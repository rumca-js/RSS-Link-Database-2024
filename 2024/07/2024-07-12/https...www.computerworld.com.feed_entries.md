<p>Open AI, the company behind the popular AI ​​chatbot Chat GPT, has now developed an evaluation scale to assess how closely AI models can approach human levels of intelligence, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-11/openai-sets-levels-to-track-progress-toward-superintelligent-ai" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg report</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about them, then work through the options and activities involved, along with a strategy for approaching such repair. Throughout, there’s special emphasis on Startup Repair and Boot Recovery tools, facilities and commands available in Windows 10 and 11.</p>
