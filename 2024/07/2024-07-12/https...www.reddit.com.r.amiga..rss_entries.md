<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After much perseverance I have got WinUAE setup (no easy feat for me) all to Play my all time favourite game Player Manager. The problem I have is saving data. The game requests me to ‚Äúinsert a formatted disk in drive A‚Äù I have downloaded ‚ÄòBlank-Empty.adf‚Äô thinking I could use DF1 and the emulator would look there, but no joy. </p> <p>(Back in the day with a real machine I obviously had the game disk in the machine, ejected, inserted save disk, and I guess put the game back in) but that was 30 years ago!</p> <p>Please could someone point me in the right direction. I have got so frustrated with this, and I bet it‚Äôs something so simple I can‚Äôt see. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EnglishMan__"> /u/EnglishMan__ </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1e1tlyy/help_needed_with_blank_save_disk/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1e
