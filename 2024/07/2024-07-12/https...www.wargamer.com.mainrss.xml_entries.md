								<p>When Dungeons and Dragons players discuss <strong>DnD builds</strong>, they’re talking about the rules (and math) that make their characters tick. This guide breaks down how the <strong>best DnD builds</strong> work, with advice on how and why to play them.</p>
<p>We’ll cover what <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/races">DnD races</a> pair best with the <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/classes">DnD classes</a>. You’ll also find advice on rolling up your stats and choosing <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/5e-feats">DnD feats</a>. Some builds in this guide are optimized to take full advantage of Dungeons and Dragons’ rules, while others offer a less explosive but still consistent kind of fun.</p>
