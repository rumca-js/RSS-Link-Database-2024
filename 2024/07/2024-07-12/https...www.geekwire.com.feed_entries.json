While the four-day summit highlights positive themes such as innovating solutions, having impact, and building community, many of the presentations on Thursday wrestled with what some dubbed &#8220;the specter&#8221; of a second Trump administration and his pledges to undo Biden administration policies that have energized the U.S. climate response. &#8220;The climate stakes of this election could not be higher,&#8221; said Sally Jewell, former CEO of REI and former secretary of&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/election-impact-on-climate-efforts-is-top-of-mind-at-first-ever-bloomberg-green-festiva", "id": 855387, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/election-impact-on-climate-efforts-is-top-of-mind-at-first-ever-bloomberg-green-festival-in-seattle", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Election impact on climate efforts is top of mind at first-ever Bloomberg Green Festival in Seattle", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-12T14:55:49+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"1013\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PXL_20240711_180827280.MP_-1260x1013.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Jim Coulter, founding partner, executive chair and director for the investment firm TPG, thinks a little more optimism is warranted in the climate tech sphere.
