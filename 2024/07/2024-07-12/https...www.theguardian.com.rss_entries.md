 Like her first novel, the 2016 Betty Trask award-winning Butterfly Fish, this is made up of two storylines in very different settings. Zulima narrates the first strand, set in 17th-century Cape Verde, where she appears as a mysterious stranger in the village of Gethsemane. She proves to be a hard worker, with a talent for healing, but her behaviour draws suspicion, and she is soon in trouble. The other narrative takes place in present-day London, where Therese, a scientist who is also an alternative healer, encounters three men, lonely strangers to the city, in whom she senses “the mark of kin”. She invites them to join her in a magical project. T

<p>After UK justice minister praised the system in the Netherlands, experts there say the reality is more complex</p><p>Earlier this year, before he became the UK justice minister, James Timpson described how Britain should follow the Dutch example of mild sentencing to help solve the prisons crisis.</p><p>“They have shut half their prisons not because people are less naughty in Holland,” he told Channel 4. “It’s because they have a different way of sentencing, which is community sentencing so people can stay at home, keep their jobs, keep their homes, keep reading their children bedtime stories, and it means they are far less likely to commit crime again. A custodial sentence is not always the right thing.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/12/could-britain-solve-prisons-crisis-going-dutch">Continue reading...</a>

These experimental influences were facilitated by producer Andrew Broder, after the pair met at Bon Iver’s Eaux Claires music festival, and Rainey now enlists another Iver collaborator in drummer and producer S Carey, plus indigenous singer Dylan Bizhikiins Jennings.

<p>A celebration of the gifts and talents of autistic people refutes the idea that autism and empathy cannot coexist </p><p>In The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, Oliver Sacks wrote about two autistic men, twins who had an extraordinary relationship with numbers. Sacks recalled that during one of his sessions a matchbox fell from a table, disgorging its contents, and the twins cried out “111”, the exact number of matches that lay on the floor. They later explained that they had not counted the matches, but could “see” how many there were. “The twins live exclusively in a thought-world of numbers,” Sacks concluded. “They have no interest in the stars shining, or&nbsp;the hearts of men.”</p><p>Daniel Tammet only mentions Sacks once in his new book, Nine Minds, but the writings of the British neurologist haunt these portraits of autistic people. Like those twins, Tammet is on the autistic spectrum, can perform absurdly complex calculations in his head, and is able to live in a “thoug

Tactile and breezy, Charm makes good on the Laurel Canyon influences touted for Cottrill’s previous record, but where 2021’s Immunity was careful and contained, these new songs make a bid for freedom. Opener Nomad, with its wandering slide guitar, sets the scene for an album about desire and distance. “I’d run the risk of losing everything / sell all my things,” she bargains, voice soft, mulling over what it would take to cross paths again with a certain person.</p><p>Recorded to tape with co-producer Leon Michels (of the soul group El Michels Affair), Charm embodies retro warmth without cliche.

<p>A new documentary reveals a powerful vulnerability which adds human depth to this once-in-a-century sportsman</p><p>You may expect the new Daley Thompson documentary to focus on his two Olympic golds in 1980 and 1984, world records and heroic performances under immense pressure. Those do feature, but the deeper takeaways are about father-son relationships, turning points in our lives and the transformative impact of key figures who shape us.</p><p>Airing on Tuesday on BBC Two, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/mediacentre/proginfo/2024/29/daley-olympic-superstar">Daley: Olympic Superstar</a> includes previously unshared insights from Thompson about his life and, poignantly, his tough childhood. We see Thompson look back on finding out that his father, whom he hardly knew, had been shot. He reflects on the fact that his mother never came to see him race with a puzzlement moulded through hindsight and his own experiences of fatherhood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/articl

Leonora Carrington claimed never to have read it. She was only seven when it appeared, growing up far from the Left Bank in a gothic English mansion where Nanny filled her head with fairytales. Yet when Carrington died in Mexico City in 2011 at the age of 94, she was one of the last living participants in the original surrealist movement. This exhibition in a rambling rural gallery is an ecstatic reminder of all that is liberating in surrealist art.</p><p>It’s also an encounter with a woman now getting her due as one of modern art’s greats.
