<p>England manager knows his critics still demand a trophy, but feels comfortable with how he’s dealt with the pressure</p><p>“I am fortunate that I am the type of guy who you have to prod a lot to get a bark,” Gareth Southgate says on a humid, wet afternoon in Blankenhain. As thoughtful, measured and interesting as ever, England’s manager explains that his calmness is inherited from his father. “He always managed his emotions really well,” Southgate says. “He also had a coach’s mentality – he was always looking after other people. I think we all grow up looking at those figures in our lives.”</p><p>For much of the past eight years it has felt as if a fractured country has looked to one mild-mannered middle-aged man for guidance on how to be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/12/i-can-handle-whatever-comes-southgate-keeps-his-cool-before-euro-2024-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The striker has at times been reduced to a meme, or worse, but teammates and staff adore their captain</p><p>The worst tackle Álvaro Morata has suffered at the Euros came from his own team. At the end of the semi-final as Spain celebrated, a fan leapt on to the pitch in search of a selfie. When he set off, so did José Santos, the security guard who travels everywhere with them. Slipping, he accidentally went in two-footed, a big man with a beard and bulging biceps crashing into the striker; Morata’s knee twisted inwards, leaving him limping. An ice pack was applied and for a moment there was a fear that he could even miss Sunday’s final. Especially for Santos.</p><p>It is his job to look after Spain’s players; now, the Spain captain looked after him. “It’s only a yellow card,” Morata said as he boarded the bus, smiling but still not moving well.

You don’t have to be on nodding terms with, let alone a fan of, the beautiful game to see that Sunday’s final of the European Championships – and the fact that England are in it – has a significance that goes beyond sport.

<p>(Island)<br />The Californian’s influences are all too clear, but her deft magpie approach proves surprisingly invigorating on album No 2</p><p>Over the course of her relatively short career, US pop musician <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/07/remi-wolf-music-interview-juno">Remi Wolf</a> has become known for a hypersaturated, genreless take on indie-pop that draws in influences from classic rock to squelchy indie-funk to sun-dappled nu-disco. The 28-year-old Californian has been lumped in with a wave of genre-agnostic gen Z musicians such as Spill Tab and bbno$, but to her credit, Wolf is something of a progenitor of the sound, and her take on it is fleshed-out and vivid. Her new album, <em>Big Ideas</em>, is filled with small details, such as the cowbell that stumbles through Toro, or the Nirvana-goes-to-Coachella vocal effect on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvr59qXJCj8">Alone in Miami</a>, that suggest her music is hardly an effort of pop-by-commit

<p>With their sweet-shop-hued flowers pointing skyward, these tenacious biennials are guaranteed to make you smile</p><p>One hot summer evening in 2020, my husband and I walked around our new neighbourhood. We had spent the day moving our belongings into our first home and, as I got to know the streets that I would eventually cycle down and push a buggy around, I pocketed the little husks of seed heads from hollyhocks that bowed over the pavements.</p><p>This time of year – proper, full-blooded summer – always makes me think of hollyhocks. There’s something puppyish in their appeal: undeniably pleasant, reaching several feet into blue skies, a spear of floral trumpets in sweet-shop hues. Around these parts (the Brixton/Camberwell borders in south London) they decorate as many tree wells and forgotten scraps of land as they do front gardens. Each summer I photograph the most unlikely ones: last year a clutch sprung up around an&nbsp;industrial-scale wheelie bin.</p> <a href="https://ww

<p>Wearing a hat, avoiding white and dialling down the sexiness are no longer mandatory. Instead take inspiration from the bridal couple’s style cues</p><p>A whole bunch of the traditional rules about what a wedding guest should or should not wear are now obsolete. Take hats. Time was when hats were such a nailed-on part of weddings that “buying a hat” was another way of saying you were invited to one. These days, while a wedding gives you licence to wear a hat if the fancy takes you, unless the ceremony is taking place in a cathedral, it certainly doesn’t raise eyebrows to go without – if anything, a hat wearer will look like a daring outlier.</p><p>Other rules have loosened, too. To turn up in white would once have been considered not much short of a declaration of war on the bride; now, an all-white dress code is sometimes requested by the happy couple.

<p>A couple edge toward a split in the writer-director’s shoddy Amazon Prime offering, carelessly made and dull to watch</p><p>When you see a title like Divorce in the Black appear underneath a Tyler Perry byline, you assume this is more not-so-clever wordplay that clumsily states the obvious: a woman takes her no-good ex to the cleaners before riding off into the sunset. But this new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/amazon-prime-video">Amazon Prime</a> feature doesn’t just fail to live up to that billing. It’s easily his worst film to date.</p><p>Perry – who, as ever, hordes credit for producing, writing and directing this 132-minute film – sets up the disappointment early, opening at the funeral of a young man for a heavy dose of exposition. Who the man is doesn’t matter as much as him dying while attempting to rob a parishioner who just so happened to be packing heat. In between the deceased being consigned to an afterlife in hell and his ne’er-do-well family dragging the

<p>The post-Nato press conference was an opportunity for the world to see Biden unscripted, but there was no coming back from the Zelenskiy/Putin slip up</p><p>Should I stay or should I go? If I stay there will be trouble … This wasn’t so much a press conference, more a job interview conducted in front of an audience of millions. One where almost everyone had already made up their mind that they would rather almost anyone else got the nod.</p><p>This was politics as a bloodsport. Painful to watch. Like intruding on a personal grief. Because there could be no winner here. Were Joe Biden to be word perfect and razor sharp, the doubts would remain about his cognitive abilities. The US president cannot erase his recent past. The gaffes come with ever increasing frequency. The obvious confusion. The long silences. The middle-distance stares.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/12/you-could-sense-the-embarrassment-as-biden-spoke-a-sign-of-how-low-the-presidenc
