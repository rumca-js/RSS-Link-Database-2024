Josuttis - ACCU 2024\n---\n\nFiltering the elements of a collection is one of the most important applications of dealing with ranges and views.\n\nUnfortunately, the filter view (available since C++20) is one of the most suprising C++ standard views.\nEven with simple use cases you can easily have:\n- Unexpected functional behavior\n- Suprising compile-time errors with cryptic error messages\n- Fatal runtime errors (without even noticing them)\n\nThere are (more or less) good reasons for the design of the filter view. However, for a successful filtering of elements knowing all these pitfalls is key.\n\nListen and learn things you would not expect but have to know when using the filter views and views in general.\nThe talk will demonstrate all the issues with simple real-work examples and also explain the (more or less wise) motivation for the design.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/", "id": 853789, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jR3WE-hAhCc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "source_obj__id": 421, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/jR3WE-hAhCc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Understanding the Filter View to Use It Right - Nicolai M.
