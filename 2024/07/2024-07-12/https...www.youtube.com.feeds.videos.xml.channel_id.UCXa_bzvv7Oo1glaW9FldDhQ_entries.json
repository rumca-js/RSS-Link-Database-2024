Before Deathloop and Prey, they plied their trade with Dishonored. Now, ostensibly a stealth-orientated action-adventure series, Dishonored and it\u2019s 2016 sequel are remembered for more than just their gameplay. \n\nDishonored 2 has numerous strengths which, as this feature goes on to explain, don\u2019t necessarily help it stand out from the pack when assessed individually. Instead, it\u2019s the sum of its parts which make this a special, memorable sequel. Fantastic world building, superb superpowers, multi-faceted branching narrative, and endless replayability elevate Dishonored 2 to a game which stands as a relic; something distinct which hasn\u2019t been totally replicated since. \n\nShould Arkane return to one of their legacy franchises, then it must be Dishonored. It\u2019s 2016 sequel is fantastic, and a type of game which seems to have gone by the wayside.", "id": 854745, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9WAP_5RYug", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/v9WAP_5RYug/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "It's A Shame We Don't Get Games Like This Anymore...", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-12T10:00:00+00:00", "description": "Games are getting more accessible than ever before with difficulty sliders, better environmental storytelling, and plenty of other options.

These 15 games are perfect gateway games that ease newcomers into the medium and provide compelling entertainment that make them want to continue forward with the hobby. \n\nGames like Super Mario Odyssey and The Last of Us attract newcomers due to their excellent marketing. Others like Undertale lack marketing, relying purely on word of mouth. One thing all these titles have in common is their ability to ease the player into short bursts of satisfying sessions without bogging them down in complex details. \n\nYet, as you\u2019ll see, these games feature plenty of depth that entice players to dig in deeper and seek more hardcore experiences.", "id": 852794, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZKyaMzUpwo", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/0ZKyaMzUpwo/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "15 Amazing Games That TURNED NON-GAMERS INTO GAMERS", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
