She's a software engineer has worked in the field for more than a decade. Interestingly, she studied photography in school and never took a programming class.\n\nWe talk about:\n\n- How she and her sister ran a dial-in Bulletin Board System (BBS) back in the pre-web days\n\n- How her first year as a dev she \"was just living in abject fear of losing my job.\"\n\n- How she stayed at her first developer agency job for 7 years, and went from imposter syndrome afflicted newbie to getting promoted\n\n- Her philosophy on creating programming tutorials: \"You don't have to be on the cutting edge. I don't operate on the cutting edge.\"\n\nCan you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1993 rock song.\n\nAlso, I want to thank the 9,779 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.
