Why?\n\n\n\"The Phantom of Heilbronn, often alternatively referred to as the \"Woman Without a Face\", was a hypothesized unknown female serial killer whose existence was inferred from DNA evidence found at numerous crime scenes in Austria, France and Germany from 1993 to 2009. The six murders among these included that of police officer Mich\u00e8le Kiesewetter, in Heilbronn, Germany, on 25 April 2007.\nThe only connection between the crimes was the presence of DNA from a single female, which had been recovered from 40 crime scenes, ranging from murders to burglaries. In late March 2009, investigators concluded that there was no \"phantom criminal\", and the DNA had already been present on the cotton swabs used for collecting DNA samples; it belonged to a woman who worked at the factory where they were made.\"\n\nMore on Wikipedia: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_of", "id": 856481, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nXAevDZuxI", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg", "source_obj__id": 447, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/1nXAevDZuxI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Suspected Female Serial Killer Caught But Not Punished | Tales From the Bottle", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
