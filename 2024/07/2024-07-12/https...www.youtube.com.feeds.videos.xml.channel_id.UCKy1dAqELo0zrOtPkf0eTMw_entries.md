Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail reviewed by Michael Higham on PC, also available on PlayStation and Xbox.

Dawntrail has some growing pains and notable lulls as it establishes a new era for Final Fantasy XIV, but the compelling cultures of Tural are strong enough to carry you to its greater moments – it’s also nice to see real-world influences near and dear to me represented so well. Once the main story flips the switch and shows you what it’s really about, it hits the kinds of peaks we’ve seen from the MMO time and time again. Dawntrail had me stunned by spectacular combat encounters, but more importantly left me floored with a unique sense of self-reflection. It doesn’t forget that this is a Final Fantasy story, and the way it ties in its past, present, and future makes for incredible moments that continue to define the series. Dawntrail is a worthy extension of FFXIV, and it leaves a world of fascinating possibilities for what’s next.

You saw the Captain America: Brave New World trailer, and are probably wondering who actor Giancarlo Esposito is portraying in the film. The Breaking Bad and Mandalorian star was a late addition to the Marvel movie, being cast during reshoots. Brave New World was delayed, which isn’t uncommon these days, but apparently underwent more reshoots and rewrites than most Marvel movies. Neither Esposito nor Marvel Studios have revealed his role in the film, but the Internet has speculated that he might be portraying the SHIELD agent G.W. Bridge. G.W. Bridge made his appearance in X-Force Issue 1, back in 1991. He was originally part of the Six Pack, which was led by Cable - so he has some mutant ties in the comics.

In today's Daily Fix:
The Nintendo Switch has broken records left and right since its launch in 2017, and it's continuing to do so. The hybrid console now has the title of 'longest-running console without a replacement' in Nintendo's history, going for 2,688 days and counting. The NES had a run of 2,686 days but the Super Nintendo was launched in the 90's to overtake it. A successor has not yet been announced, so the Switch will be adding to its record until then. In other news, the original 2D Fallout 3 is now playable thanks to a mod for Fallout 2. The 2D Fallout 3 was never released as development was switched to a 3D perspective. And finally, Analogue has launched another version of its popular Analogue Pocket, this time in all aluminum and sporting a hefty price tag.
