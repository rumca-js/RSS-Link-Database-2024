MSI had its internal warranty (RMA) server publicly exposed, where hundreds of thousands of warranty records were available to anybody. There was no hack required, no account access required, and it was all in plain text. We held publication until MSI closed the server off from public access. This follows a similar story we ran on Zotac last week.
