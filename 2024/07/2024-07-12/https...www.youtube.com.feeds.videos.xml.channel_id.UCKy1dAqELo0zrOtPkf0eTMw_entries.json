Once the main story flips the switch and shows you what it\u2019s really about, it hits the kinds of peaks we\u2019ve seen from the MMO time and time again. Dawntrail had me stunned by spectacular combat encounters, but more importantly left me floored with a unique sense of self-reflection. It doesn\u2019t forget that this is a Final Fantasy story, and the way it ties in its past, present, and future makes for incredible moments that continue to define the series. Dawntrail is a worthy extension of FFXIV, and it leaves a world of fascinating possibilities for what\u2019s next.\n\n#IGN #Gaming", "id": 857160, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEpb6xXYD_4", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/sEpb6xXYD_4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-12T22:17:58+00:00", "description": "", "id": 856935, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL0NdN-YFGU", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 26, "page_rating_contents": 82, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/xL0NdN-YFGU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "We watched Deadpool & Wolverine early (the first 35 min)", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-12T21:56:35+00:00", "description": "You saw the Captain America: Brave New World trailer, and are probably wondering who actor Giancarlo Esposito is portraying in the film. The Breaking Bad and Mandalorian star was a late addition to the Marvel movie, being cast during reshoots. Brave New World was delayed, which isn\u2019t uncommon these days, but apparently underwent more reshoots and rewrites than most Marvel movies. Neither Esposito nor Marvel Studios have revealed his role in the film, but the Internet has speculated that he might be portraying the SHIELD agent G.W. Bridge. G.W. Bridge made his appearance in X-Force Issue 1, back in 1991. He was originally part of the Six Pack, which was led by Cable - so he has some mutant ties in the comics.\n\n#IGN #MCU #Marvel", "id": 856936, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADWx0oUZT3I", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ADWx0oUZT3I/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Who Is Giancarlo Esposito in Captain America: Brave New World? - IGN The Fix: Entertainment", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-12T21:51:53+00:00", "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nThe Nintendo Switch has broken records left and right since its launch in 2017, and it's continuing to do so.
