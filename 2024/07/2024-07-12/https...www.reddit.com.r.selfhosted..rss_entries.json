I'm working on eliminating google from my life and google home is next, I wanted to install Home assistant but I'm confused between all the options for installing. I have a raspberry pi 4 running dietpi for my network stuff (Pi hole, Unbound and Wireguard) and a diy nas running Unraid as a media server and I'm trying to decide which is the right place to install it and which version of the installation (from the unraid template, dietpi software, vm, docker compose or what) is best. </p> <p>My use case is just controlling two fans and 5 lights but plan to have more things in the future. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EmizelXDoe\"> /u/EmizelXDoe </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1e1lzob/question_about_home_assistant/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1e1lzob/question_about_home_assistant/\">[", "id": 855249, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1e1lzob/question_about_home_assistant", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Question about Home Assistant", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-12T15:46:42+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys, after researching, i see that if using plex, emby, jellyfin,...

Here's how it works: you can store all your Docker compose and config files for your stacks in a git repo.

A plain Kanban board would be perfect for us. However, one challenge we face is that a project sometimes consists of several GitLab repositories (app, library, backend, etc.). In my dream scenario, I would create a card for a task, with subtasks that I would assign to issues and merge requests in the respective GitLab repositories. Ideally, there would be some kind of synchronization between software and Gitlab. For example, if I close GitLab issues, the associated subtask in the Kanban board would also be marked as completed. Does anyone know of a suitable option? I have already found some self-hostable project management software, such as Taiga, OpenProject, WeKan, but it seems that these alternatives mostly only allow linking to one Gitlab repository per project.
