#MarvelRivals #MarvelGames #Marvel 

Native to the planet Klyntar but once bonded to a certain infuriating web-head, the alien symbiote found his pair in the disgruntled Eddie Brock, together becoming the hulking Venom. After years as a hungering force of evil, these halves have found their way to becoming a one-of-a-kind lethal protector, evolving beyond their kin yet never surrendering their unmatched ferocity.

Lost in the Timestream Entanglement, Venom remains unable to recollect their past, thrust into worlds unknown as they function on instinct to recuperate. However, darkness stirs in the far reaches of the Multiverse as something ancient wriggles its tendrils into divine minds across all of time and space. Now, it's up to Venom to recover their memory and take the battle to the edge of space, whether dressed in black or blue!
