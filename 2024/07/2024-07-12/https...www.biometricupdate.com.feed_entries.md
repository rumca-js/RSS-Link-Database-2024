		The European Union has issued a new call for funding within the Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL), allocating over 108 million euros to projects designed to increase the continent's tech capacities – including digital identity.

Among the targets that will receive funding are Digital Decade Multi-Country Projects which cover the digitalization of public services. This includes the deployment of the European Union Digital Identity (EUDI) wallet in cross-border use cases and implementing the eIDAS Regulation which mandates that EU member states provide an interoperable electronic identification (eID).

The European Commission plans to allocate 25 million euros for Multi-Country Projects (MCPs) within DIGITAL, while the deadline for the calls is November 21st, 2024. The

		Because of Washington partisan politics, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) doesn’t expect to be able to field upgraded and new biometric airport screening technologies until well into the 2040s, if not longer.

This includes the first upgrade of passenger checkpoint x-ray technology to Computed Tomography (CT), and checkpoint Credential Authentication Technology (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/credential-authentication-technology-cat">CAT</a>).

Why will these crucial screening technologies take so long to deploy? Well, it’s not because TSA doesn’t have “the vendors and processes in place to complete them in this decade,” TSA Administrator David Pekoske told the House Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Securi

		Florida’s mobile driver’s license has been shut down, making the state a rare case in the world of a place where the number of people with digital ID has actually decreased.

Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles is pulling the Florida Smart ID from both iOS and Android app stores, and asking those with the app on their phone to delete it. The Department told <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/10/florida-abruptly-ends-support-for-digital-drivers-licenses-on-iphone/">9to5Mac</a> that it expects the new app to be ready by “early 2025,” and promised unspecified improvements to the application. The FDHSM says it will be “updated and improved by a new vendor.”

Florida’s mDL app was made by Thales, but how the digital ID would be accepted by state residents was

		The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is celebrating the centennial of its fingerprint lab. A release from the agency says the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services (<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis">CJIS</a>) Division marked the 100th anniversary of the FBI’s national repository for fingerprints and related criminal history data, now called the Biometric Services Section, at a ceremony in Clarksburg, West Virginia.

The first identity division at the FBI was established in 1924. For years, the unit commonly known as “Ident” performed manual fingerprinting operations, including recovery and matching. Technology has changed the process utterly. The CJIS Division says its Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification system and Next Generation Identification (NGI) sy

		A Swiss government commission has <a href="https://www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-rk-s-2024-06-28.aspx?lang=1036">adopted</a> the draft federal law on digital identity, as  Switzerland’s upcoming digital identification system, slated to appear in 2026.

The Legal Affairs Committee of the Council of States examined the draft law on electronic identity at the end of June and adopted it by nine votes to one. It also issued several recommendations, including that the comparison, or verification, of the person's face against a photograph can be carried out automatically when a digital ID is created in person.

Another recommendation says that the source code of the trust infrastructure software can not be published if this endangers data security or risks infri

		As part of the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) Safeguards Initiative fronted by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), stakeholders from different communities recently took part in a discussion during which they shared their thoughts on how countries can put in place safe and inclusive DPI.

During a recent UN Civil Society Summit held in Nairobi, Kenya, participants emphasized the importance of a participatory approach to the design and implementation of DPI ecosystems, as the UNDP pushes ahead with consultations on developing a universal DPI safeguards framework.

		The Thai government is putting the finishing touches on its digital wallet cash handout scheme, which aims to distribute 10,000 baht (US$276) to approximately 50 million citizens. On Thursday, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said that the details of the policy will be shared on July 24th.

The government stimulus package is designed to spur Thailand’s sluggish economic growth by stimulating underdeveloped provinces and regions. The cash handout project, however, has also attracted controversy, with criticism coming from the Bank of Thailand, former central bank governors and certain economists.

Cash benefits were expected to roll out in the fourth quarter but the government has been struggling to organize funding sources, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/mark
