Laura Jane Grace had to cram more than two decades of music \u2014 both solo material and from her influential punk band Against Me! \u2014 into 15 minutes. Her band was used to this gleeful chaos. Grace's wife, Paris Campbell Grace, Drive-By Truckers' Matt Patton and The Ergs' Mikey Erg make up the Mississippi Medicals, a loving and stabilizing force for a catalog of songs about American injustice, creative frustration, identity and broken promises\u2026 but also hope through collective action and personal revelation. In this Tiny Desk, you'll see them play newer songs (\"I'm Not a Cop\" and \"All F***** Out\"), but also throwbacks to \u201cPints of Guinness Make You Strong\u201d (a personal request) and an absolutely powerful version of \"Black Me Out.\"\n\nAn Against Me! show changed my life. Before Grace's set, I shared a story about a sweet, sheltered suburban kid who spent his freshman year at shows instead of studying for class.
