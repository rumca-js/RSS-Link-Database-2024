Our list of 15 best PS5 headsets goes through a wide spectrum of price points and styles. Every headset featured in this list is compatible with the PS5, either through wired 3.5mm jack functionality or through wireless Bluetooth. 

On the lower end of the list are headsets that have cheaper materials such as bendable plastic and flimsy mics. Though, many of these provide exceptional quality in other ways such as 360-degree audio or supreme comfort. 

Toward the middle of the pack lie headsets that provide brilliant all-around performance but miss on a couple small points. The best of the best make great use of the PS5â€™s exclusive Tempest 3D audio tech and also give our ears the comfort they deserve. 

All of the sets here come highly recommended, though as always, head sizes are subjective and manufacturing batches can be hit or miss concerning durability.

However, there are also Modules to enhance with resources and keeping things like mod capacity in mind. Then there's the Mastery Rank system, different ammo types, or how to get your character to stop chattering in battle.

Here are ten tips and tricks you should know when playing The First Descendant and how to make the most of the experience.
