We test Noctua's new NH-D15 G2 for thermals (Intel & AMD temperature testing), acoustics, frequency response, flatness, pressure, and more. The benchmarks also cover Noctua's three alternatives for the Noctua NH-D15 G2, including the base model and HBC vs. LBC differences (High Base Convexity & Low Base Convexity). Because Noctua includes washers for a washer mod on the Intel ILM, we also ran benchmarks for that, plus tests of the old vs. new fans. The NH-D15 G2 is Noctua's first major dual-tower release since 2014, and now it faces competition from the Thermalright Peerless Assassin, ID Cooling A720, Arctic Liquid Freezer III, and other cheaper coolers.\n\nThis is EXPENSIVE testing.
