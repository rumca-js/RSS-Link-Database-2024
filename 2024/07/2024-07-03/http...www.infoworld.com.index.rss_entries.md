<p>Developed by Facebook and released as an open standard for all to use, <a href="https://graphql.org/" rel="nofollow">GraphQL</a> is intended as an alternative to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3706031/what-is-rest-the-de-facto-web-architecture-standard.html">REST APIs</a>. Like REST, GraphQL provides a way to create and consume web-based APIs, but queries and returned data use formal schemas and a type system to guarantee consistency.</p><p>In this article, we’ll walk through the basics of designing and implementing a GraphQL API and discuss many of the key considerations and decisions you’ll make during the process.</p><h2 class="toc">GraphQL languages and frameworks</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3441178/what-is-javascript-the-full-stack-programming-language.html">JavaScript</a> language is one of the wonders of the software world. It is incredibly powerful, flexible, and versatile. One limitation of its fundamental design, however, is its single-threaded nature. Traditional JavaScript appears to handle parallel tasks, but that is a trick of syntax. To achieve true parallelism, you need to use modern multithreading approaches like web workers and worker threads.</p><h2 class="toc">Parallelism vs. concurrency</h2>
<p>The most basic way to understand the difference between parallelism and concurrency is that concurrency is semantic whereas parallelism is implementation. What I mean is that concurrency lets you <em>tell the system</em> (semantics) to do more than one thing at once. Parallelism simply performs multiple tasks simultaneously (implementation). All parallel processing is concurrent, bu
