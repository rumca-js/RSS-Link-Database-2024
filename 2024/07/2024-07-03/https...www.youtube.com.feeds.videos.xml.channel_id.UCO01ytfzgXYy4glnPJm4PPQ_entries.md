Today on the Matt Walsh, guest hosted by me, David Cone, we’ve got an Independence Day special for you. We’ll examine many of the most crucial ways America has strayed from the path our Founders established. There was a UFO sighting in Colorado…and y’all keep wondering where Matt went. I will be reading the best roast comments from the Sweet Baby Gang. Also, the Olympics are canceled.
