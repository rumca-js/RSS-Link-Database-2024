It was a sudoku solver using a na\u00efve backtracking algorithm and a smart backtracking algorithm with MRV heuristics. But there's an algorithm that's supposed to be the best for solving sudoku, Donald Knuth's Dancing Links implementation of Algorithm X. So today, I'm gonna code it!\n\nA portion of this video is sponsored by BenQ.\n\nGiveaway Details\n- Sign up to my developer newsletter, Dev Notes at https://devnotesdaily.com\n- Comment with: how many monitors you have, what operating system you\u2019re running, and your favorite feature of the BenQ Programming Monitors.\n\n#coding #computerscience #softwareengineer #RD240Q, #RD280UA, #BestMonitorForProgramming, #CodingMode\n\nIf you're a developer, sign up to my free newsletter Dev Notes \ud83d\udc49 https://www.devnotesdaily.com", "id": 811684, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg16BOslJGk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2WHjPDvbE6O328n17ZGcfg", "source_obj__id": 118, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/Wg16BOslJGk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "I Remade My First AI Program 7 Years Later\u2026 with a New Algorithm\u2026 in only 12 hours", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
