Sane Trilogy is reportedly set to hit the subscription service this August, with more Activision games coming "very soon".

While developer Ao Norte doesn't specify further, it is immediately apparent Tiny Garden's quaint toy-aesthetic has been inspired by Polly Pocket, with its clam shell opening, dolls house-like levels and - of course - its tiny garden.</p><p>Other video game inspirations, meanwhile, include the likes of Unpacking and Summerhouse.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tiny-garden-looks-like-an-adorable-polly-pocket-full-of-sunshine-for-pc-and-switch">Read more</a></p>

<em>Hello! Eurogamer is once again marking Pride with another week of features celebrating the intersection of LGBTQIA+ culture and gaming in all its guises. Today, Florence Smith Nicholls explores experimental escape room Memoirscape and its tale of queer love in the 80s.</em>
</p><p>"This room is very gender."</p><p>We're in a teen bedroom - the exact location and date is a little hazy, but it's somewhere in Queens, New York City, in 1986. All the hallmarks of adolescence are here, posters on the walls, a brightly covered duvet, knick-knacks. The space is bathed in warm light. I sit down on the bed and pick up a romance novel left nearby. It's comfortable, one might even say cosy,  but we're not alone. Another group is huddled around a cassette player, listening to a recording of a private conversation between two you

## Elden Ring's new Thrusting Shields make Shadow of the Erdtree difficulty trivial, players say

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree introduced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-thrusting-shield-locations">Thrusting Shields</a> as a new weapon type, but some players believe they're overpowered to the point of being "absolutely busted".
</p><p>
You may have spotted in the DLC's gameplay trailer the player character leaping through the air with a spiked shield. This is one of many new weapon types, with two shields to choose from: the Dueling Shield and Carian Thrusting Shield.
</p><p>
Both shields have the Shield Strike skill that uses the shield to attack. And if attacking and blocking at the same time seems overpowered, well it is.

## The Unpacking team on why there won't be a sequel, life-changing success, and new game Tempopo

It was gearing up to launch its second game - a game about unpacking boxes and finding a space for your things. Unpacking, it was called. And the hope was it would build on the success of the studio's first game, Assault Android Cactus, an energetic twin-stick shooter which did relatively well. But there was trepidation, because how many people would want a chilled-out game about placing objects? How many people would understand what it was trying to do?</p><p>Witch Beam needn't have worried. In just a year, Unpacking raced to a million sales - far, far beyond anything Assault Android Cactus had done. It rocketed the studio to fame. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is">Eurogamer awarded Unpacking Game of the Year in 2021</a>,

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will let you escape death entirely as part of its extensive difficulty customisation options, which will also let you manually adjust player and enemy health.
</p><p>
As detailed to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/01/a-look-at-dragon-age-the-veilguards-difficulty-options-and-gameplay">Game Informer</a>, BioWare has included a range of set difficulty levels and a further option that offers more granular customisation of your play experience. 
</p><p>
The Veilguard's base levels are named Storyteller, Adventurer and Nightmare - the latter of which is a permanent choice, while the former options can be flitted between. There's also a further option, Unbound, which offers difficulty editing on the fly.
