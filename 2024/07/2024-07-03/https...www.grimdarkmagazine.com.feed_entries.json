Set in her Gael Song world, it is a powerful piece of short fiction and will be hugely enjoyed by fans of her writing. Chronologically, Dreams of Sorrows takes place before the events of the Gael Song novels, but it should not be a new reader\u2019s first venture into this world. If you have not yet read Lawless\u2019 books, The Children of Gods and Fighting Men and The Words of Kings and Prophets, you must do so before reading this novella, or you risk spoiling certain key plot elements for yourself. Set in medieval Ireland, Dreams of Sorrow is the short but heart breaking tale of Senna. Senna is fifteen, in love, and content with how her life will be. Until, out of fear, she unwittingly performs magic and discovers she is a witch &#8211; a Descendant of the mythical Tuatha d\u00e9 Danaan. Senna flees from the only home she has ever known and seeks protection and education from other Descendants \u2013 kin", "id": 812048, "language": "en-AU", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-dreams-of-sorrow-by-shauna-lawless", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 137, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "REVIEW: Dreams of Sorrow by Shauna Lawless", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
