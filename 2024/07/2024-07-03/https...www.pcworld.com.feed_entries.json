They have thirty days to review their policies and comply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the specific concerns vary by company, the FTC reminded the three companies that they can&rsquo;t, for example, place stickers on a laptop that caution consumers that opening or repairing the laptop violates warranty policies. Neither can they state or imply that their products can only be repaired via an authorized service from the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<", "id": 810770, "language": null, "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2385454/ftc-warns-three-pc-tech-companies-of-potential-warranty-violations.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.pcworld.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 246, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "FTC warns three PC tech companies of potential warranty violations", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
