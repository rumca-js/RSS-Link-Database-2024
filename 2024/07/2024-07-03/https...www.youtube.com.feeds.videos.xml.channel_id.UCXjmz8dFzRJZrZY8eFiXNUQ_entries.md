We put together a 90 minute compilation of all our videos about The Office. Hope you enjoy! 

The Office may go down as one of the best sitcoms ever put on television.  Not only was it a ratings juggernaut, critically acclaimed, and beloved by fans  across many generations, but The Office has a staying power not seen by many shows throughout history.  The Office will forever be researched and directed, but nothing quite beats firing up that season 1 disc and restarting the series from the beginning.
