This is our most in-depth CPU cooler review & benchmark yet. We test Noctua's new NH-D15 G2 for thermals (Intel & AMD temperature testing), acoustics, frequency response, flatness, pressure, and more. The benchmarks also cover Noctua's three alternatives for the Noctua NH-D15 G2, including the base model and HBC vs. LBC differences (High Base Convexity & Low Base Convexity). Because Noctua includes washers for a washer mod on the Intel ILM, we also ran benchmarks for that, plus tests of the old vs. new fans. The NH-D15 G2 is Noctua's first major dual-tower release since 2014, and now it faces competition from the Thermalright Peerless Assassin, ID Cooling A720, Arctic Liquid Freezer III, and other cheaper coolers.

This is EXPENSIVE testing. To help support our ability to continue bringing high-quality and independent reviews like these, grab something on our store! https://store.gamersnexus.net/
