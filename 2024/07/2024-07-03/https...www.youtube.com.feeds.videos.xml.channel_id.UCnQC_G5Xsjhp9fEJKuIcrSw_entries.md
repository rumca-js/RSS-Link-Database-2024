The Daily Wire has a new poll out about the Department of Health and Human Services' new regulation that requires foster parents to be pro-LGBTQ. Of course, a majority of respondents are opposed to this regulation. This is perfect timing for the release of "Sound of Hope." Josh Weigel, the director and writer of the film, joins the show to talk about his experience.
