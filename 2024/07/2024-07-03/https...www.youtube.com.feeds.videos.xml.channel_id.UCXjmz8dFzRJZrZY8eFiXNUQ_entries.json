Hope you enjoy! \n\nThe Office may go down as one of the best sitcoms ever put on television.  Not only was it a ratings juggernaut, critically acclaimed, and beloved by fans  across many generations, but The Office has a staying power not seen by many shows throughout history.  The Office will forever be researched and directed, but nothing quite beats firing up that season 1 disc and restarting the series from the beginning. \n\n#theoffice  #michaelscott  #dwightschrute  #dundermifflin \n\n00:00 - Michael Scott Changed\n10:23 - Rules Behind the Chaos\n18:51 - The Office Fixed Andy\n28:15 - The Office Spin-Off Fail\n37:00 - The Worst Episode\n46:43 - Derailed The Final Season\n54:25 - The Problem with Ryan\n01:03:02 - The Office Went Global\n01:10:59 - Why Michael Hates Toby\n01:19:12 - Will Ferrell Not Funny", "id": 811055, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkmiHXKJN-8", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXjmz8dFzRJZrZY8eFiXNUQ", "source_obj__id": 236, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/FkmiHXKJN-8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Breaking Down The Highs And Lows Of The Office | Compilation", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
