The full-back, with his blue hair and ability on the ball, was sent one way then the other and finally left in limbo as the Netherlands’ No 11 crafted the space to crash a pinpoint shot inside the near post and open the scoring in their last-16 tie with Romania.</p><p>The goal set aside some on-field nerves and the Dutch duly went on to put the Romanians to the sword. Well, eventually anyway. They crafted opening after opening and had 23 shots in total, but only six were on target, and it took until the final 10 minutes for the <em>Oranje</em> to seal the deal with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/02/donyell-malen-double-sinks-romania-to-put-netherlands-in-last-eight">brace from Donyell Malen</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.the

It’s so liberating and no one can hear.”</p><p>The same is true for standing on a motorway bridge and venting your pent-up rage and frustration into the roar of the traffic underneath. Or, at a pinch, for yelling under the noise of the shower, she says. “Women are like: ‘Oh, I can’t be seen to do this stuff.’ OK, don’t be seen. But let it out.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/03/all-the-rage-women-are-furious-and-repressing-it-can-ruin-our-lives">Continue reading...</a>
