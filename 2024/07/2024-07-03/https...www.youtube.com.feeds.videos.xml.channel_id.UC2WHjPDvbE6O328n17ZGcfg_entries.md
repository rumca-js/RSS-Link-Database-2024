7 years ago, I coded my first ever artificial intelligence program. It was a sudoku solver using a naÃ¯ve backtracking algorithm and a smart backtracking algorithm with MRV heuristics. But there's an algorithm that's supposed to be the best for solving sudoku, Donald Knuth's Dancing Links implementation of Algorithm X. So today, I'm gonna code it!
