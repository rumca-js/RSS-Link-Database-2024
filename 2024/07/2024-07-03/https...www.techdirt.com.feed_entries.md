Showing yet again that you can lead a cop to a court order but you can&#8217;t make them follow it, Matthew Petti reports for Reason that the Baltimore PD apparently barely paused its scraping of seized cell phones following a court order telling it to get its warrant particularity house in order. Less than a [&#8230;]

Perplexity is an up-and-coming AI company that has broad ambition to compete with Google in the search market by providing answers to user queries with AI as its core technology.&#160; They’ve been in the news because their news feature repurposed content published on the Forbes website in an investigative article, which severely annoyed the Forbes [&#8230;]

The House Oversight Committee is investigating NewsGuard, a private company, for supposed “censorship” for the crime of… offering its own opinions on the quality of news sites. The old marketplace of ideas seems to keep getting rejected whenever Republicans find that their ideas aren’t selling quite as well as they’d hoped. Up is down, left [&#8230;]

All facial recognition tech is flawed. Some offerings may be less flawed than others, but the underlying problems (mainly, the inability to be as accurate when identifying minorities and women) remain. In Detroit, the problems became problematic fairly quickly and dramatically. Hundreds of US law enforcement agencies utilize facial recognition tech, but the Detroit PD [&#8230;]

You probably already know the benefits of learning a language, so let&#8217;s focus on the app. Right off the bat, let&#8217;s be clear about one thing: When we say &#8220;app&#8221; we don&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re limited to using Babbel on your phone. You can use Babbel on desktop, too, and your progress is synchronized across [&#8230;]

I guess I should start this out by noting that I like Tim Wu quite a bit, and always felt like I learned something in the past when I spoke with him. He was even one of the people who reviewed and provided feedback on my big “protocols, not platforms” article months before it was [&#8230;]

Four years years ago AT&#38;T, a company that for years cheapened out on upgrading its broadband lines to fiber, effectively stopped selling DSL. While that’s understandable given the limitations of the dated copper-based tech, the problem is that thanks to concentrated telecom monopolization, many of these customers were left without any replacement options due to a [&#8230;]

When it comes to policy decisions generally, and with technology platforms specifically, all we can really ask is that a policy be coherently stated and implemented in a uniform fashion. You may dislike said policy, but at a minimum it should be legible and enforced sensibly. Take, for instance, Apple&#8217;s updated policy on allowing emulation [&#8230;]
