A new regulatory filing shows that the Amazon founder plans to sell 25 million Amazon shares worth about $5 billion. This comes after he sold 50 million shares worth around $8.5 billion earlier this year. Bezos announced in November that he was leaving his longtime hometown of Seattle, where Amazon is based, and moving to Miami. The relocation&#160;sparked questions&#160;about Washington state’s capital gains tax, passed in 2021,&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/jeff-bezos-keeps-selling-amazon-stock-after-announcing-his-move-out-of-washington-state/">Read More</a>

Amazon informed customers and employees Wednesday morning that it plans to discontinue its Astro for Business program, less than a year after launching the robot security guard for small- and medium-sized businesses. The decision will help the company focus on its home version of Astro, according to an internal email. Astro for Business robots will stop working Sept. 25, the company said in a separate email to customers, encouraging them to recycle the devices. Businesses will receive full refunds for the original cost of the device, plus a $300&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazon-discontinues-astro-for-business-robot-security-guard-to-focus-on-astro-home-robot/">Read More</a>

The proposed sale on Tuesday came as Amazon&#8217;s stock closed at $200 per share, its highest price since Amazon&#8217;s 1997 NASDAQ listing. In February, Bezos sold about $8.5 billion worth of Amazon shares in his first sale of company stock since 2021. Bezos controlled about 10.8% of the company’s outstanding stock, as of a February proxy statement. Bloomberg reported that he would still hold nearly 912 million shares, or about 8.8% of Amazon,&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/jeff-bezos-selling-5b-worth-of-amazon-shares-as-companys-stock-hits-all-time-high/">Read More</a>
