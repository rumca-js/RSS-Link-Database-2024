Nonetheless, that is the best excuse our DEI pick of a press security had in the first press briefing since last weekâ€™s failure. </p><p>KJP was asked if Biden has dementia. Here is her answer for you.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨<br /><br />"Does President Biden, at 81 years old, have Alzheimer's, any f

One prediction? How about one mitigation suggestion? No? Nothing? Thought so. </p><p>Given that Fauci has lost all credibility, considering everything he predicted or recommended during the Panny D was wrong, people should stop asking him what he thinks about things. But Progressives live in La La Land and he believes he's important. </p><p>Fauci, who has such a bad track record, to the point that itâ€™s unclear if he is painfully incompetent or a pathological liar, thinks he is qualified to con

We've gone from quoting George Orwell as the media attacked US on the Right for believing our eyes and ears to CNN's Jake Tapper using the same quote against Biden now that the media has gotten permission to and/or was forced into a position where they can't pretend anymore. It depends how cynical you feel like being as you read this.<
