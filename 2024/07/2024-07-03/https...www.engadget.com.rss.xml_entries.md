<p>Forget your phone cameras and laptop built-ins; your next webcam could be your old Game Boy Camera. The team (sort of) bringing this peripheral into the modern age is Epilogue. The company makes the GB Operator, which lets people play original Game Boy, Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color cartridges on a current PC or a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Today, Epilogue announced that it is working on an update that will make the Game Boy Camera into a webcam, but one that's a fuzzy, lo-fi, 16 kilopixel experience. The magic happens through the Playback emulator app that powers the GB Operator.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a year since Meta pushed out Threads in an attempt to take on the platform now known as X. At the time, Mark Zuckerberg said that he hoped it would turn into ‚Äúa public conversations app with 1 billion+ people on it.‚Äù</p>

<p>With a US ban of its hyper-popular drones <a href="https://apnews.com/buyline-shopping/article/dji-drone-ban-in-the-us">more likely than not</a>, DJI has been diversifying into products that won't be affected by the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2864">Countering CCP Drones Act</a>, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/djis-new-backup-battery-can-power-small-appliances-charge-your-drone-130037610.html">backup batteries</a>.

<p>The Avinox system promises a relatively light 2.52 kg (5.6 pound) weight (5.39 kg including the batteries), while offering up to 105Nm (850W) of peak torque/power and 600Wh or 800Wh battery options. It uses GaN 3x fast charging tech, so the 800Wh battery can be charged from 0 to 75 percent in 1.5 hours. A planetary gearset and polymer gears allow for a balance of size, weight an

The report, which Google releases annually, shows the company‚Äôs progress towards meeting its self-proclaimed objective of becoming carbon neutral by 2030.</p>
<p>Google released 14.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, the report states, which was 48 percent higher than in 2019, and 13 percent higher than a year before. ‚ÄúThis result is primarily due to increases in data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions,‚Äù said Google in the report. ‚ÄúAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands associated with the expected increases in our technical infrast
