<p>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said Wednesday that it has sent letters to several technology companies warning them that their warranty or repair policies might violate federal law.</p>



<p>Specifically in the PC space, the FTC sent letters to companies ASRock, Gigabyte, and Zotac, warning them that they may be in violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, the federal act that oversees consumer warranties and is administered by the FTC. They have thirty days to review their policies and comply.</p>



<p>While the specific concerns vary by company, the FTC reminded the three companies that they can&rsquo;t, for example, place stickers on a laptop that caution consumers that opening or repairing the laptop violates warranty policies. Neither can they state or imply that their products can only be repaired via an authorized service from the company.</p>
