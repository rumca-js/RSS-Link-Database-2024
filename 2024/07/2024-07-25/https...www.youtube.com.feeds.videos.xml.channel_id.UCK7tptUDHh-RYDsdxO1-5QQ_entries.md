Google’s newest office in Manhattan is actually almost a hundred years old. It was built inside of and on top of an old rail terminal. Unlike its Silicon Valley headquarters filled with ping pong tables and nap pods, the tech company’s new office is designed to reflect its new culture—one focused on flexible ways to work. 

WSJ took a tour of Google’s St. Johns Terminal in New York City to see what the new integrated workspace looks like.
