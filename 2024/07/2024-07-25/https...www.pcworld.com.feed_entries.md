<p>Whether you need to store documents and photos for safe keeping or transfer them between devices, a large portable SSD is always good to have on hand—and the Samsung T7 is a solid pick.</p>



<p>Right now, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-SSD-1TB-MU-PC1T0T/dp/B0874XN4D8">1TB version of the Samsung T7 is down to just $80</a>, which is half its original MSRP. That’s a <em>fantastic</em> deal!</p>



<p>There are many cool things about the Samsung T7 SSD, starting with how compact it is. It’s small enough to fit into any pocket, even the tiny ones on women’s jeans. It’s also shock resistant and protected against falls up to 6 feet, so accidental drops are no concern.</p>



<p>The Samsung T7 isn’t just portable but also built for speed, delivering read and write speeds up to 1,050/1,000 MB/s, respectively. You’ll spend less time moving files aro

<p>In order to train their models, AI generative text tools like ChatGPT scour the internet for text…which is also something that search engines like Google do. So, why not combine them and just give you everything? That seems to be the thinking behind SearchGPT, a new search engine from ChatGPT maker OpenAI. </p>



<p>The product was announced as a prototype <a href="https://chatgpt.com/search">on OpenAI’s website</a>, inviting users to join a wait list to access the tool. According to the company, it’s designed to “combine the strength of our AI models with information from the web to give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant resources.” The prototype tool is “temporary,” at least for the moment, but at least some of its features and functionality will be integrated into the wider ChatGPT product and its accompanying apps and APIs. </p>

<p>If you have a multi-monitor setup at home or the office, you probably miss it when you’re working on the go via laptop. But there’s a solution!

<p>A year ago you’d be lucky to find any OLED gaming monitor under a thousand bucks. But we saw tons on sale during Amazon’s Prime Day, and just a week later there’s a new low price for one of its most popular models. The Samsung Odyssey G93SC, one of the biggest OLED monitors on the market, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CDQMQQS2/ref=sw_img_1?th=1">just $901.71 on Amazon today</a>. That’s not cheap by any stretch, but considering that the gigantic, luxurious ultrawide normally retails for $1,600, this is a remarkable discount. </p>



<p>This super-duper-mega-ultrawide has a resolution of 5120×1440, essentially two QHD screens smooshed together on one curved panel. With a 240Hz refresh rate and .03ms response time it’s made for gamers first and foremost, but with HDR10+ support and an amazing picture thanks to OLED’s “perfect” contrast, it’s great

<p>Maingear just tore back the curtains on a new gaming laptop called the ML-17. Not only is this one decked out with ridiculously powerful hardware, it also comes with much-awaited Thunderbolt 5 support. It’s so hot, I’m surprised it doesn’t breathe fire.</p>



<p>If you’re part of gaming PC circles, you’ve likely heard of Maingear, the company that’s known for designing and building high-performance custom PCs.</p>



<p>Well, Maingear’s latest laptop offering—though powerful and will no doubt deliver blazing fast performance—doesn’t actually stray far from the previous <a href="https://maingear.com/ml-16/">ML-16 laptop</a>‘s blueprint in terms of aesthetics. The one discernible difference? The ML-17’s screen is a little bigger.</p>

<p>Keeping your online activities and data private is a top priority nowadays. VPNs, or virtual private networks, are one of the best ways to do this. Not only do they encrypt your internet connection, but they reroute all of your traffic through a private tunnel to keep it safe from prying eyes. Even the best VPNs can have problems though. </p>



<p>Maybe you’re not sure if your VPN is working properly. Or maybe you just want to test out the service for yourself to better understand how it safeguards your privacy. Here I’ll show you an easy method to check if your VPN is working and to feel confident it’s operating correctly.</p>
