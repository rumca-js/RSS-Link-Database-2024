## Angst: A Tale Of Survival - Official Exclusive Cinematic Reveal Trailer

Angst: A Tale of Survival is an atmospheric wilderness survival game that takes you on a journey through a limbo-like world where nothing is as it seems. As you venture deeper into the snowy wilderness, you’ll encounter an array of biomes with unique characteristics and find new quests that unravel the secrets of this world’s mysterious past. To survive in this frozen realm, you must craft tools and weapons, hunt, fish, and upgrade your skills and gear. Angst: A Tale of Survival’s rogue-lite progression system complements its slow-paced survival gameplay, where resource and character management, coupled with environmental exploration, takes precedence over traditional combat and skill-based gameplay. 

In short, fight to survive against the otherworldly elements (and whatever else lurks in the icy darkness) — as this seems to be the only way out of The Hopeward Hollow.
