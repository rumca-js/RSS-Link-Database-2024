Today on the Matt Walsh Show, anti-American protesters in DC yesterday tore down an American flag, burned it, and hoisted a foreign flag in its place. It was one of the most disgraceful and infuriating displays we've ever witnessed. And it shows where the real dividing line in America is. Also, Joe Biden finally explains why he dropped out of the race. And he explained it by not explaining it at all. The White House press secretary does an even worse job of trying to explain why Biden is still fit to be president if he isn't fit to run for president. And, in keeping with one of the themes of this week, the Wall Street Journal publishes a report attempting to explain why so many people are choosing not to have kids.
