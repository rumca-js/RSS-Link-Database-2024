<p>Vice Admiral Eduardo Santos was in charge of the Philippine navy at a time of ‘creeping invasion’ by China. Then along came an unusual idea</p><p>More than 25 years ago, the BRP Sierra Madre was sent off for one final, secret voyage. In the darkness of night, the Philippine navy ship sailed from Manila Bay into the remote waters of the South China Sea. Then, to the surprise of many, it ran aground, and hasn’t moved since.</p><p>“I did it as quietly as I could, so I would not raise any hackles among anybody,” says Vice Adm Eduardo Santos, who was chief of the navy at the time. To him, it was a case of mission accomplished. His plan had been to run the ship on to a small reef known as Second Thomas Shoal, one of the world’s most fiercely contested maritime sites, without China knowing. The move would help the Philippines defend the area for decades to come.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/i-did-it-as-quietly-as-i-could-the-navy-chief-who-wrecked-his

<p>The US gymnast performed her Double Pike vault in podium training, three years after the chaos of Tokyo</p><p>The last time Simone Biles attempted to vault in a competition arena at the Olympic Games, all hell broke loose. As Biles launched herself into her extremely difficult Amanar vault, she completely lost track of herself in the air, only managing one and a half twists instead of the planned two and a half. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jul/27/simone-biles-withdraws-tokyo-2020-olympics-gymnastics-all-around-final">After withdrawing from the team final</a>, Biles would spend most of her Olympic experience in the stands.</p><p>Three years on, Biles returned to the Olympic competition floor on Thursday morning as the women’s gymnastics teams worked their way through podium training, the one chance that gymnasts will have to train inside the Bercy Arena before the gymnastics competitions begin with the men’s qualifications on Saturday.</p> <a href="https://www.th

The 67,000-capacity venue is the second largest stadium in France - and its vastness is showing, with only the lower-levels of the ground occupied, and even then with large patches of white seats. It is a disappointing turn-out for an encounter between two highly-ranked teams, and will be quite the change for the Matildas - they have played their last 14 home matches in front of capacity crowds.</p><p><strong>The players are out on the pitch,</strong> the anthems are in flow and kick-off will shortly follow.

In other speeches, Harris has also expressed a belief in “the significance of the passage of time” and a desire to “honor the women who made history throughout history”.</p><p>Since becoming the presumptive nominee, Harris has invigorated the Democratic party. It’s not only that she’s a much younger candidate than Biden; she also has a stump speech style that embraces metaphor and a new age vernacular not often heard in national politics.

<p><strong>BBC Philharmonic/Mena<br />(Chandos)</strong><br />Juanjo Mena brings out the flair for instrumental colour in Roberto Gerhard’s early works</p><p>The Catalonia-born Roberto Gerhard was a pupil of Schoenberg in Vienna and Berlin in the 1920s, but it was not until the 1950s that he began to use his teacher’s serial technique systematically in his own music. But, as this collection of Gerhard’s earlier works shows, the flair for instrumental colour and for creating vivid orchestral images that gives his later music such vitality had been ever present.</p><p>The ballet Don Quixote was first performed at Covent Garden in 1950, but Gerhard had begun working on the score in 1940, soon after leaving Franco’s Spain for the UK. The other two works here, the ballet Alegrías (Joys) and Pedrelliana, also originated in those war years. All three inhabit a musical world that Juanjo Mena, the BBC Philharmonic’s former chief conductor, understands instinctively. His performances are suitab

<p>It was hard to get the president to talk about abortion at all, but Harris seems to realize that abortion rights are a winning issue</p><p>When he was still the nominee, Joe Biden’s preferred euphemism for abortion was “Roe”. He would talk about “upholding” Roe v Wade even after June 2022, when the US supreme court struck it down. Reproductive rights advocates bristled at this, pointing out how many people had been denied abortions under Roe, and how flimsy the decision’s protection of reproductive rights had been on personal-autonomy or sex-equality grounds.</p><p>Frankly, it was hard to get the president to talk about abortion at all. He seemed to avoid even the word “abortion”. When he did talk about the procedure – and the bans on it that Republicans have unleashed across the country – he preferred to focus on women who had been denied emergency abortions for wanted pregnancies in the midst of tragic health complications.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a hr

<p>New evidence confirms Black mothers are far more at risk than their white peers. After my own traumatic experience, I’m not surprised</p><p>The fact that Black mothers in England are almost twice as likely to have their births investigated for potential NHS safety failings is shocking and unacceptable – but for me, it’s not entirely surprising. As someone who co-founded <a href="https://fivexmore.org/">Five X More</a> after my own distressing birth experience, I find these statistics hit close to home. The higher rates of investigations among Black mothers reflect a grim reality: Black women and their babies in the UK face significantly greater risks during childbirth.</p><p>For every 1,000 deliveries by Black women, 2.3 are investigated compared with 1.3 for white women, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/23/national-disgrace-black-mothers-in-england-twice-as-likely-to-have-nhs-birth-investigated">the Guardian found</a> – figures that highlight the deep-
