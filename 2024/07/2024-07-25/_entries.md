SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's SK Hynix posted its highest quarterly profit since 2018 on Thursday as the Nvidia supplier said strong AI chip demand will only get stronger, such as for high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in generative AI chipsets.  "AI demand continues to grow above expectations... We expect next year's HBM shipments to more than double this year's," Head of DRAM Marketing Kim Kyu Hyun said in an earnings call.  However, SK Hynix shares dropped as much as 8.4% in morning trade, tracking declines in U.S. shares such as Nvidia, as tech firms' results failed to meet sky-high investor expectations.

The global equity sell-off looks set to extend into Europe on Thursday although the region may be spared the carnage in parts of Asia, where Japan's Nikkei tumbled as much as 3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slumped close to 2%.

Japan's exporter-heavy equity market was hit particularly hard by a reversal in the yen, which has rebounded to about 152 per dollar from a three-decade trough near 162 yen per dollar around the start of this month.
