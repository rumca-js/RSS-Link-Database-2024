								<p>The biggest historical battle in all of <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> - the Siege of Terra - is also one of the hardest to play out fully on the tabletop, due to its vast planet-wide scale and the sheer numbers of warriors involved.

								<p>The Ranger has always been one of the more odd-ball classes in Dungeons and Dragons 5e, in part thanks to its highly situational abilities. Players were looking forward to seeing a glow-up for the class in the 2024 Player&rsquo;s Handbook, but when a video on the official YouTube channel suggested its hallmark feature, Hunter&rsquo;s Mark, &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/new-spell-rules-help-ranger">Continued</a></p>
