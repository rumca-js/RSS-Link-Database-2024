Meta just released their latest “open source” AI model, Llama 3.1. Let's see if it's better than ChatGPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Shannon. But what's crazy is that Mark Zuckerberg has been the open source AI advocate and is on a huge redemption arc. Clearly due to the increase in ability of ZuckOS thanks to Llama 3.1. And if Zuck's change isn’t a testament to just how good Llama AI models are, then I don’t know what is.
