Passing against a good defense in EA Sports College Football 25 can be tough. Corners readily contest throws, while safeties lie in wait to blow up plays, and linebackers lurk, positioned to intercept an errant throw. If you want to give yourself the best chance to hit open receivers and avoid these perils, it helps to know in advance what the defense is going to do. That’s where reading defensive coverages comes in. In this video, we’ll go over six types of pass coverages to look out for. Including how you can recognize them and weaknesses you can exploit.

00:00 Intro
00:41 Pass Coverage types

Watch our Nobody Wants to Die review by Carli Velocci on PC, also available on PS5 (PlayStation 5) and Xbox Series X|S.

Nobody Wants to Die’s relatively brief story isn’t completely original, but it has a cool mix of inspirations and unique worldbuilding touches that all work well together to create something new and engaging. It holds your hand a bit too much for a game about the art of investigation, but its conversation system picks up the slack with humor, unexpected outcomes, and a surprisingly deep story about how your past can be your present —  even when you’re facing immortality.

Now that Deadpool works for Mickey Mouse, the days of Fox X-Men movies are truly at an end. Yes, Ryan Reynolds’ fourth-wall-breaking hero is back for Deadpool & Wolverine, and it features a bunch of characters from the Fox Marvel universe – including old Hugh Jackman’s Logan himself – but this is a Disney movie now, bub. SNIKT!
So that means it’s time for the most definitive ranking of the X-Men movies that you, and we actually, can be mad about. Yes, the Fox X-Men movies are done, but there’s no denying that the series laid much of the groundwork for our modern superhero movie landscape. So there’s only one thing left to do, and that’s assess these past 24 years of mutant madness – the good, the bad, and the Origins. This is The Fox X-Men Movies: The Final Ranking!
