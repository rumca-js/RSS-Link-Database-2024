SharePlay is <a href=\"https://x.com/MaxPR/status/1816228030110400709\">now available</a> to all Max users paying for Ad-Free and Ultimate Ad-Free plans, allowing them to hold and join watch parties over FaceTime and iMessage, no matter where they are.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Users can start watching with friends by hitting the &quot;share&quot; button either on the details section of each title or within the FaceTime app. Each session can have as many as 32 participants, but they all have to be Max subscribers. That means people from regions where Max isn't available, such as in Asian countries, won't be able to hop on and watch with their pals in the US or Europe.
