This summer, Epic Games finally gets its wish when, thanks to new EU regulations, it's launching its own digital store on iOS and Android. And ahead of its arrival, the company has announced it's removing Fortnite and other Epic games from what it calls "rent collector" competing stores, "even if those stores offer us a special deal for our own games."
</p><p>
In its <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-s-new-game-strategy-for-mobile-stores">announcement</a>, Epic first confirm titles sold on its new mobile store will be subject to the same 12 percent cut seen on PC (0 percent if a developer uses a third-party payment system) before revealing plans to pull its own games from some competing stores. More specifically, it says it'll be "ending distribution partnerships with mobile stores that serve as rent collector

Video game performers within United States actors union SAG-AFTRA have voted to go on strike starting Friday, 26th July, after "more than than a year and a half of negotiations" with major game companies over the use of AI have failed to reach a deal.
</p><p>
SAG-AFTRA members initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-members-overwhelmingly-vote-in-favour-of-authorising-video-game-strike">voted in favour</a> of (but did not immediately take) strike action last September, after the union failed to reach a consensus with video game producers - including Activision, Warner Bros, EA, Take-Two, and Disney - while attempting to negotiate a successor to the Interactive Media Agreement, which covers members' work on games.

At the time, SAG-AFTRA said companies had refused to offer acceptable terms on critical i

Of all the changes made in the transition from Overwatch 1 to 2, the move from 6v6 battles to 5v5 was undoubtedly one of its most controversial. And now developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> has confirmed its's revisiting that decision, exploring if and how 6v6 matches could be re-introduced to Overwatch 2 in a series of upcoming tests.
</p><p>

Maybe you've heard of Kamala Harris; she's the current US vice president and very likely the Democratic party's official presidential nominee for November's US election. But now she's firmly back in the spotlight, the mildly curious case of her secret life in developer Remedy's 2019 action-adventure Control has resurfaced online.
</p><p>
You see, pinned to a whiteboard in an unassuming corner of The Oldest House - the transdimensional Brutalist office block at the heart of Control's story - is a picture of a missing 40-year-old Bureau employee, Jane Farland, lost during one of the House's shifts. Only, Photoshopped eyes aside, Jane Farland is the spitting image of Vice President Harris.

Infamous internet animation series Skibidi Toilet, made using Valve's Source Filmmaker software and featuring assets from Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike, is in discussions to be turned into a Michael Bay movie.
</p><p>
Bay, who directed disaster film blockbusters such as Armageddon and Pearl Harbour, is reportedly in talks to launch a Skibidi Toilet film and TV franchise with former Paramount Pictures boss Adam Goodman. 
</p><p>
"We are absolutely in talks right now, both on the television side and the earliest conversations right now on the film side," Goodman told <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/skibidi-toilet-michael-bay-movie-adam-goodman-1236077245/">Variety</a>. "But it's not a be-all, end-all for us."

Developer Nexon Games' latest effort, The First Descendant, goes a step further than most though, with this free-to-play Unreal Engine 5 shooter offering three core modes - but then also FSR 3 frame generation to increase performance on each, and a ray tracing toggle. The result is a lot of permutations to cover here, and the frank truth of the matter is that only a few of these settings are actually worth using.</p><p>The First Descendant falls into a similar trap as the 2022 Saints Row Reboot for example - and even the more recent Hogwarts Legacy. In each of those cases it was 'mode overload' on PS5, Series X and S, with developers essent

## Monster Train's acclaimed roguelike deckbuilding comes to PS5 today

Monster Train, the acclaimed roguelike deckbuilder from developer Shiny Shoe, is making its way to PlayStation 5 today, 25th July, some four years after its original release.
</p><p>
Monster Train sees players attempting to restore Hell's inferno after it freezes over - a task requiring them to ride a train carrying a burning pyre deep into the heart of Hell.
</p><p>
At first glance, it's all a bit Slay the Spire, with branching pathways providing choices on how to progress and level up each run. But the proper fun comes in combat, where the real-time card battling sees players unleashing their hellish minions against the forces of heaven - gradually moving between multiple floors of the titular train as they try and defend the pyre on top to win.

</p><p>
Around 1750 employees within Microsoft's gaming teams are now unionised, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-24/world-of-warcraft-unionizes-growing-foothold-at-microsoft-s-activision-blizzard">Bloomberg</a> reported yesterday, including those working on Blizzard's veteran MMO.

World of Warcraft developers will now be represented by the Communication Workers of America (CWA), which celebrated the inclusion of Blizzard staff yesterday in a statement which dubbed the joining as the "first wall-to-wall union at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>", and "a

Fallout: London, the fan-made game-sized mod for Fallout 4, will be released today. The mod's creators confirmed the release to <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/fallout-london-bethesda-mod-tomorrow">Inverse</a> - saying the date was now definite, "unless nuclear war happens".
</p><p>
Developed by Team Folon, the mod has been over five years in the making and transports the post-apocalyptic game to England's capital city, with a whole new story, environments, characters, factions, weapons, and gameplay elements.
</p><p>
Due to its size it won't be available on popular mod hosting sites, so is instead <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london">available on GOG</a> with a custom launcher.

Better, too, in some instances. Seemingly the very epitome of design-by-committee, it's everything you may expect a free-to-play multiplayer open-world survival horror to be, down to its garish shop and two-track battle pass. There's about eleventy gazillion menus and items to track, your UI is painfully cluttered, and in some places, the game simply feels unfinished; you can't use a controller for example, and your character seemingly only communicates by waving their arms about wildly, like improv semaphore.</p><p>And yet here I am, at 3:30am &ndash; that's real-life time, not the in-game clock, I'm embarrassed to say &ndash; creeping around this abandoned hospital because I have just one more crate to find to "complete" the stron
