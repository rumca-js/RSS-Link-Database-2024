Traditional electronics use semiconductors to transmit data through bursts of charged carriers (electrons or holes) to convey messages in "1s" and "0s." Spintronic devices can process an order of magnitude more information by assigning binary code to the orientation of electrons' magnetic poles, a property known as spin— an "up" spin is a 1, a "down" is a 0.

Homelessness is a major problem in the U.S., and it's getting worse: A record 650,000 Americans were homeless on a single night in January 2023, according to the most recent point-in-time report released by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. That amounts to 1 out of every 500 people nationwide.

The Cambrian fossil record indicates that most animal phyla had diversified and inhabited the Earth's oceans approximately 518 million years ago. But even though chordates—the group that includes vertebrates like humans—were part of this early animal diversification, they make up a relatively small portion of fossils from more than 50 Cambrian sites worldwide.

Today, enormous stretches of space are crystal clear, but that wasn't always the case. During its infancy, the universe was filled with a "fog" that made it opaque, cloaking the first stars and galaxies. NASA's upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will probe the universe's subsequent transition to the brilliant starscape we see today –– an era known as cosmic dawn.

In an actively warming world, large-scale wildfires are becoming more common. These wildfires emit black carbon to our atmosphere, one of the most potent short-lived atmospheric warming agents. This is because of its strong sunlight absorption characteristics. But scientists have yet to get a handle on the extent of atmospheric warming caused by black carbon in pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) clouds that develop from high-intensity wildfires.
