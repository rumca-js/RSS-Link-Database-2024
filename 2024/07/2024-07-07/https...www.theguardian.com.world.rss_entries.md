<p>The New Maga Deal full of errors and omissions from former Trump adviser convicted of contempt of Congress</p><p>In a book due to be published a day before his release from prison this month, the former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro praises Donald Trump’s Maga movement – and claims to list errors and omissions that led to his four-month sentence for criminal contempt of Congress, for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House January 6 committee.</p><p>But Navarro makes striking errors and omissions of his own, including jarringly misidentifying Ashli Babbitt – the Trump supporter <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ashli-babbitt-capitol-siege-a15c7e52a04d932972b7a284c7a8f7df">shot</a> dead at the US Capitol who became a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ashli-babbitt-capitol-siege-a15c7e52a04d932972b7a284c7a8f7df">martyr</a> to many on the far right – as a US marine corps veteran.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jul/07/peter-navarro-trump-a

<p>Polling shows critical group unenthused about Biden and Trump – and moved by economy over abortion</p><p>The independent voter is the elusive prize in any election. This year, Democrats are hoping that widespread support for abortion rights will draw in women who might have previously shied away from the party.</p><p>But polling shows that independent female voters, a critical group for any candidate, are particularly unenthused about the prospect of choosing between the same two guys who ran for election last time. Now, with some<strong> </strong>Democrats publicly mulling replacing Joe Biden in the wake of his catastrophic debate performance and Kamala Harris emerging as a possible heir apparent, a key question is whether a Harris-topped ticket would provide them with some much-needed excitement<strong>.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/07/independent-female-voters-kamala-harris">Continue reading...</a>

Most of them won’t know their way around at all or know what to do. It is a massive logistical challenge for parliament.”</p><p>Labour’s landslide victory will mean the most dramatic transformation in the make-up of the 650-seat lower house in decades, with Keir Starmer’s parliamentary party having almost doubled in size, and added 211 more members to its benches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/07/commons-334-rookie-mps-diverse-parliament-women-ethnic-minority">Continue reading...</a>
