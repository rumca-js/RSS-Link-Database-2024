However, when transporting them to the shop, they would fall out in my bag. To solve this, I designed an insert to make the box work as a carrying case. The insert includes a pen spring mechanism that keeps the base stable during storage and allows it to pivot out for easy access to the bits. I also can hold more bits now which is great!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Coalrober"> /u/Coalrober </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dx7m5z">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1dx7m5z/amana_cnc_bit_holder/"

I ran the motor at 10% of the power. The servo could easily change the direction. The whole assembly felt sturdy. The ESC burned when i ran it at around 30 % of the power. I am now working on replacing it with a better esc. And will also work on a detailed video of the whole build snd some more testing. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pratik_z"> /u/pratik_z </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://v.redd.it/9zbln

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Last summer I ordered rail kits for my ender 3, along with 12floz of rail oil. After 6 months of waiting, missed “promised” deadlines from the owner himself, I canceled my order. It took about a week to get my money back, as they had me sign a forum saying we wouldn’t do a charge back. After that they pretty much ghosted us until we contacted them again asking about the delays and such, and after all of that we got our money back.</p> <p>However, I did not cancel my order of rail fluid. It’s been about a year now, and I still have not gotten it. I was going to include a screenshot of the order on my account (which I will now delete), but the order is GONE. </p> <p>So just to remind you, no matter what the guy says, “struggling company, supplier issues, etc” don’t fall for it. And yes they have a Reddit presence, that’s how I originally fell for it. How hard is it to get a 12oz bottle of rail fluid?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a
