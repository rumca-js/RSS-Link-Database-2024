Assassin’s Creed Origins was a true nexus point for the genre, hosting the largest number of new features an open world game has ever had. It was the first time the genre leaned heavily into action RPG mechanics with its expanded skill trees, experience points, and upgrade system. 

The combat was very flexible, allowing you to stealth through situations using your eagle to tag marks and objectives, or to go in guns blazing using your giant axe. 

I loved the feel of the swings, dodges, and parries. Movement in general is intuitive and fluid, which leads to the exploration. Exploration was top notch in Origins. Seriously, the wildlife is the best it's ever been, with crocodiles, camels, unicorns, lions, and cats that you can pet and tame. Future games would force heavy grinding to get past certain enemies, but Origins hit the sweet spot of RPG balance.
