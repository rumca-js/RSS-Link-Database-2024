A sequel to the similarly celebrated Myst, Riven boasted arguably the most detailed pre-rendered backgrounds to date when it was released in 1997. And now it's back, stunningly realised in full real-time 3D via Unreal Engine 5, playable both as a standard game and a VR experience - and there's even a Meta Quest port. However you choose to play it, this release feels like the ultimate expression of developer Cyan's original vision.\n</p><p>\nEven at launch, Riven was a stunner. In terms of pre-rendered background quality, the improvement over Myst was gigantic.
