<p>Coco Gauff’s coach Brad Gilbert keeps the nicknames coming while motoring nuts keep the petrol flame burning</p><p>The elegantly planted driveways on the streets around the All England Club are an annual attraction, and the cars that populate them aren’t bad either – Marryat Road offers a gleaming apron front of Porsches, Bentleys, Mercedes and more. A morning walk up the hill brought a special reward for petrolheads on Sunday – a classic car meet on Wimbledon Common. By 9am, its raggedy heathland was fringed with marvellous motors, from a Lotus Elan to a Daf 600, a brand-new Morgan to a 50-year-old Stingray. The Southside Hustle began back in Covid times, when two friends, Charles Evans and Jamie Wheatley, began meeting up to enjoy a socially distanced coffee and a drive. What started with two cars now attracts dozen of eye-catching engines every first Sunday of the month – while retaining a vibe that’s both lowkey and local.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/

Yes, it will require editing, fleshing out, road-testing, but the quality of the material is crucial. Does it pulse snappily through to a meaningful resolution? Is it insightful without being mean?

I was 26 when my dad died of cancer. Three months later, my mum died of a brain aneurysm. Suddenly, I was an adult orphan, selling up the family home where I’d grown up, eradicating the safety net I’d known all my life.</p><p>What really amplified the enormity of this loss was being an only child. Of course, having siblings isn’t a guarantee that grief will be shared or lessened – there are numerous reasons why this may not be the case.

Casting a group of trans and gender nonconforming individuals as both Virginia Woolf’s Orlando and, simultaneously, as themselves, Preciado explores the experience of transition, the literary significance of the 1928 book and the evolution of selfdom. It’s a unique picture that, while it can feel a little artificial in the performance segments, is profoundly affecting when it allows the participants to explore their own stories, to be heard and to be celebrated for who they are.

Then she meets Sylvain (Pierre-Yves Cardinal), the burly, blue-collar contractor hired to renovate her dilapidated cabin retreat.

<p>Will the credits roll as Starmer wins big in 2029 or will Reeves be boxed in by her own fiscal rules and leave the economy in a worse state?</p><p>Just as in the movie Sliding Doors, there are two endings to the story that began on Thursday with Labour’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/05/time-for-us-to-deliver-says-starmer-as-labour-heads-for-landslide">victory </a>in the 2024 election. One is happy, one is sad, and either is possible. What happens to the economy over the next five years will determine which one materialises.</p><p>Let’s start with the happy ending: the one where the credits roll as Keir Starmer wins big for a second time in 2029. The script for that one starts slowly. The scale of Labour’s win means it doesn’t have to rush things but has time to put in place the supply-side reforms, such as changes to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/06/labour-nick-boles-planning-tsar">planning rules</a>, that will boos

<p>Easy chicken and simple berries for lazy summer days</p><p>I lightly brown the plump cushions of chicken, their skin turning glossy and golden, then turn them over and brown the other side. They are to roast with long, scarlet peppers, pointed like a sultan’s slippers, tiny potatoes and whole cloves of garlic. Seasoned with dried lavender and thyme, oregano and salty green olives, the dish emerges from the oven smelling of deepest summer. No side dish is needed save a bowl of watercress and butterhead lettuce, whose leaves will soften in the warmth from the sweet aromatic juices on our plates.</p><p>At the height of summer, I cherish such unfussy cooking; recipes that look after themselves, the ingredients working magic in the oven while we get on with other things. What appeals here, as much as the crisp-skinned chicken and soft peppers, are the juices, sweet and golden and delicious enough to make everyone reach for a lump of bread. It is worth mentioning that the chicken heats u

Colin was a scientist from Swansea who could be funny, but was emotionally stunted. “If Roger Mellie from <em>Viz</em> had been Welsh and a bit <em>more</em> aggressive – that was my father,” Baddiel writes.

<p>The party’s co-leader, now MP for Bristol Central, says she will pressure Starmer on climate, housing and services</p><p>On Bristol’s harbourside on Friday morning, Carla Denyer was still on the go.

<p>This masterly investigation, spanning 30 years, into the assassination of a cold war dissident, Georgi Markov, in London in 1978 exposes an assassin worthy of James Bond</p><p>The killing of a Bulgarian dissident, Georgi Markov, on Waterloo Bridge in September 1978 is a case to clinch the truism that real life is better scripted than fiction. As Markov was crossing the Thames, heading back to BBC headquarters, he bumped into a man with an umbrella and felt a sharp pain in his leg. The man apologised, got in a taxi and disappeared.</p><p>Four days later, Markov was dead. Doctors discovered a pinprick irritation on his right thigh. They removed the flesh and found a 1.7mm pellet containing 0.45 mg of ricin, a poison that had almost certainly come from Russia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jul/07/the-umbrella-by-ulrik-skotte-review-the-tireless-pursuit-of-agent-piccadilly">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Locked in their bedrooms, playing video games into the small hours, children as young as 10 years old are now addicted to their consoles. Tim Lewis hears how the compulsive games can be impossible to resist – and meets the experts tackling the issue</p><p>It was only when the doorbell rang at 2am that Dee realised how serious a problem her son had. She had been asleep, so she was especially disoriented to open the door and find two paramedics, an ambulance blinking behind them in the dark. The lead medic asked if Jake was home. She directed him to the bedroom of her son, who was 16 at the time. Five years later, the shock and distress still causes Dee’s eyes to fill with tears. “I didn’t know what was happening,” she recalls. “It’s the worst nightmare a mother could ever think of.”</p><p>Owing to patient confidentiality, it was not immediately clear who had called the paramedics or why.

If it’s summer, I’ll be up early to do open-water swimming at 9am at a nearby lake. I know, I’m a lunatic, but compared to years of getting up at 3.40am for <em>BBC Breakfast</em> I class that as a lie-in. In winter it’s a proper lie-in and my husband will bring me a cup of tea in bed.<br /><br /><strong>Sofa or sweat? </strong>I’m an activity addict so, after my swim, it would be a dog walk in the hills, culminating in a pub lunch.<br /><br /><strong>Roast out or in? </strong>Could be either. But if we’ve had an activity-filled day, we’ll do a nice roast chicken with all the trimmings– and red wine – for about 5pm.<br /><br /><strong>Work or down tools? </strong>If I’ve got a deadline, I might write, but I try not to. I want my Sundays to be fun and I want to be around in case my children, who are 22 and 19, decide to make an appearance.
