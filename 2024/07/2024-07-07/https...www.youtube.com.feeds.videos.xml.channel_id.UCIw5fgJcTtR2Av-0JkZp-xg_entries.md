PICARD: Then formulate this one. How do I deal Riker and the Hathaway? I will await your answer on the Bridge.
And, Commander, it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life.
DATA: I believe I understand, sir.
PICARD: And Data, will you leave your hesitation and self-doubt here in your quarters.
