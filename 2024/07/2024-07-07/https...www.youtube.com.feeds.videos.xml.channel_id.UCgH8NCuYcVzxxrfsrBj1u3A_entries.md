Mötley Crüe have once again been hit by claims of fakery - this time over Esteemed guitarist and friend John 5's alleged air guitar technique. He says it's simply not true and if he says that, I believe him. 

Footnote - more apologies for the in-video, video blur; we were hit with YouTube's red card over background copyright issues.
