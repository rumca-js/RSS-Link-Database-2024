Every week I usually have new 200 GB on my external SSD where I edit my stuff. Once I am happy I move it with rsync to my OMV SMB share. This first migration goes to the NVMe (FAST storage) disks so that I can still do some light editing directly of the SMB share. After a month, within the same OMV instance I move it to the larger HDD pool (SLOW storage). I do this again with rsync manually and delete manually the FAST version. This approach is very error prone for me since I don't do it frequently enough to build muscle memory around it. I have some crude bash scripts now but I feel like there has to be a better way to solve this type of problem. Please let me know your thoughts on any of the aspects I described.
