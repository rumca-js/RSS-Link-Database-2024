<p>This is it, the first game to nearly make me throw my Playdate against a wall. <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://play.date/games/angel-pop/"><em>Angel Pop</em></a>, a bullet hell shoot ‘em up that landed on the Playdate Catalog last month, is utter chaos. Playing as an adorable little girl, you must fend off a nonstop barrage of enemy fire over the course of 50-or-so levels, trying to clear each stage of all enemies within a limited span of time as projectiles bombard you from every direction. It moves at breakneck speed, and at some points, there may be as many as 1,000 objects on the screen. Basically, it’s everything a person could want in a bullet hell, and I’m completely addicted.</p>
<p><em>Angel Pop</em> really tests the limits of the Playdate, with so much happening on screen at all times, but it plays with impressive smoothness. The game is set in what developer NNNN describes as “a surreal dreamworld,” and the art juxtaposes the cartoonish player character and en

The $1.5 million electric crossover (per <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/nascar-cup-chicago-electric-racecar-bda74ac3affb199367c680e662aaf2d2"><em><ins>AP</ins></em></a>) was developed in partnership with ABB, Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota to call attention to sustainability efforts under the NASCAR Impact program and show what EVs are capable of. It doesn’t mean NASCAR is moving away from gasoline-powered race cars just yet, but rather that it’s trying to “gauge fan interest in electric racing,” people involved with the initiative told <em>AP.</em></p>
<p>NASCAR’s head of sustainability Riley Nelson told <em>AP</em> that the series and its partners “want to represent electric vehicles, and

<p>Ariane 6, the European Space Agency’s next-gen heavy-lift rocket, is expected to take its inaugural flight on July 9, ending a yearlong gap in Europe’s ability to access space on its own. The launch vehicle, made by ArianeGroup, replaces Ariane 5, which was retired last July following its 117th mission. The launch window opens at 2PM ET on Tuesday (8PM CEST).</p>
<p>Ariane 5 was in operation from 1996 to 2023 and was ESA’s main launch system. Ariane 6 was supposed to take over right away after its predecessor’s retirement, but years of delays in its development meant it ultimately wasn’t ready in time. As a result, ESA has had to rely on other launch providers, like SpaceX, to get science missions off the ground over the last year. If all goes smoothly with Ariane 6, Europe will be back in the game. “Ariane 6 marks a new era of autonomous, versatile European space travel,” <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Ariane/Ariane_6_i

<p>Bigger screens are coming to the Apple Watch, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>’s Mark Gurman. In the <em>Power On</em> newsletter this week, Gurman writes that the Series 10 models will sport larger displays than we’ve seen in past versions of the regular Apple Watch, with one of the options likely to be close in size to the Apple Watch Ultra. The Apple Watch Series 10 is <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-has-plans-for-a-thinner-iphone-macbook-pro-and-apple-watch-171137550.html"><ins>expected to be thinner</ins></a>, too, as Gurman previously reported.</p>
<p>Apple has also been working on more advanced health features for its smartwatches, but it seems some of these may not be ready in time for the next release. That includes tools to measure high blood pressure and detect sle
