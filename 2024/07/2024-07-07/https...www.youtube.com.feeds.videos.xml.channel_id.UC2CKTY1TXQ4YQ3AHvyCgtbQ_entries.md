All the new Age of Sigmar drops next weekend, but I've already decided that I'm only going to be doing TWO Spearheads (instead of the five Combat Patrols I did for 40k) for this system. I'll talk about that, which ones, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
