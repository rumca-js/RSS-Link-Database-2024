It was the first time the genre leaned heavily into action RPG mechanics with its expanded skill trees, experience points, and upgrade system. \n\nThe combat was very flexible, allowing you to stealth through situations using your eagle to tag marks and objectives, or to go in guns blazing using your giant axe. \n\nI loved the feel of the swings, dodges, and parries. Movement in general is intuitive and fluid, which leads to the exploration. Exploration was top notch in Origins. Seriously, the wildlife is the best it's ever been, with crocodiles, camels, unicorns, lions, and cats that you can pet and tame. Future games would force heavy grinding to get past certain enemies, but Origins hit the sweet spot of RPG balance.", "id": 823372, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcR1LUOSbJw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/DcR1LUOSbJw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "What Made Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins So Good?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-07T10:00:34+00:00", "description": "What\u2019s more dangerous than a game with an endless ocean of content to dive into?
