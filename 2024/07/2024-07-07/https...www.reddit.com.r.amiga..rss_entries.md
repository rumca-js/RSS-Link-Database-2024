The player mainly flies the F/A-18 Hornet, but the F-16 Fighting Falcon is also available for aerobatics, free flight and the first mission. Contrary to the title of the game, the real F/A-18 is not a true interceptor aircraft, having been designed instead as a multirole anti-ship strike fighter.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="htt

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am unable to boot into the live environment of AROS One on my Lenovo Yoga 330 11IGM. I have tried putting the USB image on 2 USB drives using both dd and Balena Etcher and burning the DVD image on a DVD-RW but no matter what I do when I try to boot off of the medium I created I get kicked straight back into the OS that's currently installed - openSUSE. I'm posting this here as the AROS reddit is dead and I can't sign up on the forum because of it not sending out the confirmation email.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alpha012_GD"> /u/Alpha012_GD </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dx69p5/aros_one_unable_to_boot/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dx69p5/aros_one_unable_to_boot/">[comments]</a></span>
