Ugh, loyal Theorists, is the galaxy far, far away losing its luster? The Star Wars fan community has been quite... argumentative... to say the least since The Force Awakens, Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker, and all of the new content Disney and Lucasfilm have created. And, sure, The Acolyte isn't exactly what we expected or wanted. But, Star Wars isn't _truly_ dead is it? There must be some way to SAVE the franchise...
