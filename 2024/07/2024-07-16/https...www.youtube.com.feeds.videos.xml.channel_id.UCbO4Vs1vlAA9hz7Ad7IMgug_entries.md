Okay kids! Let's all head to NUKA WORLD!

Modiphius is back with a full-plastic 2-Player Starter Set for gang-warfare set in a post-apocalyptic amusement park. Based on the Fallout 4 DLC, you can take command of the gangs populating Nuka World to fight for dominance and resources in the park!

Thanks to Modiphius for the copy of the Box to review.
