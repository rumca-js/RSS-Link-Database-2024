<p>Portable SSDs are blazing fast but cumbersome to carry around&hellip; unless you have one that&rsquo;s the size of SK Hynix&rsquo;s tiniest external drive, which squeezes NVMe speeds into a USB thumb drive form.</p>



<p>And if you need this kind of convenience at a discount, you&rsquo;re in luck&mdash;right now during Amazon Prime Day, you can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-1000MB-External-Compatible/dp/B0CQZCWHTQ/">1TB SK Hynix Tube T31 portable SSD for $100</a> (26% off).</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2257928/sk-hynix-tube-t31-review.html">our review of the SK Hynix Tube T31</a>, we gave it a 4.5-out-of-5-stars rating for its impressive speed in its compact form factor. Though bulkier than a true USB thumb drive, it still fits in your pocket.</p>

<p>No matter how fast your local network or internet connection gets, eventually you&rsquo;ll have to use ye olde sneakernet to move your files around. That&rsquo;s why we all have half a dozen USB flash drives hiding in various nooks and crannies.</p>



<p>But with this Prime Day deal, you can get rid of them all and replace them with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-Ultra-Flash-Drive/dp/B083ZS4HYD/">this SanDisk 512GB USB flash drive for $33 on Amazon</a>, down from its usual price of $90. That&rsquo;s what you call a bargain!</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not the fastest USB flash drive in the world, but with its 130MB/s read speed, you could copy an entire <em>Fortnite</em> installation (78GB) in a little over ten minutes. Not bad when you&rsquo;re just moving files around.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve built multiple PCs from scratch, and at PCWorld, I&rsquo;ve used my desktop knowledge to curate a list of the best available computer deals for several years.

<p>Ergonomics are important for your health, but standing desks and comfortable office chairs can feel like expensive luxuries. At least, they typically do. But during Amazon Prime Day 2024, you can sometimes snag big discounts on wildly popular desk and chair models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s true this year as well, including a few sales on internet favorites. The prices should hold through the entirety of the Prime Day period, but don&rsquo;t wait until the last second tomorrow (July 17) if you see something you like&mdash;deals can sell out.</p>



<p>Our list takes into account user reviews, technical specs, price trends over the last year, and our own experiences. PCWorld&rsquo;s editors have spent years using home office setups, as well as corporate-grade gear. We know what corners you can cut to save some cash, and which ones are must-haves. The best model

<p>Amazon Prime Day 2024 sales officially begin now&mdash;and if you&rsquo;ve been holding off on shopping for a new drive, the wait has paid off. Many SSDs, HDDs, and external storage from popular manufacturers have hit low or all-time low prices, with capacities ranging from 512GB all the way up to 4TB.</p>



<p>The deals last through Wednesday, July 17, but don&rsquo;t sit on them if you see something you like. The best bargains often sell out quickly and don&rsquo;t get restocked.</p>



<p>Take it from me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been tracking SSD and storage deals for well over a decade, and have been covering them for PCWorld since 2016. The list you&rsquo;ll see below considers not just capacity and speed, but also online reviews from tech sites like ours (when available), user feedback, and price history.
