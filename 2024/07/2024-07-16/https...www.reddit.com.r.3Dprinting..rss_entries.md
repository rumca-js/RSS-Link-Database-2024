Preferably a larger printing area would be better and some of my ideas are wider. Im not gonna pretend I know what Im doing so something user friendly would be prefered but I am willing to learn whatever is needed. Looking to spend under $500 if possible but if a $1200 printer is on sale for say $600 Id be willing to increase my budget some. Also what acccessories will I need.

Every machine needs to be maintained eventually right? I've heard it's a lot of proprietary tech but don't you eventually have to lube a rod or change/tighten a belt?<br /> There are prime sales going on right now and I'm caught between the Neptune 4 plus or the Bambu A1. I'm fine tinkering a bit with a machine since I already have a CR10 V2 and a Ender 5. A lot of people suggest the Bambu since &quot;it just works&quot; but my concern is that it might be like an Apple device. If works but if any issues arise, it's a trip to their customer support instead of being able to fix it yourself.<br /> So, for those who have the Bambu A1, or any Bambu machine, have you had any trouble maintaining the machine after months of use? Any problems getting a spare part that broke and replacing it yourself?<br /> Also, do
