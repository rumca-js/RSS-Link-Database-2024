<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft</a> is a game rooted in customization, as you have the ability to change just about everything in the world to your liking. However, if you're looking to change up your character itself, there are a few more hoops to jump through than just placing blocks. For those of you looking to swap out your Minecraft username, you've come to the right spot, as all the steps to do so are showcased below.</p><h2>How to change your Minecraft username</h2><p>For starters, there are a few different ways to change a username in Minecraft and the way you'll use depends on the platform you're on. For example, those playing Bedrock Edition on PlayStation, Switch, or Xbox have to change their system gamertag, which changes your username for all games, not just Minecraft.</p><p>You can change your console gamertag through the settings of your system.

<p>Playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft</a> on PC means you have access to a world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-minecraft-mods/2900-5234/">mods</a>, shaders, and other unique elements to add to your copy of the game. However, by default, Minecraft only allows you to allocate 2 GB of RAM to the application, meaning your performance can be hindered if you decide to download a ton of add-ons. If you want to increase performance across the board, you'll need to allocate more RAM to Minecraft, which can be done right from the application itself.</p><h2>Allocate more RAM to Minecraft</h2><p>Fortunately, while Minecraft caps your RAM by default, it's extremely simple to uncap it. All you have to do is open the Minecraft Launcher on PC to start. With the launcher open, follow the steps below to increase your RAM usage while playing Minecraft:</p><ul><li>Click on either "Minecraft: Java Edition" or "Minecraft for Windows" from the left-hand

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> remains one of the most popular and influential games out there, and it's no longer just a game, but instead a platform of sorts for all manner of different types of games and experiences. Epic's Tim Sweeney believes Fortnite is basically an early version of the metaverse, and he recently spoke about this belief and how he sees the game growing and evolving over time.</p><p>"It's going to evolve a lot," Sweeney said. He <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/sweeneystephenson">spoke to researcher Matthew Ball about this recently</a>, ahead of Fortnite's seventh anniversary in August.</p><p>Fortnite as it exists today is limited by the available technology with which to build it. For example, Sweeney said the game's battle royale mode is limited to 100 people because "computers in the data center were just too slow" when the game released. And Fortnite is divided into a number of different islands for a similar reason:

<p>If you missed an elf named Círdan in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy, it's probably because he only had a small part in the films. Jackson cast Michael Elsworth in the role, and he appears briefly as Círdan during the opening monologue of the first film as a well as a cameo near the end of Return of the King when Frodo, Gandolf, and Bilbo sail into the west. But in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lotr-rings-of-power-season-2-gets-game-changing-trailer-and-season-2-premiere-date/1100-6523409/">The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Season 2</a>, Círdan will finally have a larger role in J.R.R. Tolkien's epic.</p><p>In Tolkien's lore, the character was known among his people as Círdan the Shipwright, and he was one of the original owners of the elves' Rings of Power. Círdan is also one of the oldest living elves, with a lifespan that went from the First Age to the Fourth Age, well after the events of the trilogy.</p><figure style="width: 1300px;"><a href="
