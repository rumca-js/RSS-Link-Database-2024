								<p>The eight <strong>DnD schools of magic</strong> are used to categorize Dungeons and Dragons’ many, many spells. This guide will explain the key difference between each, with examples of the best spells from each school.</p>
<p>While a Wizard may choose to specialize in a particular <strong>Dungeons and Dragons school of magic</strong>, most other <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/classes">DnD classes</a> will encounter them less frequently. Still, it helps to know what each means – particularly if you plan to cast <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/5e-spells">DnD spells</a> staple, Detect Magic.

								<p>When Wizards of the Coast announced new &lsquo;Value&rsquo; boosters for Magic the Gathering, I was among the first to clown on them. With just seven cards and no guaranteed rares, labelling them as a&nbsp;&lsquo;value&rsquo; product&nbsp;feels like quite the claim, at least until prices are revealed. But a commenter responding to my first article pointed out &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/value-booster-draft">Continued</a></p>
