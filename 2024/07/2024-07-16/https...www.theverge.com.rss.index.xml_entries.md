  <p id="41UXba">Back in 2005, a small firm offered a tantalizing vision of the future of computer keyboards. </p>
<p id="KTVvaC">What if your keyboard was filled with tiny screens that showed you exactly what any given press would do, each built into a crystal-clear key? The keys would morph and shift as you needed, transforming from letters and numbers to full-color icons and app shortcuts, depending on what you were doing.</p>
<p id="JsJyqk">Readers and tech bloggers adored the idea. “It’s about time someone shook up this stagnant keyboard market,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050729090327/http://www.engadget.com/entry/123400074005

  <p id="sKy9Ks">There are two possible paths for augmented reality devices. One path is the all-in-one approach, which you might call the smartphone path or the Vision Pro Path: you buy a full-fledged single device with everything you need, and when you need an upgrade, you buy a new one. The other path is the unbundled one: your AR system might be lots of devices rather than just one, and you’ll upgrade and swap things in as you need them. That path is more like building a home theater system than buying a new iPhone.</p>
