Bullies use intimidation and power to force others to act against their best interests. Bullies blame the victim, assuring everyone that they wouldn&#8217;t have to use force if people would simply go along with what they want. Effective bullies organize a small mob to enforce their wishes. Living and working with bullies is no fun. [&#8230;]
