<p>Microsoft has unveiled the sixth preview of its planned .NET 9, a major release of the company’s cross-platform software development framework that brings improvements in areas ranging from code layout to System.Numerics. With .NET 9, the ASP.NET web framework introduces fingerprinting of static web assets, which promises to improve caching behavior and enable faster load times.</p>



<p>Downloadable from <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0">dotnet.microsoft.com</a>, .NET 9 Preview 6 was introduced July 15. Code layout improvements stem from the refactoring of the RyuJIT compiler’s flowgraph data structures to remove various restrictions around block ordering and to

<p>A proposal to preserve the status of Java Native Interface (JNI) as a standard way to interoperate with native code is moving forward in the Java community.</p>



<p>Originally created in May 2023 and updated on July 16, the JDK enhancement proposal (JEP), called <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/472">“Prepare to Restrict the Use of JNI,”</a> is slated for JDK 24, which would not likely arrive until March 2025. The proposal calls for  warnings about uses of JNI and adjusting the <a href="Foreign%20Function%20&amp;%20Memory%20API">Foreign Function & Memory (FFM) API</a> to issue warnings in a consistent manner. These warnings are intended to prepare developers for a future release that disallows

<p>The allure of transformative business benefits in cloud computing prompted many organizations to invest heavily in cloud solutions over the past decade. Yet, despite this investment, many enterprises still grapple with cost inefficiencies that result in substantial financial waste. This issue persists even with the introduction and adoption of financial operations (<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2336517/give-finops-a-say-over-cloud-architecture-decisions.html">finops</a>) practices designed to curb this problem.</p>

<p>It is commonly said that a developer should “always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.”  Senior developers take this quote to heart. So how do you actually do this? </p>



<p>Well, books have been written about that, but I want to share a few practices here that you can do starting today to write good code and be a better developer. These tips represent some of the more valuable lessons I’ve learned over the years of regretting the code that I wrote. After all, the worst coder I know is me six months ago.</p>

<p>Multi-tenant data management is an essential part of a systems architecture designed for massive scale. It underpins countless business platforms, from commercial software-as-a-service CRMs to internal corporate data systems. Its popularity stems from its distinctive ability to support tailored services on a shared infrastructure, maximizing resource utilization and operational efficiency for each service (or tenant) while ensuring data isolation and security.</p>



<p>But while undeniably powerful, multi-tenant data management is a demanding approach. It pushes traditional data management to the limit — sometimes beyond. It requires the ability to segregate and handle data across tenants, and
