The project is one of 11 selected for funding through NASA&#8217;s TechFlights program, which supports space technology testing on suborbital rockets, rocket-powered landers or airplane-based platforms. Interlune&#8217;s system is known as CRUMBLE &#8212; an acronym that stands for &#8220;Comminution of Regolith Using Milling for Beneficiation of Lunar Extract.&#8221; Basically, the system would break down lunar dirt and rock, or regolith, and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/nasa-interlune-348k-proce

Groups including Stand.earth and Pacific Environment said in a news release that a protest outside Amazon&#8217;s headquarters towers in the Denny Regrade area would include a street &#8220;mural&#8221; and a 1,200-square-foot banner with the message: “Amazon is going the wrong way on climate.” Posts on X showed the message stenciled on 6th Avenue and crowds gathered in the street near the Spheres. Last year, Stand took credit for a similar large and public message to Amazon and CEO&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/environmental-groups-target-amazons-climate-efforts-with-prime-day-protest-at-seattle-hq/">Read More</a>

Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell last week helped cut the ribbon to celebrate the opening of the center, located at 3131 Elliott Ave. near downtown. The office is run by VFS Global and will offer visa, passport, and citizenship services. VFS will also operate a center in Bellevue, Wash. Many tech workers from India use H-1B visas — and having the new centers nearby could be helpful.

The social media platform had been testing a beta integration of Markable&#8217;s AI technology to automatically recognize items in images and videos and recommend similar products for users to purchase. It was a hit with users on Weibo and the video platform iQIYI, recalled serial entrepreneur Joy Tang, Markable&#8217;s founder and CEO. But content creators complained that it was diverting their followers to buy knock-offs of the products they featured. Weibo decided to drop the integration as a result. However, the experience provided a key insight for Tang —&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/markable-ai-launches-100m-ad-fund-for-creators-on-instagram-tiktok-and-other-social-platforms/">Read More</a>

Over the next decade, the region&#8217;s electricity needs could spike 30%, said Crystal Ball, executive director of the Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee (PNUCC), which aggregates regional utility data. That increase is comparable to the amount of electricity needed to power seven Seattle-sized cities. &#8220;What we have seen in the last two years is remarkable,&#8221; Ball said. &#8220;We are seeing a surge in demand for electricity that exceeds PNUCC&#8217;s previous forecasts.&#8221; On Monday, Sen.
