<p>Your laptop may already have a decent webcam. Most do. Which is why Amazon&rsquo;s Prime Day is basically a chance for vendors to unload quality webcams with a forklift.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;m not really exaggerating. The Iskovi C28 webcam is a 1080p webcam, which has become table stakes for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-4k-webcam-buying-guide.html">the best webcams for your PC</a>. But the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ISKOVI-C28-Noise-Canceling-Correction-streaming/dp/B0CRNJ96NY">Iskovi C28 is just $13.59 on Amazon</a> for Prime Day &mdash; that&rsquo;s a whopping 82 percent off. And it gets better: <em>Amazon will take an additional 8 percent off if you buy two</em>. </p>



<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s insane. What&rsquo;s even crazier is that this webcam &mdash; which, admittedly, I haven&rsquo;t reviewed &mdash; has a fairly uniform four- and

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a modern Thunderbolt dock and don&rsquo;t want to spend the usual $200 to $300, then here&rsquo;s a killer Prime Day deal for you: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-SD2480T-Thunderbolt-MacBooks-K38410NA/dp/B09ZNVR6BH/">Kensington&rsquo;s SD2480T is on sale for $60 at Amazon</a>. That&rsquo;s 67% off!</p>



<p>Yes, this is older hardware. But here&rsquo;s the deal with Thunderbolt: until the apparently delayed Thunderbolt 5 hardware rolls out next year, Thunderbolt 3 is still an up-to-date standard.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve reviewed dozens of docks for PCWorld since 2020 when the pandemic hit and Thunderbolt docks became the must-have computer peripheral. I maintain PCWorld&rsquo;s roundups for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">best Thunderbolt docks</a>, <a href="https://
