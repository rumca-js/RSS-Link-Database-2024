With the closure of Microsoft's Xbox 360 digital store looming, the company has announced a final batch of heavy discounts on earlier-gen titles, as well as the release of a new Xbox Series X/S dynamic background, inspired by the Xbox 360's much-loved "blades" dashboard design.
</p><p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-will-close-next-july">announced the impending closure of its Xbox 360 digital store</a> last August, revealing it would no longer be possible to purchase games, DLC, or other entertainment content via the Xbox 360 console or web-based Xbox 360 Marketplace from 29th July this year.
</p><p>
It did, however, confirm previously purchased Xbox 360 games and DLC would remain downloadable and playable - including via backward compatibility on modern consoles - even afte

Supermassive Games' narrative-focused single-player Dead by Daylight spin-off, The Casting of Frank Stone, launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 3rd September.
</p><p>
Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-narrative-game-the-casting-of-frank-stone-revealed">last December</a>, The Casting of Frank Stone's story begins in Cedar Hills, Oregon, in the summer of 1980, when a group of young filmmakers travels to an abandoned steel mill in order to shoot their horror movie, Murder Mill. Unbeknown to the teenagers, however, a dormant evil lies waiting, and the group ends up capturing far more on camera than it bargained for, creating a "soon-to-be cult classic with an insidious influence."

In gameplay terms, The Casting of Frank Stone follows the interactive horror movie t

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 publisher Activision has made it clear that you cannot simply toggle off its upcoming game's much-hyped new "omnimovement" feature, which lets you sprint and dive in any direction.
</p><p>
Speaking via the <a href="https://youtu.be/KMFDkQ_5m1U">official Call of Duty podcast</a>, Activision confirmed omnimovement was a permanent mechanic in the game and a "global system" across all of its modes - campaign, multiplayer and zombies. And no, there's no option to switch it off. 
</p><p>
"Can you toggle omnimovement on and off?" Activision senior director of studio communications Stephanie Snowden said. "The answer is no. Omnimovement is a core foundational mechanic of the game, you cannot turn it off. But I think where people maybe got that impression was, we have another new feature, a part of movement, called

You're on the precipice of something fresh and exciting, as you hop off the ship full of beans and raring to go. The first major city, Tuliyollal, gets the blood pumping with bombastic, big band music - kicking the bar high for the expansion's sweeping score, and thanks to the graphical overhaul, Final Fantasy 14 is the best it's ever looked. Areas feel densely populated and show-stopping zones play with verticality and scale to stunning effect; the land is vast, full of lush vegetation, and has never felt more alive.</p><p>And then: back to reality. There's nothing quite like landing in a bold and beautiful new world, only to be met with vitriol in chat, pla

Larian has detailed what Baldur's Gate 3 players can expect from the seventh patch, due out in September.
</p><p>
As previously reported, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-adds-official-modding-toolkit-this-autumn">patch will include mod support</a> and, in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4240783699885624491">new post on Steam</a>, the studio has given a brief look at what some creators have achieved in the Closed Alpha.

</p><p>
But there are other additions coming too, including a much-needed tweak to split-screen play - dynamic split-screen mode - which allows players in multiplayer to split the screen and automatically merge it back into one when near each other.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate releases on Nintendo Switch tomorrow and, as turtle-fans from an early age, Jim Trinca and I will be taking an early look at the game in two player co-op for today's live stream.</p><p>Splintered Fate has actually been available on the Apple Arcade for over a year now. It's recieved a lot of positive reviews on that platform with many of them likening its rogue-like gameplay to a multiplayer version of Hades, which sounds pretty great! But will it be worth shelling out &pound;26.99 for the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Splintered-Fate-2557953.html" target="_blank">Switch version</a> (or the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2996040/T

Modders have been hard at work since the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree, releasing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-most-popular-mods-make-shadow-of-the-erdtree-far-easier">plenty of mods to make it a little easier to complete</a>.

</p><p>
That's certainly true of this mod from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5264?tab=description">FlippantTunic22 over on Nexus Mods</a>, which replaces certain Spirit Ash summons with bosses from the DLC.
</p><p>
So far 11 bosses have been included. I won't list them all for spoiler reasons, but it does include the Divine Beast Dancing Lion and Messmer the Impaler you will have seen in the DLC's trailer - right up to the final boss.

Two months before its official launch date, footage from a fully-playable version of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is being uploaded to YouTube. 
</p><p>
The videos reportedly come from a pre-release developer build of the game, which fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1e42gx0/a_space_marine_2_build_leaked_and_is_playable/">reddit</a> say is now circulating on a popular torrent website. Several of these videos have already been pulled from YouTube by Saber Interactive copyright claims, but yet more are being uploaded.
</p><p>
Worse, perhaps, numerous people appear to have been able to download and play the game's leaked version, which reportedly includes the full campaign in a fairly polished state.

Former Speaker of the House John Bercow voices a character in the forthcoming Fallout: London mod.
</p><p>
Bercow was Speaker of the House in the UK Parliament, known for yelling "Order!" at rowdy MPs during his tenure. More recently, you may have spotted him in second season of The Traitors US.
</p><p>
Next he'll make an appearance in Fallout: London as, fittingly, a robot Speaker of the House. His inclusion means he will join the likes of Neil Newbon (Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3), Anna Demetriou (Sophia in A Plague Tale: Requiem), and two Doctor Who actors: Sylvester McCoy and Colin Baker.

## Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree's progression issues could do with a bit of Nintendo magic

I really do love Shadow of the Erdtree. I love its varied, spectacular environments. I love how its dungeons are more convincingly integrated into the world design, the map as a whole a puzzle to solve. I love the visual style, how emerging into each area is framed like a renaissance painting of a post-battle autumnal dreamscape.
</p><p>
But I have to admit, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> has a problem with progression. And it's a problem some inspiration from Nintendo could solve. After all, Elden Ring is just Breath of the Wild - Dark Souls, right? 
</p><p>
I jest. Since its release, much of the Shadow of the Erdtree discourse has focused on difficulty. And that's to be expected for a Souls game. But really, the perceived challenge is exacerbated by t
