It's time for round 2 (round 3? round 12?) of the super-heavyweight fight between King Kong and Godzilla! One is a nuclear-powered dinosaur, the other is a depressed ape...with a glove! See who wins in this week's Honest Trailer!

►►In this week's episode of Star Players, Steve-O talks about his complicated history with games, from playing Pitfall and Super Mario Bros as a child, to an Angry Birds addiction and starring in the Jackass game he's never even played.► https://youtu.be/i2s9o-tu0Bk

►►There’s powerful — and then there’s POWERFUL. In this episode of By The Numbers, we ask our AI Assistant Fanda to do 100 pushups, 100 sit-ups, and then crunch the numbers to determine the most overpowered (OP) superhero!► https://youtu.be/UVLlsUU4Ye8
