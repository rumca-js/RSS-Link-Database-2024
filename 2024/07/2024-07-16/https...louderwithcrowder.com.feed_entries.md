	Well, Trump has announced his Vice President candidate and it's J.D. Vance. And, as luck would have it, or as if I knew something like this would happen, I finished reading <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> last night.</p><p>
<em>Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of Family and Culture in Crisis</em> is a memoir of Vance's life while also serving up a slice of poor working class Americans (in this case, Appalachian hillbillies). Vance explores the American Dream when the hillbillies get ahold of it, weaving a story of the clash of economy and culture.

If JD's senate debates against career politician Rep. Tim Ryan are any indication of what's to come, nope.</p><p>The main knock on Vance is that he was a Never Trumper in 2016 and had said mean things about Trump in the past. The response to that is
