<p>Google’s secret new line of Pixel 9 phones isn’t that big of a secret anymore. Taiwan’s National Communications Commission (NCC) released new photos of the phones including the Pixel 9 Pro Fold from almost every conceivable angle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-ncc-3461263/"><em>Android Authority</em></a> found the photos in the NCC archives and uploaded galleries of each of the four phones including the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL and 9 Pro Fold. They reveal some interesting details about the new Pixel phones.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The charging rates will be a little faster than the last generation of Pixel phones: Taiwanese authorities measured 24.12W for the base model, 25.20W for the Pro and 32.67W for the 9 Pro XL. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold, however, was the slowest of all of them at 20.25W. These numbers don’t often match up perfectly with the advertised ratings, so expect Google to be promoting higher numbers at its ev

<p>A US Senate Committee led by Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has issued <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/help_committee_amazon_interim_report.pdf">a report</a> claiming nearly half of Amazon warehouse workers were injured during the week of Prime Day 2019. The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee Chairman described the company’s behavior from five years ago as “incredibly dangerous.” For its part, Amazon claims Sen. Sanders is distorting and cherry-picking facts while ignoring others to fit a narrative.</p>
<p>The report cites internal company data, including injuries Amazon isn’t required to document for OSHA, allegedly showing warehouse workers suffered nearly 45 injuries per 100 workers during the week of Prime Day 2019. Meanwhile, of the “recordable” injuries serious enough that the company has to report them to OSHA, the report claims Amazon’s were more than double the industry average —&nbsp;over 10 per 100 workers.</p>

<p>A pre-release build of <em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em> has leaked online two months before release, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/">according to reporting by <em>Insider Gaming</em></a>. This is a fully playable version that was “randomly posted on a tracker,” according to sources who have downloaded and experimented with the build. It remains unclear how the game ended up online.</p>
<p>Players have said that the game is around 75GB in size. Though this leaked build is playable, it does have some issues. There are missing strings and a bunch of placeholder assets, but the version does include server data that should allow for online play. As expected, gameplay footage has begun popping up online, but we’ll refrain from posting any so as to keep things spoiler-free. We will drop a trailer though, because the game looks neat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the world’s largest tech companies trained their AI models on a dataset that included transcripts of more than 173,000 YouTube videos without permission, a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.proofnews.org/apple-nvidia-anthropic-used-thousands-of-swiped-youtube-videos-to-train-ai/">new investigation</a> from <em>Proof News</em> has found. The dataset, which was created by a nonprofit company called EleutherAI, contains transcripts of YouTube videos from more than 48,000 channels and was used by Apple, NVIDIA and Anthropic among other companies. The findings of the investigation spotlight AI’s uncomfortable truth: the technology is largely built on the backs of data siphoned from creators without their consent or compensation.</p>
<p>The dataset doesn’t include any videos or images from YouTube, but contains video transcripts from the platform's biggest creators including Marques Brownlee and MrBeast, as well as large news publishers like <em>The New York Times</e

<p>Google reportedly offered a group of EU-based cloud firms $512 million (€470 million) as an attempt to derail an antitrust settlement with Microsoft and force the continuation of a formal complaint, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-16/google-offered-470-million-to-derail-microsoft-antitrust-pact"><ins>according to </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>. The attempt failed and the settlement went through.</p>
<p>Here’s how it went down. A non-profit trade organization called the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) issued a complaint to the EU’s antitrust arm, alleging that Microsoft made it too difficult for business customers to change providers because the software was tied to Azure cloud services.</p>

Per usual, most of these aren't any good. But if you need a new notebook, we've picked through the selection, checked price histories and rounded up the Prime Day laptop deals that might actually be worth your attention below.</p> 
<p>In general, Amazon isn't the best place to go laptop shopping, as it doesn't let you precisely spec out your machine. Most of the time, it's easier to buy directly from a manufacturer. That said, the sale has brought a handful of MacBooks, gaming laptops and other <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html">notebooks we recommend</a> down to their lowest prices to date.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>OnePlus just held a press event and introduced a trio of new gadgets. There’s an upgraded tablet, new earbuds and a smartwatch. The OnePlus Pad 2 is a refresh of last year’s model, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-pad-review-solid-hardware-thats-let-down-by-android-130039695.html"><ins>which we mostly enjoyed</ins></a>, so let’s start there.</p>
<p>The Pad 2 is an upgrade over the previous iteration in nearly every way. There’s a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and a 12.1-inch screen with 3K resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate. The company also promises “stronger audio output” which is always nice, as the primary use for many tablets is consuming content. OnePlus even says that this sound system can emulate spatial audio.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day</a> is underway, and the sale includes a small handful of discounts on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html">laptops we recommend</a>. To be frank, the selection isn’t that great: Most of the notebooks advertised in the sale are either old or just not worthwhile, and Amazon doesn’t let you precisely spec out your machine either way. In many cases, buying directly from a manufacturer will be easier. That said, there are a few good prices on MacBooks and gaming laptops we like. Here are the best Prime Day laptop deals we can find.</p> 
<p>Remember that you’ll need to be a Prime member to see most Prime Day deals. The sale itself runs through July 17, and we’ll update this guide with more discounts as we find them.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>It's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day</a>, which means you can grab a bunch of its devices at a discount, including the basic Kindle e-reader released in 2022. The device is currently on sale for $85, which is $15 less than retail for what we consider as one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ereader-130013808.html">best e-readers of 2024</a>, even though it was launched two years ago.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day 2024</a> is a great opportunity to beef up your home theater system and avoid relying solely on your TV's (probably paltry) built-in speakers. Sonos makes some of the best smart speakers around and several of them are on sale during the event. For instance, the Sonos Ray soundbar has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwQjJLUFBRSzE_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLXYtMTAyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkNDFiZjFlZi1jMDNjLTQ2YzctYmJlOS04MThhZDg4ODA3NzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASVcZIoRbgYzKLNwvV3koGaZITw91_WlNmMmOPvu9Pdd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B2KPPQK1">dropped to $219</a>, which is 22 percent off the regular price of $279.</

<p>Amazon is known for its discounts, so it’s odd that its own Kindle ereaders don’t go on sale all that often. Prime Day <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">events</a> are one notable exception, and this year is no different.

<p>While you can often find discounts on Echo speakers, Fire tablets, Kindles and other Amazon devices throughout the year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day</a> is the best time to buy them, period. The online retailer usually discounts most of its own hardware for its special, members-only shopping event in the summer, and those discounted prices are typically only rivaled by Black Friday sales.</p> 
<p>In recent years, Prime Day discounts on these gadgets have even been better than those we’ve seen during the holiday shopping season. For Amazon Prime Day 2024, you’ll find most of Amazon’s devices on sale for record-low prices (or close to them). These are the best Prime Day deals you can get on Kindles, Fire TVs, Echos and more.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
