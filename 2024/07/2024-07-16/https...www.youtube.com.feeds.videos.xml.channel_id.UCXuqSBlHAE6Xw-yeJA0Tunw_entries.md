Did you know you can buy gamer gear at the local Home Depot? Although Team Green and Team Red might be referring to Ryobi and Milwaukee within the walls of the depot, they DO carry all the accessories from RGB keyboards to desks to webcams. The quality, however, will leave you needing to make another trip back just to patch the holes in these shoddily made products. More like Home Depoo, amirite.
