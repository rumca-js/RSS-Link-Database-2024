<p>A behind-the-scenes tease gives some new details on what we might get from the much-anticipated final episodes</p><p>First, the bad news. Despite the last part of the most recent season coming out more than two years ago, the fifth and final season of Stranger Things won’t be out this year. The culmination to Netflix’s most iconic show won’t be seen until some point in mid to late 2025, presumably by which point all the cute kids we fell in love with back in 2016 will have beer bellies, five o’clock shadows and repeat prescriptions for osteoporosis medication.</p><p>The better news is that Stranger Things has started to sense our impatience, which is why it has begun to dribble out information about the final season. A two-minute behind the scenes featurette dropped online on Monday, revealing that filming for season five is about halfway completed. Concrete details about what we can expect to see are remarkably thin on the ground – the video’s dialogue is almost exclusively limite

So you go on all these adventures, and meet all these different characters, but at the end of the day, you’re really just trying to get that potato for your grandma’s soup.”</p><p>As video game quests go, this is fabulously mundane and makes a refreshing change from rescuing princesses in castles and saving lands in peril. However you soon realise there is more to it all than just lost spuds. “There’s this other layer to the story, and that’s what the game is really about,” says Castañ

His staff have been visiting the team behind the <a href="https://citizensassembly.ie/">Irish citizens’ assembly</a>, which created new political mandates on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.

<p>This enthralling, cinematic study of the occupation and recapture of the French capital reads like an epic thriller</p><p>Amid the sunshine and wild celebrations of Friday 25 August 1944, the day the Germans surrendered control of Paris, Charles de Gaulle declared the city to have been “liberated by itself”, with “the help and assistance of the whole of France”. The truth was not quite so noble. De Gaulle sought to embody “the whole of France”, but it had been a fractured nation, subject to regular violent upheavals, ever since 1789. Its army had crumbled before Hitler in 1940, and the reconstituted French force that triumphantly entered Paris in 1944 comprised one armoured division entirely equipped by, and under the operational command of, the US.</p><p>If any one person saved Paris, it was Dwight D Eisenhower, allied commander, who acceded to de Gaulle’s lobbying – Ike being one of the few people who found the prickly General endearing – and agreed to march on the city.

It unfolds in an indulgent, dreamy summer haze, halfway between rapture and torpor; a murmuring indie-stonewash of good taste.</p><p>The performances are strong, but the writing is such that the characters’ passions, fears and grievances are in some way veiled; yet there is subtlety and indirectness in this.

<p>For children with ADHD, getting the help they need depends on being correctly diagnosed. As a doctor, I have seen how tricky and frustrating a process that can be</p><p>Late last summer, in the waiting room of a children’s mental health clinic, I found Daniel, a softly spoken 16-year-old boy, flanked by his parents. He had been referred to the clinic for an assessment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). As we took our seats on the plastic sofas in the consulting room, I asked him to tell me about the difficulties he was having. Tentatively, his gaze not leaving the floor, he started talking about school, about how he was finding it impossible to focus and would daydream for hours at a time. His exam results were beginning to show it too, his parents explained, and ADHD seemed to run in the family. They wanted to know more about any medication that could help.</p><p>I had just begun a six-month placement working as a junior doctor in the clinic’s ADHD team. Doctors

<p>It doesn’t get more morally wrong than losing a parent and immediately being made homeless, but surprising numbers of young people are affected. It is time to end this gross injustice</p><p>In 2022 I was contacted by a friend of a friend – let’s call her Tiana – who was distraught. Her mum had become sick a few months earlier, so Tiana, who was her mum’s only child, had moved out of her own house and into her mum’s flat in Wandsworth, south London, to care for her. Then, in March 2022, her mum died suddenly. Before Tiana even had the chance to arrange her funeral, she received an eviction notice from Wandsworth council, giving her only a few days to move out. Her mum had lived there for 20 years. Tiana asked them for a two-week extension on compassionate grounds, to give her time to sort through her mum’s stuff and figure out where she was going to live. They wouldn’t give it to her.</p><p>I met Tiana at the top-floor flat a week after her mum’s funeral. The council had told her sh
