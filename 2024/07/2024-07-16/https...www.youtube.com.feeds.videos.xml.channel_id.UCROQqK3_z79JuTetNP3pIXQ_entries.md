Marketing movies has never seemed harder. From Hot Ones to the Buzzfeed-ification of everything, I go over it all here. From the success of the Super Mario Brothers movie, to the failure of Madame Web. Will Smith, Florence Pugh, Harrison Ford, they're all expected to participate in a lot of gimmicky marketing. How do we feel about that and what does it mean for the film industry.
