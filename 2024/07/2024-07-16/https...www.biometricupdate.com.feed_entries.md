		In today's smartphone market, almost every new device comes equipped with some form of biometric authentication for enhanced security. While contactless fingerprint biometrics have been in use for some time, there is a growing concern about the susceptibility of smartphone-based fingerprint biometric systems to morphing attacks.

A research team from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology has put forward a method to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-66790-8">generate morphing attacks</a> on “fingerphoto” biometrics captured using smartphones. They have developed three distinct algorithms for generating morphing attacks at the image level, allowing them to create morphed fingerprint images with minimal distortions.

The research uses tw
