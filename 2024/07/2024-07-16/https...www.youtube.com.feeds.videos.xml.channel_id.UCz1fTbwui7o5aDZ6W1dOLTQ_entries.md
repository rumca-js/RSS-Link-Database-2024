Star Wars the Acolyte is an "all you can eat buffet" of cringe. This time Mae and Osha and the Sol brothers finally meet as Mae pursues her next target. The episode hits a few of the typical "current year" writing tropes but few other shows, molded from the Disney cringe, has done something so hideously silly as this episode. Imagine if a stupid, off-the-cuff, Marvel joke became the catalyst for an entire series.
