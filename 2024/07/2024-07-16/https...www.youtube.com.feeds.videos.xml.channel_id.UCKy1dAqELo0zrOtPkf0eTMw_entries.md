In today's Daily Fix:
Just in time for Prime Day, Amazon is selling a bundle with everything you need to start playing Xbox games, and that includes NOT including a console. The bundle includes an Xbox controller (in a variety of colors), an Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max, and a month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate—a savings for $40.99 if all those are purchased separately. Recently Microsoft announced a new Xbox app for the Fire TV specifically for playing games over the cloud, and this bundle definitely reinforces the "console-less" gaming future. Speaking of Xbox, July's Game Pass Wave 2 games have been announced, and you're getting Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Magical Delicacy, and Flock. If you Game Pass Ultimate or EA Play, you get access to EA Sports College Football 25 for 10 hours. And finally, Larian has revealed patch notes for the latest Baldur's Gate 3 update.

When you’re working on a show about gladiators and the Roman Empire, you tend to think about the Roman Empire a lot. But before the actors were cast in the new gladiator drama “Those About to Die”, we asked them “How Often Do You Think of the Roman Empire?” and “What is Your Roman Empire?” 

Roland Emmerich’s new gladiator series, “Those About to Die” (starring Anthony Hopkins), is a brand new epic series that explores the Roman Empire in 79 CE.  Streaming on Peacock (NBC) and inspired by the same book as “Gladiator”, “Those About to Die” delves into the life of the Flavian Dynasty, the Gladiator, the Chariot Races, the Patricians, and the Underbelly. From Gladiator 2 gladiator and chariot race to chariot race we discover how the bloody arena fueled the Roman Empire and the introduction of the new Flavian Amphitheatre or as we know it today, the Colosseum. 

“Those About to Die” premieres July 18 on Peacock.

“Those About to Die” cast includes:
Anthony Hopkins as Emperor Vespasian

It’s a big moment for Marvel fans everywhere. The Merc With a Mouth is finally making the jump into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Deadpool & Wolverine, the third film in the mutant anti-hero’s solo franchise. As the only MCU movie releasing in theaters this year, the first proper crossover between the two titular main characters (no, we’re not counting Weapon XI in X-Men Origins: Wolverine) is practically guaranteed to make a big splash at the box office. Between record-breaking pre-ticket sales and the many multiversal cameos of fan-favorite characters that are expected, the movie is set to be a major shot in the arm for the MCU. 

Marvel is clearly banking hard on the return of Hugh Jackman’s Logan being a big draw for audiences. Ryan Reynolds has even made a point of saying on the press tour that “no one can do it except him” in regards to Jackman portraying the character. But if Deadpool 3 uses the multiverse to bring over even more of the Fox X-Men versions of characters int

In today's Daily Fix:
Last week Microsoft announced the latest price hike in their popular Game Pass subscription service, but don't expect that to be the last jump in fees. According to industry analysts, it was inevitable, considering overall inflation, slowing consumer adoption, and other factors. In fact, depending how how the overall market goes over the next few years, we might see more hikes. But don't fret, Xbox fans, analysts believe Game Pass will ultimately be successful, as Xbox integrates it even more fully into their strategy. In other news, the fan-made Fallout London mod has cast the voice actor for the game's robotic Speaker of the House...and it's voiced by an actual Speaker of the House: John Bercow, who served as Speaker in British Parliament from 2009 to 2019. And finally, a former Crash Bandicoot developer revealed that a Crash 5 was in the works—emphasis on 'was.'

Late last year, we heard Netflix was working with both Skydance and Production I.G on a new animated series based on Terminator - now, we can finally see it in action in this trailer. And not only is the release date pretty soon, it’s also a nice in-universe reference.August 29th, as any T2 fan can tell you is the date Skynet launched the nukes that became known as Judgment Day. Of course, that Judgment Day took place in 1997, so it’s technically the 27th anniversary of the Judgment Day that was hypothetically prevented in that timeline . Anyway, In the animated series, we’ll be introduced to a slew of new characters, including one Malcolm Lee, who apparently is a scientist working to launch an A.I. to rival Skynet’s impending attack on humanity. The series will jump from 2022 to 1997, the future events and those that took place in the past. #NetflixAnime
