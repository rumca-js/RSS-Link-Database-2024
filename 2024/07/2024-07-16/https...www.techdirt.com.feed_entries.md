ShotSpotter may be making the most headlines (and losing the most large contracts), but it has competitors in the field of gunshot detection. But, according to this report by Todd Feathers for Wired, its closest competitor isn&#8217;t any better than the current market leader. In February 2023, San Jose began piloting AI-powered gunshot detection technology [&#8230;]

The RIAA just won’t quit in attacking users on the internet and trying to get them banned from using the internet entirely. The latest news is that all the major record labels have sued Verizon for not kicking users the RIAA accuses (but has not litigated) of being infringers off the internet. But, there’s a [&#8230;]

I can&#8217;t even imagine what it must be like to fight an obviously bogus lawsuit for most of a decade. That&#8217;s what activist DeRay Mckesson has been dealing with since 2017. Mckesson participated in a protest in Baton Rouge, Louisiana all the way back in July 2016. At that protest, Officer John Ford (previously known [&#8230;]

I supposed the court had no choice, but I&#8217;m always a little wary when the Fifth Circuit decides to take another look at some litigation, especially when it involves certain amendments like the First. Or the Fourth. This case, however, is a mess. It began (as far too many do these days) with a supposedly [&#8230;]

Hey, remember when the FCC tried to implement some really basic consumer privacy protections for wireless and broadband but AT&#38;T convinced GOP Senators to kill those efforts before they could even take effect?

Far too many law enforcement officers believe the best way to deal with suicidal people is to kill them. That&#8217;s the case here with Washington County Deputy Brian Krook.
