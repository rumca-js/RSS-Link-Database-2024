Especially when things are going well — and at Tomo, they really are,&#8221; Armstrong wrote in a LinkedIn post about her departure. &#8220;And yet, sometimes, it’s exactly what you should do.&#8221; Armstrong said she&#8217;ll remain a board director of Tomo. She helped launch Tomo in 2020 with Greg Schwartz, another former Zillow exec who remains CEO. Tomo&#8217;s initial focus was on a tech-fueled mortgage and transaction platform&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/tech-moves-tomo-co-founder-steps-down-usermind-co-founder-joins-ironclad-ex-google-director-joins-microsoft/">Read

The chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway told WSJ last week that nearly all of his massive wealth will go to a newly created trust overseen by his three children. Buffett currently owns approximately $130 billion of Berkshire stock. It&#8217;s unclear how the trust will allocate the funds. Each of his children also run their own independent foundations. From 2006 to 2023, the Seattle-based Gates Foundation received $39.3&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/warren-buffett-says-no-money-going-to-gates-foundation-after-his-death/">Read More</a>

The thefts are particularly painful for drivers who lack home chargers and are left scrambling to find a way to juice up their vehicles. Each damaged charger can cost thousands of dollars to repair. “It’s a serious and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-area-ev-drivers-left-searching-for-fast-chargers-due-to-epidemic-of-cable-theft/">Read More</a>
