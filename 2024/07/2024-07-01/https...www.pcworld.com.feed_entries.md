<p>A Thunderbolt 5 cable has finally appeared, even before Thunderbolt 5 docks have begun shipping. Cable Matters is now advertising several &ldquo;Intel Certified&rdquo; Thunderbolt 5 cables capable of 120Gbps&mdash;but only one is worth buying, eventually.</p>



<p>Cable Matters is selling <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP8K1C59&amp;xcust=2-1-2382640-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Thunderbolt 5 cables at Amazon for $32.99 apiece</a>, with a 10 percent discount coupon on top of that. That nabs you a 3.3-foot cable, which is probably the ideal length.

<p>AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen X3D processors, with their special sauce V-Cache for boosting gaming performance, are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524570/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-review-v-cache.html">all the rage in the custom-built desktop space</a>. But what if you want some of that power in a machine that fits in a backpack? Then you might want to check out the MSI Titan 18 Pro, packing a Ryzen 9 7945HX3D processor.</p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first laptop to be equipped with an AMD X3D processor&mdash;that honor goes to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2007902/amd-ryzen-9-7945hx3d-3d-v-cache-to-gaming-laptops.html">Asus ROG Strix Scar 17 from last year</a> with the same chip&mdash;but as a close second, the Titan 18 Pro is compelling.

<p>When looking for a top-notch VPN, the two most important things to look for are privacy and speed. While privacy is crucial to a good VPN, speed should not be overlooked. Faster speeds mean quicker file downloads and website load times, a better streaming experience, and just a better all-around experience.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve tested numerous VPNs and put their servers from all over the world through countless speed tests to determine the fastest services based on their network averages. I highlight not only the fastest download speeds, but also the fastest upload speeds. Read below to see PCWorld&rsquo;s curated list of the fastest VPNs available now.</p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust me:</strong> Here at PCWorld we&rsquo;ve been testing computer hardware, software, and services since the 1980s. I&rsquo;m continually testing all of the major VPNs on the ma
