<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 01 July 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01943-8">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01943-8</a></p>The voltage penalty driving water dissociation at high current density is a challenge for bipolar-membrane-based energy devices. Materials descriptors such as electrical conductivity, microscopic surface area and surface-hydroxyl coverage are now shown to control water dissociation kinetics in these membranes.
