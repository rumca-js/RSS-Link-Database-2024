<p>Midjourney, a popular AI-powered image generator, is creating images of Donald Trump and Joe Biden <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ai-image-generator-midjourney-blocks-images-of-biden-and-trump-as-election-looms">despite saying</a> that it would block users from doing so earlier this year ahead of the upcoming US presidential election.</p>
<p>When Engadget prompted the service to create an image of “the president of the United States,” Midjourney generated four images in various styles of former president Donald Trump.</p>

<p>YouTube quietly <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7671399?hl=en">added</a> a new policy last month that lets you request the removal of AI-generated content featuring your likeness. The new privacy violation policy, first <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/01/youtube-now-lets-you-request-removal-of-ai-generated-content-that-simulates-your-face-or-voice/">spotted by</a> <em>TechCrunch</em>’s Sarah Perez, allows you to flag videos that “used AI to alter or create synthetic content that looks or sounds like you.”</p>
<p>YouTube says several factors will determine whether it considers a removal, including whether the content is altered or synthetic (and whether it’s disclosed as such), easily identifiable as the person in question or realistic.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company will also weigh whether it could be considered a parody or satire. Another factor is whether it includes a public

<p>Alternate video game endings are always fun to see. If a talented modder remakes an alternate ending previously scrapped by the game’s developer, it’s even better. Someone did just that, putting together an alternate ending for <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt </em>using footage that was originally discarded by CD Projekt Red.</p>
<p>YouTuber xLetalis shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3GMtR7U_hI">video</a> detailing the restorations that modder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoSPKfadbmawD0zH13mxLnA">Glassfish</a> added to <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> after the end of the game’s original storyline. (Note that some spoilers for the game follow!) The game ends with Geralt being pulled out of his fight with Eredin by Yennefer, his potential partner and sorceress. However, the remade cutscene shows Geralt waking up in a tent and receiving care from two doctors making a bet on his survival rate. From there, he leaves the hospital and talks to Yennefer, whose

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day 2024</a> is officially a couple of weeks away now but we’re already starting to see early Prime Day deals pop up.

Most early Prime Day deals are exactly that — early discounts that only Prime members can access — but every once in a while there are some discounts available to all. We’ve collected the best early Prime Day deals here, along with the rest of the best discounts on our favorite gadgets that anyone can get from Amazon right now. We’ll be updating this post regularly, so check back to see the latest discounts.</p>

<p>The new <em>Lovestruck</em> expansion pack for <em>The Sims 4</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/lovestruck-expansion-pack">gives</a> the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-05-06-the-sims-4-announced-for-2014-on-pc-mac.html">decade-old</a> sequel a shot of life by turning it into a full-fledged dating sim — including non-monogamous WooHoo-ing for the first time. In addition to polyamory, the $40 DLC adds an in-game dating app, an encounter-planning system, turn-ons and turn-offs and a swanky singles club where Leisure Suit Larry (apologies for the dated reference) would feel right at home.</p>
<p>The expansion pack takes your Sim to Ciudad Enamorada, “a gorgeous city in love and the perfect place for all of your romantic encounters.” It includes three neighborhoods for all the dangerous (if you’re into that) liaisons your Sim’s gibberish-speaking heart can handle.</p>

<p>Meta is updating its “Made with AI” labels after widespread complaints from photographers that the company was mistakenly flagging non-AI-generated content.

<p>Welcome to the first day of July. Summer is here in earnest, but let me keep you, briefly, indoors with tales of finalized rules for crypto in the US, and how Lego is making bricks from stardust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new rule finalized by the US Treasury Department will ensure that people that dipped their toes into crypto (and crypto trading) are paying the proper amount on their sales. The new rule will require cryptocurrency platforms like exchanges and payment processors to report their users' transactions to the IRS. Brokers will have to start reporting sales proceeds on digital assets in 2026 for all transactions accomplished in 2025, which means crypto traders are still on their own for now.</p>
<p>The rule will make easier for people to declare their earnings because their brokers will now <em>have</em> to provide them with a 1099 form. The form has a threshold of $10,000 to report on transactions involving stablecoin, which are cryptocurrencies that track fiat money like the US

<p>The best Wi-Fi range extenders do what they say on the box - extend your home’s Wi-Fi signal, eliminating dead spots around your home. With so many of us working from home, it’s important that your wireless network is robust, and that means being able to get a Wi-Fi signal in all areas of your home, including your basement or backyard. You don’t necessarily need to invest in a new wireless router or modem either, since Wi-Fi extenders connect to your existing home network and are often quite affordable. We tested out a number of Wi-Fi extenders to find out which are actually worth your money.
