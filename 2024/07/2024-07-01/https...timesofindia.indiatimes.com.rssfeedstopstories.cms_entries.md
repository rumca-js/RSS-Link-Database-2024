Despite an 11% shortfall in June, the Indian monsoon is expected to conclude above normal, according to IMD. Historically, when June rainfall was below normal, subsequent months often saw normal or above normal rainfall. IMD predicts relief from high temperatures in northwest India due to anticipated good rainfall in July. However, the region faced unusually high temperatures in June. The summer of 2023 marked the highest number of heat wave days since 2010, with June alone witnessing the highest in 15 years.

A UN panel determined that former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan's detention is arbitrary and violates international law, calling for his immediate release and compensation. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention highlighted that Khan's imprisonment lacks legal basis and appears politically motivated to disqualify him from political office. Despite being cleared for release before Pakistan's general elections, Khan remains detained. His party, PTI, celebrated the ruling as proof of his innocence and unlawful imprisonment.

The US Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that former President Trump has “absolute” immunity for official acts, raising concerns about an imperial presidency. The decision, split along conservative-liberal lines, sends Trump’s election interference case back to lower courts, likely delaying it until after the 2024 election. If Trump wins, he can quash the case; if Biden wins, he might gain similar powers. The ruling could reshape presidential immunity, with critics arguing it undermines the principle that no one is above the law.
