<p>Last Updated on July 2, 2024 Welcome to issue #39 of Grimdark Magazine! Grimdark is a state of mind; it is a style of storytelling that finds a home in just about every genre.

Abandoned on the streets of a New York City decimated by monsters, Kierse is a skilled thief with a reckless streak. A robbery gone awry draws the attention of handsome, broody warlock Graves. Intrigued by Kierse’s apparent ability to evade his magical home security system, Graves hires her to steal a powerful spear from the vampire king of the monster underworld at a Winter Solstice party. As the solstice approaches and Kierse and Graves grow closer, his true motivations and Kierse’s true heritage are brought to light, both of which are intimately bound up in the thread of Celtic mythology that runs throughout the book. Slow to start, The Wren in the Holly Library gathers speed as i
