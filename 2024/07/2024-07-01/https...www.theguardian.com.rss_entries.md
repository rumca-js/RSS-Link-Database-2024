<p>Apology accepted.

Events that take place purely because people expect events to take place. Hours of planning for each one. A venue to be booked. Activists to be bussed in to provide local colour. All of whom will become part of the background so we could be almost anywhere. The meta tipping into the surreal. Events that will be forgotten even before they are over. Unlikely to make much more than a 20-second clip on the rolling news channels.</p><p>But elections abhor a vacuum. Without a daily stream of events, the politicians would be lost. Lose their sense of purpose. Just imagine if none of the broadcasters turned up. It would throw everyone into a deeper than usual existential crisis. The crumbling of the fragile ego.

<p>A middle-aged woman’s has a giddy fling in Monia Chokri’s latest film – at first all is roses, but then moral murkiness creeps in</p><p>Middle-aged women enjoying torrid flings were treated with solemnity in Claire Denis’s Both Sides of the Blade and Harry Wootliff’s True Things. The Québécois actor-director Monia Chokri takes a gentler, livelier tack in her third movie and first as solo screenwriter. It kicks off at a choppily edited dinner-party where a gaggle of erudite pals are bantering about the end of the world (“We’re in extinction denial”), then narrows the focus to one couple. Sophia (Magalie Lépine-Blondeau), a philosophy professor whose lectures amount to little more than listing quotes about love from the likes of Schopenhauer, Spinoza and Plato, is a decade into her cosy, unchallenging relationship with Xavier (Francis-William Rhéaume).

<p>Ollie West is superb as a sensitive misfit who inadvertently causes a terrible tragedy in this atmospheric family drama </p><p>Beautiful West Cork is photographed like a crime scene, chilly and sinister, in this atmospheric family drama about grief and guilt, and the life-changing burden of causing a terrible tragedy. In his first acting role Ollie West is superb as Kevin, a sensitive, moody teenager with chipped black nail varnish. Kevin is constantly in trouble; he’s nothing like his army veteran dad (David O’Hara), or popular big brother Robbie (Éanna Hardwicke), whose easy smile wins him the girl they both like. Kevin feels like an outsider in his family; partly the problem is that he reminds everyone of his mum, an artist who died in circumstances that make her unmentionable in their house.</p><p>The family is already bewildered by grief. Then, at around the 30-minute mark, something happens: Kevin inadvertently causes a tragedy so awful that you wonder how it’s possible to ca

The shelves are stacked with sepia-tinged bric-a-brac, ancient relics like a rotary dial telephone, which the children are encouraged to explore and touch. “It’s a compass!

Somehow this 1969 classic, courtesy of Sly and the Family Stone, sonically captures the exact patina of summer, making it a quintessential part of the seasonal canon. Written and produced by Sly himself (with him and the entire group exuberantly taking on vocal duties), the funk jam scoops a lot into its brisk two and a half minutes. Kicking off with that unmistakable piano riff, it then starkly transitions into its main melody which boasts iconic horns that double as a bugle call for the season. “Hi, hi, hi, hi there” we hear, a breezy greeting mimicking summer’s laidback sensibilities. It’s a mood that later extends into scat-inspired lyrics like, “Boop-boop-boop-boop when I want to.” Despite being released over a half-century ago, Hot Fun in the Sum

<p>Juan Ignacio Fernández Hoppe’s documentary tries to pin down a true record of the father he lost aged eight, but the struggle to find it is what compels attention</p><p>What are the pieces that make up a life? This thorny question lies at the heart of Juan Ignacio Fernández Hoppe’s riveting, emotional documentary, whose structure resembles a detective story. When Hoppe was only eight years old, his father Juan José Fernández died on a lonely beach in the Uruguayan resort town of Salinas. Along with the official authorities, Hoppe’s psychologist mother accepted the cause of death to be drowning, but the film-maker himself has his doubts.</p><p>While this death might have been the jumping-off point, Hoppe’s inquiry fascinatingly expands, as it takes in the years that led up to that one fateful night. Against a white background, objects once owned by Hoppe’s father resurface in the film’s opening scenes, their presentation echoing the scene of an archaeological excavation. A rusty key

<p>A new season of films celebrates how different directors have found a way to bring Shakespeare’s work forward, from Baz Luhrmann to Derek Jarman</p><p>What is the Shakespeare canon if not the ideal treasure trove of IP? Truancy laws mandate that students develop at the very least a passing familiarity with Romeo and Juliet, the highest-brow pop culture artifact nonetheless considered universally common knowledge, and the themes isolated in those lesson plans can be easily mapped onto present-day scenarios: the heedless forbidden passions of Romeo and Juliet, the topsy-turvy crushes of Twelfth Night, the power struggles of Hamlet, Macbeth, and Lear. Best of all, as far as Hollywood types are concerned, it’s all open-source mythology in the public domain, the sweet spot of brand recognition nobody has to pay for.</p><p>And yet since the decline of the studio system’s golden age, there hasn’t been much of an effort to make uppermost-tier blockbusters out of the stories themselves, the

Now she spends four months each winter volunteering on the border, helping migrants who are battling the odds</p><p>When travel resumed after the first pandemic lockdown in 2020, Fiona Burke, who was 60, boarded a plane to Austin, Texas. She was one of the first post-Covid volunteers to arrive at a migrant centre for people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the US-Mexico border. “Stuck at home during lockdown and seeing images of children in cages, I felt compelled to help,” says Burke.</p><p>This idea of helping others, she believes, was drilled into her from a young age, growing up in Ireland and attending a Catholic school. “I am not a practising Catholic and have rebelled against the church in many ways but the nuns had a very big influence on me, subliminally. I always wanted to help people and we were fed that message a lot,” she says. This idea informed Burke’s first career

<p>Authors reassess the legacy of the father of psychotherapy in a lovely grab bag of essays</p><p>Spare a thought for Ida Bauer. The 17-year-old came to Freud’s consulting room with a host of symptoms – fainting fits, pains, hoarse cough, breathlessness. She told Freud her dad’s friend Herr K had tried to seduce her from the age of 13. Possibly K’s advances, for which she once understandably slapped him, were erotic payback for her father having an affair with Herr K’s wife.</p><p>Freud disagreed, arguing that, really, she wanted to be seduced by Herr K – and by her therapist too. Unsurprisingly, she terminated Freud’s therapy after three months. “Talk about unexamined projection!” writes the cartoonist and editor Sarah Boxer in the first essay in this often droll and always engaging collection, arguing that his treatment of Ida was: “Ground zero for ‘No means yes.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jul/01/on-the-couch-writers-analyze-sigmund-freud-review-t
