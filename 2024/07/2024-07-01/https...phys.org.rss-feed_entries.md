High in the summer sky, the constellation Hercules acts as a centerpiece for late-night stargazers. At the center of Hercules is the "Keystone," a near-perfect square shape between the bright stars Vega and Arcturus that is easy to recognize and can serve as a guidepost for some amazing sights. While not the brightest stars, the shape of the hero's torso, like a smaller Orion, is nearly directly overhead after sunset. Along the edge of this square, you can find a most magnificent jewel—the Great Globular Cluster of Hercules, also known as Messier 13.

Evaluation is an essential part of the learning process, as it helps to determine whether students have truly grasped the concepts being taught. The item difficulty index (the difficulty level of items or questions) plays a key role in evaluation and represents the ratio of the number of students who chose the correct response to the total number of students who responded to each question. This index can therefore provide a general measure of the difficulty level of tests. Furthermore, the ability of educators to create items and predict their difficulty indices significantly affects the evaluation process.

In 2023, around 16 billion liters of biodiesel and HVO diesel were produced in the European Union, based on maize, rapeseed, or partially on waste materials from agricultural production. A by-product of biodiesel production is glycerol, which can be used as a building block for the production of valuable chemicals such as dihydroxyacetone, formic acid, glyceraldehyde and glycolaldehyde via a glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). Glycerol can be oxidized electrochemically in (photo)electrochemical (PEC) reactors, which are currently being developed specifically for the production of green hydrogen.

Due to the difficulty of directly observing root dynamics, quantifying fine root lifespan can be challenging. Many factors may concurrently regulate fine root lifespan, but the relative importance of these controlling factors is not fully understood.

Domesticated animals play a prominent role in our society, with two-thirds of American families enjoying the companionship of pets and many others relying on animal products for their nutritional needs. But the process of domestication remains a bit of a mystery. Convincing wild animals they are safe enough to coexist and mate in enclosures and in close proximity to humans and other animals is no small feat. What does it take behaviorally and genetically for that to happen?

Even if two molecules have the exact same chemical formula and the same number and types of bonds, their three-dimensional arrangements can still be different. While some people might mistakenly disregard this as a minor detail, even simple changes in the position or orientation of a functional group can dramatically affect the biological properties of a molecule, sometimes rendering an otherwise benign substance into a highly toxic one. Thus, the study of such possible molecular variants, called "geometric isomers," is essential in the field of drug development.

Understanding the dynamics of rainfall-runoff in mountainous terrains is vital for refining predictions of sediment-related hazards, which are becoming increasingly critical under the influence of climate change. Despite extensive flood monitoring in various mountainous locales globally, comprehensive data from areas characterized by high-relief have been limited primarily to smaller watersheds, typically under 1 km2, featuring moderate river discharges. Meso-scale watersheds, spanning approximately 1–10 km2 and noted for their steep gradients and substantial sediment and water flows, present substantial data collection challenges.

What if we could find a way to make electric currents flow, without energy loss? A promising approach for this involves using materials known as topological insulators. They are known to exist in one (wire), two (sheet) and three (cube) dimensions; all with different possible applications in electronic devices.

If you've ever snacked on raisins or enjoyed a glass of wine, you may, in part, have the extinction of the dinosaurs to thank for it. In a discovery described in the journal Nature Plants, researchers found fossil grape seeds that range from 60 to 19 million years old in Colombia, Panama, and Perú. One of these species represents the earliest known example of plants from the grape family in the Western Hemisphere. These fossil seeds help show how the grape family spread in the years following the death of the dinosaurs.
