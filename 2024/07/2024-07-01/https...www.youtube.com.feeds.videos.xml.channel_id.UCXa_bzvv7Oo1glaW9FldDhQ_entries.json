Its pricing may leave some a little miffed, especially given the lack of additional content or bonus goodies in this remaster, but for those who never played the original or returning fans who want to re-experience it, Luigi\u2019s Mansion 2 HD is easy to recommend.", "id": 800842, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArAndsn4TrY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ArAndsn4TrY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-01T15:30:08+00:00", "description": "FromSoftware has gone above and beyond in terms of stuffing Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree full of content.
