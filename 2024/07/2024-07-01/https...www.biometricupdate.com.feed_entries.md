		New developments have emerged about some business moguls who have been cited as being involved in a procurement scandal for biometric voting equipment which cost the government around $40 million in Zimbabwe. The country held its <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/zimbabwe-endures-exercises-campaigns-and-processes-for-biometric-voter-registration">first mobile biometric registration campaign</a> last year ahead of general elections.

Some of the actors involved in the corrupt tender issued by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) have been facing trial for alleged dirty dealings. They include Moses Mpofu, Wicknell Chivayo, Mike Chimombe and Pedzai Sakupwanya, all of them business magnets.

		Uganda’s Minister of Information, Communications Technology and National Guidance, Chris Baryomunsi, has warned that the practice of money lenders asking for the national ID cards of borrowers as collateral is illegal and must be discontinued forthwith.

This is the second time the government is sending out this warning in a little over a year. The police <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/uganda-new-id-plans-reportedly-stalled-3m-current-cards-unclaimed">made a similar call</a> in April last year.

The communication minister briefed the press on this issue recently in Kampala, according to <a href="https://x.com/UgandaMediaCent/status/1806608442058055973">an X Thread</a> by the Uganda Media Center, the government’s official communications platform.

		Australia’s digital ID has made “real progress” in the last few months but the federal government is still unable to give a timeline of when the upcoming ID credentials will be integrated into the country’s government services app myGov, according to Australian Minister for Government Services Bill Shorten.

The government is planning to make the app a one-stop shop for government services, says Shorten. Many Australians already using the myGov app with their Medicare card.

Last Friday, the Minister announced that veteran's cards will also be available in the myGov app. The move will allow the country’s 300,000 veterans to access services, lodge claims and get bills paid for home care and support.

		After more than a decade of waiting, Gabonese will now be able to apply for and obtain a national digital ID card. The identity credential, known officially as the National Electronic Identity Card (CNIE), was launched last week in a ceremony presided at by the country’s military leader, Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema.

The last time national ID cards were issued to Gabonese was in 2013. Since then, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/gabon-hopes-to-deliver-on-its-lingering-national-id-card-promise-this-year">the government has made several attempts</a> to restart the process to no avail.

		The United Kingdom Home Office has issued a tender for a new national facial recognition software for policing amid increasing use of the technology by the country’s law enforcement agencies.

		Swedish government agencies are facing legal barriers related to biometric data as well as a lack of skills and technical resources to prevent crimes related to identity – including benefit fraud and giving out residence permits to migrants who may not be entitled to one.

The conclusion was reached by the Swedish National Audit Office (NAO) after examining the work of multiple government agencies in areas such as border controls, population registration and applications for residence permits and citizenship. The Swedish Migration Agency, the Swedish Tax Agency and the National Government Service Centre are facing the most serious shortcomings.
