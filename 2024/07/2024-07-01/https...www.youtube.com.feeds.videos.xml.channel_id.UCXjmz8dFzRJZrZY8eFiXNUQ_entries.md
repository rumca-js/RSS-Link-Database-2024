Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez were two of the most influential directors during the 90's.   With hits like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp FIctuion, Desperado, and Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Tarantino and Rodriguez made a name for themselves with movies that harken back to the days of pulp and Grindhouse theaters.  Which is why when the two teamed up for a Grindhouse feature of their own with both Death Proof and Planet Terror, no one knew quite what to expect.  But even with the cult following that Death Proof and Planet Terror have garnered, it doesn't seem like we'll ever get another theater experience quite like Grindhouse.
