In my opinion, the server has not really reached its limits yet. Unfortunately, when I configured it back then, I decided against a GPU because it was too expensive and there was no real need.

The app runs through apache inside a docker container on port 8080. I can access the app by typing the IP_OF_SERVER:PORT, example: <a href="http://89.120.121.122:8080">89.120.121.122:8080</a> </p> <p>However the web app rely on an authentication service (Auth0) that requires a secure origin, to be able to work, so I need to setup HTTPS. All the tutorials I found so far rely on having a domain name and then adding the SSL certificate. I want to know if there is a way for me to access the app using either the server IP and the port, or the server host (v123456789.quicksrv.de:8080) with HTTPS ? </p> <p>I'd really appreciate any resources that could help me with this.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> this is a dev environment and not a production one, so any workaround is

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My new fiber ISP apparently has its IPv4 behind CGN unfortunately. I have servers id like to be able to access from home, plex, music etc.</p> <p>I've heard there's a way to use a VPS and its public IPv4 and somehow route it to my home network - so I can use that IP and associated port to access a LAN device behind CGN.</p> <p>My home router is OpnSense if that helps.</p> <p>Any ideas? Apologies if I'm using the wrong terminology but it's all new to me.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mark1210a"> /u/mark1210a </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dshpu0/working_around_cgn_nat_ideas/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dshpu0/working_around_cgn_nat_ideas/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, I’m a comp sci student and decided to run T Pot on an AWS EC2 as a good project. When I enter the ip along with the port it takes me to the home page after I login. However when I try to open Kibana it just loads until I get a HTTP 504 error and the attack map loads up but shows nothing on the logs. Cyberchef and elasticvue also don’t load up although I don’t get any errors it’s just stuck in a refresh stage. Any idea what could be causing this?? Thank you </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Interesting_Map_3427"> /u/Interesting_Map_3427 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dsfe04/tpot_honeypot_not_loading/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dsfe04/tpot_honeypot_not_loading/">[comments]</a></span>
