## Nintendo's Plan to Stomp Switch 2 Scalpers - IGN Daily Fix

If there's anyone more excited than Nintendo fans to get their hands on the company's followup to the Switch, it's scalpers who are hungry to resell the consoles at stupidly high markups! But in a recent Q&amp;A with investors, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa suggested they're well-aware they'll need to produce enough supply to keep up with the demand for their new console if they don't want a repeat of the Nintendo Switch's launch, which saw the hybrid handheld getting routinely scooped up by resellers before customers had a chance to buy them at MSRP. Marvel Studios' upcoming Deadpool and Wolverine looks set for a crossover with Call of Duty, if a datamined finisher posted on X is to be believed. And Elden Ring fans who have been waiting to dive into the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC together using the game's most popular mod have reason to get excited: Seamless Co-op has now been updated to work with the game's latest massive expansion. Praise the message, Tarnished!
