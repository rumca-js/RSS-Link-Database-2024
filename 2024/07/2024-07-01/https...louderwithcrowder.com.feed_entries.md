Just the idea of having to be around her for five minutes is insufferable. And she has proved once again why she is the most irritating sportsman to have ever walked this earth. </p><p>If there is anything clear about this woman, it’s that no one ever told her silence is violence. </p><p>Rapinoe refused to clarify her stance on boys intruding in girls’ sports.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">TPM's <a href="http

Turns out that was fake news, and they were all there for an Annie Leibovitz photo shoot. However, his family remains in full support of allowing Joe to deteriorate before our very eyes, with Hunter Biden being his most vocal supporter.
