<p>Nintendo has a plan to combat the potential scalping of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch successor</a>: one that boils down to making certain that there are enough units available to satisfy demand when it's eventually released.
