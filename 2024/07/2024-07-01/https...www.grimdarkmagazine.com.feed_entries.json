Grimdark is a state of mind; it is a style of storytelling that finds a home in just about every genre. Knowing this, we dedicate one of our quarterly GdM issues to science fiction, yearly. As a heavy reader of science fiction, I look forward to this issue every year. I enjoy reading stories that bring you into the cold, endless dark of space or the rotten politics of futuristic societies. In this issue, we have a unique collection of stories that range in style and subject, promising to captivate even the most dedicated science fiction reader. So, kick back and let us take you into the vast black. Happy reading, my friends. Cover reveal Carlos Diaz has knocked it out of the park once again! The depth and eeriness he injects into his SF covers is amazing, as is the detail on those ships.

Unfortunately for me, the action-packed plot and charismatic leads struggled to transcend the novel\u2019s overstuffed, ungrounded worldbuilding. Abandoned on the streets of a New York City decimated by monsters, Kierse is a skilled thief with a reckless streak. A robbery gone awry draws the attention of handsome, broody warlock Graves. Intrigued by Kierse\u2019s apparent ability to evade his magical home security system, Graves hires her to steal a powerful spear from the vampire king of the monster underworld at a Winter Solstice party.
