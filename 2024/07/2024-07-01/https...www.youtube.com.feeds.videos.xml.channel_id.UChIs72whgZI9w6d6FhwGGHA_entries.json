Support independent testing & grab a GN Modmat or Case Magnet: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\nIn this review, we benchmark the Thermalright Frozen Prism 360 liquid cooler (\"AIO\"), available in both ARGB and black-out variants for CPU cooling. We tested the Thermalright Frozen Prism on both Intel and AMD solutions, finding it mostly interesting for its insanely low $60 price-point. This makes it one of the cheapest liquid coolers on the market. Our testing analyzes thermal performance and acoustics vs. the Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360, the Liquid Freezer II, dozens of other coolers, and of course, water vs. air cooling. The only thing we can't test in this review is the longevity of the solution. We'll see with time!\n\nCheck out our Antec C8 Case Review from yesterday! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJAq2H52A2A\nYou can grab one of our PC building Modmats with wiring diagrams, pinouts, and screw-tracking grids here: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-m", "id": 795679, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPQ-UvavT8Q", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "source_obj__id": 428, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/MPQ-UvavT8Q/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Thermalright Strikes Again: $56.90 360mm Liquid Cooler | Frozen Prism Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
