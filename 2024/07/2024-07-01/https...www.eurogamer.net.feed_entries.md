Parkitect is an absolute treat, a theme park management sim in the classic Rollercoaster Tycoon mould, but with more than a few fresh ideas of its own. It was a joy on PC, and it's finally console-bound, heading to Xbox and PlayStation this Wednesday, 3rd July.
</p><p>
Parkitect is the work of developer Texel Raptor, and originally launched into Steam early access back in 2016. Two years later, it got a wonderfully finessed 1.0 release, and nearly six years on from that, it's been refreshed for consoles, incorporating the likes of an updated UI and a new control scheme built specifically for controllers.
</p><p>
And, honestly, Parkitect's an easy recommend if you're a tycoon game fan, expanding on the classic theme park management sim formula (in which yo

Following last week's briskest of teases, Capcom has properly unveiled Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - which is bringing its spruced up zombies-in-a-mall action to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 19th September, with a physical release to follow.
</p><p>
Capcom's Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster revisits the original 2006 game - in which players, as photojournalist Frank West, have three in-game days to investigate Colorado's sprawling, zombie-infested Willamette Parkview Mall - giving its slapstick action a new lick of paint.
</p><p>
It retains the same maximalist approach to zombie hordes and the same anything-goes approach to weaponry, but features upgraded visuals, quality of life improvements, and more. On the graphics front, Capcom's Deluxe Remaster adds enhanced character models and "evolved" mall designs featuring r

When will Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 be released? More than two decades on from the launch of Ubisoft's original game, we still don't know - but Beyond Good &amp; Evil's 20th Anniversary Edition now demands that its succesor does arrive, and sooner rather than later. 
</p><p>
As well as technical upgrades and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-originally-featured-in-beyond-good-evil-and-other-development-secrets">deep, fascinating behind-the-scenes developer archive</a>, Ubisoft's new version of Beyond Good &amp; Evil includes fresh story and new cutscenes which directly tie into the publisher's long-held plans for the game's successor.

Characters from Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 (which is set to be a prequel) appear in video diaries showing them inter

Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) must pay more than &pound;27k to a disabled former employee who brought a discrimination claim against the company.
</p><p>
The case, filed by Star Citizen senior programmer Paul Ah-Thion, revolves around a return-to-work policy that also involved work from the company's new central Manchester office location - some 15 miles from its previous Wilmslow location. 
</p><p>
Ah-Thion, who previously worked in-office at Wilmslow, brought the case after his requests to work remotely rather than travel into central Manchester were denied and he was subsequently terminated.

It's a puzzle that has confounded many over the last few years and after discussions with multiple sources, including some of the highest profile triple-A developers in the business, we finally have some answers - and it's all laid out in this week's edition of DF Direct Weekly.</p><p>In terms of technical specifications, Xbox Series X is undoubtedly the most powerful console on the market - at least until the mooted PlayStation 5 Pro arrives. Its GPU hits 12 teraflops, augmented by a handsome amount of memory bandwidth: a max of 560GB/s. PlayStation 5? 10.23TF of GPU compute is available, fed by

The big budget upcoming return of Crazy Taxi will be an open-world, massively-multiplayer game, Sega has said.

A new developer interview video published today includes quotes from Sega's team behind the upcoming reboot, as well as brief flashes of in-game footage. There are clips of multiple yellow taxis racing each other - and police cars in pursuit.
</p><p>
Job adverts on Sega's <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs?category=2010249489979686912">recruitment page</a> note that the game is being developed in Unreal Engine, and that Sega has high expectations for the game's success globally. The publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-aaa-in-scope">previously described the project's scope as "AAA"</a>, indicating it is placing plenty of resources behind it.

## Zelda & Jazz: it really works

Ray was in his 80s when I knew him, and as a result, he was a bit of a gateway to Brighton in the 1950s. 1950s Ray really loved jazz, and 2023 Ray was there to tell me about what it was like to love jazz in Brighton back then. It was a town of cider bars for the most part, as Ray told it, but underneath a lot of bars were jazz venues, all literally underground, and the greats from the whole world of jazz would come and play in darkened, smoky rooms in this strange town stuck on the chill edge of England. This was always done under assumed names, which was something to do with managers and payments, I gather. The important part: you had to be in the know to access any of this.</p><p>I thought of Ray earlier this week when I got an email about a new jazz record t
