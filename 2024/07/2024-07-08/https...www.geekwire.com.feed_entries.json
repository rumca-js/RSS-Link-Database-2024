Spire, a 41-story building a stone&#8217;s throw from Amazon headquarters on Sixth Avenue, announced an EV charging system Monday that it says can fully charge up to 192 vehicles \u2014\u00a0more than two thirds of the building&#8217;s garage capacity \u2014\u00a0within a 24-hour period.

Readers may have already noticed her byline on a story about the widespread thefts of EV charging cables in Seattle and the aggravating impact on area drivers, and another on plans for a climate tech co-working space, plus her earlier coverage of clean energy grants and funding for climate tech. Dohrn grew up in Seattle and in June finished a master\u2019s program in science communication at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC).

Now he&#8217;s applying lessons from that experience to a new entrepreneurial venture called AllDrafts, which aims to help lawyers draft contracts. &#8220;It turns out Bible study and the law have something in common: they both involve a lot of commentary on ancient and sacred texts,&#8221; Pritchett said via email. Faithlife sold a majority of its shares to private equity firm Cove Hill Partners in 2020. Pritchett stepped down as CEO of Faithlife in 2022, and founded AllDrafts later that year.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/founder-of-bible-software-company-leads-new-contract-drafting-startup-alldrafts/\">Read More</a>", "id": 827879, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/founder-of-bible-software-company-leads-new-contract-drafting-startup-alldrafts", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Founder of bible software company leads new contract drafting startup AllDrafts", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
