A recent study explored the relationship between corporate climate change mitigation actions and the cost of capital for 2,100 Japanese listed companies from 2017 to 2021. The findings reveal that companies that maintain lower carbon intensity and disclose more climate-related information can reduce their capital costs. Conversely, mere commitments to climate change without actionable measures do not significantly impact costs.

## Hexagonal perovskite oxides: Electrolytes for next-generation protonic ceramic fuel cells

Researchers have identified hexagonal perovskite-related oxides as materials with exceptionally high proton conductivity and thermal stability. Their unique crystal structure and large number of oxygen vacancies enable full hydration and high proton diffusion, making these materials ideal candidates as electrolytes for next-generation protonic ceramic fuel cells that can operate at intermediate temperatures without degradation.

## Genomic data integration improves prediction accuracy of apple fruit traits

Genotyping techniques can be used to select fruit trees with desired traits at the seedling stage, increasing the efficiency of fruit tree breeding. However, so far, there are multiple different genotyping systems, each generating distinct datasets. In a recent study, Japanese scientists revealed that integrating genomic data obtained with different genotyping systems can effectively combine with historical data, leveraging the accuracy of genomic predictions.

## Visualizing short-lived intermediate compounds produced during chemical reactions

Immobilizing small synthetic molecules inside protein crystals proves to be a promising avenue for studying intermediate compounds formed during chemical reactions, scientists report. By integrating this method with time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography, they successfully visualized reaction dynamics and rapid structural changes occurring within reaction centers immobilized inside protein crystals. This innovative strategy holds significant potential for the intelligent design of drugs, catalysts, and functional materials.

## Weaker ocean circulation could enhance carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere, study finds

Scientists may have to rethink the relationship between the ocean's circulation and its long-term capacity to store carbon, new research suggests. As the ocean gets weaker, it could release more carbon from the deep ocean into the atmosphere -- rather than less, as some have predicted.

## Brain size riddle solved as humans exceed evolution trend

The largest animals do not have proportionally bigger brains -- with humans bucking this trend -- a new study has revealed.

## GeneMAP discovery platform will help define functions for 'orphan' metabolic proteins

Researchers have developed a discovery platform to probe the function of genes involved in metabolism -- the sum of all life-sustaining chemical reactions. The investigators used the new platform, called GeneMAP (Gene-Metabolite Association Prediction), to identify a gene necessary for mitochondrial choline transport.

Researchers have discovered a new potential drug target for the lethal wasting disease known as cancer cachexia. Their findings illustrate that even small groups of neurons in the brain can have an outsized impact on the body's cancer response.

## Why some abusive bosses get a pass from their employees

Why do employees sometimes accept working for an abusive boss? A new study suggests that when a leader is seen as a high performer, employees are more likely to label abuse as just 'tough love.'
