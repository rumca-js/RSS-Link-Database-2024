<p>
	From April 24th to 26th we had our annual edition of the C++ conference using std::cpp 2024. This is the major conference held in Spain since 2013.</p>
<p>
	Our final report has now been published:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
	It includes answers to many interesting questions from the audience, not only about the conference, but also about the state of the C++ programming language ecosystem.</p>
<p>
	Do you want to know which is the most widely used version of the C++ language amont our attendees? What are the most popular platforms and compilers? Which tools are used?</p>
<p>
	And above all, do you really want to know which one was considered the best talk in the conference?</p>
