Jo Ann, a youth worker in Terror Town who is afraid to leave her home, attracts the attention of time travellers from the future. Meanwhile, her foster-brother Donny, a young Black man, is struggling to connect with his African roots. Venturing out, he’s beaten by a brutal mob hunting a scapegoat to drive out the old year and ring in the new. Ultimately, it’s Jo Ann’s redemptive connection with the space pilot Pelegrin that enables her to move on.</p><p>As with all his operas, the composer wrote his own libretto for New Year, drawing on Jungian ph

<ul><li>Company scrutinising City deals ‘works for rival clubs’</li><li>Relates to legal fight on associated party transactions</li></ul><p>Manchester City are claiming the Premier League has treated them unfairly in assessing their commercial income by relying on the analysis of a data company which also works for their rivals. The Guardian has learned that the league’s scrutiny of the fair market value of City’s deals was undertaken by Nielsen Sports, a global data and media valuation firm that has contracts with several top-flight clubs.</p><p>City are understood to have raised the Premier League’s use of Nielsen in their legal battle over associated party transactions (APT), in which clubs strike sponsorship or revenue deals with businesses linked to their owners, which was heard in private last month. A decision on the landmark case is expected soon, although it is unclear when it will be made public.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/08/mancheste

<p>Some claim bringing Ukraine into Nato would deter Russia from ever invading the country again. That is wishful thinking</p><p>At last year’s Nato summit, the United States focused on improving Ukraine’s self-defense capabilities rather than addressing the country’s potential membership in Nato. At Nato’s upcoming summit in July, some are pushing for Nato to bring Ukraine significantly closer toward membership, such as by defining an accession process for Kyiv or inviting the country to join that process. Any such step would be unwise.</p><p>Nato’s Article 5 is widely considered to bind members of the alliance – in practice the United States above all – to go to war to repel an attack against any member. If Ukraine were to join Nato after the current war, the US and its allies would be understood to be making a commitment to fight Russian forces over Ukraine, should Russia invade again.

Enthralled by the showbiz industry, I wanted to become a big-time producer and see my name in the credits on the silver screen. And I got there, kind of. I made the 5,500-mile journey from London to Los Angeles, attending UCLA, interning at the production company of a bona fide A-list celebrity and ultimately securing sponsorship for a work visa.

I have an open mind about trying things,” she says.</p><p>Having enjoyed the workshop, she did another one. What Thompson didn’t know was that this is how the Company of Elders, Sadler’s Wells’ dance company for non-professional dancers over 60, scouts out new members, to avoid the pressure of an audition. The company whittled it down to a few people, including Thompson, and they were invited to dance at Sadler’s Wells. “I was phenomenally excited and very nervous,” she says.</p> <a href="ht

The prize is within my sights: an oat-milk latte, my reward for getting up ridiculously early.</p><p>The trains have not started running yet and the silence seems to magnify hitherto inaudible sounds.

<p>In kingdom where half of people have Palestinian roots, rulers try to balance US ties with calls for action on Gaza war</p><p><strong> </strong>Ahmed Saeed Abu Fares leans back in his cheap plastic chair and smiles. He has just got a call through to his older sister in Gaza. Though he is only 90 miles away in Jordan, this is an achievement. The conversation is brief, but long enough for Abu Fares to hear that she is safe. So too are her children. For the first time in weeks, the 63-year-old scrap dealer relaxes.</p><p>“We just couldn’t get through to check on them. When their house was bombed and two of my nieces were killed, it was two weeks before I found out. So I’ve been panicking when my phone rings. Every time, it is terror or fear,” Abu Fares says. “I feel much better now. She says they are all tired but OK.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/i-panic-when-my-phone-rings-the-plight-of-palestinians-in-jordan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The lifting of a long-held ban has angered conservationists, but others argue trophy hunting can support local economies and even help protect threatened species</p><p>In the borderlands of Tanzania and Kenya, the “super tuskers” roam. A combination of old age, genetic pooling and prolonged protection from poaching has created a population of bull elephants with enormous tusks, weighing up to 45kg apiece, large enough to scrape along the ground as the animals walk. To many, the bulls are “living icons” of the African savannah. They are also highly prized by trophy hunters.</p><p>Now, a series of super-tusker killings has sparked a bitter international battle over trophy hunting and its controversial, sometimes counterintuitive role in conservation. Some conservationists believe the killing of these extraordinary animals should not be allowed. Others say controlled, regulated hunting can actually contribute to elephants’ long-term survival by providing jobs for local people and ince
