  <p id="USdHkl">Moving is one of the most stressful events that can happen in your life. It takes a lot of time and effort, it’s expensive, it’s complicated, and there’s just a ton to do. </p>
<p id="0exZKr">It’s not just a matter of finding a place you can afford, signing the lease or arranging for a mortgage, and figuring out how to get your stuff from one place to another. There are also a variety of other issues. You probably have to downsize and declutter before you move. You have to figure out which furniture to move, and which to keep, and get rid of all those

  <p id="KdkBCZ">Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud charge related to a pair of crashes of its 737 Max planes, as part of a plea deal with the US Department of Justice. Lawyers for the victims’ families plan to object to the deal, which was forged on Sunday just before a midnight deadline and must still be approved by a federal judge.</p>

<p id="m5QQzM">That’s a misleading statement; I haven’t really taken <em>any </em>phones apart lately, but when CMF’s Phone 1 arrived, that’s the first thing I did. Because this one, my friends, is built different.
