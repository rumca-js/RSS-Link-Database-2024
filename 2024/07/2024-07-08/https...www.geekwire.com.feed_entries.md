Spire, a 41-story building a stone&#8217;s throw from Amazon headquarters on Sixth Avenue, announced an EV charging system Monday that it says can fully charge up to 192 vehicles — more than two thirds of the building&#8217;s garage capacity — within a 24-hour period. The $350 million development, which is more than 80% sold, made headlines three years ago with the installation of a computer-controlled, automated parking system that uses elevators and a system of dollies to&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/automated-parking-garage-in-seattle-condo-tower-gets-even-more-robotic-with-ev-charging-bays/">Read More</a>

Lawyers for the companies staked out their positions in dueling memos filed during the Fourth of July holiday week in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, where the New York Times Co. filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against both OpenAI and its partner Microsoft in December 2023. &#8220;OpenAI’s claim that&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/new-york-times-co-fights-openais-request-for-reporters-source-materials-in-copyright-dispute/">Read More</a>

Readers may have already noticed her byline on a story about the widespread thefts of EV charging cables in Seattle and the aggravating impact on area drivers, and another on plans for a climate tech co-working space, plus her earlier coverage of clean energy grants and funding for climate tech. Dohrn grew up in Seattle and in June finished a master’s program in science communication at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). She also has a Bachelor of Arts degree in molecular&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/meet-gillian-dohrn-geekwires-ocean-plunging-and-science-loving-climate-tech-intern/">Read More</a>

Now he&#8217;s applying lessons from that experience to a new entrepreneurial venture called AllDrafts, which aims to help lawyers draft contracts. &#8220;It turns out Bible study and the law have something in common: they both involve a lot of commentary on ancient and sacred texts,&#8221; Pritchett said via email. Faithlife sold a majority of its shares to private equity firm Cove Hill Partners in 2020. Pritchett stepped down as CEO of Faithlife in 2022, and founded AllDrafts later that year.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/founder-of-bible-software-company-leads-new-contract-drafting-startup-alldrafts/">Read More</a>
