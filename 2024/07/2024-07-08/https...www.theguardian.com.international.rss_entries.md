<p>Inspired by the demise of her own modelling career, this BBC show about a woman trying to hide her bankruptcy unleashes De Swarte’s mesmeric talents</p><p>There is an uncompromising ferocity to Michelle de Swarte on screen that I foolishly assumed had reached its full expression in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/07/the-baby-review-post-roe-this-comedy-horror-is-truly-terrifying">the 2022 comedy horror The Baby</a>. In that series, the standup and writer played a woman corralled into motherhood by a possessed infant. It was the perfect metaphor for the unending rapaciousness of children; it makes much more sense to consider them malevolent demons sucking us dry rather than vulnerable bundles in need of all our love and care.</p><p>The series was great, De Swarte sensational. Now, she has unleashed her talent – and her&nbsp;mesmeric presence – by writing and starring in the six‑part comedy drama Spent, based loosely on her experiences&nbsp;as a model.</p>

This is a maximum security facility and you’re talking about wanting me to run around with tights talking about to be and not to be?
