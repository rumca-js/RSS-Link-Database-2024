## Ex-GTA 5 Dev Confirms Why "Kick-Ass" Story DLC Was Scrapped - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
A former developer with Rockstar basically confirms what we all knew about the canceled Grand Theft Auto 5 DLC: it was scrapped because GTA Online became too successful. Basically, after GTA 5 shipped, a lot of that team moved on to Red Dead Redemption 2, leaving a smaller group to work on story DLC. But GTA Online blew up and some of the DLC was repurposed for online content. So in a nutshell, we didn't get GTA 5 DLC because you all spent too much money on GTA Online. Kidding. In some alternate dimension, we got at least one awesome DLC expansion to GTA 5 AND content for GTA Online. In other news, the publisher for Manor Lords is hitting back at claims that the game doesn't have enough post-launch content. The game is in early access, so technically it hasn't launched yet...because it's not finished. And speaking of games that are or aren't finished, the developers of Fallout London appear to be teasing that mod's release, and it could be very soon.

The American production company, Skydance, is set to take over Paramount in a deal worth $8 billion dollars. With that investment, Skydance will have stake in Paramount tv and film, Paramount Plus, CBS, MTV Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and quite a few of its intellectual properties, such as Star Trek and Top Gun. One item Skydance noted to the press that might be interesting to this audience is its video game business. Skydance has two in-house developers with upcoming Star Wars and Marvel console games. Under the terms laid out by Skydance, Paramount’s non-executive chair Shari Redstone will sell her family’s controlling stake in the company. Under this new deal, a new Paramount company will be formed that’ll be valued at $28 billion dollars. The deal is looking to close by summer of next year.

Following Hulu's critically acclaimed 2023 revival of Futurama, the epic sci-fi series from Matt Groening and David X. Cohen returns in 2024 with ten all-new episodes. 

On this orbit around the sun, our occasionally heroic crew embarks on mind-bending adventures involving birthday party games to the death, the secrets of Bender's ancestral robot village, A.I. friends (and enemies), impossibly cute beanbags, and the true 5 million-year-old story behind the consciousness-altering substance known as coffee. And, of course, the next chapter in Fry and Leela's fateful, time-twisted romance. 

Futurama Season 12 launches on Hulu on July 29, 2024. The voice cast includes John DiMaggio, Billy West, Katey Sagal, Tress MacNeille, Maurice LaMarche, Lauren Tom, Phil LaMarr and David Herman.
