Although perovskites have attracted a lot of attention lately, anti-perovskites hold just as much potential as functional materials. Bearing a similar crystal structure to perovskites but with an inverted electrical configuration, anti-perovskites exhibit peculiar properties that could be exploited, including negative thermal expansion, ionic conductivity, and even superconductivity. Unfortunately, thus far, synthesizing nanosized anti-perovskites has proven difficult, which is holding back these promising materials in catalytic applications.

Currently, there is no effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most frequent and malignant type of brain tumor. Some low molecular weight antitumor agents are used to permeate the gaps between endothelial cells in the BBTB (blood−brain tumor barrier), which is a characteristic blood vessel structure and formed by the partial collapse of the blood−brain barrier, but they are rapidly excreted from the kidneys, resulting in low GBM accumulation.

Wheat production is essential for global food security, and continual improvement to grain yield is necessary to meet the nutritional demands of the expanding human population. Grain size is positively correlated with grain weight, while the flag leaf serves as the major source of photosynthetic assimilates for grain development, therefore grain and flag leaf morphologies are determining factors in the final yield potential of wheat. Identification of genes involved in both grain and flag leaf morphologies remains an essential step in precision breeding and cultivation of wheat with high yield potential.

Polar regions are known to be warming at an enhanced rate compared to lower latitudes, with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change citing a ~5 °C increase in air temperature over Arctic land masses during the 20th century and the highest rates of ~1 °C per decade since the 1980s. Clearly, this so-called "polar amplification" of warming, defined as the ratio of high-latitude (>60 ºN/S) to low-latitude (

Multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) materials are promising candidates for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with narrow electroluminescence (EL) spectra. Scientists in China propose an interlayer sensitization strategy to improve EL efficiencies of blue MR-TADF emitters with blue MR-TADF sensitizer, and successfully realize blue hyperfluorescence OLEDs with high color quality and outstanding EL efficiencies simultaneously.
