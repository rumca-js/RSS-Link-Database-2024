<p>Blizzard and Hasbro have revealed the Transformers skins for <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s upcoming collaboration with the popular mecha toy franchise. The two companies released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3K-Avl7yFY">animated trailer</a> on the <em>Overwatch</em> YouTube channel today, showing off the skins based on three Autobots and a Decepticon.</p>
<p>The trailer shows that the Transformers skins are assigned to Reinhardt, Bastion, Illari and Ramratta — four characters that were already robots or humans wearing armor to begin with. Reinhardt will be cosplaying Optimus Prime, the fearless leader of the Autobots; Bastion will be Bumblebee; Illari will be pretty in pink as Arcee; and Ramratta will be the fearsome Decepticon leader, Megatron. Many <em>Overwatch 2</em> players are anticipating how well the Transformers skins will fit with the game’s <a href="https://gamedesignskills.com/game-design/video-game-mechanics/#f

<p>Scalpers have used a security researcher’s findings to reverse-engineer “nontransferable” digital tickets from Ticketmaster and AXS, allowing transfers outside their apps. The workaround was revealed in a lawsuit AXS filed in May against third-party brokers adopting the practice, according to <em>404 Media</em>, which first <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.404media.co/scalpers-are-working-with-hackers-to-liberate-non-transferable-tickets-from-ticketmasters-ecosystem/">reported</a> the news.</p>
<p>The saga began in February when an anonymous security researcher, going by the pseudonym Conduition, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://conduition.io/coding/ticketmaster/?ref=404media.co">published technical details</a> about how Ticketmaster generates its electronic tickets. If you aren’t already familiar with how modern e-ticketing systems work, Ticketmaster and AXS lock ticket resales inside their platforms, preventing transfers on third-party services like <a hre

<p>Let’s start this news off with a catchy song: Who just got a release date for Disney+? It’s <em>Agatha All Along</em>! The <em>WandaVision</em> spinoff series starring the titular witch who pulled every evil string in the original show starts streaming on September 18.</p>
<p>Disney and Marvel announced the release date for <em>Agatha All Along</em> today and gave us a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARulRbzM7Jw">teaser trailer</a> to go with it.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c318fc94b53a4bdb892d6eb323e2b2b7"></div>
<p>The trailer shows Agatha (Kathryn Hahn) working as a detective when she finds the body of a Jane Doe by the river in Westview. She’s shocked to discover that the Jane Doe is none other than Wanda Maximoff, a.k.a. Scarlet Witch, who went into hiding after casting a containment spell on Agatha, stripping her of her powers in the process at the end of <em>WandaVision</em>. Rio (Aubrey Plaza), the warrior witch of Agatha’s coven, convi

<p>Xbox cloud gaming has officially arrived for Amazon Fire TV sticks, making for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-gaming-coming-to-select-amazon-fire-tv-devices-in-july-182541532.html"><ins>an extremely budget-friendly way</ins></a> to play some of the latest and greatest releases. Users can play games directly from the Xbox app, though there are some caveats.</p>
<p>First of all, this service is only available for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, which is the most expensive tier at around $17 per month. Also, it only works with the Fire TV Stick 4K and the Fire TV Stick 4K Max. These are both recent releases, though the Xbox press release suggests that more devices will receive the functionality at a later date. We already thought the Fire TV Stick 4K Max <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-is-better-as-a-retro-gaming-device-than-a-streamer-160022685.html"><ins>was a perfect fit for retro gaming</ins></a>, but now that also goes for AAA gaming.</p>

Even though the shopping event is limited to 48 hours, Amazon typically has early Prime Day deals rolling out for weeks ahead of time. This year is no different: we’re already starting to see early Prime Day deals trickle in that members can take advantage of. Plus, there are also a number of solid tech deals available on Amazon that aren’t explicitly tied to July Prime Day, but are likely to get lumped in with the rest of the discounts anyway.

<p>It has finally happened. Microsoft’s text editor Notepad just got a spellcheck feature, more than 40 years after the software launched in 1983. For the history buffs, Ronald Reagan was still president in 1983 and <em>Ghostbusters</em>, then called Ghost Smashers, was an unmade script set to star Eddie Murphy. It was a long time ago.</p>
<p>Microsoft just rolled out the new spellcheck tool to the Notepad app in Windows 11 and it works how one would expect. It automatically checks spelling errors. The company began testing the feature, to whatever extent it required testing, back in March and now it has been quietly updating the software these last few days, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/8/24194047/microsoft-notepad-spellcheck-autocorrect-features-available"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>.</p>

<p>A new college year is right around the corner, which means it’s time for a new batch of freshmen to live independently for the first time. If you’re among that group, it’s a good idea to stock up on a few essentials that’ll make your dorm room feel more like a (tiny) second home. We’ve rounded up a few dorm-friendly items we can safely recommend; this is Engadget, so expect a bunch of tech gear, but we’ve also got a few non-gadgets that can hopefully make student life less stressful, if only by a little bit.</p>

<p>With the possible exception of a phone, a laptop is unquestionably a college student’s most important gadget. It will be used to take notes in class, write essays, create presentations and maybe even game a little. (But only after all your homework is done, right?) That’s why it’s critical to pick a laptop that can support the work you’re trying to do while also being thin, light and long-lasting. After all, a laptop isn’t very useful if it’s too big to lug around or if it dies instantly whenever it isn’t plugged into the wall. So to help figure out which options are right for you, we’ve put together a list of our favorite laptops for college across a range of OSes, prices and use cases.</p>

<p>I’ve sneered at Apple’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f1-manager-2022-august-30-release-date-announced-171348352.html">F1</a> movie since it was announced, assuming it’ll be a cynical exercise in brand building. Given the close involvement of the sport’s governing body, its stars and teams, it has the vibes of a two-hour commercial. But the teaser trailer for the film has made me worried, because it actually looks like it could be quite good. Oh no.</p>
<p><em>F1 </em>was co-produced by (F1 great) Lewis Hamilton himself, who pledged to make it the most realistic racing movie ever made. It centers on Brad Pitt’s Sonny Hayes, who is recruited from retirement to be a mentor to Damson Idris’ hot new prospect, Joshua Pierce. The last sequence in the teaser, all roaring engines and heavy breathing as the car warps around the track, is enough to make me think this has to be seen in IMAX.</p>

If you already have a smart TV and don’t care for the interface, streaming devices give you a whole new way to control your experience. And finally, if you’ve found that hotel television or the static on your Airbnb set leave something to be desired (or if you just don’t want to re-enter all your passwords), a streaming stick will replicate your at-home experience with minimal effort. There are a ton of different streamers out there, all with different strengths and drawbacks. We tried a number to come up with recommendations for the best streaming device for you, depending on what you want to get out of your TV.</p>
