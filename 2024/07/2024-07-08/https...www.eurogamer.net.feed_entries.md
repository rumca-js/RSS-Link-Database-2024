Following Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-partnering-with-amazon-to-deliver-xbox-cloud-gaming-via-fire-tv-devices">announcement it's teaming up with Amazon</a> to bring Xbox games to Fire TV devices via cloud streaming, the initiative is now live for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.
</p><p>
Getting set up for console-free gaming with Fire TV is relatively straightforward; just download the Xbox app to a compatible device - Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Stick 4K Max are both supported - then sign in with an active Xbox Game Pass Ultimate account.
</p><p>
That'll give you access to Microsoft's <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play/gallery/all-games">streamable Xbox Game Pass library</a> (a 20 Mbps internet connection over 5GHz Wi-Fi is recommended for play), with the last step being to connect a B

Respawn Entertainment has announced Apex Legends' upcoming Season 22 will make significant changes to the free-to-play shooter's Battle Pass "experience", by releasing two Battle Passes per season instead of one, and then charging full price for each.
</p><p>
As of Season 22, Apex Legends will ditch its current season-long Battle Pass in favour of two half-season Battle Passes - one launching at a season's start and another at its mid-point "split" - each featuring 60 levels of rewards, compared to the previous version's 110.
</p><p>
Despite the truncated number of progression levels, each new half-season premium Battle Pass costs approximately the same as the older season-long version. Previously, a premium Battle Pass cost 950 Apex Coins (a 1000-coin bundle is priced at $9.99 USD), and Respawn's new half-season Battle Passes cos

## Is a VRR TV becoming more important for console gaming?

We don't think VRR is being used as a crutch by game developers to mitigate wobbly frame-rates, but we do think that it's an excellent user tool in improving the overall performance in a relatively small number of titles&hellip; and its importance <em>is </em>increasing.</p><p>So, before we go on, let's explain what VRR is. Typically, TVs operate at a fixed refresh rate - usually 60Hz. For completely smooth performance, a game needs to run at 60fps: a new frame for every refresh. A decent fall-back position is 30fps, where a new frame is presented every other refresh. If a game consistently can

Piranha Bytes, the Embracer-owned German studio behind the Gothic, Risen and ELEX series, has reportedly shut down. 
</p><p>
The embattled publisher Embracer had been seeking a buyer for Piranha Bytes as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">vast and brutal swathe of cost-cutting</a> that saw multiple studios shut and more than 4500 people lose their jobs - though ultimately was unsuccessful.

## Okami's initial sales were "huge failure", says director Hideki Kamiya

Okami was a "huge failure" in terms of initial sales, director Hideki Kamiya has said. Had it been more successful, its developer Clover "would have probably continued" - rather than shutting down the following year.
</p><p>
Kamiya discussed the development of Okami with Ikumi Nakamura for the YouTube channel of her new studio Unseen. The pair worked together for the first time on the Zelda-like adventure game.
</p><p>
Okami has received plenty of cult acclaim since its release on PS2 in 2006, but was one of only a handful of games made by the Capcom-owned studio before it was dissolved.

</p><p>
Created by Steins Alter, the teaser is already on X but will soon be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz5HMQKOk7Q">viewable on YouTube</a> too.
</p><p>
The full short is set to be released in autumn on YouTube and while it will be just five minutes long, it looks like an impressive version of the full game - and its DLC.

</p><p>
Work to continue the BioShock series has been ongoing over the past 10 years, though has stopped and started at a selection of development studios.

Pok&eacute;mon Go has dropped a gigantic hint it will add Gen 8's game-changing Dynamax mechanic in the not-too-distant future.

An issue with Final Fantasy 14 on Xbox is still not resolved, despite maintenance over the weekend.

Director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-apologises-for-issues-identified-in-the-early-access-build-of-dawntrail">Naoki Yoshida last week offered his "sincere apologies"</a> for issues discovered in new expansion Dawntrail, including transition freezes on Xbox.
