    In <a href="https://naobservatory.org/blog/detecting-genetically-engineered-viruses">Detecting
      Genetically Engineered Viruses With Metagenomic Sequencing</a> we have:

<blockquote>
      our best guess is that if this system were deployed at the scale of
      approximately $1.5M/y it could detect something genetically engineered
      that shed like SARS-CoV-2 before 0.2% of people in the monitored
      sewersheds had been infected.

    that pandemic is in that parti
