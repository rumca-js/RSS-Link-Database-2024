								<p>A US Magic the Gathering retailer pulled the plug on a Legacy tournament with a $5k prize pool scheduled for July 20, stating that &ldquo;the perceived health of the Legacy format was toxic&rdquo; within the community. It points the finger at Wizards of the Coast&rsquo;s most recent&nbsp;banlist update, which left the powerful and contentious card &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/5k-legacy-tournament-cancelled-grief">Continued</a></p>

								<p><strong>The nine DnD alignments measure a character’s morality and lawfulness.</strong> Lawfulness represents how likely a character is to follow the rules of the society they belong to. Meanwhile, morality defines how selfish or selfless your character is (or, in more black-and-white terms, good or evil). This guide explains each of the<strong> Dungeons and Dragons alignments</strong> in detail, and it can help you choose the perfect one for your next character.</p>
<p>Previous editions of D&amp;D had alignments baked into their very mechanics. Certain <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/classes">DnD classes</a> and <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/search/races">DnD races</a> were tied to specific alignments, and your alignment impacted the weapons, sp

								<p>Is this heresy? We're pretty sure this is heresy - Games Workshop's latest upcoming model reveal for <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong>'s narrative variant Necromunda is a grotesque, genestealer-cloned replica of an Adeptus Mechanicus tech-priest, complete with fleshy mechadendrites and an <em>adorable</em> little genestealer pet at his side.

								<p>Warhammer 40k has one of the best armories in all of sci-fi. Forget your &ldquo;elegant weapons for a more civilized age&rdquo; &ndash; the guns, swords, and explosives in the grim darkness of the 41st millennium are big, ugly, and&nbsp;ridiculously fun to play&nbsp;with.
