		If you thought age verification measures for pornography were controversial, American Rounds would like you to hold its beer. The company has caused a stir with its automated vending machines for ammunition, which it places in grocery stores to make ammo more available to the public.

American Rounds kiosks offer ammunition for rifles, handguns and shotguns, for what it calls “safe, affordable and available ammunition sales.” The company argues that its ammo kiosks are safer than standard gun sales practices, because ammunition is locked inside the machine and can only be accessed once <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/selfie-biometrics-integrated-with-1-click-idv-age-document-checks">AI-assisted age verification</a> has been performed via face biometrics ma

		Mexico’s emergence as a regional tech leader could apply to AI and digital identity, according to UNESCO. Caribbean leaders are among the more engaged and educated tackling digital identity implementations. And Taiwan is advising Saint Kitts and Nevis on digital ID.
<h2>Mexico ready for AI, says new UNESCO report</h2>
The Artificial Intelligence Readiness Assessment of Mexico, a collaboration between UNESCO, and the <a href="https://www.ania.org.mx/">National Alliance for Artificial Intelligence</a> (ANIA), has determined that Mexico is well-positioned to become a regional leader in AI, and recommends the launch of a single digital identity system for the country.

		The <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=Maldives">Maldives</a> has started on an ambitious journey to transform its identity management systems by incorporating digital technologies to improve the efficiency, security, and accessibility of its citizens. The modernization efforts spearheaded by the Maldivian Government and the Global Health Advocacy Incubator (<a href="https://www.advocacyincubator.org/">GHAI</a>) involve upgrading the civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system, improving national identity management, and rolling out the eFaas digital ID platform. Introducing biometric authentication, mobile ID applications, and smart ID cards is part of a larger strategy that seeks to decentralize services and develop a digital economy backed by initia

		A report by the Africa Policy Research Institute (<a href="https://afripoli.org/what-african-countries-can-learn-from-the-continents-top-performers-in-e-government">APRI</a>) holds that putting in place strong and efficient digital government systems by African countries will drive them closer towards a major continental goal of having a single profitable digital market in the next five years.

The 44-page report authored by three researchers presents a decision-making framework that encourages stronger implementation of more efficient digital government policies, using some top performing African countries as a model for emulation. The three levels of the proposed framework include front and back-office interfaces, data security and exchange platform

		The government of Botswana has been told to strengthen the country’s porous personal data protection legal framework to address major concerns about biometric data security.

The recommendation is contained in a <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/news/essential-reforms-needed-elevate-biometric-data-protection-botswanas-biometric-data-security">paper</a> published by the Association for Progressive Communications (APC) which outlines steps needed to improve the security of citizens’ biometric data in the Southern African country.

		Consumers are feeling increasing anxiety about the effectiveness of banks' fraud-protection measures, a recent study by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/jumio">Jumio</a> highlights. This is especially the case in Singapore, where a new law has been passed introducing stiffer fines for anti-money laundering (AML) violations.

According to the <a href="https://www.jumio.com/2024-identity-study/">Jumio 2024 online identity study</a>, 75 percent of consumers are ready to switch banks if their current provider fails to protect them from scammers. This figure rises to 78 percent in Singapore.

The demand for stronger cybersecurity measures is also higher in Singapore, with 74 percent of consumers expressing concern, compared to 69 percent globally. The highe

		A group of rights organizations is calling on the Brazilian government to pass the country’s proposed AI regulation and introduce a ban on facial recognition use by law enforcement.

Brazil is currently debating amendments to Bill No. 2338/2023 on the use of AI. Drawing inspiration from the EU AI Act, the rulebook categorizes AI systems according to different levels of risk and aims to establish compliance requirements for AI system providers.

In an <a href="https://direitosnarede.org.br/2024/07/08/open-letter-advocating-for-brazilian-ai-regulation-that-protects-human-rights/">open letter</a>, Rights in Network Coalition (Coalizão Direitos na Rede, CDR) says that the bill is a good guide for AI regulation, although the legislation has room for improveme

In an opinion piece addressed to the newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Blair says that the UK government should harness the power of artificial intelligence and create a plan to control immigration.

		Google Wallet is rolling out support for American biometric passports, according to an X post from code leaker <a href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1808827267893612649">Assemble Debug</a>.

The post, spotted by <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-wallet-support-digital-passport/">Android Police</a>, specifies that the feature will only be available in the U.S. to start.

Users scan their passport with Google Wallet to add it as an ID pass, and can then perform identity verification by connecting their phone to an NFC scanner or scanning a QR code generated by the ID pass. They are still recommended to carry a physical copy of their passport, however.

The feature is not currently live, but expected to be included in an imminent update.

		The government of Mozambique is enjoying support from the World Bank to ease up access to national ID card cards for free and bridge the identification gap in the country.

Already, more 140,000 individuals have been able to get national ID cards in the pilot phase of the program which started in November last year. This has helped give legal identity to many who were cut off from access to many services for years due to a lack of an ID card, according to a World Bank <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2024/07/03/unlocking-opportunities-for-millions-in-mozambique-afe-with-free-ids">blog post</a>.

Citizens in the country, including school-going children, had complained of several hurdles in obtaining ID cards such as the high cost involved and difficult ac
