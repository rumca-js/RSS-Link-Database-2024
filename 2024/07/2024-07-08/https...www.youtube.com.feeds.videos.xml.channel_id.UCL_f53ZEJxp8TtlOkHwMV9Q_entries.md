Dr. Jordan Peterson and Tammy Peterson sit down in-person with journalist and activist Tommy Robinson. They discuss why he was recently detained in Calgary, the lawfare being waged against him and the film he is attempting to screen, the story behind the film, why he became an activist, the brutality of the UK grooming gangs, and the cowardice of the government that is actively enabling it.

Tommy Robinson is a British journalist and activist who first became an establishment target after reporting on the grooming gangs in London. From then on he and his family have suffered sacrifice and punishment for attempting to out those who are enabling the grotesque brutality of Islamic extremism.
