I colorized , restored and created a sound design for this video of old Spanish cities of Granada and Seville in the 1930s,  we can see the cobbled streets and architectural treasures of the historic cities of Granada and Seville, Moorish palaces, lush gardens and lively squares and the beauty of Andalusia

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”sound design added only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
