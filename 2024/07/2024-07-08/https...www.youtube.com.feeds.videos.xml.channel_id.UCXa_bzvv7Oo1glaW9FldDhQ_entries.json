Like Honkai: Star Rail and Genshin Impact, Zenless Zone Zero stands out, promising a sleek urban action experience with stylish combat.\n\nThe visuals and animation work are gorgeous, while the soundtrack is one of the year's best. However, at its heart, Zenless Zone Zero does a compelling job of telling the story of Belle and Wise, fleshing out the setting of New Eridu (and the Old World), and giving you reasons to care about its cast. Of course, the excellent combat helps, especially when you start to embrace the system's nuances.\n\nDespite a slow-paced opening, some pacing issues and a few performance issues, Zenless Zone Zero is a fun hack-and-slash experience. It borrows its fair share of fundamentals from miHoYo's best, but its style is undeniable.", "id": 829870, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuTLaIW30VM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/OuTLaIW30VM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Zenless Zone Zero Review PS5 Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-08T15:30:23+00:00", "description": "It\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been 11 long years since the last NCAA football game. EA Sports College Football 25 marks the return of the series, following the court case allowing college player compensation. \n\nAs such, EA Sports College Football 25 will be the first time realistic player likenesses are used in a college football game. There\u2019s a bunch of other additions and differences from NCAA Football 14 on top of that, such as the real-time Wear and Tear system and RPG-inspired Coach Archetypes that you can level up and strategize with. \n\nI\u2019m particularly excited about the returning Road to Glory mode and its improved high school stadiums. Of course, the most obvious change from the last game is the graphical fidelity and AI. EA Sports College Football 25 uses the latest iteration of Frostbite engine, which allows realistic portrayals of all 134 Division 1 stadiums and greater attention to detail for the unique school runout routines and mascots.", "id": 828348, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbMSvLt_0Kk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/wbMSvLt_0Kk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "EA Sports College Football 25 vs. NCAA Football 14  - 15 BIGGEST DIFFERENCES", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-08T10:00:45+00:00", "description": "Call yourself someone who likes a challenge, call yourself a masochist, call yourself whatever you want- either way, chances are you love a game that puts up a fight, and the kind of fight that can make you want to rip your hair right out. \n\nWhy? Well, probably because you love the feeling of immense gratification that you get when you are able to finally overcome those challenges after repeated, endless attempts.
