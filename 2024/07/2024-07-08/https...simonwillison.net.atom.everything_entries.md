<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevons paradox</a></p>
I've been thinking recently about how the demand for professional software engineers might be affected by the fact that LLMs are getting so good at producing working code, when prompted in the right way.</p>
<p>One possibility is that the price for writing code will fall, in a way that massively increases the demand for custom solutions - resulting in a greater demand for software engineers since the increased value they can provide makes it much easier to justify the expense of hiring them in the first place.</p>
<p>TIL about the related idea of the Jevons paradox, currently explained by Wikipedia like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the falling cost of use induces increases in demand enough that resource use is increased, rather than reduced.</p>

I just found out my favourite TV writer, Brian Grubb, is <a href="https://briancgrubb.substack.com/p/goodbyes-andor-hellos">no longer with Uproxx</a> and is now writing for his own newsletter - free on Sunday, paid-subscribers only on Friday. I hit subscribe so fast.</p>
<p>In addition to TV, Brian's coverage of heists - most recently <a href="https://briancgrubb.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-summer-of-lego-heists">Lego</a> and an <a href="https://briancgrubb.substack.com/p/it-sure-looks-like-a-bunch-of-idiots">attempted heist of Graceland</a> - "It really does look like a bunch of idiots tried to steal and auction off Graceland using Hotmail accounts and they almost got away with it" - is legendary.</p>
<p>I'd love to see more <a href="https://briancgrubb.substack.com/p/please-make-more-fun-little-friday">fun little Friday night shows</a> too.

Another example of a tiny personal tool I built using Claude 3.5 Sonnet and artifacts. In this case my prompt was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CSS for a slight box shadow, build me a tool that helps me twiddle settings and preview them and copy and paste out the CSS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I changed my mind half way through typing the prompt and asked it for a custom tool, and it built me this!</p>

<p><a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/geomys/">Geomys, a blueprint for a sustainable open source maintenance firm</a></p>
Filippo Valsorda has been <a href="https://words.filippo.io/full-time-maintainer/">working as a full-time professional open source maintainer</a> for nearly two years now, accepting payments on retainer from companies that depend on his cryptography Go packages.</p>
<p>This has worked well enough that he's now expanding: Geomys (a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomys">genus of gophers</a>) is a new company which adds two new "associate maintainers" and an administrative director, covering more projects and providing clients with access to more expertise.</p>
<p>Filipino describes the model like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re betting your business on a critical open source technology, you</p>
<ol>
<li>want it to be sustainably and predictably maintained; and</li>
<li>need occasional access to expertise that would be blisteringly expensive t
