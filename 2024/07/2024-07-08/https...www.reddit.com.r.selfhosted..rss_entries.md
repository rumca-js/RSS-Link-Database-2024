I had no idea how to do any of this a week ago, so through a lot of disjointed tutorials, various reddit threads, and trial and error, I got everything working.</p> <p>Notably, this is not a docker set up. I tried to use docker for one thing in the past and just got completely blown out of the water in terms of complexity and retreated back to my Windows hole.

Unfortunately, I did not find many fitting products.</p> <p>I still forget about such birthday or christmas presents though. Letting these expire is quite stupid as they hold a monetary value and should be redeemed. However, who really remembers the exact expiry date? Where did I place the couvert with the gift card? Guess I am not alone here.</p> <p>A gift card as present for a visit to the local cinema? Nice, much appreciated! But also a soon forgotten or misplaced item in the cupboard. Even if quite present in memory, there is still a high likelyhood I do not have the gift card and redeem code handy when spontaneously visiting the cinema.</p> <blockquote> <p>What a pitty!

Notably I <em>am</em> connecting with HTTPS, and the CDP is proxying 9443, Authentik's HTTPS port, to the host's port 443. I've tried configuring the reverse proxy to hit Authentik's HTTP port, but that didn't work (I just got 502s), and I can confirm that my Authentik stack works fine with the ports bound directly, so it is a problem with the proxy.

It has two USB HDDs mounted in /srv, with the OS installed on a microSD card. The first HDD serves as the main storage, and the second is used for backup of the main. Docker is installed on the main HDD (/srv/...), and its containers run from there. Currently, I have Portainer managing three containers: Nextcloud, Mariadb, Redis, and another one is Portainer itself. Nextcloud's data and configs (docker volumes) are also stored on the main HDD. However, I'm not satisfied with this setup as Nextcloud is performing slower than expected. </p> <p>I'm considering a new setup with an Odroid H4+ and two 2TB SSD SATA disks in RAID1. Would this be worth it considering power consumption, speed, and accessory costs (disks, memory, case) compared to the Raspberry Pi 5? My goal is to consolidate NAS and Nextcloud onto one device.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently checking out Libby, hoopla, and the other various services my library offers (check them out if you haven't and support your local libraries) and hoopla is pretty interesting as far as media variety in one interface. Ebooks, albums, movies and TV shows all together. Pretty tight limits but that's to be expected considering what it is.</p> <p>Would be great to host something similar instead of the current patchwork of services. Jellyfin, Kavita, and navidrome are good enough for me but not as kid friendly as an all in one.</p> <p>What else is out there? Lesser known projects or plugins that may be under the radar? Jellyfin has some kind of ok options but they really only shine with third party apps. What are you all using to make your stacks feel more like a single service?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pie_Rat_Chris"> /u/Pie_Rat_Chris </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/

I want to give some friends + family access to this server as well and from all my research around the subject I've put up the following security safeguards: &nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Jellyfin running in unprivileged LXC w/read only SMB share to NAS media directory</li> <li>A Caddy reverse proxy to direct traffic to Jellyfin/Jellyseerr (also an unprivileged LXC)</li> <li>Separate VLAN for Jellyfin/Jellyseerr and Caddy to all live on (with appropriate firewall rules for NAS access, arr stack communication, etc)</li> <li>Fail2ban monitoring Jellyfin/Jellyseer logs, ban IP after n failed attempts</li> </ul> <p>My plan was to open ports 80/443 on my router &amp; have all HTTP/HTTPS traffic directed to the Caddy reverse proxy. How does this setup sound from a security standpoint? Wanted to make sure I'm not missing anything. I believe my largest point o
