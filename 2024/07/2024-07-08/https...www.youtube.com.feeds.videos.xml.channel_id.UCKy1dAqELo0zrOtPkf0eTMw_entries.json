Basically, after GTA 5 shipped, a lot of that team moved on to Red Dead Redemption 2, leaving a smaller group to work on story DLC. But GTA Online blew up and some of the DLC was repurposed for online content. So in a nutshell, we didn't get GTA 5 DLC because you all spent too much money on GTA Online. Kidding. In some alternate dimension, we got at least one awesome DLC expansion to GTA 5 AND content for GTA Online. In other news, the publisher for Manor Lords is hitting back at claims that the game doesn't have enough post-launch content. The game is in early access, so technically it hasn't launched yet...because it's not finished. And speaking of games that are or aren't finished, the developers of Fallout London appear to be teasing that mod's release, and it could be very soon.\n\n#GTA5", "id": 830366, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQsS1LZ8C4A", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/nQsS1LZ8C4A/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Ex-GTA 5 Dev Confirms Why \"Kick-Ass\" Story DLC Was Scrapped - IGN Daily Fix", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-08T21:08:47+00:00", "description": "The American production company, Skydance, is set to take over Paramount in a deal worth $8 billion dollars.
