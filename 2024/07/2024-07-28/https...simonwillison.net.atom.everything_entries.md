This long excerpt from Kristen Haring's 2008 book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262582766/ham-radios-technical-culture/">Ham Radio's Technical Culture</a> filled in so many gaps for me. I'm ham licensed in the USA (see my recent notes on <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/ham-radio/general">passing the general exam</a>) but prior to reading this I hadn't appreciated quite how much the 100+ year history of the hobby explains the way it works today. Some ham abbreviations derive from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_Code">the Phillips Code</a> created in 1879!</p>
<p>The Hacker News thread attracted some delightful personal stories from older ham operators: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41060631#41095579">"my exposure to ham radio really started in the 1970s..."</a>. I also liked <a href="https://

Stamen's custom basemaps have long harbored an Easter egg: zoom all the way in on 0, 0 to see the outline of the mystical "null island", the place where GIS glitches and data bugs accumulate, in the Gulf of Guinea south of Ghana.</p>
<p>Stamen's Alan McConchie provides a detailed history of the Easter egg - first introduced by Mike Migurski in 2010 - along with a definitive guide to the GIS jokes and traditions that surround it.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://maps.stamen.com/toner/#19/0/0">Null Island on Stamen's Toner map</a>. The shape (also available <a href="https://github.com/stamen/toner-carto/blob/master/shp-local/nullisland.geojson">as GeoJSON</a>) is an homage to the island from 1993's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst">Myst</a>, hence the outline of a large docked ship at the bottom.</p>

Fun satirical GPT-powered calculator demo by Calvin Liang, originally built in July 2023. From the ChatGPT-generated artist statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The piece invites us to reflect on the necessity and relevance of AI in every aspect of our lives as opposed to its prevailing use as a mere marketing gimmick. With its delightful slowness and propensity for computational errors, CalcGPT elicits mirth while urging us to question our zealous indulgence in all things AI.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-optimism-vs-ai-arms-race/"><p>The key to understanding the pace of today’s infrastructure buildout is to recognize that while AI optimism is certainly a driver of AI CapEx, it is not the only one. The cloud players exist in a ruthless oligopoly with intense competition. [...]</p>
<p>Every time Microsoft escalates, Amazon is motivated to escalate to keep up. And vice versa. We are now in a cycle of competitive escalation between three of the biggest companies in the history of the world, collectively worth more than $7T. At each cycle of the escalation, there is an easy justification—we have plenty of money to afford this. With more commitment comes more confidence, and this loop becomes self-reinforcing. Supply constraints turbocharge this dynamic: If you don’t acquire land, power and labor now, someone else will.</p></blockquote><p class="cite">&mdash; <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-optimism-vs-ai-arms-race/">Dav
