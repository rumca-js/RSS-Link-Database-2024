## How to integrate a peripheral with RISCV?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I basically want to integrate a a risc v core (the one i'm using is CVA6 which I have been trying to get running for the past 2 weeks) with an AI accelerator which is basically like a peripheral. The AI accelerator has an APB(type of AXI connection) interface and I need to connect it to the CVA6 core.</p> <p>However, I don't know where to start. I have identified the memory map and I guess I could put the peripheral on the address 6000_0000(its adress range is only 1). I don't know how exactly to do that. Someone on the repo mentioned I have to connect the peripheral to the crossbar. But idk how to do that, neither are there much resources online.</p> <p>I would also like to know what changes in the software stack I would have to make. Do I need to modify and rebuild the kernel? Modify the device tree? Where do I even get the device tree?</p> <p>I can't open the CVA6 design in Vivado either, I have to make the changes in code in Verilog/System Ver

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think I'm just as excited about RISC-V as the next person, but I'm curious about the current state of the power and capabilities of it.</p> <p>Obviously it's hard to get an apples to apples comparison, but today I saw a Milk-V Mars, which is roughly Raspberry Pi shaped/sized... and I just wonder, head to head, like how a ~200 dollar Milk-V Mars does against an 80 Raspberry Pi 5 in any benchmark? I don't know which ones are popular anymore. Where I used to work, we used HPCG.</p> <p>I mostly want to know if I run out and get that Mars board, am I building half of it myself and fixing a massive heap of broken software and non-existent drivers to have something more than twice the cost and half the speed of a Ras Pi 5 or what? The Mars board looks like a pretty polished product... but is it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/replikatumbleweed"> /u/replikatumbleweed </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://
