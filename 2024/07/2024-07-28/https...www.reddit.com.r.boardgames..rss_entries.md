<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Long story, but I'm playing a game of guess who for major stakes. Instead of the board game where you ask yes or no questions about 20 pictures of people, the answer can be anyone in the world, living or dead, fictional or real. It's more like a game of 20 questions. The point is to guess the answer in the least amount of questions as possible. I could really use your help, what would be the best questions to narrow it down quickly?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Razzmatazz-3720"> /u/Ok-Razzmatazz-3720 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eekyw0/best_questions_for_real_life_guess_who/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eekyw0/best_questions_for_real_life_guess_who/">[comments]</a></span>

But I'm wondering if anyone has actually finished the camapaign - or come relatively close to doing so - and if so, whether they'd be willing to share some spoiler-free thoughts about how satisfying the entire experience was. Is the narrative fulfilling? Is the combat system too grindy when all is said and done? TIG seems to tick all of the boxes I'm looking to tick (e.g., the combat system seems more up my street than what I've seen in games like Oathsworn, and the narrative focus and open-world elements seem amazing), but it's such an expensive game that I feel like I need to be *really* sure before I pull the trigger.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Commentator28"> /u/Commentator28 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.red

From what I understand, she likes games that are chill and likes to use them more as an avenue to hang out with friends.

BUT she also is quite the puzzler, and enjoy solving mysteries and figuring things out. She doesn't own any board games like this, but I am thinking maybe I ought to get her one. Her OTHER favorite game is <strong>Mycelium: a Mushling Game</strong>, which is objectively an alright game, but I am pretty sure the main reasons she loves it is cuz of the cute little mushroom people.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’ve been in the hobby for about 5 years or so now and have loved every second. My collection has grown but I try to keep a tight ship with what games I keep so I do tend to cull games and replace with others I think might be a hit in my group. We tend to lean towards more euro type games and lately I have just stopped and reflected about the culling cycle I’m on. </p> <p>Euro games tend to feel somewhat similar to others in the genre. Yes there are different takes on similar mechanics but a lot of the time when you boil it down most euros have a lot of the same dna and feel. </p> <p>Does anyone else feel this way and stop to think why do I need more euros if I already have some many good ones? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GKS230"> /u/GKS230 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ee4e8z/culling_euros_for_other_euros/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey Reddit</p> <p>The most loved boardgames in our collection are Spirit Island and Smash Up, both with all expansions. And recently my GF and I discussed the appeal of those games and found one similarity. Simple structure, that meets vastly different player powers.</p> <p>In Spirit Island the same Board and Invaders are fought completely different depending on the Spirit(s). Even though the Rules (play cards you can pay) are simple.</p> <p>In Smash Up the whole game can be descriped as &quot;play a creature and an action, score bases when the power requirement is met, obey the card effects&quot;. But the factions sometimes fundamentaly breqk the game. Which is great.</p> <p>Both games offer tons of replayability this way and have been played well over 100 and 150 games each.</p> <p>So I was curious and that's why we are here: What are games in your collection that feel like this? Completely different each time, but not by overcomplexity.</p> </div><

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I made an impulse buy at my game store and ran into Ankh. I did some hastily-made research to see the general popularity/rating of the game and saw it was up there with Blood Rage, which I have, so I figured that the game is a “can’t go wrong with it” purchase for me. I’ve read the rules, but haven’t played my first game yet (that actually happens tomorrow!). If I like it, I’ll likely buy the expansions. Are there any expansions I should avoid?</p> <p>Through my research, there was a few things that kept reappearing:</p> <p>Merge: it’s pretty much a 50/50 on whether someone likes this mechanic or not.
