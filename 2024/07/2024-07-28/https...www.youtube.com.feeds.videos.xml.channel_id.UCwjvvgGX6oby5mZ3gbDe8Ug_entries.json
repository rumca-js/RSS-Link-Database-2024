On July 7, 2024, a netizen on the x platform posted: 95 cities in China are already like the city of Hegang. Now, with a few thousand to twenty thousand dollars, although you can't buy a BYD electric car after a price reduction, you can buy a house! Attached below the post is a \"list of cities with very low prices for buying a house.\" As you can see from the picture, many provinces and cities in China, such as Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, \u3001 Hebei, Shandong, and Guangdong are all listed.\n\nHave questions?
