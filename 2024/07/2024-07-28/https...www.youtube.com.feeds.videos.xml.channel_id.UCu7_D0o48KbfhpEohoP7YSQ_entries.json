In addition, the SD cards can become corrupted if the Pi loses power without a proper shutdown. We have several possibilities to avoid this disaster. Only one is simple and cheap. But, unfortunately, it has its caveats. So, let\u2019s get an overview and use a nearly unknown Raspbian feature to help us solve the problem.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nRaspberry Pi 4: https://amzn.to/4ckpLUF\nRaspberry Pi 5: https://amzn.to/4cD8rKp\nBarefoot method 1: https://medium.com/swlh/make-your-raspberry-pi-file-system-read-only-raspbian-buster-c558694de79\nBarefoot Method 2: https://www.raspberry-pi-geek.de/ausgaben/rpg/2018/08/raspbian-im-read-only-modus/2/\nAdafruit's writeup: https://learn.adafruit.com/read-only-raspberry-pi/overview\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://www", "id": 942965, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW3IaRCalu0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ", "source_obj__id": 17, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ZW3IaRCalu0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Simple Trick to protect your Raspberry SD card from Crashing", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
