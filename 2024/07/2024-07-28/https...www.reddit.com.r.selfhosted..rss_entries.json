And I want some last bits of insight, a last second opinion, before I commit. </p> <p>So far the one that has all of the functional features I want (except for self hosted) is ClickUp. It has color-coding, custom fields, boards that are sortable by any criteria, and multi-project viewing. </p> <p>The ones that have fallen short are YouTrack, Plane, Focalboard, Leantime, NextCloud, and Taiga. TouTrack came the closest. Jira came pretty close too, but not as close. Focalboard had promise but fell quite short. I was surprised at some of Jira\u2019s limitations and, moreover, the resistance to more expansive features. E.g. In one thread somebody asked about showing lists of multiple projects organized by a custom field\u2014something I crave\u2014and the response was basically \u201cThis is the only sensible way to organize things.\u201d Well, my severe ADHD protests.
