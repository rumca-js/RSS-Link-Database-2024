The martial artist tells us all about her roles in major franchises like the MCU and Star Wars, where she stars in Ant-Man: Quantumania and The Mandalorian respectively. 

O’Brian also boasts an upcoming role in Tom Cruise’s Mission Impossible 8, leaving us to wonder just how much she’s get to flex her fighting skills. Also recently announced is her role in in Queens Of The Dead, a zombie rom-com directed by Tina Romero (the daughters of Night of the Living Dead director George A. Romero.

Like they say in Twisters, if you feel it, chase it. With all her successes and more to come, there’s no question Katy O’Brian certainly has.
