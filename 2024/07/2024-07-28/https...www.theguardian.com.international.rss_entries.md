Adam Peaty did not so much as flicker his eyes left or right. The defending Olympic champion walked straight ahead to the blocks, and set himself for the race ahead.

<p>Military tension simmers between the countries but a mixed doubles match in Paris still turned into something of a minor classic</p><p>“No politics at the Olympics! Bye! Thank you!” To be fair to the group of Chinese fans outside the table tennis arena at Porte de Versailles, this is undoubtedly the most sensible answer to any question about the tectonic ripples, the ping-pong diplomacy angle of a meeting across the pink and black Olympic table of China and the entity called Chinese Taipei, also known, outside of Olympic unreality, as Taiwan.</p><p>These are not matters to be taken lightly. In May this year the Chinese government announced it would consider applying the death penalty to those promoting the cause of Taiwanese separatism, a complex proposition given Taiwan is, on the face of it, already separate; but just another note in the drip-drip of manoeuvres and pre-invasion chat currently being enacted across the Straits. So yes, probably best to keep shtum on all that for no

The 22-year-old Marchand is trained by Michael Phelps’s old coach, Bob Bowman, and there were echoes of the American great as he took victory by an astonishing 5.67sec. For good measure his time of 4min 02.95sec also broke swimming’s longest standing Olympic record, set by Phelps in 2008.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/28/face-of-games-leon-marchand-gets-paris-jumping-by-storming-to-medley-gold">Continue read

<p>Kevin Durant, LeBron James and co dismantle their world No 4-ranked Serbian opponents in a riotous Paris Olympics pantomime</p><p>Perhaps the pivotal moment in this game – tonally, if not competitively – came right at the end of the third quarter. Anthony Edwards sends Nikola Jovic to the shoe shop with an outrageous feint and slip, drains a simple two, and as he peels away he sees pretty much the entire bench doing impressions of him, spinning and reeling, consumed in fits of laughter. That, in hindsight, was probably the point at which a potentially tricky Olympic basketball opener against the world’s No 4 side dissolved fully into riotous, uproarious&nbsp;pantomime.</p><p>So no, it’s fair to say Team USA did not get the memo. They are not burdened by your expectations. They are not keeping themselves up at night worrying about how they measure up against 1992. They have not been reading your angsty tweets (with the exception of KD, who almost certainly <em>has</em>). The result:

<p>Pompidou Centre show will move on to Madrid, Hamburg and Philadelphia, changing from city to city</p><p>One hundred years ago, in a tiny studio flat in a bohemian district of Paris, a former medical student turned writer set out to define surrealism “for once and for all”. In his Manifesto of Surrealism <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/jun/16/1">André Breton</a> called for a new kind of art and literature fired by the unconscious, “the dictation of thought free from any control by reason, exempt from aesthetic or moral preoccupation”.</p><p>Far from settling surrealism “for once and for all”, the handwritten document was a departure point for a sprawling, subversive movement of bad dreams, haunting landscapes, fantastical alien creatures, unsettling portraits and visual tricks. Now, a century later, a major exhibition at the Pompidou Centre in Paris, opening in September, will celebrate how surrealism spread around the world, far beyond the environs of the French c

<p>A village teacher is accused of inappropriate behaviour in Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s handsome, beautifully performed, three-and-a-half-hour fable</p><p>When we first glimpse schoolteacher Samet (Deniz Celiloğlu), he’s little more than a sooty smudge in the wide, white snowscape of a bitter Anatolian winter. Spilled out of a minibus after a holiday, he registers displeasure with every heavy step through the blizzard as he returns to a place he describes repeatedly as a hellhole. Thick snowfall blurs the edges of his advancing figure, which takes an unexpectedly long time to take on a solid, three-dimensional form. Such unhurried pacing prevails for nearly three-and-a-half hours in this Turkish-language arthouse epic, the latest from festival heavyweight and 2014 Cannes Palme d’Or winner Nuri Bilge Ceylan.
