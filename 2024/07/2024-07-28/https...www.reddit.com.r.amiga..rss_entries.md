<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Very old original Amiga owner from back in the day that sometimes dips in and out of games with FS-UAE.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a amiga 500 with a internal gotek installed I bought this already modded like this maybe five years ago, and I've never had one of my own before but growing up I played amiga games at a neighbor... anyways, recently I've been thinking about starting to use the amiga ( it's just been standing in a corner for years due to... life) anyways, I was wondering since I have the gotek can I somehow still use a external floppy drive? Or how would all that work? I'd like to start to possibly collect for amiga and not only use roms. Also, does anyone know how to update the gotek? Or that's not possible and not a thing? Please explain in a way so a newbie would understand maybe in step by steps ? Also what for external floppy drive would I need and how or where would I connect that? And what kinda cables? Thanks :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/itsybitsybit"> /u/itsybitsybit </a> <br /> <span><a href=

Before you play the main events you have to train in the gym.
