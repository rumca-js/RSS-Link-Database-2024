Napper\u2019s Ghost of the Neon God is an utterly haunting, lonely, and beautiful novella. I simply cannot put down Napper&#8217;s books and short stories, and before I get into this review more, I highly encourage you to pick up something, anything he&#8217;s written. Jackson is the homeless son of an immigrant, eking out an existence squatting in under-construction towers in metro Melbourne, Australia, and talking shit with his mate Col to pass the time. They steal where they can, buy dope and food where possible, and stare at the neon glow of the buildings and streets, and the people below they share this cage with. When walking through a back alley, a foreign woman runs into Jackson as she flees for her life. His life is about to change. But first, he\u2019ll steal that woman\u2019s shoes.
