The AI accelerator has an APB(type of AXI connection) interface and I need to connect it to the CVA6 core.</p> <p>However, I don't know where to start. I have identified the memory map and I guess I could put the peripheral on the address 6000_0000(its adress range is only 1). I don't know how exactly to do that. Someone on the repo mentioned I have to connect the peripheral to the crossbar. But idk how to do that, neither are there much resources online.</p> <p>I would also like to know what changes in the software stack I would have to make. Do I need to modify and rebuild the kernel? Modify the device tree? Where do I even get the device tree?</p> <p>I can't open the CVA6 design in Vivado either, I have to make the changes in code in Verilog/System Ver", "id": 943013, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ee1ce0/how_to_integrate_a_peripheral_with_riscv", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "source_obj__id": 471, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How to integrate a peripheral with RISCV?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-28T03:37:37+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I think I'm just as excited about RISC-V as the next person, but I'm curious about the current state of the power and capabilities of it.</p> <p>Obviously it's hard to get an apples to apples comparison, but today I saw a Milk-V Mars, which is roughly Raspberry Pi shaped/sized... and I just wonder, head to head, like how a ~200 dollar Milk-V Mars does against an 80 Raspberry Pi 5 in any benchmark? I don't know which ones are popular anymore. Where I used to work, we used HPCG.</p> <p>I mostly want to know if I run out and get that Mars board, am I building half of it myself and fixing a massive heap of broken software and non-existent drivers to have something more than twice the cost and half the speed of a Ras Pi 5 or what?
