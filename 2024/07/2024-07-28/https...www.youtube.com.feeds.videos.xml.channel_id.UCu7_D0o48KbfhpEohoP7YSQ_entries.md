This is a replay of the video 403 (during my summer break)
SD cards in Raspberry Pi computers wear out and die after a while because they are not made for computer usage, and many write cycles. In addition, the SD cards can become corrupted if the Pi loses power without a proper shutdown. We have several possibilities to avoid this disaster. Only one is simple and cheap. But, unfortunately, it has its caveats. So, letâ€™s get an overview and use a nearly unknown Raspbian feature to help us solve the problem.
