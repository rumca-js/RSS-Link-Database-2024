## Would you trust a RPi that overheated once?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have an Raspberry Pi 4 that's running a Magic Mirror that I built. It's been running fine for the past 4 or 5 years. Yesterday, I noticed that the screen was off. I looked in the back and so that the RPi was extremely hot and the plastic (or rubber) on connected usb cables were almost in melting state. </p> <p>I turned off the device and let things cool off. Later on, I turned it back on and everything is fine, temperature is good. I can't tell why this occurred. I even wrote a little script to send me a text if the temp is over 63Â° C. And it has never gone over that. </p> <p>However, the Magic Mirror is in our bedroom and I am kind of concerned that it's not a one time event. Would you trust it going forward?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SophieTheCat"> /u/SophieTheCat </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1eeftki/would_you_trust_a_rpi_that_overheated_once/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I've transformed my Raspberry Pi 5 into a sleek, portable media server designed for travel. To keep it powered, I integrated a Geekwork X1201 UPS board. For storage, I opted for a 1TB Crucial P3 M.2 SSD, connected via the Geekwork X1001 hat.</p> <p> </p> <p>I housed all these components in a custom 3D-printed case, which features a slot for a 0.96-inch OLED display and a capacitive touch button for turning display on. For efficient cooling, I employed the Raspberry Pi's active cooler alongside a 2207 fan</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dinohussler007"> /u/Dinohussler007 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ee76y5/portable_media_server_using_raspberry_pi_5/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ee76y5/portable_media_server_using_raspberry_pi_5/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a project that runs a python script when the pi boots up. When it boots, it checks how many days left until Halloween, and displays an image on the screen to reflect how many days left. It also spins 2 stepper motors ...This part works. The issue I am having is the cursor is displayed right smack in the middle of the screen, and I need it moved out of the way. This is going to run on its own with no mouse/kb installed. I've tried using the following methods:</p> <pre><code>pyautogui - attempt to move the cursor using pyautogui.moveTo(screen_width - 1, screen_height - 1) xdotool via subprocess - subprocess.run([&quot;xdotool&quot;, &quot;mousemove&quot;, str(screen_width - 1), str(screen_height - 1)]) - also tried to execute xdtool before initializing pygame: subprocess.run([&quot;xdotool&quot;, &quot;mousemove&quot;, &quot;1919&quot;, &quot;719&quot;]) pynput - mouse.position = (screen_width - 1, screen_height - 1) evdev - ui.write(e.EV_REL, e.
