Exactly how far have China's housing prices fallen? On July 7, 2024, a netizen on the x platform posted: 95 cities in China are already like the city of Hegang. Now, with a few thousand to twenty thousand dollars, although you can't buy a BYD electric car after a price reduction, you can buy a house! Attached below the post is a "list of cities with very low prices for buying a house." As you can see from the picture, many provinces and cities in China, such as Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, „ÄÅ Hebei, Shandong, and Guangdong are all listed.
