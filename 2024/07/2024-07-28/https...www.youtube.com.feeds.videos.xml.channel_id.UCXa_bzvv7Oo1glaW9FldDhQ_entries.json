The game puts players in a dark world where they have to interact with spirits to figure out the way forward.\n\nThe game makes intense use of its lighting to create an oppressive atmosphere that is further aided by the use of great sound design. Almost completely avoiding jump scares, Sylvio: Black Waters instead focuses on giving the players a horror experience where the story isn't as important as the general mood created by its visuals and audio. Its short length also helps by not having the game overstay its welcome.", "id": 945601, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umkn3MSGdeQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/umkn3MSGdeQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Sylvio: Black Waters Review - A Decent Psychological Horror Experience", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-28T15:30:05+00:00", "description": "The tenth expansion to Blizzard\u2019s long-serving MMORPG is almost upon us.

But with the recent surge of Soulslike games, uneven scenarios have become much more common. Our list here is comprised of massive things to overcome in general, so not just merely the traditional boss fight. \n\nGames like Shadow of the Colossus emphasise humongous boss fights over intricate level design, while Dark Souls tends to throw giant labyrinthine castles for you to overcome alone. These massive obstacles don\u2019t merely challenge the player with difficulties, but also help establish character arcs for many protagonists facing them as well.
