<p>In the centenary of his birth year, the author’s voice is as necessary, human and sharp as ever in a reprinted short story collection and memoir from the 1960s and 70s</p><p>James Baldwin, gone these past 37 years, is back. In truth he never went away. In the centenary year of his birth (2 August 1924), with reissues of his short story collection <em>Going to Meet the Man </em>(1965), and the autobiographical work <em>No Name in the Street </em>(1972), along with staged readings of his famous essays, rereleases of myriad documentaries and literary festival panels interrogating his wide influence, from his scintillating oratory to being a queer black style icon, the man is born again. Imprinted on our consciousness are those big, wide-awake eyes on the lookout for trouble but hoping for love, the mischievous, gap-toothed grin of gossip and delight, the rich gravitas of his voice, as foreboding as thunder but often edged with humour and always humane – all signifiers of the distilled

<p>Costanza Piccolomini was physically disfigured by her lover, the Baroque sculptor Bernini: 400 years later her story can finally be told</p><p>Around 1637, the Baroque “superstar” artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini ­created his first, and only, non-commissioned sculpture: an intimate portrait of his lover, Costanza Piccolomini. Captured for eternity, the smooth contours of her face are chiselled with a tender sensitivity, there is a softness to Costanza’s flesh, a sensuality to her slightly parted lips, and her chemise falls invitingly undone. Yet, there appears to be a defiance too, as if Costanza is about to deliver a witty riposte or give Bernini a piece of her mind.</p><p>Hers is also a sculpture which changed the course of art history. Marble busts of living women were relatively rare in the early 17th century, and usually of noblewomen, following strict rules of modesty and decorum. By contrast, Costanza was relatively poor, the wife of one of Bernini’s assistants. Her portrait intr

<p>The four disparate projects shortlisted for the annual prize add up to a heartening display of style, beauty, collaboration and force-for-good ambition</p><p>The £10,000 <a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/page/dorfman-prize">RA Dorfman prize</a>, given each year by the Royal Academy of Arts in London, is broad in its aims and global in its ambition. It “champions new talent”, from anywhere in the world, found with the help of 150 nominators and judged by a panel of academicians. The prize takes into consideration “geographical and sociopolitical challenges”. Its winners don’t have to be especially young. Rather, says the RA’s head of architecture, Vicky Richardson, it is “really good at finding people who have been building away, working like mad, without promoting themselves internationally”.</p><p>The prize risks being too general for its own good, but it has a knack for spotting individuals and groups who expand what architecture can do.

<p>A mysterious late-night TV show unites two disaffected adolescents in Jane Schoenbrun’s haunting, 90s-set allegory</p><p>To call it horror seems reductive. With its shapeshifting disquiet, <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> is too languidly weird, too unmoored from genre conventions to be neatly categorised. But there’s not a frame in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/11/jane-schoenbrun-interview-i-saw-tv-glow-movie">Jane Schoenbrun</a>’s suffocating second feature that isn’t drenched in dread and unease.</p><p>The story starts in the 1990s, although like most things in this uncanny world, time doesn’t play by normal rules. A pair of misfit teenagers, Owen (Justice Smith) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine), are united in their love for a hokey, supernatural late-night TV series. There’s another thing they share – something Maddy clocks long before Owen does: the suspicion that there is something terribly wrong with the world.</p><p>In UK and Irish cinemas</p> <a href

<p>Relax into the lazy days of summer with a calming lunch</p><p>A certain calm has enveloped the kitchen. A stillness that often happens at this point in the summer, when there is no longer any hurry to get lunch or dinner on the table, and each meal feels more like unpacking a picnic than cooking.</p><p>I relish these dog days of summer, when the garden is heady with the scent of thyme and ripening tomatoes, and life moves at a slower pace.

<p>Local newspapers in the UK are disappearing fast, creating news deserts and leaving councils unscrutinised. Now, though, a new generation is reinventing community journalism. Tina Brown, for one, is a fan</p><p>I’m not sure what I was expecting of Mill Media’s HQ: en route to Manchester, where the business is based, I vaguely picture people frantically hot-desking in a WeWork-style shared space. But whatever was in my mind, it’s nothing like the reality. The digital publisher of local news whose cheerleaders include Tina Brown, the former editor of the <em>New Yorker</em><em>,</em> and Mark Thompson, the chief executive of CNN, has made its home high in the roof of the magnificent Royal Exchange, in a trio of rooms, little wider than corridors, that contain not one bit of boring, Scandinavian-inflected office furniture. Staff here joke that Joshi Herrmann, the company’s charismatic founder, is as good at interior design as he is at journalism, and in a single glance you can see why

The square was opened in Hackney, in one of the most deprived wards in the UK, by London mayor Ken Livingstone in 2006, on a site that was previously a car park. Neighbouring derelict factory premises were redeveloped by a local co-operative as a culture centre, and a series of small business units were created around the new space. The ambition was to establish a communal area “with the potential to become something specific – or remain not really anything at all… a place to see, hear, feel, smell, taste and discover wonderful and incredible things”.</p><p>Since 2012, Ramanan has been documenting how those civic hopes and ambitions turned out.

Few expected the vice-president to attract a sufficient number of delegates and political endorsements prior to the party’s Chicago convention on 19 August, if then. Instead, Harris soared into an unassailable position within 48 hours of the White House announcement. Potential rivals tamely fell away.

That said, many of the new generation of concealers serve other purposes: they’re a great alternative to foundation and, increasingly, a skincare-makeup hybrid. Charlotte Tilbury’s, for instance, includes hyaluronic acid (super hydrating) and Vitamin C (super brightening). But not all concealers are equal and there are several things to consider. Coverage: how much do you need? If you battle with hyperpigmentation, a lightweight concealer is not going to cut it. Longevity: if you keep long hours you need a concealer to stay the course. Finish? While a matte concealer is a younger or oilier skin’s dream, it can be a mature skin’s nightmare. And then, of course, shade. Most websites now have an impressive shade finder to help pick the right colour. But if that p

That said, while a well-made extra dry prosecco such as Asda’s bargain is an ideal contender for any summer parties or picnics, its slightly sweet style is also well matched to the sort of foods I’d eat come rain or shine at this time of year, whether a delicate Vietnamese salad flavoured with mint, coriander, fish sauce and lime or a fresh fruit salad of English summer berries.

Now, concluding his trilogy about the evolution of intelligence, he shows how animal life has shaped the planet itself</p><p>Peter Godfrey-Smith is the scuba-diving philosopher who took octopus off the menu for many readers of his bestselling book, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/15/other-minds-peter-godfrey-smith-review-octopus-philip-hoare">Other Minds</a></em>. It looked at the distinctive intelligence of cephalopods, rescuing this myth-laden eight-limbed creature from its most frequent setting of a seafood salad and recasting it as subaquatic hero of perception and understanding.</p><p>Following up that literary success with 2020’s <em>Metazoa</em> (the word means multicellular animals), Godfrey-Smith is about to publish the final part of his trilogy on the roots of intelligence, <em>Living on Earth: Life, Consciousness and the Making of the Natural World</em>.<
