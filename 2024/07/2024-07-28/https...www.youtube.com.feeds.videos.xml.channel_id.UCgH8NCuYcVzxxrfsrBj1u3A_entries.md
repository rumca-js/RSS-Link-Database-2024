This week I'm discussing ticket prices after a spat broke out in the press and online over what some described as "astronomical" costs to see Sabrina Carpenter at her forthcoming UK shows. She's not the only artist to be hit with criticism about prices and whilst it can be an expensive business,  is it right or necessary to charge fans so much?
