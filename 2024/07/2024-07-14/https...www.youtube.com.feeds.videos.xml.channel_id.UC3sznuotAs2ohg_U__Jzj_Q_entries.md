Inside Out 2 was such a beautiful movie, wasn't it, loyal Theorist? And after a few hits and misses, we're happy that Pixar is back on track with a success. So you just knew that we couldn't let this movie slide. Today we're exploring Riley's psychological state to see what emotions would _really_ be in control of her. Will anxiety, ennui, joy, and anger stick around? Or could other emotions take control? Strap in for one emotional roller coaster!
