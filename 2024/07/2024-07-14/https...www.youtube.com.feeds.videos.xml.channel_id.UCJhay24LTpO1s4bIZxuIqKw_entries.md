When Less Is More: Designing & Decoding Complex Distributed Systems - Jessica Winer & Jacqueline Pan - ACCU 2024
---

How often do we, as engineers, look at some code and wonder “What does this do?” and “Why was this written this way?” Often, the more mature software is, the more likely it is to confuse engineers. It’s only natural that, as new users and workflows are crammed into existing distributed systems over time, that software will become increasingly confounding.

When building your system’s architecture, it is difficult to decide on design tradeoffs. However, having to reverse engineer mature systems to understand those tradeoffs is even more challenging. For many enterprise products, there is an additional layer of complexity for distributed systems span across multiple teams. Each design tradeoff was likely not made in isolation, so stepping back to view the holistic cross-team architecture can often add important context.
