<p>Our team is committed to sharing our love of grimdark fantasy and science fiction in all media—be it books, film, TV or games—in the hopes that you might find a story you love. But, what exactly is grimdark and where does it situate itself relative to other speculative fiction? Although it lacks a formal definition, the term “grimdark” is now commonly used to describe works of fantasy or science fiction that are particularly violent, dystopian, or amoral.
