## Imitation Intelligence, my keynote for PyCon US 2024

<p>I gave an invited keynote at PyCon US 2024 in Pittsburgh this year. My goal was to say some interesting things about AI - specifically about Large Language Models - both to help catch people up who may not have been paying close attention, but also to give people who <em>were</em> paying close attention some new things to think about.</p>

<p>The video is now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1-KQZZarpc&amp;t=248">available on YouTube</a>. Below is a fully annotated version of the slides and transcript.</p>

 

<p>I started with a cold open - no warm-up introduction, just jumping straight into the material. This worked well - I plan to do the same thing for many of my talks in the future.</p>
