Join the cast of Twisters with Daisy Edgar-Jones, Anthony Ramos, Brandon Perea, Glen Powell, Katy O'Brian, and Tunde Adebimpe describing their roles in the film and what it was like to be apart of the film's production.

Kate Cooper (Edgar-Jones) is a former storm chaser haunted by a devastating encounter with a tornado during her college years and now studies storm patterns on screens safely in New York City. However, she's lured back to the open plains by her friend, Javi (Ramos) to test a groundbreaking new tracking system. There, she crosses paths with Tyler Owens (Powell), the charming and reckless social-media superstar who thrives on posting his storm-chasing adventures with his raucous crew.

As storm season intensifies, terrifying phenomena never seen before are unleashed, and Kate, Tyler, and their competing teams find themselves in the paths of multiple storm systems converging over central Oklahoma.

Twisters opens in UK cinemas on July 17, 2024 and US theaters on July 19.
