<p>Attack is likely to fortify sense of grievance his supporters already feel toward political elites as campaign seizes on opportunity to fuel narrative of persecution</p><p>It will be the new must-have for every Donald Trump acolyte. The indelible image of the former US president, ear bloodied and fist raised as Secret Service agents try to rush him away from a would-be assassin’s bullets, has already been turned into <a href="https://officialhodgetwins.com/products/trump-fight-fight-fight-t-shirt">a $35 T-shirt</a> with a simple legend: “Fight! Fight! Fight!”</p><p>The words are taken from Trump’s entreaty as he was bundled off stage in the aftermath of the shooting which left one man dead at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday.

<p>The attempted assassination of the former and would-be president at a rally comes amid growing discord. Violence must be condemned</p><p>The attempted assassination of Donald Trump, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/14/trump-rally-shooting-fbi-names-20-year-old-from-bethel-park-as-subject-involved">injured the former president</a> at a rally for his re-election campaign and killed a spectator, marks a shocking and frightening moment. Political violence is neither a new development nor an aberration for the US. Though thankfully Mr Trump survived, four American presidents have been murdered, along with candidates and holders of lower offices. Many more have faced serious threats to their lives.</p><p>Sometimes such attempts are the work of an individual, such as John Hinckley Jr, who shot and injured Ronald Reagan while mentally ill, or of a small group bent on a particular aim. Sometimes, as with Abraham Lincoln’s murder, they speak to the roiling

It was like a dream and blue and light, and I thought I was in heaven as it was the most beautiful thing I had seen.” And then … “my uncle pulled me out.”</p><p>It seemed an unpromising start to an artistic career.

Often, he points out, they had public personas and identities at odds with their private selves, operating as some of them were “in the claustrophobic sexual and gendered atmosphere of America in the early 1950s” where “any perceived deviancy was automatically suspect”.

<p>An unappreciated ‘hodgepodge’ of a building in Belgium has been opened up into a spacious and unusual home</p><p>For Belgian painter Nils Verkaeren, a home of his own wasn’t strictly necessary. He could just as easily live as a nomad. “In 2002, I didn’t have an official address. I traded two landscape paintings for a Renault Twingo and set off into the wild. I found it quite easy to have nothing. But owning a home also has its charm.”</p><p>But his partner, Eva Wuytjens, needed a place where she felt at home. At first, somewhere in the countryside was their instinct: a logical decision, given that Eva grew up in the country and Nils creates vibrant landscape paintings, preferably in the open air. But also illogical, given their hunger for urban stimuli. “So we decided to search for a home in Antwerp instead,” says Eva. “When we visited this house, right in the city centre, we spontaneously began renovating it in our minds. I understand why many potential buyers backed out: it was a

That one time of the week that I left school at 4pm and watched <em>Neighbours</em> was now gone. I think that’s probably why, when I gave up rowing, I stopped doing any exercise at all. I’d had enough. Exercise for me equated to diehard commitment and someone shouting at me all the time. So I did nothing.

## Labour can end austerity at a stroke – by taxing the rich and taxing them hard | George Monbiot

<p>The focus on growth to ease the UK’s economic ills will not be nearly enough, but there is a way to raise the sums needed</p><p>Never let your opponents define the terms of a debate. All too often, Labour has allowed the Conservatives and the billionaire press to demonise the notion of “tax and spend”. It went to great lengths before the election to assure voters it had no such intention. Now it drives home the message: instead, our needs will be met by “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/08/rachel-reeves-fix-foundations-uk-economy-growth-plan">growth, growth, growth</a>”. But tax and spend is the foundation of a civilised society.</p><p>Few of the changes this country requires can be achieved while adhering to the “<a href="https://labour.org.uk/updates/stories/labour-party-tax-policy-how-we-will-make-the-tax-system-fairer/">tough spending rules</a>” the new government has imposed on itself.

<p>The former research manager of Stanford Internet Observatory talks about her new book exploring propaganda in the digital age – and how she came to be known as ‘CIA Renée’… </p><p>Renée DiResta is a writer and researcher into online manipulation. In 2018, she led a US Senate investigation into the activities of the Russian Internet Research Agency and in 2019 she joined the Stanford Internet Observatory – a non-partisan project to analyse online disinformation. In June this year, after a Republican-led investigation, her contract, along with those of many other staffers, was not renewed, prompting some observers to claim the group <a href="https://www.platformer.news/stanford-internet-observatory-shutdown-stamos-diresta-sio/">was being dismantled</a> due to political pressure.</p><p><strong>What inspired you to write about what you call the “propaganda machine”? <br /></strong>I started to feel that propaganda had fundamentally changed.

<p>An art student’s self-worth is undermined by her boyfriend in the author’s second novel, a subtle tale of a toxic relationship</p><p></p><p></p><p>Rosie Price’s debut novel, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/what-red-was-9781529110784">What Red Was</a></em>, won a place on the <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/13/debut-novelists-of-2019-interviews-bev-thomas">Observer</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/13/debut-novelists-of-2019-interviews-bev-thomas">’s best debuts list in 2019</a>. If her second, <em>The Orange Room</em>, hints at an arching rainbow of titles, let me be flip and say I’m looking forward to yellow. The more profound thread in Price’s work, however, is its dissection of the relationships between sex and power, men and women: <em>What Red Was</em> dealt with the aftermath of a rape, while <em>The Orange Room</em> slowly unravels a toxic affair. Price is concerned with the murkiness of the everyday – her narrative

Watched over by the eight muses for whom the Madrid museum’s Sala de las Musas is named, a tall, famous and angular flamenco dancer called El Yiyo was clicking, clapping, stomping and pirouetting before a rapt, grateful and slightly bemused audience. A few feet away sat the renowned guitarist Rafael Andújar, who had ambled into the <em>sala</em> a few moments earlier, taken his seat and begun to fill the air with notes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/14/madrid-culture-initiative-climate-crisis-summer-heat-air-conditioned-venues"

Whether she’s playing Glastonbury, an arena or a club in Las Vegas, the 56-year-old pop icon is such a pro that you know you’re in safe hands. However, that knowledge doesn’t make tonight’s show in Hyde Park any less dazzling. As she arrives on stage in a red vinyl jumpsuit and launches into the robotic title track from her 2023 album Tension, a current of electricity seems to spread through the crowd. They are hyped up and Kylie can feel it. “Don’t make me cry,” she says dabbing at her eyes. “We only just started.”</p><p>She manages to hold off, and instead blasts through a show so stacked with hits that it leaves you breathless.

Here, she explores the notion of ‘disenfranchised grief’ – and learns how to let her sorrow in</p><p>When I was 17, a girl in my year died suddenly, in her sleep. Natalie was beautiful and very popular. We weren’t friends and we hadn’t really spoken to each other much.

Because I was self-obsessed, I was worried about being accused of using a tragedy to gain traction and social status. I didn’t try to comfort her friends. I didn’t understand that we were going through a collective, communal grief. My shock and sadness seemed fraudulent and I believed the best gift I could give anyone was space.

<p>Wealth is a privilege, and with it comes the obligation of paying tax to benefit society</p><p>‘Let me tell you about&nbsp;the very rich. They are different from you and me,” wrote F&nbsp;Scott Fitzgerald in 1925. “They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves. Even when they enter deep into our world or sink below us, they still think that they are better than we are. They are different.” The delusions of entitlement – that the rich deserve their wealth, privilege and the right to transgress social mores as they choose – are ever-present. In their eyes, wealth can’t just be a by-product of luck, can it? It must, one way or another, be deserved.</p><p>Among the great deformations of the four neoliberal decades through which we have lived are not just the policy catastrophes – monetarism, financial deregulation, austerity, Brexit, the Truss budget – but also the way that wealth genera

<p>(Sony)<br />The south Londoner follows up on viral hit Go with an album of anthemic introspection</p><p>In 2022, emerging singer-songwriter <a href="https://www.catburns.com/">Cat Burns</a>’s song <a href="https://youtu.be/r-go07SLxlU">Go</a> went viral on TikTok. This raw yet soft guitar track would go double platinum, with the south Londoner subsequently gaining three Brit award nominations. Now, 24-year-old Burns’s debut album, <em>Early Twenties, </em>lives up to the hype.</p><p>Imbued with moving gospel richness and an indie sensibility, it’s an introspective but anthemic, English-accented pop collection about growing pains. With chatty, self-effacing candour, Burns ruminates on loneliness, connection, insecurity and self-actualisation. Occasionally, she falls into cliches about kindness or quasi-musical theatre lines (“this is what happens when you’re anxious, so damn anxious, I’m so anxious all the time!”). But the spelled-out frankness is part of her charm, not least for a

<p>In hot weather, a dark bar is more reliable</p><p>When I was newly on the path to matrescence, and every day was like a crawl to the peak of an oxygen-deprived mountain, I used to keep a giant bar of Dairy Milk (back then I liked it) in the car. I would sneak out, after first and second breakfast, lunch, dinner, bedtime, and bite chunks out of it, leaving teeth marks of guilty, desperate, pleasure.</p><p>Then one day summer really did come to England and it all melted.

<p>After the Divorce Reform Act a decade earlier, women were telling their husbands, ‘I’ve had enough!’</p><p>‘When things go wrong, it is now possible for the first time in history for the women in a marriage to say, “I’m off,”’ wrote the <em>Observer</em> in 1976. Since the 1969 Divorce Reform Act, divorces were rocketing – 120,000 petitions a year – but was it inevitably an ‘emotional disaster’ or the ‘unacceptable face of individualism?’ And above all: ‘What about the children?’</p><p>Individual stories gave a more reassuring, recognisable picture. Peter, 40, had ‘achieved an amicable divorce’ with ex-wife Elizabeth, including alternate-week custody of their son, Tony. Both had remarried (Elizabeth to Peter’s best friend Jonathan) and all four met up regularly to discuss Tony’s welfare. Tony, Peter said, ‘felt the draught during the worst months’, but was now thriving. It had been painful, unsurprisingly, but eventually Elizabeth said: ‘We were able to stand back and think, “How c

<p>Monroe plays a dogged, antisocial FBI agent on the trail of Cage’s occult serial killer in the latest buzzy, atmospheric film from Osgood Perkins</p><p>Her FBI colleagues describe Agent Lee Harker (Maika Monroe) as “highly intuitive”. And if the term sounds like federal agency code for something ominous and slightly sinister, that’s because it is. Harker might lack social graces (she’d sooner lurk alone in her coffin-like, wood-lined cabin than engage in small talk), but she has uncanny instincts when reading a crime scene. Or she does for some of the time, at least – it’s a gift that is selective and intermittent. But as jovial, gregarious Agent Carter (Blair Underwood) observes: “Half-psychic is better than not psychic at all.” Carter is clearly the glass-half-full type, particularly if the glass is half full of whisky. He has recruited Harker to work on a confounding cold case, hoping that her abilities may help to get the investigation moving again. What he couldn’t have antici

You could almost term it a “day off”: I visit Berlin’s Mauerpark flea market; I walk around Schlachtensee, one of the closest lakes to the city centre; I sit in a beer garden next to a suburban football pitch; I eat hip but slightly underwhelming Georgian food. To crown it all I see a man wearing the cream and black Ipswich Town away kit of 1996-97. This city never disappoints; like the rest of Germany, it has gladly opened its doors to Euro 2024 revelry while never feeling entirely consumed by it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/14/euro-2024-d

That’s not quite the case with a winemaker: as an old wine trade rule of thumb would have it, it’s easy enough to make a terrible wine out of good grapes, but you simply can’t make a good wine from bad grapes. Still, there is something of the flexible cook’s store-cupboard pragmatism to some of my favourite wines. Certainly, that’s part of the story of one of Argentina’s best whites. When leading winemaker Susana Balbo wanted to make a Bordeaux-style white blend, she had access to plenty of the two key ingredients: sauvignon blanc and semillon. The third, muscadelle, was more elusive. A cunning substitution of the similarly aromatic local grape variety torrontés
