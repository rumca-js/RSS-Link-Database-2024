MMU in use on CD32, not reported as in use on A1200.

There are about 7 or 8 other Commodore Amiga pcs not including the ones in photos. So 10 all together possibly with possibly unopened ones and then separate boxes with keyboards. I plan to post more pictures on this post once I get there to give more context. Just looking for any helpful info or things to look for, and are they worth bringing back and cleaning up? Sorry to be kinda vague, still learning about the Amiga Commodores. ( also the one in the box in the one photo is unopened) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.red
