  <p id="TkrDBG">Alderon Games, the maker of <a href="https://alderongames.com/store/path-of-titans">dinosaur MMO <em>Path of Titans</em></a>, says it's swapping out its Intel 13th and 14th Gen-based servers for AMD and urges others hosting the game’s servers to do the same. The developer has had “significant” instability issues that none of the fixes so far have reversed, <a href="https://alderongames.com/intel-crashes">wrote Alderon founder Matthew Cassells</a> in a blog post last week.</p>

  <p id="8vM2eA">Humans are terrible at remembering things. We forget things over time; we fail to remember them in the first place because we’re also not great at paying attention; we misremember things because of our inherent biases and the way we perceive the world. There’s a lot going on, and we don’t keep much of it for long.</p>
<p id="ONTPXd">Maybe AI can fix that. It sure looks like we’re about to find out. Microsoft, for instance, is making <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24159258/microsoft-recall-ai-explorer-windows-11-surface-event">a big bet on Recall</a>, an app that promises to use AI to collect, store, o

  <p id="a89ZgZ">Conspiracy theories about the shooting at a Trump rally began surfacing on X shortly after the news broke this afternoon, with the platform promoting topics including “#falseflag” and “staged” to users. X owner Elon Musk has staunchly advocated for “free speech” on social media platforms — which can include misinformation like the above.</p>
<p id="B8PUTg">After the shooting, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1812256998588662068">Musk posted</a> that he would “fully endorse” the former president. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-12/elon-musk-donates-to-trump-tapping-vast-fortune-to-swing-2024-race"><em>Bloomberg </em>report
