But, what exactly is grimdark and where does it situate itself relative to other speculative fiction? Although it lacks a formal definition, the term \u201cgrimdark\u201d is now commonly used to describe works of fantasy or science fiction that are particularly violent, dystopian, or amoral. The purpose of this essay is to reconsider this popularly held opinion of grimdark and propose a description that fits how we\u2019ve seen it evolve over the years and where we see it now. The definition proposed herein represents the collective view of the\u00a0Grimdark Magazine\u00a0leadership team. Previous Attempts to Define Grimdark The word \u201cgrimdark\u201d originated from the tagline of the dystopian tabletop war game, Warhammer 40,000, which was introduced in 1987 and famously proclaimed: \u201cIn the grim darkness of the far future there is only w", "id": 863618, "language": "en-AU", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/defining-grimdark-fantasy-and-sf-moving-to-an-inclusive-future", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 137, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Defining Grimdark Fantasy and SF: Moving to an Inclusive Future", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-14T04:25:13+00:00", "description": "<p>Arm of the Sphinx is Josiah Bancroft\u2019s swashbuckling sequel to Senlin Ascends and the second entry in his Books of Babel tetralogy. This second book has a very different feel compared to Bancroft\u2019s debut, which focused almost exclusively on its lead protagonist, Thomas Senlin, a small-town schoolteacher whose honeymoon at the Tower of Babel turns into a Kafkaesque nightmare as he searches for his lost wife, Marya, across stratified layers of absurdity. In contrast, Arm of the Sphinx adopts a more conventional narrative structure, with multiple points of view from Senlin and his companions. Arm of the Sphinx opens with Senlin in the guise of Captain Tom Mudd, an airship pirate causing fear and disruption outside the walls of the Tower of Babel. Senlin\u2019s motley crew includes the scrappy fighter Iren and siblings Adam and Voleta Boreas. Adam is an engineer of questionable loyalty who committed the original sin against Senlin upon his initial entry into the Tower.
