Doherty, who died at 53, almost ten years after she was first diagnosed with breast cancer, was a child actor, most notably on <em>Little House on the Prairie</em>. She was in <em>Heathers</em> in 1988, which is a bright spot on any résumé. But she became an icon as Brenda Walsh on <em>Beverly Hills, 90210</em>, one of the biggest hits of the early '90s and the spark for many teen soaps that came later.
