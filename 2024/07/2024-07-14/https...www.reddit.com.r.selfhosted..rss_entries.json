I\u2019m undecided in which OS or frontend to go with. I\u2019m currently rebuilding my offsite home server with and not so old PC. It has a i5-7500 8GB of ram (will buy another 8GB soon) and two 1tb drives in raid (2Tb total) + 1 250gb ssd. Now, at my home I figured everything out. I want to use TrueNAS Scale on an small SSD, the application pool on an NVME and the storage pool on two 12tb drives in mirror mode. Everything works and I\u2019m happy. Or I\u2019m hoping, still need to order the two 12Tb drives. The problem is, truenas hogs all the boot drive (the 250gb Ssd) to itself, and unable to use the same drive for the apps. I saw guides on how to split the drive, but being 99% away from this server I want stability. I don\u2019t need ProxMox (I think?) or similar as it\u2019ll be used for storage/off site backup and manages 2 camera via Frigate, and Jellyfin for when I\u2019m there.
