<p>Perennial contenders may have been tournament’s great triers but that was not enough against a far superior side</p><p>The metal crinkle of squashed pilsner cans runs up the train carriage like electricity. A song goes up: “his name is Johnny, Johnny fucking Stones, de-der der der der der de-de-de-de der”. An announcement: ‘nächste station, Olympiastadion’. Another song: “Phil Foden’s on fire and he’s playing the Germans off the park.” Doors slide open. The air smells of sweat, piss, bratwurst and possibility.</p><p>There is a montage on the big screen. There are some rondos on the pitch. There is a largely forgettable musical hors d’oeuvres which sounds like a group of guys trapped under the rubble of a collapsed nightclub, screaming for help over a pounding disco beat. Pennants are exchanged. Flags draped over the barriers like beach towels. The Spanish comfortably outnumbered. This could be Benidorm or anywhere.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/

## Mikel Oyarzabal’s late winner for Spain crushes England’s Euro 2024 dream

<p>If football is going home, it is only because this final belonged to Spain. A record fourth ­European ­Championship title was their reward for a splendid performance in ­Berlin, even though it briefly seemed ­England would produce another illogical escape act.</p><p>Anything other than a 27th ­consecutive win for a Spanish team in a final would have been a travesty. They led when their flying wingers combined, Lamine Yamal setting up Nico Williams, and they gathered their thoughts after Cole Palmer’s equaliser. When the substitute, Mikel Oyarzabal, scored with four minutes to go, it was not a surprise. There was no misfortune to Gareth Southgate’s heartache. England were outclassed by Luis de la Fuente’s refined side and it was another occasion when Harry Kane failed to perform on the big stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/14/spain-england-euro-2024-final-european-championship-football">Continue reading...</a>

<p>American tennis player who won 15 grand slams during his career including the Wimbledon men’s singles title in 1953</p><p>The American tennis player and former Wimbledon champion Vic Seixas, who has died aged 100, did not win 15 grand slam titles during a 30-year career by serving his opponents off the court or overpowering them from the ground. Instead Seixas relied on extraordinary conditioning, an indefatigable workrate, hair-trigger reflexes and sheer force of will to compensate for any technical shortcomings.</p><p>Seixas’s fleet-footed athleticism, aggressive net-rushing and superb volleying were tailor-made for the All England Club, where the grass courts were then sown with a seed mix conducive to faster play.

<p>A deliciously minxy Johansson and buttoned-up Channing Tatum make strange bedfellows in this Nixon-era tale of Nasa’s lunar programme</p><p>The 1960s space race has revved up to full throttle; the moon landing is months away. But the public has lost interest in all things Nasa-related. Enter marketing hotshot and professional flimflam artist Kelly Jones (Scarlett Johansson), hired by the Nixon administration to reignite the collective excitement around the space programme. Sparks fly between Kelly, peppy and chic in her tailored suits, and Nasa launch director Cole Davis (Channing Tatum), who carries with him the heavy burden of a previous failed mission and the deaths of three astronauts.</p><p>This chipper romantic drama is aiming for the sweet spot between <em>Down With Love</em>-style battle of the sexes period pastiche and a <em>Mad Men</em>-flavoured conspiracy movie, but this proves to be a tricky mix to navigate. Part of the problem is that while Johansson is deliciously mi
