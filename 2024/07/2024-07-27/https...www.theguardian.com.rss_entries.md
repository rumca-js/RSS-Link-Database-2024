<p>Pre-Tokyo doubts seem absurd after a stunning opening in Tahiti justified holding the event 15,000km away from Paris</p><p>When surfing was added to the Olympics ahead of Tokyo 2020, many in the surf world expressed hesitation. Some even conveyed outright hostility. “Surfing in the Olympics will never work,” offered one observer. Other commentators felt similarly: “Surfing isn’t an Olympic sport for a reason.”</p><p>Some of these reservations were not unfounded. The sport’s reliance on the whims of mother nature make advance planning difficult; good waves and the major city infrastructure needed to host an Olympics rarely go together. There were fears of bad waves and subjective judging. The ultra-commercialised nature of the Games also jarred with the sport’s counter-cultural roots.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/28/teahupoo-delivers-as-decision-to-include-surfing-at-paris-olympics-is-vindicated">Continue reading...</a>

It’s partly what made me want to be a writer.”</p><p>A decade ago the two became acquainted, brought together by an old friend of Myers who was seeing Barker’s daughter. By then, Myers was establishing himself as one of the most electrifying voices in British fiction, setting most of his work, such as the 2013 Gordon Burn prize-winning novel <em><a href="https://www.t

<p>When Mumbai-based photographer Rajesh Vora travelled to Punjab state in 2014, he was struck by the enormous cartoonish sculptures that adorned rooftops across the region’s rural villages. Known as “showpieces”, the artworks double as water tanks and are part of a custom beginning in the 1970s, wherein Punjabi citizens who had immigrated to other parts of the world erected them on top of the homes they’d kept in their native country as a symbol of prosperity. “I was in awe of their grandiosity, elaborate ornamentation and emotional exuberance,” says Vora, who has spent the past few years travelling to more than 150 villages to capture rooftops embellished with everything from aeroplanes to footballers. <em>Everyday Baroque</em>, a collection of these images on display at the Arles festival of photography, tells the story of how “these icons of aspiration are often entwined with the personal histories of their owners”.</p><ul><li><em><a href="https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/expos

<p>Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman’s superhero odd couple are flung together in a gagtastic if sloppy action comedy that maxes out its 15 certificate</p><p>If there’s a more obnoxious film this year, I’ll book myself on an all-expenses trip to “the Void” (a dumping ground for reject mutants, superheroes and sundry franchise miscellanea, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/deadpool">Deadpool</a>, irreverent scamp that he is, describes as “a bit Mad Maxy”). This isn’t unexpected. Obviously this movie is obnoxious. It’s directed by Shawn Levy (<em>Free Guy</em>), whose approach is to deploy cinematic winks and ironic air quotes, and it stars Ryan Reynolds, who has made a career from walking the precarious line that divides lovable from punchable. It isn’t even necessarily a bad thing: a film can be obnoxious and simultaneously very funny, and <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> is frequently hilarious.

The 25-year-old dispossessed one opponent just inside the Spanish half before setting off on a solo 40m run, brushing off another defender, drawing the keeper, and flicking the ball high into the top right corner.

Growing up in Glasgow, I went to the island several times as a child, played mini golf at Brodick and spent hours combing beaches for perfectly smooth, multicoloured stones. My husband’s family used to decamp from London for long summer holidays too: stories of three-year-olds trudging up Goatfell – the island’s tallest peak at 874 metres – are the stuff of family fable.</p><p>We have two children of our own now – Henry, eight, and Isobel, five – and we brought them back to this beautiful Firth of Clyde island in May half-term.

 According to the Associated Press (AP), the order comes in response to rocket fire that Israel says originates from the area.
