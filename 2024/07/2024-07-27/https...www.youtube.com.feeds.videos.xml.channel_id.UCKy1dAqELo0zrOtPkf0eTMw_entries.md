Deadpool and Wolverine has arrived and with it come sky-high expectations for how it will shake up the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman undoubtedly bring their all to the first-ever R-rated MCU movie, but the superhero buddy comedy consistently falls victim to the same shoddy storytelling tendencies that got the franchise into choppy waters in the first place. Join us on location at San Diego Comic-Con as we discuss what effect Deadpool and Wolverine will have on the MCU.

Presented by Alien: Romulus. Experience it in IMAX. In theaters everywhere August 16th.

In space, no one can here you scream. But at San Diego Comic-Con, the cast and director of Alien: Romulus gave us plenty to hoot and holler about. Director Fede Alvarez and his cast - Cailee Spaeny, Isabela Merced, Archie Renaux, and Spike Fearn - joined us to tease what's sure to be the most horrifically goopy movie of the summer. The franchise is in good hands: Alvarez directed 2013's Evil Dead remake, which modernized the granddaddy of "cabin in the woods" movies to great effect. Alvarez discusses how all that bloody knowledge made its way into Alien: Romulus, plus the lasting legacy of Ridley Scott and James Cameron's work on Alien and Aliens.

We are on our way to San Diego Comic-Con and IGN’s Ben Watts is on the road to pick up Max Scoville and Akeem Lawanson. Together they chat about their favorite moments and what they are excited to see this year at Comic-Con.

San Diego Comic-Con is back in a big way. After last year’s strike-affected and somewhat muted celebration (which still saw popular headliners like Star Wars Outlaws , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem , The Creator , and Spider-Man 2 ), 2024’s edition is shaping up to be a return to form for fans of movies, TV, games, comics, and collectibles.

San Diego Comic-Con is from Wednesday, July 24, 2024 - Sunday, July 28, 2024
