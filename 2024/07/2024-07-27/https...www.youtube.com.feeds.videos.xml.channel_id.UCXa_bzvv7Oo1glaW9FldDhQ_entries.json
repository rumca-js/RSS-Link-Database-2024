This year's iteration aims to go further beyond, providing the option to make a team and compete against the best to rise to the top.\n\nOf course, it's easier said than done when you need to balance various facilities, manage the Mentality and confidence of your Drivers, improve and fine-tune vehicles, negotiate contracts, meet sponsor expectations and much more. The wealth of options in Create A Team means several unique starts and challenges while expertly capturing the tension of Race Day.\n\nIt has several flaws, from the oddly handled contracts system and Drivers communicating phantom occurrences to iffy crash physics. However, F1 Manager 2024 offers a compelling depiction of the highs and lows of the sport behind the scenes with some good production values.", "id": 941658, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8UmU1dv7_Y", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Z8UmU1dv7_Y/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "F1 Manager 2024 Review - Can This Automobile Sim Take Pole Position?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-27T14:00:46+00:00", "description": "Fallout 5 may not be coming anytime soon, but for longtime fans of the franchise, there's something else to dive into. Fallout: London, an ambitious mod in the works for years, is finally available on PC. It explores the post-apocalypse across the ocean as players escape a mysterious facility to discover their true identity.\n\nWhile it's not leaps and bounds ahead of Fallout 4 in visuals, Fallout: London captures the city's atmosphere in incredible detail while adding new weapons, enemies, and much more. Team FOLON is touting 200 quests, 20 factions, full voice acting for its extensive cast of characters, and even a revamped soundtrack.\n\nThough it has several issues concerning optimization, Fallout: London is worth playing for fans of the series.
