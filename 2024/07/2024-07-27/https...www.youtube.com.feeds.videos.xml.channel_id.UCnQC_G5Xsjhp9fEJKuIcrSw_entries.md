Victor Davis Hanson is a distinguished classicist, military historian, and prolific commentator on contemporary geopolitics. Hanson‚Äôs latest work, "The End of Everything: How Wars Descend into Annihilation", delves into the unsettling parallels between the conflicts of antiquity and our modern symptoms of decline. In today‚Äôs episode, we discuss the reverberations of the war in the Middle East, the merits of federalism, and the consequences of a possible Trump victory. As we navigate an era marked by rapid change and global uncertainty, Victor Davis Hanson's insights prove the enduring relevance of classical wisdom in today‚Äôs world. This is a conversation you don‚Äôt want to miss!
