There have been episodes about smartphones and 3D printers that use sci-fi nonsense to complicate the concepts in a way that makes them funny. That has largely continued to be true over many years (and cancellations). But in its Hulu revival last year, the show really started to mess up the balance, and its topical jokes began to overshadow the sci-fi gags. <a h", "id": 941323, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/24206898/futurama-season-12-review-hulu-nft-ai", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "source_obj__id": 359, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Futurama\u2019s new season struggles to make NFTs and AI funny", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-27T14:00:00+00:00", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"Chrome page showing The Verge, with tab groups on top, surrounded by artistic illustrations.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MiR_bW9joxH1l7h0D0d_QXIqDZ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73485522/HT038_S_Haddad_Chrome_Tabs.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Illustration by Samar Haddad / The Verge</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"wjyD1c\">I\u2019ve got a stack of bookmarked, favorited, and saved-for-later web articles that I\u2019m going to get around to reading one day\u2026 but haven\u2019t.
