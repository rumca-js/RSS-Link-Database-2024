Don't cheap out on a PSU, and don't build your own. Buy one from our sponsor Seasonic instead: https://lmg.gg/FCS627 or learn more about what the have coming at https://seasonic.com/news/computex-2024/

Ever thought about trying to assemble your own power supply out of a few separate parts? You probably shouldn’t, but we definitely did. Is it a competent power supply? How does it compare to higher end power supplies like those you might find from Seasonic?
