I have a handful of 16 GB ram cards. Would it be worth while to upgrade this laptop to 32 GB ram or would that be unnecessary?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have services running on my LAN, that the wife and I access through a public DNS that is pointing to internal IP addresses. I already feel this isn't a good move. But anyway, it isn't accessible by anybody that is not in my LAN, so I don't care much.</p> <p>When I am out of my lan, I access those services via tailscale. However, I need to use the tailscale IP addresses as my DNS points to an IP that will be invalid outside of my lan. I don't use their name stuff since I have a reserse proxy and I want to keep it tidy.</p> <p>I played around having a local DNS server with the internal IPs, and the public DNS server with the tailscale IPs. It works flawlessly... depending on the browser. The wife uses chrome, and it refuses to respect the local DNS server, I imagine due to DNS over HTTPS. My attempts were with `dnsmasq`.</p> <p>What would be the smart approach here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user

Now I have been using seafile to a great extent, however, I have just realized how it ruins any symlink converting it to a file with the target content. There are several open tickets related to this issue and this won't be solved as it has been the case for much of the other glitches of the software.</p> <p>I know there is an ugly workaround somewhere in github implemented by a good soul, which I would avoid at all costs unless someone can report a good experience with it.</p> <p>I tried to install owncloud to try to check for the correct handling of symlinks, but get stuck trying to find the proper installation steps.</p> <p>At this point I am really considering using rsync over my cl

Can the operator of the network log all packets? And rebuild or instantiate a new connection to my vpn server like clone the connection?</p> <p>Does OpenVPN packets are encrypted using a private key or public key from my laptop device that a sniffing party will never see or have using this method?</p> <p>Or can they have advantage or abuse my vpn connection and or server? By acting they are me?</p> <p>Or is a vpn connection checked using more then keys and ips rules? Like a device identifier as header on packets or special crc. Check based on timestamp and device id?</p> <p>Or is it not secure at all?</p> <p>As example maybe better use tailscale or Wireguard for t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I'm trying to find a way where I can run 2 instances of the same game on my one computer while I play one of them and my friend remotely joins the other one but still utilizing my pcs recourses (mainly the gpu) so far ive thought abt setting up a VM like hyper-v and enabling gpu passthrough as I've heard hyper-v allows for that. Then I thought of either letting him use the VM through remote desktop connection but I'm thinking running a dedicated cloud gaming software like Parsec would probably make for a smoother experience... But then again I have no idea if this will work, in theory it should.. And thoughts that might help me out with this? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WolfDale11"> /u/WolfDale11 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ed3h4l/wanna_game_with_a_friemd/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ed3

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Networking noob here, be gentle</p> <p>I have a domain that I have purchased and the registrar included it in EasyDNS.</p> <p>I have a local Ubuntu box running on my home network (Verizon FIOS) and in that I want to run an nginx instance to serve content, such that when somebody outside my network types in my domain, this box handles the request.</p> <p>I think I understand some it, mainly that in my registrars UI I need to add a record to my domain that points to my IP, but the issue is Verizon FIOS does not allow static IPs on residential accounts.</p> <p>What steps, if any, do I need to undertake to achieve the desired result?</p> <p>For additional context, I’m a SWE but I never play in the hosting/networking world, so I’m looking to beef up my understanding of deployments a bit here; so feel free to assume I can work through whatever technical steps you might need to include.</p> <p>Cheers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href
