## Easy breezy: pretty broderie anglaise for summer cool

<p>A summer wardrobe regular, broderie anglaise, with its cutout eyelets, is cool, floaty and lightweight – in other words the perfect fabric for the season</p><p>There are two ways to play it. The first is to embrace the romanticism of the look: think crisp white poplin dresses, tie-front tops, petticoats and visions of idyllic picnics and lounging in summer meadows. Susan Fang’s frilled broderie anglaise concoctions (left) unashamedly lean into the romance of the trend – as did the finale dresses at Chanel’s recent resort show in Marseille. Get the look with Madewell’s tank dress (£159) and Zara’s cutwork midi style (£55.99), or hit up a vintage market for a bargain.</p><p>The other option is to mix things up. A broderie anglaise shirt, for example, is a useful beach cover-up over a bikini. Try New Look (£22.99) or Y.A.S’s scalloped cuff style (£70) from asos.com. Balance the flounce factor by styling it with denim shorts or wide-leg jeans for a festival or weekend barbecue. Swap wh

<p>Tension palpable as three Chinese swimmers cleared by Wada for doping offences in 2021 compete in the pool</p><p>There were cheers and squeals and fluttered flags, sustained and perhaps a little pointed, as Zhang Yufei walked out for the women’s 100m butterfly semi-final at 8.38pm inside the agreeably boisterous La&nbsp;Defénse&nbsp;Arena.</p><p>Zhang waved and smiled, always looking straight ahead, then reeled off a 56.15sec race to take second place and book a spot in the final. All Olympic athletes need to find that neutral space, to close out the noise, to create a kind of light around themselves. In Zhang’s case, as with 10 other Chinese swimmers in Paris, this will involve a note of additional defiance at a competition already charged with its own note of wider&nbsp;tension.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/27/paris-olympics-china-swimming-zhang-yufei-fei-lewei-qin-haiyang">Continue reading...</a>

<p>US fencing was rocked by internal strife at the Tokyo Games. The lead-up to Paris 2024 hasn’t been much better</p><p>Just when it appeared as if these Olympics couldn’t get any more scandalous, between the poison in the pool and the security issues, the fencing starts this weekend.</p><p>A fixture on the program since the 1896 Summer Games, which kicked off the modern Olympiad, fencing is the sport where old-world tradition meets new-world technology. Referees actually say “en garde” before the swordplay, and points are scored electronically to keep pace with blink-and-you’ll-miss-it touches of steel. The rules of engagement are complicated, and it’s down to the referee to determine which strikes are legal. That’s a lot of room for interpretation. And, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGWZ13gxTxc&amp;ab_channel=PABLOTORREFINDSOUT">some would have us believe</a>, corruption.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/27/fencing-enters-olympics-under-clou

## ‘Hold on to your seats’: how much will AI affect the art of film-making?

<p>The future is here, whether some like it or not, and artificial intelligence is already impacting the film industry. But just how far can, and should, it go?</p><p>Last year, Rachel Antell, an archival producer for documentary films, started noticing AI-generated images mixed in with authentic photos. There are always holes or limitations in an archive; in one case, film-makers got around a shortage of images for a barely photographed 19th-century woman by using AI to generate what looked like old photos. Which brought up the question: should they? And if they did, what sort of transparency is required? The capability and availability of generative AI – the type that can produce text, images and video – have changed so rapidly, and the conversations around it have been so fraught, that film-makers’ ability to use it far outpaces any consensus on how.</p><p>“We realized it was kind of the wild west, and film-makers without any mal-intent were getting themselves into situations where

She and her twin sister, Katherine, make up the Tyler Twins, professional photographers who specialise in celebrity portraits, events and concerts. Past subjects include Jay-Z, Whoopi Goldberg and Lady Gaga.</p><p>Mariel took this image in 2015. “Normally when we shoot professionally, we pass the camera back and forth. Whoever is not shooting is directing. We rarely remember, or care, who took what shot. It’s always a joint effort,” Mariel says. “This shot was entirely spontaneous.

Not one. But on Sunday, the young nation will make its Olympic basketball debut against Puerto Rico in Lille. It is a remarkable story of resilience, unity and hope – with a strong Australian flavour.</p><p>South Sudan, in central Africa, declared independence from Sudan in 2011 following a protracted, bloody civil war. The world’s youngest country remains wracked by internal turmoil. But when retired British-South Sudanese basketball star Luol Deng received a phone call from his brother in 2019, it came with an intriguing offer. The government of South Sudan wanted someone to run its nascent basketball program; would Deng help?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/27/paris-olympics-2024-basketball-australia-south-sudan-luol-deng-schedule-group-c">Continue r
