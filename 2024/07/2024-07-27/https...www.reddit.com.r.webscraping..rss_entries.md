<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im trying to scrape <a href="https://www.bestprice.gr/cat/806/mobile-phones/f/1_26/samsung.html">this</a> website. I had already figured out how to scrape this website but they removed the pages and now new products load when srcolling, for a page with many products. I tried to scrape with selenium but im getting a 403 error. Then i tried to use selenium-wire using the proper headers and i still get the error.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/abki12c"> /u/abki12c </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1edtaem/getting_403_error_when_trying_to_scrape_a_website/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1edtaem/getting_403_error_when_trying_to_scrape_a_website/">[comments]</a></span>
