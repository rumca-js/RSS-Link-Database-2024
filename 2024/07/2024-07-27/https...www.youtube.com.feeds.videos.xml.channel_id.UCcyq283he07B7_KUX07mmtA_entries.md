Hagoromo has been described as "the Rolls-Royce" of chalk." The formerly Japanese, now Korean brand's chalk is known for its smooth consistency, vibrancy, and being nearly dust-free. But the brand almost disappeared in 2015, which sent its loyal fans into a frenzy, buying up lifetime supplies before the factory shut down.
