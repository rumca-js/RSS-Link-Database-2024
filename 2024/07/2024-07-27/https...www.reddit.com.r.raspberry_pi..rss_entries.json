When referencing the IO Board schematics I see that they have a 100Uf cap through which the 5V lines are connected. I was confused as to why such a large bulk capacitance was needed near the power rails. Most design guide/IC layout/Bypass cap placement sources note each VDD pin on an IC should have its own 0.1uf bypass. Is the 100u / such a large tantalum on the power supply pins really needed to stabilize the transient response for the CM4? I doubt it\u2019s doing very much in terms of filtering high frequency noise </p> <p>Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HobbyBoard_45\"> /u/HobbyBoard_45 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1edi1ix/100uf_tantalum_on_rpi_cm4_io_board/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1edi1ix/100uf_tantalum_on_rpi_c", "id": 941247, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1edi1ix/100uf_tantalum_on_rpi_cm4_io_board", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "source_obj__id": 470, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "100uf Tantalum on RPI CM4 IO Board", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
