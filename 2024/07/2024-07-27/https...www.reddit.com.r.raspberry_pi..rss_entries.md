## 100uf Tantalum on RPI CM4 IO Board

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, </p> <p>I’m currently designing my own CM4 carrier board. When referencing the IO Board schematics I see that they have a 100Uf cap through which the 5V lines are connected. I was confused as to why such a large bulk capacitance was needed near the power rails. Most design guide/IC layout/Bypass cap placement sources note each VDD pin on an IC should have its own 0.1uf bypass. Is the 100u / such a large tantalum on the power supply pins really needed to stabilize the transient response for the CM4? I doubt it’s doing very much in terms of filtering high frequency noise </p> <p>Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HobbyBoard_45"> /u/HobbyBoard_45 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1edi1ix/100uf_tantalum_on_rpi_cm4_io_board/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1edi1ix/100uf_tantalum_on_rpi_c
