The protagonist is understandably pushing further and further, kicking everything that gets in his way while the efforts of the opposing gangs amp up in response.\n\nIt's a reasonable exercise and one that can be fun. What begins as an objective to blaze through levels as quickly as possible can become measured and intuitive - where learning the layout and enemy placements becomes second nature. The different sneakers and their abilities add to this in terms of strategy and ridiculousness.\n\nWhile Anger Foot has some issues, from the lack of checkpoints and multiple ways to die instantly - one would have been preferable over the other - it's still an adrenaline rush with reasonable bits of humor.", "id": 849964, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al2qUtMn7Zk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/Al2qUtMn7Zk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Anger Foot Review - Kicking Enemies Never Felt So Good", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-11T15:30:02+00:00", "description": "Brutal realism isn\u2019t always a favored mechanic for gamers.
