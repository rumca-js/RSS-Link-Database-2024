Now, a strategy based on the use of vitamin C is developed to stabilize organic semiconductors. Vitamin C scavenges reactive oxygen species and inhibits their generation, improving the performance and stability of organic semiconductors and their electronic devices.", "id": 846206, "language": "en", "link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01939-4", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.nature.com/nmat/current_issue/rss", "source_obj__id": 231, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Vitamin C stabilizes n-type organic semiconductors", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
