<p>We know Starmer is in No 10, the Tories in disarray but what lies beneath should worry the entire political class</p><p>Don’t forget that the word <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z1jRy-lj9w">landslide</a> has another meaning, freighted with danger. Soil comes loose and the ground fails. Solid land turns semi-liquid under your feet. Without warning, rocks come crashing down. A vast river of mud covers roads, levels homes. What was once safe territory turns lethal.<br /><br />
 No one at Westminster this week wants refreshers in geology, and who can blame them? Much more pleasant to talk of mandates, of Britain as an oasis of political stability, of the orderly transition of power in the mother of all parliaments. Yet this general election shows us that the landscape for both government and official opposition is growing ever more treacherous.<br /><br />
 It’s not just the fact that Keir Starmer has scooped a Tony Blair-style majority on Jeremy Corbyn-style polling. It’s a

<p><strong>11 July 1964</strong>: Crowds line the streets as the four musicians visit their home city for the northern premiere of A Hard Day’s Night </p><p>The Beatles returned to Liverpool last night to attend the northern premiere of their film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058182/">A Hard Day’s Night</a> and, presumably, to put an end to the rumours that their popularity on Merseyside was on the wane.</p><p>In case any readers have just come from Mars, the Beatles are the four long-haired musicians who sing rock’n’roll music and have become as permanent a part of the Liverpool scene as the sight of ferry boats on the Mersey. But, unlike the Mersey ferries the Beatles have been playing in foreign waters: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/31/guardian190-beatlemania-new-york-1964">America</a>, Australia, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/18/mersey-beaucoup-the-beatles-in-paris-1964">France</a>, and what is even

Why do these kids have so much independence, while other countries are so risk-averse? </p><p>It’s 1.30pm. Nila and Arion arrive home after finishing school for the day. They let themselves in, make some food, then sit down to do homework, or practise piano, or do the housework they’ve been asked to do. Their parents won’t be home for a few hours yet. The children sometimes go out with friends to play in the street or wander the fields.
