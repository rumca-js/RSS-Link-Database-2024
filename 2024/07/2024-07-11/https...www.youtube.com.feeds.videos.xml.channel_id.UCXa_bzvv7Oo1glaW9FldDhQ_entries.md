Between its disgusting (in a somewhat good way) aesthetic, crime-ridden city and a thumping soundtrack, Anger Foot is an assault on the senses. The protagonist is understandably pushing further and further, kicking everything that gets in his way while the efforts of the opposing gangs amp up in response.

It's a reasonable exercise and one that can be fun. What begins as an objective to blaze through levels as quickly as possible can become measured and intuitive - where learning the layout and enemy placements becomes second nature. The different sneakers and their abilities add to this in terms of strategy and ridiculousness.

While Anger Foot has some issues, from the lack of checkpoints and multiple ways to die instantly - one would have been preferable over the other - it's still an adrenaline rush with reasonable bits of humor.

Brutal realism isn’t always a favored mechanic for gamers. If it’s shoehorned into an FPS or action- adventure without there being wider context for it then it just feels unnecessary. 

What the games featured on this rundown demonstrate though is that when realism is thoughtfully implemented, with actions having very real consequences, then there’s really no more brutal a gameplay feature that’ll haunt the mind of the player long before your characters have respawned. 

A game’s setting is crucial here too, that’s why numerous featured in this rundown take place against the backdrop of devastating war, hostile wilderness, or (perhaps not quite as realistically) zombie apocalypse. 

Also of note are the games which don’t just feature death as punishment, but explore the consequences of surviving in terms of mental health and morale.

## We NEED To Talk About Xbox Game Pass...

Microsoft recently announced that is increasing the subscription prices for all tiers of Game Pass, and that it is discontinuing the current base Xbox Game Pass console tier. 

That is going to be replaced in the coming months with the new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier, which, crucially, will not include access to day one releases. The price increase in and of itself is perhaps not entirely surprising, even if it obviously stings. 

With the removal of day one releases from all console Game Pass tiers except the costliest one – which will now cost $20 per month – Microsoft has once again fallen into what was an easily avoidable pit, and in the process muddied the messaging. What sort of damage will that do to Game Pass, if any?
