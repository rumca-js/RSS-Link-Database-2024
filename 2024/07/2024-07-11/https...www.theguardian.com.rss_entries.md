<p>Wearing a soggy, stinky bracelet shows you’re part of a something communal, which is the very opposite of haute couture</p><p>There is a moment during any music festival when I want to tear my skin off and go home. It’s not after the two-plus days of wet wipe “showers”. Or the thigh burn from hovering above a toilet seat (if there is one). Or even the powerful smell of aged cheese and human waste that’s released from the ground on the final day. This moment can happen minutes, even seconds, into the weekend. And it will continue to happen many times a day for however long the thing goes on.</p><p>This moment is triggered whenever I have to wash my hands, and the dangly bit of the wristband will inevitably get wet and stay like that for at least an hour. Maybe longer. You can ignore it for a while, but then you’ll give someone dressed like a banana a high five and you will feel it, moist and scratching, against your forearm. If you’re wearing long sleeves, forget about it. It will p

Come July, they were heavy with plump fruit the colour of vamp nail polish. Some years I got the lion’s share, and others the birds beat me to it. Cherries are perfectly delicious plucked straight from the tree, but their intense, bright flavour should be celebrated beyond just pie filling. They have a sweet-sour flavour that is not only irresistible in bakes, it also provides a zippy contrast to rich cheese or fatty meat such as pork and duck.

<p>We need to keep open offbeat DIY spaces that belong to artists and communities. Even if the odd performance sells zero tickets, they push theatre forward</p><p>It feels like a lifetime ago. In 2011, I was appointed director of Camden People’s theatre in London, initially as a job-share with my partner Jenny Paton. Neither of us had run a venue before. Jenny was a producer; I co-ran a touring theatre company, with a sideline as comedy critic for this newspaper. We got the job as we were raising our first child, then aged one. It was a new chapter of life. We were going to make this flyblown corner of Hampstead Road a hothouse of radical theatre! But first we had to unblock the loos.</p><p>In week one, the director of an Italian production of Hamlet emailed to cancel his scheduled run. I mentioned that that would incur a small fee.

This film promises to be different every time it’s shown, thanks to software that randomly selects different scenes (with bleepy, glitchy little interludes to remind us what’s it’s doing). The gimmick is entirely on-brand for Eno, who has been dabbling in generative music (music determined by a preordained set of parameters, that never repeats itself) since the 1990s, and who has never met an artistic process he couldn’t question, dismantle and rearrange in a novel way. From his early days gilding Roxy Music with a futuristic edge, to his avant garde solo works, to his production duties on classic albums by the likes of David Bowie, U2 and Talkin

I want her to be loved only the way I love her: as the author of a few specific pieces of writing.</p><p>I’m not alone in this feeling.

It’s like chancing across a bunch of eerily gifted kids by the roadside putting on a bizarrely accomplished, very extended series of magic tricks and circus acrobatic stunts. You could at first find it very startling and funny, then a little dull but finally after an hour or so enter a home stretch of being just stunned at the simple fact that it is still going on, and at such a pitch of crazy inventiveness you can’t help but feel awe at this film’s absolute dedication to gag productivity.</p><p>Director Mike Cheslik and his lead actor and co-writer Ryland Brickson Cole Tews mix live action with homespun animation in black-and-white, in the style of Buster Keaton and Chuck Jones’s Looney Tunes creations.
