Once Human throws you into a strange post apocalyptic world, and it’s your job to figure out how to survive, but you don’t need to do it alone.  Whether it’s building a base or fighting grotesque monstrosities, some things are just more fun to do with a buddy. But in order to do that you need to be in the same world, on the same server. So how do you do that, and if you already have characters, how do you change servers? In this video, we’ll show you exactly how to do it

In today's all-dragon Daily Fix:
Bioware is teasing some nudity in their upcoming action-RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard. We'll be seeing som top nudty, but it's unclear if we're getting bottom nudity, as well. BioWare did say this was a mature game, and seems to follow the trend set by other RPGs like The Witcher 3 and Baldur's Gate 3. In other dragon news, Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake is getting some graphics options, such as a 4k 30fps quality mode, and a lower-res 60fps performance mode. Square Enix is also adding new story elements and improving other features from the original 1988 game. And finally, Double Dragon is back, with a new entry recently announced titled "Double Dragon Revive." The game will be handled by Yukes and published by ArcSystem Works, so there's some pretty decent fighting game pedigree behind the scenes.

Demi Moore gives a career best performance as Elisabeth Sparkle, a former A-lister past her prime and suddenly fired from her fitness TV show by repellent studio head Harvey (Dennis Quaid).

All it takes is one injection and she is reborn – temporarily – as the gorgeous, twenty-something Sue (Margaret Qualley). The only rule? Time needs to be split: exactly one week in one body, then one week in the other. No exceptions. A perfect balance. What could go wrong?

## The First Descendant Review

Don't miss our The First Descendant review by Travis Northup on PC and Xbox, also available on PlayStation.

The First Descendant has all the building blocks of a fantastic looter shooter, but they’re buried under a pile of monotonous quests, a terrible story, and an infuriating free-to-play model that has influenced its game design in the worst possible way. In its best moments, blasting aliens apart with both fireballs and a satisfying arsenal of weapons makes for a really great time – but at least an equal portion of my time was spent battling perplexing design decisions that tested the limits of my abundant patience. Like its peers, future updates could evolve this live-service into a much more consistently enjoyable way to spend time with friends, but for now it misses the mark too often to make its grind feel worthwhile.
