I've got a nano pi r4s running dietpi and several apps.</p> <p>I've just recently bought a domain and setup caddy w/ reverse proxies for PhotoPrism and JellyFin currently.</p> <p>Was proud to get them working on my cellphone but quickly realized it wasn't working when back on wifi or my desktop.</p> <p>I've been doing some research and I've seen a few options.</p> <p>NAT Hairpinning, Split DNS, IPV6 are the main ones I've read.</p> <p>Currently I'm running a router using openwrt(work one) but it has the web gui disabled and I have limited network settings. I can update DNS server, port forwarding and static ips. I currently have Adguard home setup as a DNS sinkhole through the router and it works well </p> <p>What is my best option in 2024? </p> <p>I'm looking into grabbing an extra router from work and flashing stock openwrt not our custom firmware.</p>

That means I can receive email sent from other servers (Gmail and Disroot are services that I have tested sending from), but I cannot send email out to any servers. When attempting to do that, the connection is timed out.</p> <p>Thinking to solve this issues, two solutions come into my mind:<br /> - Accept incoming on port 25 as normal, but outgoing will use port 26 (or just any number that I feels like) by configuring the SMTP service to do that itself.<br /> - Redirect anything that comes out of port 25 to 27, then anything comes into port 27 to 26, and preserve destination address and port.</p> <p>The second one looks like dead end to me. My first thought is to use iptables to achieve that but I'm not familiar with it

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I'm relatively new to the world of domains, DNS, and all that jazz, and I am looking to go more in-depth. Currently, I self-host a VPN server using Wireguard on an Ubuntu server. It's working great, and I'm able to access my LAN from work or school. Currently, I use it via a DDNS address I got from No-IP due to my residential internet connection being a dynamic IP. However, I soon got bored of that and wanted to get my own domain working. I went on Namecheap, bought a cheap domain relevant to me, and got to a stage where I could point the domain to resolve to my public IP. I didn't get much further than that before I became overwhelmed. I am trying to do this: Have a subdomain like VPN.mydomain.net lead to my VPN server while having mydomain.net and other subdomains point to something else. Could anyone here point me in the right direction to get started? Or is this out of reach for someone with a dynamic public IP?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <
