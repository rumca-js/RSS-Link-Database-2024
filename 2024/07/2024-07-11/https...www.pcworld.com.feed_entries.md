<p>Whether you&rsquo;re an off-road enthusiast, a safety-conscious camper, or just someone living in a state with frequent power outages, you should have a portable charger, backup lantern, and emergency radio.</p>



<p>And with <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Innopower-10000mAh-Hand-Crank-Radio-Emergency-Radio-Solar-Radio-NOAA-AM-FM-Weather-Radio-USB-Type-C-Charging-Radios-Portable-LED-Reading-Light-SOS-Co/5044297485?athbdg=L1800">this Innopower gadget now just $26 at Walmart</a>, down from $60, you can have it all in one device&mdash;plus more.</p>



<p>Frankly, calling this gadget an &ldquo;emergency radio&rdquo; is doing it a disservice. This thing is an emergency Swiss Army Knife, fully equipped to keep you safe, in contact, and in the know during emergencies.</p>



<p>This Innopower device includes:</p>



<ul>

<p>Security researchers from Morphisec recently <a href="https://blog.morphisec.com/cve-2024-38021-microsoft-outlook-moniker-rce-vulnerability">discovered a serious security hole in Outlook</a>. Called CVE-2024-38021, this is a zero-click remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability that can allow unauthorized access to your system without a single click.</p>



<p>The issue apparently affects most Microsoft Outlook applications and doesn&rsquo;t require any user authentication. In the worst-case scenario, CVE-2024-38021 can lead to potential data leaks, unauthorized access, execution of malicious code, and other dangers.</p>

To avoid such tests of patience, however, it&rsquo;s not just a matter of having a good broadband connection &mdash; your surfing speed also depends on the browser you use.</p>



<p>When interpreting HTML, executing scripts, or loading graphics and videos, browsers like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox often perform differently.

<p>As of 2024, Windows now collects more data about you than ever before, and it&rsquo;s a real point of concern for privacy enthuasists.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not just that the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2344411/windows-11-recall-ai-feature-privacy-nightmare.html">recently announced Recall feature is a privacy nightmare</a>, but Windows 11 is already collecting all kinds of data as far as what you&rsquo;re doing, what you&rsquo;re using, and more. Some of it&rsquo;s necessary for the main system to function, but not all of it is.</p>



<p>Fortunately, a lot of Windows 11&rsquo;s data collection is optional. You can decline the tracking during initial setup, or turn most of it off after the fact&mdash;even if <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2354686/microsoft-blocks-windows-11-workaround-local-accounts.html">Microsoft is making it more difficul
