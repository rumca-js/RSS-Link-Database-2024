<p>The German Navy is in need of a serious upgrade for its fleet of submarine frigates and we’re not talking about a digital upload or some kind of software patch. The country’s fleets of submarine frigates have operated on old-fashioned, 8-inch floppy disks since they were commissioned back in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Now the German Navy is trying to find a way to replace the outdated disk system that are “vital to the running of its Brandenburg class F123 frigates,” according to <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/german-navy-aims-to-replace-aging-8-inch-floppy-drives-with-an-emulated-solution-for-its-anti-submarine-frigates"><em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Replacing the floppy disk system won’t be an easy task. These disks pretty much control everything on the ships from airflow systems to power generation. Does the German Navy still use Palm Pilots to organize its codewords and Tamagotchi to train its recruits in marine wi

<p>This year is no different: we’re already starting to see early Prime Day deals trickle in that members can take advantage of. Plus, there are also a number of solid tech deals available on Amazon that aren’t explicitly tied to July Prime Day, but are likely to get lumped in with the rest of the discounts anyway.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/joby-aviation/">Joby Aviation</a> says a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hydrogen/">hydrogen-powered</a> version of its electric vertical takeoff and landing (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/evtol/">eVTOL</a>) aircraft successfully completed a 523-mile test flight. The only byproduct from the prototype, which has a liquid hydrogen fuel cell and hydrogen-electric propulsion system, was water vapor. The company suggested that the test flight points toward a future of emissions-free regional aviation in an industry that still relies heavily on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>This is believed to be the first liquid hydrogen-powered eVTOL forward flight. Joby kept the same shell and most of the guts of its battery-electric <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/air-taxi/">air taxi</a> but it reduced the battery load and installed a fuel tank that can store up to 40 kilograms of liquid hydrogen.

## Starlink Mini is now widely available and doesn't need a residential subscription

<p>You can now get a Starlink Mini in the US, wherever you are and even if you're not paying for a residential subscription. SpaceX started offering select users the new Starlink dish model that's small enough to fit in a backpack in late June. Despite its small size that makes it easy to transport and carry around, the Mini used to require an existing $150 standard service plan — you could only tack on the Mini Roam service for an additional fee of $30 a month. Now, you can get it on its own <a href="https://www.starlink.com/roam">with a roaming service</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mobile regional plan costs $150 a month and will give you access to unlimited data. It's probably the better option if you live in an RV or travel to remote locations for extended periods of time. Meanwhile, the Mini Roam plan costs $50 a month and will give you access to 50GB of data, which is likely enough if you don't live on the road full time. Take note that you can use Mini Roam in motion anytime, as long a

Resembling not at all the original two-door <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/classic-cars/105874/ford-capri-a-history-1969-to-1986">pony-style fastback</a> that debuted in 1968, the new Capri will instead be a four-door electric vehicle built on Volkswagen's MEB platform and be sold only in Europe.</p>
<p>The Capri looks like it was designed by executive committee, with styling that resembles the Polestar 2, but far more nondescript. Ford calls it a &quot;sports coupe for the family,&quot; and the only thing vaguely as rebellious as the original is the paint scheme, either in bright yellow or blue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Energy Department has revealed that it's awarding car and auto parts factories in eight states a total of $1.7 billion in funding, so that they can be retooled to build electric vehicles and their components. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/business/biden-administration-electric-vehicles.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/11/ev-production-biden-electric-vehicle-factories/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, the money will come from President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which provides subsidies to EV and battery plants, as well as the $7,500 tax credits consumers can get if they buy an electric vehicle.</p>
<p>One of the 11 recipients is a Jeep factory in Belvidere, Illinois that closed last year. The $334.8 million it will get from the initiative will allow it to reopen to produce electric vehicles and restore 1,450 jobs. GM, which will be awarded $500 million, will conver

<p>It's the end of the line for Redbox and its DVD rental kiosks.

But it apparently shifted its filing from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, which means it intends to liquidate its business altogether instead of putting the company through a reorganization. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/redbox-liquidation-bankruptcy-chicken-soup-for-the-soul-chapter-7-1236006525/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, the company was initially looking to raise funds by selling some assets and keeping around 100 employees. However, in the end, it decided that the best course of action was to let all 1,000 Redbox employees go and to shut down all 24,000 Redbox kiosks.&nbsp;</p>

The agreement saves Apple from facing an antitrust fine equal to up to 10 percent of its worldwide annual turnover — about $40 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple has also agreed to stipulations such as allowing users to make third-party wallets their default app. &quot;It opens up competition in this crucial sector, by preventing Apple from excluding other mobile wallets from the

<p>Taking care of business doesn’t always happen within range of an outlet. Traveling, working off-site and decamping to a coffee shop are all situations where a laptop power bank could come in handy. These high-capacity batteries can recharge your devices — from tiny earbuds to power-hungry laptops — and can even top off more than one at a time. There aren’t quite as many laptop power banks on the market as there are standard <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-power-bank-143048526.html">portable chargers</a>, but you’ll still find a fair number to consider. I tested out a handful and can recommend three that cover different needs when you’re far from an outlet but still need extra power.</p>

The big announcement was Samsung’s foray into a new kind of wearable, the smart ring.</p>
<p>Samsung claims it’s been able to cram its existing sensor tech into the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-finally-properly-launches-the-galaxy-ring-130055455.html"> <ins>Galaxy Ring’s</ins></a> smaller form factor.
