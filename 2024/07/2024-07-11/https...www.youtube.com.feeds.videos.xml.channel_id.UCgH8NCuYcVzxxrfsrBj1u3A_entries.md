This week, I’m reviewing All My Life by Falling In Reverse. I realise I’m late to this, but I’m on tour so doing it post-humorously (for context on this reference, watch the episode).

Warning: If triggered by pausing and snatches of track, please visit the link below to watch/listen to the song in full - without interruption. Then, if still triggered, watch my Comments episode. It won’t help.

I thank you
