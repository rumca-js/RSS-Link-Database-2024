Delhi's power bills increased in February due to a 6-8% rise in the power purchase adjustment charge (PPAC) by various discoms (BRPL, BYPL, Tata Power, NDMC). BJP's leaders criticized the AAP government for unchecked PPAC hikes, while AAP argued it remains constant and blamed BJP-run states for higher costs. Rising coal and fuel prices influenced the hike.
