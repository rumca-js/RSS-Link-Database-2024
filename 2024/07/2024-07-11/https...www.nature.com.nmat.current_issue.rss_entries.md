<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 11 July 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01939-4">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01939-4</a></p>The instability of n-type organic semiconductors in air is a long-standing challenge in organic electronics. Now, a strategy based on the use of vitamin C is developed to stabilize organic semiconductors. Vitamin C scavenges reactive oxygen species and inhibits their generation, improving the performance and stability of organic semiconductors and their electronic devices.
