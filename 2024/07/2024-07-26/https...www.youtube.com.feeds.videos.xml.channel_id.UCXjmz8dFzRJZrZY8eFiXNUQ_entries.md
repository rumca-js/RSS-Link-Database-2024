It's no doubt that Amazon's The Boys has put Karl Urban in the spotlight once again, but he's been dominating roles for several decades.  Starring in storied franchises like Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, and Thor, Karl Urban has the ability to inhabit any character he takes on.  Which is to say, even though he's been working steadily for decades, we still think Karl Urban should be bigger.  Perhaps his turn as Billy Butcher in The Boys will continue to push him to new heights after it ends with it's next season.
