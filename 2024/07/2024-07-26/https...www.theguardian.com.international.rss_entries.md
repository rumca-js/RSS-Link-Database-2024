It pitched a little short, and the West Indies captain dabbed it into the ground and ran. It felt a little ambitious, if only for a moment – by the time Woakes had extended and diverted his follow-through to reach the ball both he and the batters knew the risk had paid off. Was this, perhaps, a sign that West Indies had come out on the front foot, having won the toss, determined to impose themselves on the game?</p><p>Mikyle Louis, Brathwaite’s opening partner, pushed his bat unconvincingly at the first ball he faced, left the last four balls of that Woakes over well alone, and took 22 balls to get off the mark.

Even beyond the moral obvious, no dialogue should be had with this man for the same reason dialogue with Trump is a waste of time - all you’re ever going to get is another masterclass in gaslighting. And that is exactly what this speech was - from craven lying about the death toll in Gaza to craven lying about his attempts to free the hostages - A smorgasbord of

<p>The success of Manchester’s Outbreak festival shows the appetite for the genre isn’t just healthy, it’s on the rise. Its organisers discuss the scene’s evolution, its fragility, and its (very loud) future </p><p>At the end of June this year thousands of people – from Scotland to Bulgaria, Chile to Singapore – gathered in&nbsp;an industrial estate in Manchester to boot each other in the head. That wasn’t the express purpose, of course, but a common side-effect of attending Outbreak, the&nbsp;hardcore punk festival that has become a flagship event for a genre experiencing an unprecedented moment of mainstream visibility.</p><p>Bursting out of the American suburbs in the late 1970s, hardcore was a response to the punk and new wave invasion that had dominated the years prior. Early bands such as Black Flag, Bad Brains and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/nov/16/dead-kennedys-10-of-the-best">Dead Kennedys</a> distilled the rawness of punk and pushed it to extrem

<p>Or rather, what is the sweet spot where quality and value for money meet?</p><p>The discovery and savouring of new bottles is the glue that keeps the secondary school woodwork project of my life together. But, after rent and bills, groceries, shampoo, therapy and a Disney+ subscription I said I’d never get, there’s not much left to spend on the one thing I enjoy the most: wine. If you’re reading this, you may well feel a similar way.</p><p>I’m just back from a book tour, and at every stop I was greeted by a raised hand asking the same question: how much should I spend on a bottle of wine? Through this question, I think we’re really asking several. How little can I spend without stripping my tongue of all sensation? How much do I have to spend until the quality isn’t reflected in a high price tag? Where is the sweet spot in the quality-to-cost ratio?</p><p>Hannah Crosbie is a wine writer and broadcaster.

<p>Andy Murray waves farewell at the launching pad of his career while old foes could meet again in the second round</p><p>As Andy Murray spoke in the immediate aftermath of the most painful moment of his career, his defeat to Roger Federer in the 2012 Wimbledon final, the tears came quickly. He had been so close to winning his first grand slam, yet it also felt as far away as ever. While his legendary contemporaries were racking up major titles, he just could not figure out how to let go of his inhibitions and get over the line. He had lost all four grand slam finals he had contested, while winning only one set.</p><p>But the summer of 2012 was like no other. Three weeks after the players had departed the All England Club, they had returned. The plain green backboards had been replaced by a loud, bright purple, and instead of the traditional all-white attire, matches across the grounds were a technicolour vision. The London 2012 Olympic tennis event at Wimbledon had begun.</p> <a hre

<p>At a festival, I try up to 17 half pints, and the most I’ve been to in a year is 109</p><p>I got a taste for real ale in the late 1970s while at university in Cardiff. The only alcohol available in the students’ union was bland, fizzy beer. I&nbsp;sought out a better quality drink in local pubs and quickly grew to&nbsp;love the depth of flavour of all the different styles of cask ales. I like the&nbsp;fact that cask beers continue to ferment in the barrel before they are&nbsp;served, which keg beers don’t. That conditions the beer and improves&nbsp;the flavour.</p><p>Back home in Sheffield after university, I started attending beer festivals. By 1985, I was recording the&nbsp;beers I drank by ticking them off in&nbsp;the festival programmes. In those early years, I was going to three or four&nbsp;festivals a year. Then someone I&nbsp;knew got me into this hobby properly, which is called beer ticking or scratching – marking off beers you&nbsp;drink from a&nbsp;list.</p> <a href="htt

<p>Tory MPs opposed to this human right have been swept away.

Expect the right to die to be one of this government’s landmarks, removing one of the last barriers to freedom over our own bodies. Everyone must die, but the greatest dread is exiting the world through a torture chamber. Once assured that we need never bear the unbearable, death would lose much of its sting.</p><p>While other countries allow the mortally ill to be released from the last stages of life if they wish, the British have been denied that choice, mainly by the power of religious lobbies. Only God can decide how long we should suffer before death comes at a time of his pitiless whim, they say. Humanists UK has tussled with them for years on this.

<p>Ask yourself what you’d be comfortable in on the beach when shouting at the kids about suncream</p><p>On the beach, in the park and at the lido, a battle as old as time – or at least, as old as Brigitte Bardot – is back. Are you team swimsuit, or team bikini? The bikini is back in the game. For a few summers, the one-piece had the fashion momentum. But in fashion, as in life, change is the one thing you can bet on. So much so that it could be time to cross the floor.</p><p>I have always been a bikini person. This has less to do with fashion than with comfort. There are women in swimwear all around us – on adverts, in shop windows, on social media – which makes it easy to think of swimwear as an aesthetic choice. But it is not really – unless you are, or are likely to be, a Love Island contestant. For the rest of us, swimwear is only for rare days when we are very lucky with both the weather and our to-do list. Those days don’t come around all that often, so all that counts is that
