<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My ISP no longer provides public IPv4 addresses due to IPv4 exhaustion. So I spent countless hours learning and setting up an IPv6 server, only to discover that my router, TP-Link C1200, <a href="https://community.tp-link.com/us/home/forum/topic/94783">doesn't fully support IPv6 even though it claimed to be</a>.</p> <p>TP-Link C1200 has a built-in IPv6 firewall that blocks all ports by default, and you CANNOT DISABLE IT. This renders the public IPv6 address useless since you can’t open ports to the public internet.
