With the situation becoming politically difficult, a plan is hatched: women are invited to join the police. It\u2019s a publicity stunt, but the force hope it will take the heat off them for a while. Based on real events, this series tells the story of four of the recruits: Gabina, Maria, \u00c1ngeles and Valentina, who are all, in different ways, chafing against the patriarchy. As the Undresser continues his rampage, they glimpse the possibility of redemption by catching him.
