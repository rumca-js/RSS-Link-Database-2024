When we think of Jupiter-type planets, we usually picture massive cloud-covered worlds orbiting far from their stars. That distance keeps their volatile gases from vaporizing from stellar heat, similar to what we're familiar with in our solar system. So, why are so many exoplanets known as "hot Jupiters" orbiting very close to their stars? That's the question astronomers ask as they study more of these extreme worlds.

Cycloaddition reactions are an efficient strategy for constructing cyclic compounds that are important building blocks for other chemicals. In these processes, π-electrons from different unsaturated molecules, such as alkenes, alkynes, or dienes accommodate to form new cyclic structures in a single step. π-electrons are those responsible for the π-bonds in double and triple bonds. In a double bond, one of the C-C bonds is a π-bond, while in a triple bond, two of the C-C bonds are π-bonds.
