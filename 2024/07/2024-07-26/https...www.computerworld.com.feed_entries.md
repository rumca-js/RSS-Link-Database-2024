<p>Google’s AI unit Deepmind has demonstrated two new AI systems, AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2, which can successfully solve complex mathematical problems, representing a significant milestone in AI development, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/google-ai-systems-make-headway-with-math-progress-toward-reasoning-2024-07-25/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reports .</p>



<p>Today’s AI models work by being able to recognize patterns and statistically predict, for example, the next word that should be generated. However, this is not enough to handle abstract mathematics, which instead requires a system that can reason in a way that more close

<p>Open AI CEO Sam Altman has written an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/25/sam-altman-ai-democracy-authoritarianism-future/">attention-grabbing column in <em>The Washington Post</em></a> about the risks of artificial intelligence (AI), warning that authoritarian countries such as Russia and China want to control the development of AI systems — something that could eventually threaten humanity.</p>



<p>For example, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that whoever wins the AI ​​battle will be the “ruler of the world”, while China has a stated goal of becoming the leader in AI by 2030. To prevent that from happening, the United States and its allies should work togeth

<p>OpenAI has thrown down the gauntlet to search giants like Google and Bing with the launch of its AI-powered search engine, SearchGPT.</p>



<p>Currently, in testing with a small group of users and publishers, SearchGPT combines the advanced conversational abilities of OpenAI’s large language models with real-time web data to provide “fast, accurate answers complete with clear and relevant sources.”</p>



<p>“Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort,” <a href="https://openai.com/index/searchgpt-prototype/">OpenAI said in a statement</a>. “We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you’re looking for

<p>The modern web browser is rather staid and not terribly exciting. Google Chrome rules the roost, browser technologies like HTML and JavaScript have gone unchanged for years, and updates to browsers are more often bug fixes than new features.</p>



<p>But it’s about to get a little more interesting.</p>



<p>Generative AI is coming to every web browser. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other browsers are trying to change how we interact with the web, using AI to boil down web articles and make browsing more efficient, said Ritu Jyoti, group vice president for AI infrastructure at IDC.</p>



<p>“The strategy is to reinvent web search, and the hope is that you don’t have to a load a dozen brow

<p>Sometimes a Windows 10 system starts misbehaving to the point where repair is needed. This often takes the form of worsening performance or stability, and can originate from damage to, loss of, or corruption of Windows system files (normally in the <strong>C:\Windows</strong> folder hierarchy). When that happens, users would be well advised to break out the following routine to help them set things back to rights.</p>



<p>This story provides a sequence of techniques to try if you’re frequently experiencing problems like slowdowns and crashes. All of these methods start with the assumption that you’re at least able to get into the Windows environment. If Windows won’t start up at all, see my stor

<p>Let me just take a second to say what I suspect most of us are thinking right now: <em>Sigh.</em></p>



<p>All right — with that out of the way, we’re ready to get to the crux of this conversation: Google’s next-gen Pixel 9 devices are set to officially break cover in just over a couple weeks now. And from the looks of it, they’ll be ushering in a new era of on-the-go Google goodness while, just as notably, saying adieu to an old one.</p>



<p>As you’ve probably figured out by this point, I’m not talkin’ about the hardware itself or anything specific to the phones’ forms. I’m talkin’ about the virtual assistant at the heart of the Pixel and broader Android experience — the thing we interact with
