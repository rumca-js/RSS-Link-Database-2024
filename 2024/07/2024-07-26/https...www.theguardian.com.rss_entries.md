<p><strong>Hammersmith Apollo, London<br /></strong>Played at the volume of a pantomime, this makeover of the fairytale favourite is flatly unadventurous</p><p>You might have walked into the Emerald City. The art deco auditorium of Hammersmith’s Apollo is bathed in green light, the stage dressed with a curtain of ivy. But we’re meeting an ogre not a wizard and, this being Shrek, he’s in the outhouse taking a dump.</p><p>There’s plenty more toilet humour to come in this revival of Jeanine Tesori and David Lindsay-Abaire’s 2008 musical, based on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jul/01/philipfrench">2001 Oscar winner</a> and William Steig’s book, now in London after a UK and Ireland tour.

<p>The Parisian rain showed there is a good reason why Olympic opening ceremonies are held in stadiums</p><p>Avant: le deluge. There was a moment, about an hour into Paris 2024’s Grand Opening Spectacular, as the rain soaked through shoes, trousers, socks and eventually skin, hair and bone; as yet more boats of waving people chugged down the Seine, like watching an endless series of weirdly nationalistic office parties; as some men did some dancing in a place, for reasons that frankly seemed quite remote at that point, where a thought occurred.</p><p>Maybe this wasn’t just the worst Olympic opening ceremony ever.

More than 300,000 people watched the riverside and bridges – and hundreds more stood at windows and balconies – as a show of dance, live-music and acrobatics unfolded along more than 6km of river from the Pont d’Austerlitz to the Eiffel Tower.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/26/paris-olympic-games-opening-ceremony-a-high-kitch-riverside-spectacle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Another record haul is possible for Team GB in Paris, and those behind it hope they can use success to make a lingering impact on British society</p><p>There used to be a hidden wall at UK Sport’s old London headquarters where senior figures would meticulously plot Team GB’s medal charge before each Olympics. But with every passing Games there was increasingly less space on it, as the 30 medals Britain won in Athens jumped to 51 in Beijing, and the 65 in London was eclipsed by the 67 in&nbsp;Rio. And while the Goodge Street office permanently shut during the&nbsp;pandemic, the ambition inked on that wall remains: for Britain to stay an Olympic sporting superpower.</p><p>For Paris, UK Sport has forecast a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/08/uk-sport-olympic-games-team-gb-medals">medal range of 50 to 70</a>.

<p>Two girls set out to catch the Yorkshire Ripper in this vividly narrated novel of adolescent curiosity and confusion</p><p>Set in Yorkshire in 1979 shortly after the election of Margaret Thatcher, Jennie Godfrey’s novel revolves around a working-class family living in the shadow of a new Conservative government and the Yorkshire Ripper murders. The novel opens with 12-year-old Miv quietly fretting about the stories in the papers of young women being killed and her aunt’s suggestion that life would be better if they moved down south. Appalled at the prospect of leaving her home, Miv hatches a plan. She and her best friend, Sharon, will do what the police have so far failed to do: they will catch the Yorkshire Ripper.</p><p>The List of Suspicious Things – the title comes from Miv’s list of the suspicious goings-on in her community – comes with a keen sense of time and place.

<p>British rower dreamed of Olympic glory aged 14 watching London 2012 and her dad fished the discarded diary note out of the bin and kept it for years</p><p>At the time, Lola Anderson had written it off as a cringeworthy adolescent whim. She was far from the only youngster to have been swept along by the endless summer of London 2012 and, watching Great Britain surge down Dorney Lake towards one of their four rowing golds, was struck by “this massive wave of inspiration”. Her love for the sport had been growing and, at 14, this was the moment to spell out a plan for the future.</p><p>She ran to find her diary and started writing. “My name is Lola Anderson and I think it would be my biggest dream in life to go to the Olympics and represent Team GB in rowing and, if possible, win a gold medal,” read the entry. But immediately self-consciousness set in. Looking back now it is easily diagnosable. “Teenage girls don’t necessarily have the most belief in ourselves and I got very embarrasse

<p>Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley indulge in some sensational swearing in a hugely enjoyable comedy, while Stanley Kubrick’s iconoclastic horror still packs a punch</p><p>When a series of anonymous poison pen letters are sent to prim coastal town resident Edith (Olivia Colman), suspicion immediately falls on her neighbour Rose (Jessie Buckley), an Irish single mother with a boisterous, proto-feminist attitude. There is something inherently hilarious about Colman swearing, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/24/wicked-little-letters-review-thea-sharrock-olivia-colman-jessie-buckley-deliciously-sweary-poison-pen-mystery">Thea Sharrock’s fact-based 1920s comedy</a> ladles on the creative insults as the writer’s vitriol widens to take in the whole community.

<p>After the overhaul which followed disappointment in Tokyo, the team are well placed to achieve something special</p><p>British rowing at the Olympics used to be all about the men’s coxless four who maintained an incredible winning streak across five Olympics over two decades. That chain was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jul/30/team-gb-win-bronze-in-mens-eight-as-inquest-starts-into-poor-olympic-regatta">broken painfully at Tokyo in 2021</a>. At the time, some interpreted this as symptomatic of a crisis in the British rowing team that won just two medals: one silver, one bronze. Yet just three years later that break seems to have liberated the team from a legacy that had become more of a burden than advantage and kickstarted some overdue modernisation. This summer, it’s genuinely difficult to say which is our “top boat” because there is a broader spread of talent across boat classes than there has ever been.</p><p>There are reigning world champions in the women’s q

<p>The warm, likable tale of Mexican women joining the police to catch a serial killer, plus Shaun Ryder asks Bez to plan his funeral – with predictably eccentric results</p><p>Mexico City, 1971. A serial killer known as the Undresser is murdering women and the police are nowhere near catching him. With the situation becoming politically difficult, a plan is hatched: women are invited to join the police. It’s a publicity stunt, but the force hope it will take the heat off them for a while. Based on real events, this series tells the story of four of the recruits: Gabina, Maria, Ángeles and Valentina, who are all, in different ways, chafing against the patriarchy. As the Undresser continues his rampage, they glimpse the possibility of redemption by catching him. It’s occasionally melodramatic and not particularly subtle, but it is a warm, likable story. <br /><em>Apple TV+, from Wednesday</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jul/26/women-in-blue-to-ce

It gives you access to the state healthcare that a resident of that country would receive, so not everything may be free. It doesn’t help you get home if you are sick or injured, so does not replace travel insurance, but it is worth having for emergencies. And some travel insurers insist you have one. Luckily, Ghics are free – <a href="https://overseas-healthcare.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/get-healthcare-cover-travelling-abroad/start">apply via the NHS website</a> and don’t fall for services that try to charge you.

 One hundred years since the games were last held there, Paris is hosting the greatest sports tournament in the world for a third time – and the city is pulling out all the stops for the opening ceremony. Stage director Thomas Jolly is the man behind the ambitious event, which takes place along the Seine rather than inside a stadium. Clare Balding and her team will present all the coverage as more than 10,500 athletes parade down boats on a 6km route that passes the Grand Palais and Eiffel Tower. Performers for the evening haven’t been confirmed, but Sabrina Carpenter has appeared in an advert for the event – will she add a shot of Espresso to the night? <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jul/26/tv-tonight-paris-and-the-seine-sta
