Man, Deadpool & Wolverine sure gave us a bunch of Easter eggs and cameos that tie back to a variety of old Fox Marvel movies – and some non-Fox ones as well. But what the latest Marvel Studios film also manages to do is kind of make the Fox X-Men movie timeline even more confusing than it already was – and that’s saying something.

Still, perhaps what lies at the center of the new Ryan Reynolds/Hugh Jackman film is a bigger question about how much any of this continuity stuff really matters anyway.
In a world where you can have 100 Deadpools, or a new Logan – even after the so-called final film in the Wolverine franchise killed off the character – does continuity or canon really make a difference anymore? The Fox movie-verse is essentially part of the MCU now – a franchise that in part rose to Hollywood prominence because of its mastery of the concept of the shared universe. But it’s hard not to wonder how much longer viewers will remain invested in the House that Kevin Feige built wh

In Season Two of The Rings of Power, Sauron has returned. Cast out by Galadriel, without an army or ally, the rising Dark Lord must now rely on his own cunning to rebuild his strength and oversee the creation of the Rings of Power, which will allow him to bind all the peoples of Middle-earth to his sinister will. Building on Season One’s epic scope and ambition, the new season plunges even its most beloved and vulnerable characters into a rising tide of darkness, challenging each to find their place in a world that is increasingly on the brink of calamity. As friendships are strained and kingdoms begin to fracture, the forces of good—Elves and dwarves, orcs and men, wizards and Harfoots—will struggle ever more valiantly to hold on to what matters to them most of all: each other.
The second season of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power will premiere exclusively on Prime Video on August 29, 2024.

The roar of a crowd. A sound that countless gladiators heard as they walked out onto the sands of the Roman arena. A sound that you can still hear today in stadiums around the world, where athletes compete for wealth and for glory. 
On Episode 5 of Rise or Die, host Dana Schwartz (Noble Blood) wanted to explore how the creative team behind Those About To Die explored the similarities between the spectacle of the Roman arena and modern sports. She speaks with historical consultant Justin Pollard about the bread and circuses and his feeling that F1 racing is the modern incarnation of the Circus Maixmus.

Here's your look at Gundam: Requiem for Vengeance in this latest trailer for the upcoming Netflix anime series. Gundam: Requiem for Vengeance stars Celia Massingham. 

In the year Universal Century 0079, a state of war began when the Principality of Zeon declared its independence from the Earth Federation government. In the war's opening stages, the Zeon forces maintained an advantage thanks to the effectiveness of their new weapon, the mobile suit. However, they lacked the fighting strength to fully conquer Earth, and the war became a stalemate.

Eleven months after the outbreak of war, a base in Zeon-occupied Eastern Europe is captured by the Federation Forces. A Zeon composite battalion is sent to recapture the base, and among its members are Solari and her Red Wolf Squadron, a mobile suit team that has only just arrived from space.
