Creating Better Systems by Focusing on Sustainability - Jutta Eckstein - ACCU 2024
---

The planetary challenges like the climate crisis are asking for our attention. Yet, our work keeps us busy. So, what if we could for example reduce the carbon footprint of the system we are creating while improving it?
Luckily, more and more support for increasing environmental, social, and economic sustainability is available. For example, we can now pick the region for our cloud by e.g., specifying that carbon reduction is an important criterion for us. We can also find out what kind of energy is available when and where. The questions are: Are we aware of the available support? How can we make use of it while developing a system? And what can we actually easily do?
In this session, I want to explore various practices that can help us increase sustainability in software development. The focus is on simple changes to create better and more sustain
