<p>On Thursday, July 25, Netflix finally rolled out its updated <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9wzdncrfj3tj">app for Windows on the Microsoft Store</a>, but the new version isn’t likely to get the thumbs up from users. In fact, it’s downright disappointing.</p>



<p>The update was first announced back in May, in which Netflix said the native app would be retired by June. After some delay, the update was quickly tested in July before being pushed live.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time coming! Microsoft is finally keen to improve integration between Windows 11 computers and Android phones. If you hate transferring files between the two, there’s good news ahead.</p>



<p><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/07/25/ability-to-access-your-android-phone-in-file-explorer-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/">Microsoft has started beta testing</a> a new feature that lets you “see your Android phone in File Explorer” and “wirelessly browse through all your folders and files, including media that is on your Android phone.”</p>

<p>As someone who frequently types in lots of numbers for works, using a laptop or keyboard without a numpad is pure torture. But I also don’t want a numpad <em>all the time</em> because it takes up space.</p>



<p>Which is why I absolutely love <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Aluminum-Rechargeable-Wireless-Compatible/dp/B07L139XXZ">this Bluetooth numpad</a>, which is currently half off and available for just $30 on Amazon. It’s a fantastic deal on a sleek accessory that’s perfect for smaller laptops and compact keyboards that lack numeric keypads.</p>



<p>The number pad has an ergonomic tilt to ensure comfortable data entry, and it’s small enough that you can toss it into your laptop bag and forget about it. It doesn’t just feature the number pad, by the way—it also has navigation arrows, page up, page down, and so on.</p>

<p>If you have any files on your PC worth keeping long-term, then you <em>need</em> some kind of backup system—one that combines local backups (to quickly protect huge amounts of data) with cloud-based uploads (to protect against local data loss).</p>



<p>Right now, you can get both solutions wrapped into one with <a href="https://software.pcworld.com/p44403-acronis_cyber_protect_home_office_2023_advanced_1-d_1-yr_50gb">Acronis True Image backup software for $29.99, or 45% off sticker price</a>. </p>



<p>Acronis True Image 2025 Advanced includes the core software (which can locally back up selected folders, drives, or entire computer images) plus 50GB of protected online storage. The local system works forever, the cloud system for a year—far cheaper than other major cloud services. After the year ends, you can continue via paid subscription if you like.</p>

<p>Secure Boot, a tool that’s built into hundreds of millions of PCs to keep them from loading unverified software via UEFI, is a fundamental cornerstone of modern computer security. It uses cryptographic signatures in hardware components to make sure that nothing connected to your PC can load up code that you (or at least the PC) haven’t verified. That’s why cryptographic key leaks are such a big deal.</p>
