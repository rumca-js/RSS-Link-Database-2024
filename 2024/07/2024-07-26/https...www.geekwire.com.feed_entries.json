Jay Inslee on Monday is highlighting a statewide program that will provide $200 energy credits to help low-income residents pay their electricity bills. The $150 million program is funded by the Climate Commitment Act, whose fate will be decided by Washington voters this November. The Initiative 2117 ballot measure would eliminate the act, which created a marketplace where oil refineries, utilities and most of the state&#8217;s largest greenhouse gas emitters bid on carbon pollution permits that decrease in number over time. The act has generated more than $2 billion from the state&#8217;s largest carbon emitters.

Monsef is the CEO and co-founder of Genie, a new app-based chatbot that acts as teacher, motivational coach, creative assistant, storyteller, game companion, and more. The goal is to provide a friendly, positive voice on the other end of an internet that can be harsh for kids. &#8220;Genie&#8217;s entire purpose is to help kids have a better, more fun,&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/with-new-ai-sidekick-genie-startup-vets-aim-to-create-a-safer-online-experience-for-kids/\">Read More</a>", "id": 935144, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/with-new-ai-sidekick-genie-startup-vets-aim-to-create-a-safer-online-experience-for-kids", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "With new AI sidekick \u2018Genie,\u2019 startup vets aim to create a safer online experience for kids", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-26T14:15:00+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"1107\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image003.png\" width=\"1185\" /><br />A group of former colleagues at DataCloud, a startup that helped mining companies extract value out of data collection, are teaming up again to take aim at another industry: food. Seattle startup Terrantic recently raised a $3.5 million seed round to fuel development of its software system aimed at helping food growers, packers, and processors improve the quality and yield of their products. The idea is to replace the mishmash of traditional spreadsheets with a centralized platform that not only organizes data in one place but can also identify ways to find efficiencies with the help of artificial intelligence.
