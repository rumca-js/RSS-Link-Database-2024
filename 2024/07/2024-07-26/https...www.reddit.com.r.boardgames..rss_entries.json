I have checked out multiple play through videos on YouTube, but these didn\u2019t answer the question. </p> <p>On the field on the board where you can buy a stall, it says \u201conce per action\u201d, but how should this be interpreted? Does it mean that - let\u2019s say - I place my first worker on this field, then on every turn that round I can buy a stall (and still use another worker and put on a separate action space during that turn)?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sabbi86\"> /u/sabbi86 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ecx9lh/agricola_acbas_rule_clarification/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ecx9lh/agricola_acbas_rule_clarification/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 937219, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ecx9lh/agricola_acbas_rule_clarification", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Agricola: ACBAS Rule Clarification", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-26T19:53:24+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted to ask you this.
