<p>A July 18 software update from CrowdStrike caused a massive IT outage, leading to chaos across airports, banks, stock exchanges, hospitals, and more. This incident, marked by widespread occurrences of the “blue screen of death” (BSOD), highlighted the vulnerability of relying on a single cloud provider.</p>

Flights were canceled, banks could not make deposits, and patients could not get hospital treatment. That’s scary post-apocalypse stuff. This outage was not the result of a malicious act, but it proves we’re not ready to face a substantial cyberattack and the far-reaching dam

Further, large amounts of organizational data frequently remain underutilized for insights due to challenges with active data management, the report states.</p>



<p>Released July 24, the report, titled “<a href="https://www.bmc.com/info/value-of-data-survey.html?vu=valueofdata">Putting the ‘Ops’ in DataOps: Success factors for operationalizing data</a>,” was based on research examining organizational data management and DataOps practices. The report found there is no “one-size-fits-all approach” to data-driven practice
