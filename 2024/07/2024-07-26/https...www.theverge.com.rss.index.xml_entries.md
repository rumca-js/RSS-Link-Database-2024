  <p id="bznEhM">Valve has introduced some changes to Steam that should make it easier to find and install playable game demos. In a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/6233628070477025191">new events blog post</a>, Steam said the “Great Steam Demo Update” was based on developer and player feedback, with new functionality that makes demos behave more like standalone games hosted on the platform.</p>
