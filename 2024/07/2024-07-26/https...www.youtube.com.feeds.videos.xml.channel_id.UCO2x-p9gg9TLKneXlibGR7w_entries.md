There are finally new ARM computers for Windows. The last time we tried them, they were... terrible. But Qualcomm has got silicon—the Snapdragon X Elite—that they say now competes with Apple silicon. And Microsoft has completely redone Windows 11 ARM compatibility with their new Prism emulation layer—similar to Rosetta for macOS. And not only can it recompile x86 binaries to ARM, it can even do graphics API translation for DirectX games! Can a thin and light laptop game better than a MacBook Air? Perhaps! In this video, we'll discuss every laptop that currently ships with the X Elite, buy one, set it up, and see if it can hang with the best-selling laptop in the world: Apple's MacBook Air.
