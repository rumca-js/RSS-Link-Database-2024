On Prime Day, Amazon shoppers will be able to browse over 600 million products. They may not be aware that most of those listings are from non-Amazon sellers, who account for 60% of sales on the platform. Most are small- and medium-sized businesses: bookstores selling used hardbacks, toymakers selling original goods, and distributors unloading clothes.

One could argue that brown dwarfs don't get the love they deserve. Sometimes referred to as "failed stars," they don't have enough mass to sustain nuclear fusion, which powers all stars, including our sun. But they are also too big to be considered planets, with some having 75 times the mass of Jupiter.

The fusion of two nuclei is a complex process influenced by many factors. These factors include not only the relative energy and angular momentum of the two nuclei, but also how their structures evolve as they collide. The outcome of the collisions is dramatically impacted by the quantum nature of the nuclei. The best way to handle the underlying complexities is to directly simulate how the nuclei evolve as they collide, though this constitutes a massive computational effort.
