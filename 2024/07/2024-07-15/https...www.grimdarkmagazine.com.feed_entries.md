<p>If Gemmell had a small crew of protégés, I think Cameron Johnston has placed himself at their forefront with The Last Shield. A heroic dark fantasy with plenty of grit, high stakes, battles, and bloody-grinned relentless no-giving-up protagonists, The Last Shield is an un-put-downable thrill ride. In The Last Shield, Briar is the leader of the Regent of Sunweald’s personal bodyguard. Armed with buckler and sword and honed by a lifetime of training, the Shields keep the leaders of their realm alive. When one of them goes rogue, and a mysterious bowman cripples Briar, a devious plot is revealed and it puts the one person Briar loves (but cannot have) in danger&#8211;and with that person in danger, all of Sunweald is in danger. If you mixed Gemmell’s storytelling with Die Hard, I think you would find The Last Shield. With a gruff hero who just won’t die, a villain with evil deeds on their mind, treachery, non stop action and bloody, rather inventive deaths hitting you every few pages
