<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi</p> <p>In my Youth i owned an Amiga 500 but sadly i dont have it anymore. I tried to emulate Amiga 500 on my PC but i am too dumb to get the Kickstart ROM Files. </p> <p>So my Question is: Is the Amiga 500 Mini a good Option for me as Emulation Noob? I heard that the Mini can run adf Files on USB Sticks too and that it can even emulate Amiga 1200. Is that true?</p> <p>Can you Guys tell me how i can get a Mini to play other Games on a USB Stick and if its a good Solution in General? Can it handle Amiga 1200? I never played the 1200 and would love to try out a few Games.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Goodbye_May_Kasahara"> /u/Goodbye_May_Kasahara </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1e3r2qi/amiga_500_mini_for_amiga_noob/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1e3r2qi/amiga_500_mini_for_amiga_noob/">[comments]</a></span>
