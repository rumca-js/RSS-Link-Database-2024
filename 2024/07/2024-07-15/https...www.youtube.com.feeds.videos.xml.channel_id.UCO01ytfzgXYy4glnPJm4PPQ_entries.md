All of the fear-mongering about Trump being an evil dictator bent on destroying democracy finally led to its desired result on Saturday, when Trump came within one inch of death. I have a lot to say about the attempted assassination of President Trump, as you can imagine.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, all of the fear-mongering about Trump being an evil dictator bent on destroying democracy finally led to its desired result on Saturday, when Trump came within one inch of death. I have a lot to say about the attempted assassination of President Trump, as you can imagine. And, what exactly do we know about the would-be assassin? Almost nothing, according to the official narrative. Is it time to take the "conspiracy theories" seriously? Plus, have Democrats essentially given up hope of winning in 2024 in the wake of the shooting? Should they give up hope? And, did DEI play a role in the tragedy on Saturday?
