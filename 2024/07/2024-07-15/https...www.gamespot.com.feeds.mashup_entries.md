Now, Disney is the latest victim of hacking attack, but the full extent of the leak isn't immediately clear.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/internal-disney-communications-leaked-online-after-hack-b57baaeb?st=0tuedahl8kuj7tn">The Wall Street Journal</a>, the hacker group known as Nullbulge announced that it targeted Disney because of "how it handles artist contracts, its approach to AI, and [its] pretty blatant disregard for the consumer." Nullbulge claims to have infiltrated Disney's Slack account and stolen "computer code and details about unreleased projects."</p><p>However, Nullbulge's claims about the value of the data taken during the hack may be overblown.

<p dir="ltr">I never really outgrew hide-and-seek. Thankfully I have kids who give me an excuse to continue playing it. The thrill of evading detection is fun in real life, and it's probably a big part of why I love stealth games, too. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/midnight-murder-club/">Midnight Murder Club</a> (MMC), the upcoming game from Velan Studios (Knockout City, Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit), stealth is a huge part of the experience. But because of proximity chat, this team-based PvP first-person shooter is routinely hilarious and chaotic. I recently got to participate in the game's first alpha, which makes these my early impressions and not indicative of the final game which is maybe months away from launch. But the proof-of-concept is immediately obvious, and I'm excited to see how it progresses.</p><p dir="ltr">Midnight Murder Club arms everyone in its six-player rounds with a flashlight and a revolver, then sets them off to do one of a number of tasks depend

<p>Last year, studio Orange released Trigun Stampede, a retelling of the 1998 Trigun anime based on the manga that Yasuhiro Nightow created. And while this is a retelling of a familiar story, Stampede does more than enough to stand on its own legs.</p><p dir="ltr">A notable example can be seen in the choice of art style. Many popular animes, such as Attack on Titan, are presented in a 2-D animated art style, often reserving CGI for epic fight scenes. Trigun Stampede, on the other hand, relies heavily on using CGI for its primary art style.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been a little more than a year since the series hit the small screen. Since then, studio Orange has been working on Season 2. Just recently, the<a href="https://x.com/trigun_anime/status/1809009735016067213"> official Trigun Stampede X/Twitter account</a> announced that season two of the show will officially be called Trigun Stargaze.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-stampede-reveals-marvel-cinematic-universe
