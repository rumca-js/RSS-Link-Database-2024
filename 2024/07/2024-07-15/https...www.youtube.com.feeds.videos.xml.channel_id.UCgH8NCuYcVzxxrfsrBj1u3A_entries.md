This week, Iâ€™m reviewing Favourite by Fontaines D.C.  I was asked to do this by you - my dear YouTube viewers - in the Comments section. I do read them you know.

Warning: If triggered by pausing and snatches of track, please visit the link below to watch/listen to the song in full - without interruption. Then, if still triggered, watch my Comments episode: . https://youtu.be/RSB6ZiFQpkw 

It won't help.

I thank you.
