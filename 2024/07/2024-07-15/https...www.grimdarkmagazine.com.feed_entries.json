A heroic dark fantasy with plenty of grit, high stakes, battles, and bloody-grinned relentless no-giving-up protagonists, The Last Shield is an un-put-downable thrill ride. In The Last Shield, Briar is the leader of the Regent of Sunweald\u2019s personal bodyguard. Armed with buckler and sword and honed by a lifetime of training, the Shields keep the leaders of their realm alive. When one of them goes rogue, and a mysterious bowman cripples Briar, a devious plot is revealed and it puts the one person Briar loves (but cannot have) in danger&#8211;and with that person in danger, all of Sunweald is in danger. If you mixed Gemmell\u2019s storytelling with Die Hard, I think you would find The Last Shield. With a gruff hero who just won\u2019t die, a villain with evil deeds on their mind, treachery, non stop action and bloody, rather inventive deaths hitting you every few pages ", "id": 868622, "language": "en-AU", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-the-last-shield-by-cameron-johnston", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 137, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Review: The Last Shield by Cameron Johnston", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-15T04:43:33+00:00", "description": "<p>Elizabeth Helen is the pen name of sister duo, Elizabeth and Helen, authors of a hot new fantasy series inspired by Beauty and the Beast.
