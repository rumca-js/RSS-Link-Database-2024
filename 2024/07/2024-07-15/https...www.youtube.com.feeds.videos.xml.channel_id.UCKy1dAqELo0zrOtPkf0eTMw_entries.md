House of the Dragon S2E5 “Regent” makes a whole lot of questions crystal clear: there is something even stronger than House Targaryen in House of the Dragon. In the aftermath of Rook’s Rest, House of the Dragon Season 2 Ep 5 explores what the protagonists are really up against, a problem that still exists in Game of Thrones’ time. The show’s direction and marketing are clever; the House of the Dragon season 2 trailer made it seem like Allicent vs Rhaenyra, but that was never it for the HBO Max banner show. House of the Dragon Season 2 Episode 5 truly turns the tides for hotd, in both a devastating and brilliant way. Could we have expected Daemon to show us, the audience, his true colors based on the House of the Dragon Season 2 Episode 5 specific trailer? Probably not, and the HBO show also delivered on the stakes of dragons,if it wasn’t already clear. The Max show has wavered on Daemon Targaryen and Aemond Targaryen, on who these men are and would be, but there aren’t many questions
