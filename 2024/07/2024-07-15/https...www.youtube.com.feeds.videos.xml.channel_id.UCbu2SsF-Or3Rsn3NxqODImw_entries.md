In this week's episode of Star Players, Steve-O talks about his complicated history with games, from playing Pitfall and Super Mario Bros as a child, to an Angry Birds addiction and starring in the Jackass game he's never even played.

This week on Star Players, Lucy James is joined by Steve-O, the entertainer, comedian and podcast host best known for his appearances in Jackass, Wild Boys and Steve-O's Wild Ride. Steve-O breaks down his personal history with video games, from playing Baseball on the Intellivision with his father and playing RoboCop with friends, his guest appearances in ESPN NFL 2K5 and Tony Hawk's Underground 2, and why he now regrets saying video games are a waste of time.
