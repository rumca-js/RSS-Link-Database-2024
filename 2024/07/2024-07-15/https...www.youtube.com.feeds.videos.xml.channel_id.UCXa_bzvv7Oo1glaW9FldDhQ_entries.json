Throughout the game, you\u2019ll fly atop a bird and fill out your Aunt Jane\u2019s Creature Guide. Exploring the environments as you listen for the hems and haws of these creatures is a delight thanks to the excellent sound design, but the process of documenting them could be better. \n\nHowever, that isn\u2019t all you do in Flock, you must locate the species-specific whistles in order to collect them. The guidance and flow of the environments is wonderful, though the \u2018charm\u2019 minigame gets repetitive pretty fast. With a wonderfully atmospheric soundtrack and colorful art style, Flock is a delight for the senses. It\u2019s easy to pick and play and has full co-op functionality to boot.
