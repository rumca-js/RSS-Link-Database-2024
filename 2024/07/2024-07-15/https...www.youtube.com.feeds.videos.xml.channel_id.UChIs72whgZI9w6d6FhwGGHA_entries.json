In fact, some of the 9950X benchmarks beat the 7950X world records at significantly lower clocks -- sometimes as low as 5.85GHz on the 9950X to a prior 6.7-6.9GHz on the 7950X. We'll also spend time talking about the new Curve Shaper, which will stack atop the prior Curve Optimizer for Ryzen.\n\nLearn more about the Zen 5 CPU basics here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1yubL0h46U\nOr the article for it here: https://gamersnexus.net/news/amd-announces-ryzen-9950x-9900x-9700x-9600x-zen-5-cpus-extends-am5-life-ai-cpus\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
