The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU is the first Zen 5 CPU benchmark we've seen, and it's starting with extreme overclocking to 6.6GHz. In fact, some of the 9950X benchmarks beat the 7950X world records at significantly lower clocks -- sometimes as low as 5.85GHz on the 9950X to a prior 6.7-6.9GHz on the 7950X. We'll also spend time talking about the new Curve Shaper, which will stack atop the prior Curve Optimizer for Ryzen.
