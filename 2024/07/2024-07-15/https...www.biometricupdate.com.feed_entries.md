		The U.S. Payments Forum (USPF) has published a new white paper entitled “<a href="https://www.uspaymentsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/USPF_The-Role-of-Mobile-IDs-in-Payments_White-Paper.pdf">The Role of Mobile IDs in Payments</a>.” Authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/teresawu_mobileids-mdl-payments-activity-7217653096464687104-Rjq4/">Teresa Wu and Annemarie Mattheyse</a> of USPF member company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia">Idemia</a>, the paper “examines how government-issued mobile IDs (mID) which include mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs), can be leveraged in the payments ecosystem, both today and in the future as well as in-store and online, including examples of where digital identities and digital payment acceptan

		Wyoming is moving towards the issuance of digital ID in the form of an optional mobile driver’s license, but it will take at least a year for the first ones to reach residents’ smartphones.

The work on Wyoming’s mDL traces back to at least 2017, when the state participated in a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/201709/wyoming-joins-gemaltos-digital-drivers-license-pilot-program">pilot with Gemalto</a> (now <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/thales-digital-identity-and-security">Thales</a>).

		The government of Nepal has reversed its decision to mandate the use of national identity cards for citizens to receive social security allowances.

The initial plan, which would have required elderly citizens and pensioners to present a national digital ID card to access their benefits, was met with widespread criticism. The government had initially decided to make the national identity card mandatory for social security allowances, pensions and insurance from July 1, 2024.

Some argued that the move would unfairly disadvantage those in rural areas and older populations who may find it difficult to obtain the new chip-enabled digital ID cards. Concerns were also raised about the readiness of the national ID system, as well as the potenti

		The UK’s Home Office has announced an initiative aimed at improving the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) office through a comprehensive transformation program. This project, spearheaded by Carly Blay, the newly appointed senior responsible owner (SRO), is set to modernize the way civil registration services operate, leveraging technology to improve efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility.

The transformation program, which began this month, seeks to overhaul the CRVS office by integrating digital systems, including biometric technologies. This modernization effort is part of a broader government strategy to streamline public services and ensure they meet contemporary standards of service delivery.

		A World Bank team has identified immediate actions which the government of Equatorial Guinea should undertake in ramping up its digital transformation push.

These actions include setting up a digital identity system as well as other digital public infrastructure (DPI) that will contribute to building a robust and vibrant digital economy in line with the World Bank’s Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) initiative, according to a résumé of the publication. The <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/all-africa-digital-transformation">DE4A</a> was birthed to support Africa’s digital transformation strategy and ensure a digitally-enabled Africa by 2030.

		The UK is still debating national identity documents and digital identities, with lawmakers and experts arguing that the creation of some form of ID is inevitable.

Last week, British Labor Party politician Lord David Blunkett <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202404/the-uks-election-may-spell-out-the-future-of-its-national-id-cards">renewed his calls</a> to introduce digital IDs, arguing that it could be the country’s solution for unchecked immigration and human trafficking.

“As the variety of digital record requirements are rolled out, combining them into a usable identity process will become inevitable,” he says.

Blunkett's comments followed Britain's former Prime Minister Tony Blair calling on the newly-elected Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to consider digital

		Engineers at Meta have filed for a <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/external.html?q=(20240211563).pn.&amp;db=US-PGPUB">patent</a> to cover an authentication system that combines voice biometrics with skin vibrations.

The abstract describes an authentication system that “detects, via a microphone array, airborne acoustic waves corresponding to a vocalization of a user. The system also detects, via a vibration measurement assembly, vibration of tissue of the user caused by the vocalization.” Detected airborne acoustic waves and recorded tissue vibrations are turned into an authentication dataset which can be used as part of a user authentication process.

Hardware-wise, the model described uses a headset or near eye display (NED) and may include, among other com
