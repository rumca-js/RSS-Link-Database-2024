Hopping from up-tempo tracks like \u201cLEGENDARIO\u201d with leading percussion and bass, to the soulful and wildly skilled vocal performance of \u201cENVIDIA,\u201d Peluso delivered a versed ode to Latin American and Spanish rhythms.\n \nPeluso is a master of the unexpected, and from first note to last the concert represented what an artist can bring when they highlight the full breadth of their vision. Prepared to show the world what an Argentine-born, Spanish-raised artist can play with in a more wildly diverse Spanish-speaking diaspora than ever before, Peluso came and rompi\u00f3. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cBUENOS AIRES\u201d\n\u201cAPRENDER A AMAR\u201d\n\u201cLEGENDARIO\u201d\n\u201cENVIDIA\u201d\n\u201cREM", "id": 868229, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1V_PGElOHs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "source_obj__id": 225, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/_1V_PGElOHs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Nathy Peluso: Tiny Desk Concert", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
