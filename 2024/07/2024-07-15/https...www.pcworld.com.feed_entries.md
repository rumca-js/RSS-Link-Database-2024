<p>I&rsquo;ve never built a PC in anything smaller than MicroATX. But even as someone who can&rsquo;t live without a few extra PCIE slots, I must admit that those Mini-ITX designs have some <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2374276/watch-pcworld-build-a-pair-of-sff-video-production-pcs.html">serious aesthetic appeal</a>. If you happen to have even a budget 3D printer, you don&rsquo;t need to sojourn to your nearest MicroCenter to see one, either &mdash; you can whip up a free one at home. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/919239-kubic-an-itx-pc-case-that-looks-like-a-cube">Kubic</a> is a small form factor PC case compatible with Mini-ITX motherboards, with a roughly <s>kubic</s> cubic layout and some NES vibes. At least that&rsquo;s the impression I get from creator WhoIsLudwig&rsquo;s choice of colors and finish on his completed files.

<p>Microsoft has changed the default font in Word with one of the latest updates. Instead of Calibri for normal text and Calibri Light for headings, the fonts Aptos and Aptos Display are now preset. </p>



<p>If you do not like the appearance of these two fonts, you can easily switch back to Calibri or set an alternative. To do this, open a new document and make sure that you are in the &ldquo;Start&rdquo; ribbon. </p>

<p>Attending HP&rsquo;s Imagine AI event in New York City last Thursday gave me a real indication about the direction AI laptops are heading in.</p>



<p>My main takeaway is that manufacturers are going to continue to push the limits on TOPS&mdash;tera operations per second, the processing speed of NPUs in AI PCs&mdash;as mobile workers dig deeper into the kinds of benefits generative AI will deliver them.</p>



<p>Proof of that was HP&rsquo;s announcement of a new laptop in its consumer portfolio: the <strong>HP OmniBook Ultra PC</strong>. The 14-inch clamshell-style laptop, designed for hybrid workers, makes a big leap in AI processing over the previously announced HP OmniBook X, offering what HP claims is an industry-leading 55 TOPS AI processing power in a laptop this thin.</p>

<p>The PC industry is currently obsessed with power efficiency, long battery life, and AI. But who&rsquo;s going to stand up for the people who want raw performance and don&rsquo;t care about anything else?</p>



<p>That performance advocate could be you, AMD. You&rsquo;ve got what it takes. So dig out that bomber jacket, put on those aviator shades, and lean in. Be the rebel chip vendor we want you to be.</p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t a story about AMD executives smashing a server with a sledgehammer, or spray-painting graffiti all over Intel&rsquo;s headquarters. In fact, at its recent Tech Day, AMD spent two days with reporters talking over PowerPoint presentations about IPC uplift, data paths, and the time to first token.

<p>Exciting times! Microsoft recently announced at its developer conference about artificial intelligence, a new laptop class with significantly more powerful Snapdragon X CPUs, and its new operating system for the Arm architecture all sounds really promising. </p>



<p>This is also true in view of the fact that Apple took this step very successfully and consistently years ago. In the meantime, the entire Mac model range has been converted to Arm CPUs from its own production; models with Intel x86 processors are no longer offered.</p>



<p>The fact that Microsoft is now announcing a similar step together with the important computer manufacturers Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung is therefore definitely a sign of things to come. </p>



<p>On the other hand, as a long-time IT observer, it is almost alarming when Microsoft once again announces a &ldquo;<em>n
