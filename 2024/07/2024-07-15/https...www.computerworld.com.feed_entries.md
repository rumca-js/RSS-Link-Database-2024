<p><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2511302/why-and-perhaps-how-apple-intelligence-will-make-money.html" target="_blank">Apple Intelligence</a> isn’t entirely Apple’s intelligence; just like so many other artificial intelligence (AI) tools, it also leans into all the human experience shared on the internet because all that data informs the AI models the company builds.</p>



<p>That said, the company explained <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/introducing-apple-foundation-models" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">where it gets the information it uses</a> when it announced Apple Intelligence last month: “We train our foundation models on licensed data, includ

<p>The AI landscape is undergoing a transformative shift as chipmakers, traditionally focused on hardware innovation, are increasingly recognizing the pivotal role of software.</p>



<p>This strategic shift is redefining the AI race, where software expertise is becoming as crucial as hardware prowess.</p>

<p>AMD’s recent acquisition of Silo AI, Europe’s largest private AI lab, exemplifies this trend. Silo AI brings to the table a wealth of experience in developing and deploying AI models, particularly <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1627101/what-are-large-langua

<p>A whistleblower letter obtained by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/13/openai-safety-risks-whistleblower-sec/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> accuses Open AI of illegally restricting employees from communicating with authorities about the risks their technology may pose. The letter was reportedly sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) — the agency that oversees the trading of securities — urging the regulators to review Open AI.</p>



<p>According to the letter, Open AI allegedly used illegal non-disclosure agreements to, among other things, force employees to refrain from whistle-blowing incentives and it re

<p>Chat GPT developer Open AI is developing a new kind of reasoning AI models with the project name “Strawberry” that can be used for research, according to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-working-new-reasoning-technology-under-code-name-strawberry-2024-07-12/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. Strawberry was apparently earlier known by the name “Q” and would be considered a breakthrough within Open AI.</p>



<p>The plan is for the new Strawberry models to not only be able to generate answers based on instructions, but also to be able to plan ahead by navigating the internet independently and reliably perform what Open AI

<p>Some employees of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI have reportedly written to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking a probe into some employee agreements, which they term restrictive non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).</p>



<p>These staffers-turned-whistleblowers have written to the SEC alleging that the company forced their employees to sign agreements that were not in compliance with SEC’s regulations.</p>



<p>“Given the well-documented potential risks posed by the irresponsible deployment of AI, we urge the commissioners to immediately approve an investigation into OpenAI’s prior NDAs, and to review current efforts apparently being undertaken by the company to ensure full compliance w

<p>On Friday, <a href="https://computersweden.se/article/2509923/apple-vision-pro-har-lanserats-i-kina-och-japan-fler-lander-pa-gang.html">Apple Vision Pro was launched in Europe</a>. But the analysts do not expect any major sales success.</p>



<p>According to research firm IDC, fewer than 500,000 units of the mixed reality headset will be sold in 2024, which is partly due to the high price. Apple’s headset costs $3,499; that corresponds, for example, to almost 50,000 Swedish kronor with included VAT and other fees.</p>



<p>By comparison, Facebook’s parent company Meta sells its Meta Quest 3 headset for $499, and its predecessor, the Meta Quest 2, retails for $299.</p>

<p>One of the more tired cliches in IT circles refers to “Cowboy IT” or “Wild West IT,” but it’s the most appropriate way to describe enterprise generative AI (genAI) efforts these days. As much as IT is struggling to keep on top of internal genAI efforts, the biggest danger today involves various business units globally creating or purchasing their very own experimental AI efforts.</p>

<p>Amazon last week made an <a href="https://www.adept.ai/blog/adept-update">unusual deal with a company called Adept</a> in which Amazon will license the company’s technology and also poach members of its team, including the company’s co-founders.</p>



<p>The e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming and artificial intelligence (AI) giant is no doubt hoping the deal will propel Amazon, which is lagging behind companies like Microsoft, Google and Meta in the all-important area of AI. (In fact, Adept had previously been in acquisition talks with both Microsoft and Meta.) </p>
