## Deadpool & Wolverine sneak preview hints at a snarky satire on Marvel’s multiverse

<p>Can Ryan Reynolds and the director Shawn Levy integrate our favourite antihero into the MCU? Or will they just send the whole thing up instead?</p><p>What exactly do we want from a Deadpool movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? The integration of Ryan Reynolds’s potty-mouthed mutant into the rather more wholesome universe populated by the likes of Spider-Man, Thor and the Hulk? Or a freaky, bloodthirsty, meta-fuelled superhero buddy movie that gives Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine one last hurrah on the big stage? Thirty-seven minutes of footage screened for fans from Shawn Levy’s film (at a super-snazzy London fan event featuring live bands, Spandau Ballet’s Martin Kemp DJing 80s hits and Jackman and Reynolds themselves) suggested we may well need to settle on one or the other, at least for a while longer.</p><p>Much has been made of Deadpool &amp; Wolverine’s potential to integrate X-Men – once the property of 20th Century Fox, now owned (like Marvel) by Disney in terms of big-screen

Surely it wasn’t anything too bad? I’d been arrested in Athens, Georgia, back in 2021, because my car looked like one that had been involved in a hit-and-run. It wasn’t, but it then turned out that my driver’s license wasn’t a driver’s license but rather a state identification card. A misunderstanding, but I was also in the middle of a crisis. Things went to hell in a handbasket, I went to jail overnight, but everything was eventually sorted out and I’ve had lots of great therapy since then.</p><p>Mike McClelland teaches creative writing at Eastern Illinois University and is currently at work on a novel</p> <a href

<p>Ninety-four-year-old Squibb is grea as a woman going after phone scammers – with the help of the late Shaft star Richard Roundtree – in a robust feelgood comedy</p><p>At 94, June Squibb gives a marvellous performance in this sentimental comedy from writer-director Josh Margolin, inspired by his own grandmother, a video of whom is played over the final credits. It is a film which is also surely inspired, more than a little, by the much tougher movies of Alexander Payne in which Squibb has also performed: she was the (late) wife of Jack Nicholson’s cantankerous widower in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/jan/24/artsfeatures2">About Schmidt from 2002</a>, and got <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/27/june-squibb-84-years-actor-nebraska-oscar">an Oscar nomination</a> as Bruce Dern’s plain-speaking wife in Payne’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/05/nebraska-review">2013 movie Nebraska</a>.

He was a fortnight shy of his ninth birthday.</p><p>If I said that I loved him and that this sudden, wrongful loss floored me for days, drained the world of light and colour for weeks and still jabs at me now, I would be stating what any but the most exasperated pet owner would recognise as the bleeding obvious.

<p>The sculptor says his uncannily accurate casts of discarded items – from Blu-Tack to burnt candles – are about redeeming waste. But really, this spellbinding show is beyond words</p><p>At first glance, Hany Armanious’s work is just rubbish – literally. Bits of Blu-Tack, old paint trays, half-burnt candles, a rusty table covered in sand.</p><p>But the objects on display at the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds are actually casts. They are not the <em>original </em>bits of Blu-Tack, they are utterly flawless replicas of them made in resin. I asked Armanious to tell me how he does it over and over, and I still struggled to comprehend how he could make perfect replicas of sand, foam, rope, stone and glass. They look so real, and they open an infinite can of worms about what makes something real, and why it matters. As the institute’s director director, Laurence Sillars, points out, Armonious is asking us to trust that these really are copies, and to suspend our disbelief.</p> <a href="htt

Who knows what lies beyond a lousy opening. What if the book gets better as it goes on?

<p>Unsurprisingly, creating a 3D avatar to increase a model’s income is fraught with moral and ethical questions, but this documentary seems uninterested in addressing them</p><p>Doubles, doppelgangers, clones; twin visions have long fascinated directors and audiences alike. It’s unnerving, however, when technologies that once belonged to the realm of science fiction are now realised in the present. A German model called Lale is interested in creating a 3D clone of herself and this documentary from Katharina Pethke taps into a new unsettling reality.</p><p>The rationale behind the project sounds promising on the surface. As the company that offers the body scanning service to Lale explains, a 3D clone can take on a larger number of campaigns, without the hassle of paying an in-person crew, thus increasing Lale’s income. What is striking, however, is that the firm’s examples of 3D avatars are all of non-white models.With the recent push for more inclusivity in the fashion and modelling

<p>A blunt detective teams up with a podcast journalist (because: 2024). Plus, the third and final series of The Great. Here’s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>Monday, 9pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br /></strong>Jenna Coleman is back with another twisty primetime thriller – a timely four-part story about a detective and a podcast journalist coming together to see how crimes in a Lancashire lakeside town might be connected. Coleman is straight-talking DC Ember Manning who, after her husband’s death, seems to be moving on well enough with their teenage daughter. A local arson attack leads Manning to reach out to Riz (Weruche Opia) – who is investigating a missing persons cold case – and a man in his 20s who had relationships with two underage girls. Manning’s discoveries soon compel her to question her own past relationship and the age gap between them when they met. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jul/15/tv-t
