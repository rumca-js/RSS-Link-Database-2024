Disaster movies like Twister have been dominating the box office for the better part of a century.  These disaster movies usually depict major natural disasters, incoming asteroids, or man made problems.  Usually they are a flash in the pan, but in the case of films like Twister, some have stood the test of time as truly great cinema.  With the sequel Twisters starring Glen Powell on the way, it seems we haven't lost our love for disaster movies.
