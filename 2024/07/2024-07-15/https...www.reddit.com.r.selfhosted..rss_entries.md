<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read some posts about self hosting DNS server. It's really very confusing. Such posts only use DNS word again and again and do not specify which DNS server?</p> <p>First, there are two types of DNS server we can selfhost- Recursive DNS (client computer uses it to translate domain name to IP. It gets IP from Authoritative DNS)</p> <p>Authoritative DNS (storing DNS records, with an exception of NS records maintained at registrar website).</p> <p>...................................</p> <p>Now there are two recursive DNS IP are stored in network settings of operating system of client computer.</p> <p>For domain name, there are also two Authoritative DNS.</p> <p>For selfhosting, what are the requirements- Will I need two IP? Will I need two static IP? Or dynamic IP will work.</p> <p>If dynamic IP will work, then how it will change automatically in my network settings of client computer OS.</p> <p>1.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So after many many years working in technology, I just recently learned the value of Docker and what it can do. Along that learning path, I kept seeing references to Kubernetes and K8s, and I was under the (very incorrect) assumption that Kubernetes was an alternative to Docker; I just found out how wrong that was. I can see sort of what it can do on top of Docker, and it’s very cool, however the first video I watched was just building a cluster of web servers with a load balancer. </p> <p>That’s great if that’s what you need; but what do you use it for in your home lab? Beyond running several of the same container for HA, tell me your real world use cases for a K8s cluster. I’m curious what you’re all doing with it at home or in your lab, as it may give me the motivation to start messing around with it some more. I will eventually be replacing the Pi 5 with a couple of NUC type mini PC’s, so I’m wondering if K8s makes sense at that point. The Pi 5 wi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I hope this isn't considered self-promotion, but I wanted to share a series I'm writing on self-hosting. I'm looking to do guides for people completely new to the space and welcome feedback, especially on next articles to write.</p> <p>The first is an overview of what self hosting is and the pros/cons. Then I wrote up a guide on how to setup Proxmox. The third installment sets up both a Linux and Windows VM.</p> <p>I'm thinking the next one should be Docker with Dockage/Portainer/etc. I also want to write up how to use NAS storage on Proxmox but probably want something a bit more detailed or it'll be a short guide!</p> <p>Anyway, would love anyone taking a look and providing feedback.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don't know much about hardware and it's compatibility, so i hope some of you will lend me a helping hand here.</p> <p>Right now i have a Dell Precision 3630 tower that i use as a server. However, i just got about 6 6TB HDD's plus the 3 that's already in the case, that i of course want to utilize. I first tried with an external JBOD case, but wasn't happy with that solution, so now i'm looking to migrate all the internals to another case.</p> <p>I don't know the type of the <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/da-dk/precision-3630-workstation/prec_3630_specifications_manual/motherboard-layout?guid=guid-cd1ddaa0-081a-4f7c-8018-2b5cfb5a2b23&amp;lang=en-us">mobo</a>, but when i ask chatGPT it says micro ATX. Is that reliable? If it is a micro ATX mobo, is it then necessary for the case to also be micro ATX, or just at least whatever size a micro ATX is (or bigger) and then the mobo will fit in there?</p> <p>Apart from the size/type, i need:</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Making this post to spread the good word about <a href="https://n8n.io">n8n</a>.</p> <p>Today, I decided that I wanted certain files on my server backed up in Dropbox every hour. Normally, I would just write a script and set up a cronjob to call it. If I went down that route then I would have to:</p> <ol> <li>Write the code to call some APIs that are hosted on my machine</li> <li>Spend some hours figuring out how to authenticate and interact with the Dropbox API</li> <li>Spend another few hours debugging the script and making sure everything was working as intended</li> </ol> <p>I thought &quot;Hey, let's try to use n8n to do this&quot; and so I did.</p> <p>It took 20 minutes. 20 minutes to have a workflow which runs every hour that calls Miniflux to get my RSS feed data, Mealie to get my recipes, and then upload those files to Dropbox. I got all of the functionality that I wanted + the logging and monitoring that comes out of the box with n8n.</p> <p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>I've setup my VPS to handle email. I've gone to the trouble of making sure, SPF, DMARC and DKIM have been setup. I thought would have been the end of it all. </p> <p>I got an email bounce this morning and on further investigation it turns out my IP is in a /17 block where someone has either been compromised or is just spamming. So as opposed to black listing the specific IP, now I've been affected as part of some sort 'guilt by association' punishment. According to the blacklst investigating I did anyway.</p> <p>Not sure what to do? I've obviously contacted my provider OVH Cloud but what's the best overall solution.

My brother has asked about setting up a server to back up their data. Anyone in this sub live in HK and can help me with where to go and what prices are decent? </p> <p>We went to the place in Sham Sui Po and got a quote from a system builder, but I'm wondering if there is a better place to go or if the guy is ripping us off. My HK family is fairly computer illiterate so they're not familiar with this stuff.</p> <p>(Yes I'm well aware of the pitfalls of setting up a server for family/friends and have accepted that I'll be tech support.)</p> <p>Edit: </p> <p>Should probably add what the quote was. </p> <p>CPU Intel i3-12100, mobo B760M, 16gb ddr4 ram, 512gb nvme SSD, 550w power supply, total $3080</p> <p>Adding 3x 16tb drives for $1900 each</p> <p>(Prices are in HKD)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user
