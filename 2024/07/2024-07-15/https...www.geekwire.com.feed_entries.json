The data reveals the initial impact of controversial pay regulations on the growing food delivery market. New York City began enforcing a minimum wage law for delivery drivers in December; Seattle implemented a similar law in January. Worker earnings in New York City rose from $11.72 per hour to $19.26 per hour after tips in the first quarter of this year,&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/new-data-reveals-impact-of-minimum-wage-law-on-food-delivery-drivers-and-orders-in-nyc/\">Read More</a>", "id": 868701, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/new-data-reveals-impact-of-minimum-wage-law-on-food-delivery-drivers-and-orders-in-nyc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "New data reveals impact of minimum wage law on food delivery drivers and orders in NYC", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-15T17:51:21+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TrueMedia.png\" width=\"867\" /><br />Journalists used artificial intelligence to check the authenticity of images from the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania on Saturday night \u2014 demonstrating both the potential and the limitations of AI technology in minimizing the spread of misinformation online. AI tools offered by Seattle-based non-partisan nonprofit\u00a0organization TrueMedia.org were used by reporters to assess images that spread on social media after the shooting, including a photo that appeared to capture a bullet in mid-air behind Trump&#8217;s head. That picture was taken by New York Times photographer Doug Mills.

The issue was a hot topic of discussion last week in Seattle at two major climate events: PNW Climate Week and the Bloomberg Green Festival. Training AI models and using AI-powered machines require tons of energy.

The system, known as FeaturePrint, doesn&#8217;t use barcodes or blockchain.
