  <p id="8GbezE">News moves fast following shocking events. But the hustlers trying to make a quick buck might move even faster.</p>
<p id="WcwFjV">Within hours of a shooter attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at a rally on Saturday, countless products emblazoned with an image of Trump, bloodied and fist raised, were for sale on e-commerce platforms. A shirt on Temu with an image from the rally and the words “TRUMP BULLETPROOF” is for sale for $9.59. (One person died at the rally and two were critically injured.) On Amazon, many of the top-selling men’s novelty T-shirts are nearly identical: some version of an image of Trump

  <p id="vyBasV">A federal appeals court has agreed to halt the reinstatement of net neutrality rules until August 5th, while the court considers whether more permanent action is justified.</p>
<p id="m8lBOk">It’s the latest setback in a long back and forth on net neutrality — the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) should not be able to block or throttle internet traffic in a discriminatory manner. The Federal Communications Commission has sought to achieve this by reclassifying ISPs under Title II of the Communications Act, which gives the agency greater regulatory oversight.
