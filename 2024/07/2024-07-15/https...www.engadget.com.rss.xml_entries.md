<h2 id="jump-link-compatible-macs">Compatible Macs</h2>
<p>First, you’ll need a recent Mac to run the Sequoia public beta. Apple’s software supports the following models:</p>

<p>Now that it’s available, you can test-drive Apple’s iOS 18 public beta before the software’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-18-gets-a-revamped-control-center-and-loads-of-home-screen-customization-options-172350046.html">official arrival this fall</a>.

<p>First, remember that, as its “beta” name implies, this is pre-release software that will likely reveal itself as such in ways that frustrate and annoy you. Some third-party apps may be broken (banking apps especially), and plenty of Apple’s features may be inconsistent or buggy until the company irons out the kinks in future updates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elon Musk confirmed on Monday that Tesla’s robotaxi event scheduled for August has been delayed to October. The CEO <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1812883378703925625">replied</a> on X (the former Twitter, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html">which he owns</a>) to a user’s post that he “requested what I think is an important design change to the front, and extra time allows us to show off a few other things.”</p>
<p>Musk’s X post appears to echo what <em>Bloomberg</em> reported last week. The publication claimed on July 11 that delaying the event would give Tesla <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-11/tesla-plans-to-delay-robotaxi-unveiling-to-october-from-august">more time to build additional prototypes</a>.

<p>YouTube Music is rolling out some fun new features, including the expansion of the “hum to search” tool that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-can-now-hum-to-find-a-song-on-youtube-music-for-android-190037510.html">has been in beta for Android users</a> since March. The company says this tool allows users to “search the YouTube Music catalog of over 100 million official songs” by using natural sound.</p>
<p>All you have to do is tap “search” and look for the waveform icon. Then it’s up to you. The tool lets people hum the song, sing the song or even play the song on another instrument. The feature is rolling out to YouTube music subscribers on both iOS and Android.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s also been working on something called AI-generated conversational radio.

But it can be tough to prioritize a run or a HIIT session when you have a lot going on at school. We’re not saying these products will magically open up time in your schedule, but a little motivation from a fitness tracker, good audio from workout earbuds and affordable apps that get you moving without a gym membership might make raising your heart rate a little easier. Here’s the fitness gear we’ve tried over the years that’s relatively affordable and doesn’t take up a lot of space.</p>
