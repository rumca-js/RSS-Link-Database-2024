Developer NetherRealm has pulled the plug on its free-to-play mobile game Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, just days after the studio reportedly laid off its entire mobile team.
</p><p>
Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a character-collecting RPG featuring faces from across the fighting series, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-new-mortal-kombat-role-playing-game-coming">announced</a> in October 2022 and arrived <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-onslaughts-free-to-play-rpg-battling-is-officially-available-now">almost exactly one year later</a>. It promised a "mobile-exclusive" story and "massive real-time group battles" for up to ten fighters.
</p><p>
Nine months on, however, and Onslaught is officially shutting down. NetherRealm <a href="https://x.com/mkonslaught/status/1814057567422750937">announced the news</a>

Just weeks after Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">major Xbox Game Pass shakeup</a>, a new report claims the company is mulling over a variety of additional subscription tiers in a bid to expand the service's reach, including a tier offering access to the Game Pass catalogue exclusively via cloud gaming.
</p><p>
That's according Windows Central's Jez Corden who, in a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/whats-next-for-xbox-game-pass-tiers-and-return-of-family-plan">lengthy article</a> discussing Game Pass' future, claims to have heard from sources that Microsoft's is "working towards" a cloud-only version that would be "cheaper and more approachable" than Game Pass Ultimate.

The internet was all in a flap last week after Microsoft promised to place <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-unveils-deadpool-bum-controller-as-competition-prize-for-one-lucky-recipient">Deadpool's pert posterior</a> into the hands of a lucky few by way of a new limited edition controller.

The Tesla Cybertruck is set to make its official video game debut tomorrow, in Fortnite. 
</p><p>
Many other games have featured <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>'s wheels before - but only via unofficial mods. The Cybertruck has been added by fans into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/of-course-the-cybertrucks-been-modded-into-gta-5">Cyberpunk 2077, Rocket League, GoldenEye 007, and even Minecraft</a>. 
</p><p>
Now, it's set to be ownable in a video game for real - years after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elon-musks-new-truck-looks-like-a-low-poly-90s-game-and-the-memes-are-rolling-in">memes spread online suggesting the Cybertruck looked like a PlayStation 1-era vehicle</a>.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has reinstated former President Donald Trump's account, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-bans-trump-for-good-promises-further-policy-changes">permanent ban in 2021</a> following the storming of the US Capitol building.

</p><p>
It's unclear if this was specifically requested by the Trump campaign team. Eurogamer was provided the following statement from a Twitch spokesperson:
</p><p>
"We reinstated former President Trump's Twitch channel," it reads. "We believe there is value in hearing from Presidential nominees directly, when possible. Trump is now the official Republican nominee for US president."

It's a simple kind of magic, and it's been there since the bright, fizzing days of the arcades, and yet I never even come close to getting tired of it. You race all the way to the right of the screen, and then - wow! - you're suddenly back at the very left. You run all the way to the top, and with one final push you find yourself back at the bottom.</p><p>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure is even more in love with this than I am. It's wraparound screens: the video game. Arranger tells the story of Jemma, a misfit trying to escape from a culture of cheerful stagnation. She leaves her home town and moves across the wider world trying to put right what has gone wrong and, in doing so, find a place for herself. All great. But she does this by manipulating a grid system o

Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has said he'll "never" charge money for a DLC or update "for as long as I live".
</p><p>
Earlier today, the developer posted on social media site X to say console and mobile ports of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">Stardew Valley 1.6 update</a> are "still in progress", following the PC release back in March.

</p><p>
"The ports and next PC update are still in progress," said Barone. "I know it is taking a long time, it's on my mind every minute. I have personally been working on the mobile port every day. I will announce when there is any meaningful news (eg. a release date). Hope you're having a good summer."

Tales publisher Bandai Namco is yet to announce Tales of Xillia Remastered, but the game has popped up on a slew of online retailers. 
</p><p>
Eastern European online stores JRC, Smarty and Brloh all briefly hosted listings for the game, for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, as spotted by fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1e8c14h/tales_of_xillia_remastered_leaked_by_slovakian/">reddit</a>. These listings have now been removed. 
</p><p>
Each image featured new boxart, with the same "Remastered" text design as the recent Tales of Symphonia Remastered. Eurogamer has contacted Bandai Namco for comment.

Netflix currently has over 80 games in development, with plans to release a game a month to its subscribers from this month onwards.

In its <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_events/2024/Jul/18/netflix-inc-usa-244e80f7-c939-40a1-a316-82d7d29f8a40.pdf">latest earnings call</a>, Netflix's co-CEO, president and director Gregory K Peters discussed the company's plans for gaming and how it will achieve growth.

</p><p>
Where the company is moving quickest is with interactive narrative games, which Peters describes as "easier to build". These are placed in the Netflix Stories narrative hub and it's here the company will be launching a new game each month based on popular series like Emily in Paris and Selling Sunset.

Outspoken former Capcom director Hideki Kamiya has said he feels a "duty" to develop sequels to cult classics Okami and Viewtiful Joe in order to finish off their respective stories. 
</p><p>
In his latest video with fellow Capcom alum Ikumi Nakamura, Kamiya asks Capcom again for the ability to return to his former franchises.
</p><p>
"Creators have the duty to create sequels fans are wanting to see," Kamiya said. "Although I sound all high and mighty, it's been a while since I've moved on from Okami. But I still feel like I haven't fulfilled my duty. So Capcom-san, please, let's do it together.

It's been rather hectic in video land recently and I also had a few days off here and there (selfish, I know) which made it hard to find time to put together site posts. I haven't been so slack over on the YouTube channel though, so here's a little rundown of the previous three weeks worth of VR coverage.</p><p>It's been a long time since a PSVR2 review code has appeared in my inbox but, two weeks ago, I was able to check out the first-person, tower defence VR game Captain Toonhead vs The Punks From Outer Space. 
</p><p>Developed by Columbian studio Teravision Games, the team behind the recently released Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, Captain Toonhead is a much more family friendly video game that features a light-hearted storyline and a nice

Publishers hoping to launch the world's next big live service game often give up on projects too soon, the boss of Warframe developer Digital Extremes has said.

Live service games with so-so launches could still be salvaged  with more work, Digital Extreme's Steve Sinclair told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/big-publishers-eject-too-soon-from-live-service-titles-says-warframe-boss/">VGC</a>, rather than moving on and ditching years of progress.
</p><p>
"They think the release is make or break, and it's not. They have a financial way to be persistent, and they never do it," Sinclair said. "It comes out, doesn't work and they throw it away."
