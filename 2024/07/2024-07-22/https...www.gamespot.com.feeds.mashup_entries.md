<p>Prior to the decision to make <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Cassandra_Nova_Xavier_(Earth-616)">Cassandra Nova</a> the villain in Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, the filmmakers considered other possibilities for the main baddie.

Debuting in 1974, the original movie was exceptionally controversial for its time because of its violence and gore, which could be argued is as graphic or more so than many modern horror slashers.</p><p dir="ltr">The first movie in the franchise introduces Leatherface as the primary antagonist. The focus is on him and his family, the Sawyer family (or Hewitt, depending on which timeline you're watching). The Sawyers are sadistic, violent cannibals who live in a dilapidated house in rural Texas. Leatherface is simply the enforcer for that group--or a hunter, if you will. The character's design as wearing the faces of his victims makes for an intimidating and iconic slasher killer, and that's before you get to his titular chai

There have been reboots almost since the dawn of cinema more than a century ago. But it's important to realize that reboots are not the same thing as sequels. Take for example, James Bond. Although multiple actors have portrayed 007, every film up to Die Another Day acted as if the same James Bond had lived through all of his adventures. Casino Royale was a true reboot because it introduced Daniel Craig's rookie Bond, and he had a five-film storyline that came to a conclusion in No Time To Die. Presumably the next James Bond movie will have to be another reboot after that.</p><p dir="ltr">So why does Hollywood keep rebooting some of its most-famous franchises? Because they're largely considered safe bets. Although some reboots have spectacularly
