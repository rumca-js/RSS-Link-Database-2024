<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm hoping for advice on finding a camera I can use that has a good view distance wise, or can be zoomed. I want to avoid more monthly fees... I have enough already. </p> <p>I need to be able to see around 100-150 feet ish, so I can just check my camera and look at my garage in my complex. I don't want notifications at all, since there's movement every moment of every day, but when I hear noises at night that should not be there, I don't want to have to walk all the way around my building to check. (we've been robbed 4x. I'm hyper vigilant)</p> <p>Ideally it is something that can be affixed to the outside without screws... And battery operated or plugged in outside 24/7.

## NVMe SSD longevity

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few days ago the NVMe SSD of my mini pc started reporting failures and everything stopped working. I have backups and snapshots in place so I didn’t lose critical data. But what is weird to me is that the disk only lasted about 1 year.</p> <p>I run about 20 docker services (*arr suite, photoprism, home assistant, etc), and a couple of cron jobs (poll TrueNAS for notifications, export files, etc). Is this too much stress for a single NVMe SSD drive? The drive was rated for 600 TBW, and I know this rating does not translate directly, but now I’m concerned if I just replace the drive and it lasts just one more year.</p> <p>Could this have been a case of just a bad quality drive or is this “normal” for a 24/7 load of about 20 docker services?</p> <p>The drive in question is a Silicon Power, not sure of the brand’s reliability but it had about 10k reviews and 4.5 stars.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/use

I may need a NAS and something like my zimaboard to do everything I want. I have a PI 4, Nvidia Jetson and now a zimaboard but I always fail to find a starting point I can build on.

Are there any good alternatives to herefm that anyone might know of? I tried Kosmi but it sent me to a room called &quot;18+ stroke party&quot; upon account creation. I removed myself from the chatroom and launched the web app again only to get sent into that very same chat. I also tried gathertown, but it's too hard to navigate and personalize the workspace. Are there any other alternatives I don't know about? Also, are there any programmers here? if so, how hard would it be to recreate the website/app? I'm just desperate to get herefm back at this point 😭 🫶</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Boring-Sp

Changing Ip addresses could be resolved by a DDNS, and for the problem with DSLite i had some ideas aswell:</p> <ol> <li>Use exclusively IPv6 in my Network. -&gt; Problem: would have to use Kubernetes instead of docker, and it seems like some applications like jellyfin dont work very well with IPv6</li> <li>Dual Reverse Proxy: Combine the DDNS server with a reverse proxy.

Additionally, it would tunnel the IPv4 request via IPv6 to the reverse proxy in my home network, and from there on everythings ipv4 again in my homenetwork (at least i think that

Since I prefer not to run computers at home, I rent a dedicated server from Hetzner.</p> <p>Yesterday, I received an email notifying me that a netscan had been detected originating from my server. It had been scanning IP addresses like <a href="http://192.1.0.253">192.1.0.253</a> on port 8006. Because I didn't respond in time, Hetzner temporarily blocked my IP from accessing the internet. I am now trying to find the root cause, as it seems something in my network is performing these scans. I have no idea how this happened since none of my servers are accessible from the internet; I use Cloudflare to protect them.</p> <p>Where would you start in addressing this issue? How can I find the root cause?</p> <p>Here's my setup:</p> <ul> <li>Dedicated server from Hetzner with a WAN IP address: x.x.x.1</li> <li>ProxMox firewall en

Can Proxmox handle such a setup? How will i manage the power costs if I leave another pc running 24/7?

My Restic repository is encrypted with a password. The script needs the password the be able to backup to the encrypted repository. </p> <p>At the moment I pass on the password as a file, that file is owned by root and only accessible by root. But I still prefer not to have my password in plain text.</p> <p>I already use pass, is there a way to let the script grap the password from pass instead of a file? </p> <p>Thanks for any tips.</p> <p><code> export B2_ACCOUNT_ID=&quot;backblaze_id&quot; export B2_ACCOUNT_KEY=&quot;backblaze_key&quot; export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=&quot;b2:Bucket&quot; export RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE=/etc/restic-password </code></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Proximus88"> /u/Proximus88 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r

I've been trying to get my server back online after a long time, so I wanted to do a clean install.</p> <p>So, I downloaded the newest Proxmox 8-2 and it was great for the first few days. I had a problem with TrueNas (Set as the only VM) and decided to reboot everything. When I did, it was taking forever to boot and when i looked at the screen, it was having major SSD issues. So today I swapped the SSD for a 4TB WD Red HD and tried to do a clean boot. </p> <p>Now while trying to do a clean install again from a thumb drive, I'm seeing a ton of errors with: &quot;Buffer i/o error, dev sda, sector,...&quot;</p> <p>I have reformatted the thumb drive and same error. I have used another 8 GB thumb drive and still the same errors. I am open to try anything at this point here. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a
