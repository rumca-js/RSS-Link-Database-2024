<p>As with any new CPU architecture, software support and ease of adoption are extremely important if you want to reach a wider audience. I wouldn't expect every developer and SBC hobbyist to be able to compile the Linux kernel, and the need to compile much of anything these days is getting rare. So having any instance where one <em>has</em> to know how to tweak a Makefile or pass in different flags to a compiler is a bit of a turn-off for platform adoption.</p>
