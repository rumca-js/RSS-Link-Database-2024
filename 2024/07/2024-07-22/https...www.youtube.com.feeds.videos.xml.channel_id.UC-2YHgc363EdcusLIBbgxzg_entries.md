In today’s Lightning Round video, we tackle the fact that the moon rang like a bell for hours when the Apollo 12 second stage slammed into it, the questionable intelligence of the whale shark, and the newest JWST findings that seem to add to the cosmological crisis. Along with some personal musings.
