<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Before I go about purchasing a few load sensors and doing the calculations myself, does anyone happen to know where the center of mass coordinates of the raspberry pi 4b are (using the same axes as the major-minor dimensions of the pcb itself). I couldn't find this in the datasheet either.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pickandroll3"> /u/pickandroll3 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1e9nmra/center_of_mass_coordinates_of_a_rpi_4b/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1e9nmra/center_of_mass_coordinates_of_a_rpi_4b/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a Raspberry Pi that controls it's hdmi ports ar certain days/time. When my Rpi script turns off the hdmi port on the Rpi, the TV is supposed to not display anything and should go back to sleep. When the script enables the port back on, the TV should wake back up from sleep and start displaying the input from the Rpi. However currently, when the Rpi gives an input signal to the TV, the TV does not turn on from sleep and I have to manually turn it on from the remote. Is there anyway to automate it? (I'm using xrandr to turn the hdmi ports on/off. HDMI CEC on the Pi couldn't detect the TV even if samsung anynet is enable) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sidiiss"> /u/sidiiss </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1e9l8d7/samsung_tv_input_controls/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1e9l8d7/samsung_tv_input_c

I followed the instructions shown here <a href="https://blog.unetstack.net/Project-Sabine-Low-cost-DIY-underwater-modem-using-COTS-components-and-Unet-audio">https://blog.unetstack.net/Project-Sabine-Low-cost-DIY-underwater-modem-using-COTS-components-and-Unet-audio</a> (this is what I'm building) as well as tried other installation methods shown on their website. Whenever I get to the step to try to run UnetAudio using &quot;bin/unet -c audio&quot; or through one of the groovy files, I get the same error: </p> <p>bin/unet: line 30: /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-armhf/bin/java: cannot execute: required file not found</p> <p>I have confirmed though this exact file path that the java file is located there, and am a bit lost as to what to do next. Any suggestions or prior experiences would be greatly appreciated, thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &
