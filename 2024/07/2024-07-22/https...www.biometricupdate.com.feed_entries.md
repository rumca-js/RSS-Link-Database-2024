		A Johannesburg-based company, Ren-Form, which supplied biometric hardware to the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) says it is not responsible for glitches reported during general elections in the country in May.

An investigation by <a href="https://www.news24.com/news24/investigations/iec-paid-joburg-printing-company-r546m-for-faulty-voter-management-devices-that-delayed-voting-20240718">News 24</a> reveals that the IEC paid the sum of 546 million rand (US$.29.8 million) to the company for the supply of 40,000 biometric Voter Management Devices (VMDs) which reportedly caused delays during voting because some of the devices didn’t work properly. The IEC had initially hoped to procure 60,000 devices but changed its plan due to financial constraints.

		The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission of Kenya (IEBC) has cried out that supplementary budget cuts instructed by the President of the Republic will affect a planned continuous voter registration exercise and other activities related to its preparations for upcoming electoral operations in the country.

Kenya has faced socio-political tensions in the past weeks, headlined by youth-led protests which forced President William Ruto late last month to withdraw an unpopular finance bill which was set to increase the tax burden on citizens.

As part of the fallout of the protests, Ruto also sacked his entire cabinet almost two weeks ago, and pledged to make adjustments to the country’s budget in the face of an economic squeeze.

The IEBC is among the state in

		More than a dozen bills have been introduced in the current U.S. Congress that, if enacted, would increase protections for minors online by requiring website operators to use biometric or other personally identifiable information (PII) to verify a person’s age.

Such a requirement, however, would likely come up against a variety of constitutional and other legal challenges, wrote Clare Cho, a specialist in industrial organization and business policy at the U.S. Congressional Research Service (CRS), in a June report for Congress, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47884"><em>Identifying Minors Online</em></a>.

		Three years after New Zealand law enforcement agencies were ordered to delete tens of thousands of photos of children and young people it collected unlawfully, the police are struggling to complete the task due to the sheer volume of images.

In 2021, the Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) and the Office of Privacy Commissioner (OPC) launched an investigation into the practice of taking photos of young Maoris which concluded with action against the police for breaching privacy regulations. Police were also ordered to delete fingerprints taken unlawfully after it was discovered that the force engaged in a “systemic” practice of collecting duplicate sets of fingerprints and photographs of young people in custody and holding on to them longer than allowed.
