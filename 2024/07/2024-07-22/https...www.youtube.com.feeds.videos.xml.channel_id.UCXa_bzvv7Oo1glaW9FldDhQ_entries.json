The indie space has also done pretty well for itself, with The Outlast Trials offering a frighteningly gruesome time. It only makes sense that an adaptation of A Quiet Place would arrive sooner or later.\n\nDeveloped by Stormind Games and published by Saber Interactive, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead adapts the hit film series. Taking place a few months after murderous aliens arrive on Earth, it focuses on college student Alex as she navigates the ruins of society while trying to survive. Make too much noise, and the aliens will quickly rip you apart.\n\nAs simple as it may seem, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead has the potential to be a big hit.
