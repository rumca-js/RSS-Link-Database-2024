MCSs typically produce intense, concentrated, and long-lasting rainfall, which can trigger floods. Despite this, their contribution to major flood events in East Asia has received relatively little attention, largely due to a research gap between meteorology and hydrology fields. As a result, the quantitative relationship between MCS and major flood events at the climate scale has not been well established.", "id": 908173, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2024-07-reveals-contribution-mesoscale-convective-east.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 30, "page_rating_contents": 95, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed", "source_obj__id": 251, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2024/new-study-reveals-cont.jpg", "title": "New study reveals contribution of mesoscale convective systems to floods in East Asia", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-22T12:27:07+00:00", "description": "Raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14 years old in South Australia is an important step forwards in progressing the principles of trauma-informed justice systems, Flinders experts say.", "id": 908174, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2024-07-crime-expert-trauma-justice.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 30, "page_rating_contents": 95, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed", "source_obj__id": 251, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2019/crimescene.jpg", "title": "Crime expert promotes trauma-informed justice", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-22T12:26:32+00:00", "description": "Magnetite, the most magnetic mineral on Earth, is increasingly being found in seafloor environments that are rich in iron and have high methane flux.
