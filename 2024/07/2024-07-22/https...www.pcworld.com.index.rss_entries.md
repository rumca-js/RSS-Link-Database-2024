<p>Comic book superheroes and their live-action counterparts have always put impressive physiques front-and-center&hellip; but never has the objectification of superheroes been so literal as in the latest promotional Xbox controllers.</p>



<p>For the upcoming <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> threequel, Microsoft will let fans get their hands on the goods, so to speak. With unique designs inspired by the costumes and, um, assets of the two co-leads, these controllers take &ldquo;ergonomics&rdquo; to a new level.</p>



<p>The rear panels have been custom molded to evoke the bodacious booties of Deadpool and Wolverine, going so far as to match the textures and seams of their figure-hugging suits. Microsoft&rsquo;s promotional material says that they&rsquo;ve both been &ldquo;designed by Deadpool,&rdquo; which tracks.</p>

<p>I hate having to carry around multiple chargers, so having one capable brick that can charge three devices simultaneously is ideal&mdash;and so it&rsquo;s kind of perfect that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-Foldable-MacBook/dp/B09C5RG6KV/">Anker 735 (Nano II 65W) USB-C portable charger is 46% off right now on Amazon</a>, available for a mere $30.</p>



<p>This nano-sized Anker power bank is the only charger you&rsquo;ll need because it can handle three devices at once&mdash;including laptops and smartphones&mdash;and it provides intelligent high-speed charging.</p>



<p>When you connect a single device, it provides a max charging rate of 65W, which is more than enough for a laptop. With multiple devices connected, it efficiently distributes power between ports to ensure each device gets the best charge possible.</p>

<p>By now you&rsquo;ve probably heard of the CrowdStrike outage. If you&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to avoid any personal headaches from this widespread incident, you surely know someone who <em>was</em> affected.</p>



<p>The good news? Microsoft has released a recovery tool to help IT workers get around the PC crashes that resulted from the CrowdStrike update, hopefully alleviating recovery times.</p>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-box-text inline-box">
<p><strong>Quick context:</strong> CrowdStrike is a US cybersecurity software supplier that sells security infrastructure to huge corporations. While you probably don&rsquo;t work with CrowdStrike&rsquo;s software directly, there&rsquo;s a good chance it&rsquo;s humming away somewhere within the systems of the company you work for.</p>

<p>A Wi-Fi-connected security camera is an easy and technologically simple way to watch your home and give yourself a little peace of mind&hellip; or maybe you just like knowing the moment your Amazon packages arrive. Honestly, it&rsquo;s mostly the second thing.</p>



<p>But while Wi-Fi security cameras are meant to equip homeowners and apartment dwellers with thief-deterring measures, thieves are now using tech to even the playing field. </p>



<p>According to a tweet sent out by the <a href="https://x.com/LAPDWilshire/status/1764780841996030209/photo/1">Los Angeles Police Department&rsquo;s Wilshire division</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/lapd-warn-residents-after-spate-of-wi-fi-jammer-cloaked-burglaries-police-share-a-security-check-list">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>), a small band of burglars is using Wi-Fi jamming devices to nul

<p>Last Friday, there was a worldwide IT system outage that took down millions of computers around the world. It was so catastrophic that it&rsquo;s been labeled as the largest IT meltdown of all time.</p>



<p>Due to a faulty update pushed by cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike, numerous Windows systems crashed and couldn&rsquo;t boot back up due to an infinite loop of blue screens, restarts, and more blue screens.</p>

<p>Steam Deck competitors have had a lot of ups and downs, but if there&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s frequently approved as an immediate alternative to Valve&rsquo;s tiny titan, it&rsquo;s the ROG Ally by Asus.</p>

<p>Publicly, Intel is no closer to solving the mystery that surrounds crashes with its 13th- and 14th-gen Core desktop processors. However, company representatives denied Internet comments that say that its mobile processors are subject to the same crashes.</p>



<p>Matthew Cassells, the founder of Alderon Games and developer of <em>Path of Titan</em>s, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1e13ipy/comment/lcyythb/">claimed</a> on Reddit that the company had noted crashes on Intel&rsquo;s mobile processors. &ldquo;Yes we have several laptops that have failed with the same crashes,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just slightly more rare then [sic] the desktop CPU faults.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Previously, Alderon had issued a <a href="https://alderongames.com/intel-crashes">statement</a> blaming &ldquo;thousands of crashes,&rdquo; as noted by its own cras
