In a period piece like Those About to Die, or “sword and sandal epics” as they are sometimes called, audiences have high expectations for the costumes. And what the character is wearing doesn’t just say something about them—it says something about the world they inhabit. Creating the costumes for Those About to Die, and helping create the world of the show, required rigorous research and a heroic creative team.
On Episode 3 of Rise or Die, host Dana Schwartz (Noble Blood) talks about how some of the tactile details on set—like the costumes, the props, even the texture of the dust—allowed the Roman Underbelly to come to life. She speaks to costume designer Gianni Casalnuovo, actors Iwan Rheon and Sara Martins, and historical consultant Justin Pollard about bringing authenticity to a part of Roman life is that sometimes overlooked.

F1 Manager 2024 reviewed by Henry Stockdale on PlayStation 5, also available on PC, PlayStation 4, Switch, and Xbox.

F1 Manager 2024 doesn't completely escape the pitfalls that come with being an annual series, though evolutionary changes make this a welcome third outing. New features like creating your own team offer strong customization options, and securing victories with a tailor-made squad feels even sweeter than building upon an existing team. The mechanical faults and expanded sponsorship systems add welcome strategic depth, too. Several flaws like the tedious contracts system could use further work, and some lingering issues like collision damage haven't been solved, but this is still Frontier's best take on a Formula 1 management sim yet.
