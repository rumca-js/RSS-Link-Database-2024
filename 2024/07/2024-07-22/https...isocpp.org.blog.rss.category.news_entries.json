Lucian Radu Teodorescu provides a simple theory of concurrency which is easy to reason about and apply.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<h3>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://accu.org/journals/overload/32/181/teodorescu/\">Concurrency: From Theory to Practice</a></h3>\n\t<p>\n\t\tby Lucian Radu Teodorescu</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFrom the article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\tOne of the big challenges with concurrency is the misalignment between theory and practice. This includes the goals of concurrency (e.g., improving the performance of the application) and the means we use to achieve that goal (e.g., blocking primitives that slow down the program). The theory of concurrency is simple and elegant. In practice, concurrency is often messy and strays from the good practices of enabling local reasoning and using structured programming.</p>", "id": 911337, "language": "en", "link": "https://isocpp.org//blog/2024/07/concurrency-from-theory-to-practice-lucian-radu-teodorescu", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://isocpp.org/blog/rss/category/news", "source_obj__id": 314, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Concurrency: From Theory to Practice -- Lucian Radu Teodorescu", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
