I kept wondering, &quot;Could I 3D print this at home instead of buying it?&quot; This led me to create a simple Chrome extension that might help others too.</p> <p>The extension is straightforward: when you're browsing Amazon search results, it shows you 5 relevant objects from Thingiverse.com that you could potentially 3D print at home. No more endless searches to see if there's a printable alternative!</p> <p>I know it’s not much yet, but I thought some of you might find it useful.
