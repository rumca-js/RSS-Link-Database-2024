He's a bit more into combat and less into narrative; Gloomhaven is probably not narrative-focused enough for what I'm looking for, but really, I'm just looking to compile a list of all of the good narrative/storybook-driven games that have compelling gameplay to them (and aren't just choose-your-own-adventure books disguised as boardgames) so I can research our options. I've looked at the likes of Oathsworn (promising) and Earthborne Rangers (probably not the right theme for my son)...what else would you recommend? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Commentator28"> /u/Commentator28 </a> <br /> <sp

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few days ago I posted something on <a href="/r/scythe">r/scythe</a> Basically I have applied some house rules to the game to make it feel a bit more like a RTS game. </p> <p>I did this because i, like many other was disappointed in how the game sells itself like a 4X but in reality it's an economic/management game with little interaction between players.</p> <p>Long story short, people didn't like it haha, so since I may be wrong I would like to ask: is there a board game that plays like a RTS? I bring some examples from the videogames i used to play on PC:</p> <ul> <li>age of empires </li> <li>warcraft 3 (which plays a lot like scythe with the playable hero &amp; resource gathering)</li> <li>stronghold </li> <li>rise of nations </li> </ul> <p>What game gives that feeling of being able to gather resources, recruit troops, building structures and have fights? </p> <p>I hope I made it clear and I look forward to your answers :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Catan is a classic in the little board game club I host and it's usually my go-to for people who have never seen a board game besides Monopoly before.</p> <p>Be it because of poor colony placement at the start or someone else is getting all the luck with the dice, I've seen lots of new players being frustrated by the lack of agency: you really can't do anything when you aren't getting any resources, so they decide that the game just isn't for them and they don't show up to the club anymore.</p> <p>My advice to them so far has been to buy some Progress cards to try and turn the tide in their favour by maybe snatching a critical resource from an opponent, but I'm interested of what's your strategy to catch up when you're severely falling behind.</p> <p>Go for Progress?

## 'Mountain Goats' is absolutely better in every way when compared to 'Can't Stop'. What other games do you think are better than another similar game?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Played both games at different times and Mountain Goats is so much better. Better art, better dice decision making, better player engagement. With Can't Stop, when someone else is rolling dice, you don't care about the board since it doesn't affect you in any way. With Mountain Goats it has that light Monopoly effect where when someone else is rolling dice, you kinda/sorta care about the outcome of the dice. The artwork is better, and it can go upto 5 with expansions. AND AND it plays in a shorter time with the same &quot;feel&quot; like Can't Stop.</p> <p>Anyways. I think this turned into rant, but also one game is from 2020s, and one game is from the 1980s. </p> <p>What games in your opinion is much better version of another game?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AlexRescueDotCom"> /u/AlexRescueDotCom </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1e937dd/mountain_goats_i

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We were opening up and playing our brand new Betrayal: Deck of Lost Souls when we noticed an unusual feature. On every single card aside from the Journey cards, only able to be seen in the correct lighting, were these unusual glyphs like some Easter egg. We looked all over the Internet and found nothing on these glyphs and what they meant, so I resorted to trying the board game subreddit to see if anyone here knew about these glyphs. We don't know if it was some puzzle, an Easter egg, or just some watermark. If it was some cool Easter egg or anything relevant to the game, we wanted to find out what it meant but will just drop it if it's just some watermark.

Fast forward to now, where I’m married to someone who literally NEVER loses. We can play a game with any amount of strategy and not just pure luck he wins; never fails. (He hates pure luck games because it ‘takes the skill out of winning” he says). It has honestly started to kill my love of board games because I don’t know how I’ll ever get enough skill to beat him when he is so naturally gifted at winning.

I know about Pericle: gathering darkness which I will try out but it seems very complicated which I don’t mind but I would like to incorporate games like ‘court of the dead’ that I heard about is really fun but it’s mainly multiplayer.
