From the time when Microsoft's first party lineup was characterized by sparse offerings to more recent years, which have seen the company building up a much meatier stockpile of studios and franchises, one fact that has remained constant for Xbox as a brand is that Gears of War has been and continues to be one of its biggest, most successful, and most beloved properties. 

Maybe there's a case to be made that the series doesn't have the sort of shiny prestige that it used to have during the Xbox 360 era, but even now, it's unquestionable that Gears of War is one of Microsoft's biggest and most important first party franchises.

The series' next game, Gears of War: E-Day, is set to pause its ongoing story and instead take players back in the timeline, going back 14 years prior to the events of the first game, further back in the Gears chronology than we've ever gone before, to tell an origin story focused on beloved series veterans Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago.

The market for horror games is healthier than ever, whether you're a fan of Resident Evil or anticipating the revival of Silent Hill. The indie space has also done pretty well for itself, with The Outlast Trials offering a frighteningly gruesome time. It only makes sense that an adaptation of A Quiet Place would arrive sooner or later.

Developed by Stormind Games and published by Saber Interactive, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead adapts the hit film series. Taking place a few months after murderous aliens arrive on Earth, it focuses on college student Alex as she navigates the ruins of society while trying to survive. Make too much noise, and the aliens will quickly rip you apart.

As simple as it may seem, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead has the potential to be a big hit. Take a closer look at why alongside the more notable aspects.

From resetting at checkpoints and having enemies respawn at death to the promise of a line of challenging bosses to take on, the upcoming Black Myth: Wukong is clearly going to have more than a little bit in common with Soulslike games, but as the action RPG approaches its August release, developer Game Science has also made it clear that it isn’t going to fall completely in that genre. 

In some key ways, and to varying degrees, Black Myth: Wukong will deviate from the traditional Soulslike formula, instead choosing to do things its own way, whether that’s through the style of its combat or in terms of how it handles progression. Here, we’re going to go over some of the biggest ways it will differ from regular Soulslikes.
