<p>These pasty-like cheesy parcels are ideal picnic fare</p><p>The same Italian teacher who taught me <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jun/03/rachel-roddys-recipe-for-stuffed-tomatoes">to stuff vegetables in her brown kitchen</a> introduced me to diminutive and augmentative suffixes using the word<em> pancia,</em> or “belly”. It was a good move on her part, teaching me via my stomach, and years on I still remember her lesson. It went something like this: the addition of <em>-ino</em> or -<em>ina</em>, depending on the gender of the<em> </em>pancia<em> </em>being described, produces <em>pancino/pancina,</em> or little belly. The suffix <em>-etta</em> has a similarly diminishing effect,<em> </em>as in <em>pancetta</em>, which also brings us to cured pork. At the other end of the scale, adding augmentative -<em>ione</em> or <em>-iona </em>produces more the ample<em> pancione </em>and <em>panciona. </em>My wise teacher also explained how, in southern dialect, pancia

<p>It took less than 24 hours for the newest member of our family to make a break for freedom. It nearly ended badly for both of us</p><p>‘The honey-coloured one with the funny hat,” said Myles, our youngest son. “I’m calling her Honey!” With that, we’d completed our family mission to choose a mixed flock of chickens at a rural poultry farm. And so we set off on the return journey to Melbourne with three cardboard cartons containing six ISA Brown laying hens and three pet bantams.</p><p>Since it was late in the day, the whole flock went into our fox-proof coop, with the usual settling-in biffo. Honey immediately came out on top, even with chickens twice her size who were clearly scared of her intense, don’t-mess-with-me demeanour. But next morning she relaxed a little when introduced to the new chicken run under our olive tree, and so did I. Until that afternoon, anyway, when there was a knock on our front door.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/22
