Assuming Kamala Harris is the nominee, will she be an easier candidate for Trump to beat? By her own merits, yes. But she's never done anything by her own merits and she won't start now.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden is officially out of the race. But, does he even know it? And, how can the Democrats claim to be the party of democracy after pulling off a coup against their own nominee? We'll talk about all of that today. Also, assuming Kamala Harris is the nominee, will she be an easier candidate for Trump to beat? By her own merits, yes. But she's never done anything by her own merits and she won't start now. Also, the head of the Secret Service testifies on Capitol Hill. And a pop star reveals her plan to rent three wombs at the same time to have triplets—yet another reason why surrogacy is an abomination.
