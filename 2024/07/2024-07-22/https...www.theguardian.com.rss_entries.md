That was my part. Finished. I said to this bloke, ‘I can’t believe the waste of money on this film. Take me.

<p>With new players and staff – both executive and coaching – in place Erik ten Hag will be looking for improvement </p><p>Call it the warmest of rapprochements. A work in progress. An uneasy truce or standoff of convenience. However you boil it down, there is no escaping how dubious Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos-led football department was of Erik ten Hag’s candidacy to continue as Manchester United manager. After the Dutchman survived despite the sounding out of a plethora of potential replacements, can he and Dan Ashworth, the club’s new sporting director, strike up a strong professional relationship and work in concert to drive the team forward? There is a desire from Ten Hag and Ineos to do so – of course there is – but the test of any cracks in the Dutchman’s status may come if United lose three on the bounce or eke a couple of draws while stinking the pitch out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/22/manchester-united-pre-season-us-tour-five-things-to

## Difficult, fearsome, aggressive: the Faye Dunaway documentary is unusually frank

<p>Unlike many other fawning documentaries about big stars, HBO’s Faye is fascinatingly candid and unvarnished</p><p>Faye: The Many lives of Faye Dunaway, <a href="https://www.hbo.com/movies/faye">now streaming on Max</a> in the US, is a refreshingly frank portrait of a genuinely interesting star. In fact it is often surprisingly candid. The director Laurent Bouzereau is a friend of the actor’s son Liam Dunaway O’Neill, who appears several times, so it is naturally a very compassionate film. Crucially, however, it confronts without flinching the subject’s reputation for being what is euphemistically described as “difficult” – so much so that even the redoubtable Bette Davis told Johnny Carson she would never work with her again.</p><p>The documentary begins with Dunaway on edge, haranguing the film-makers to get started. She displays both the tetchiness and the perfectionism – the couch, the camera angle just aren’t right – that fed into that notorious reputation. But her face lights

<p>Only a handful of people grasp the magnitude of the changes that are about to hit us. They’re exciting – and terrifying</p><p>A short while ago, a screenwriter friend from Los Angeles called me. “I have three years left,” he said. “Maybe five if I’m lucky.” He had been allowed to test a screenplay AI still in development. He described a miniseries: main characters, plot and atmosphere – and a few minutes later, there they were, all the episodes, written and ready for filming. Then he asked the AI for improvement suggestions on its own series, and to his astonishment, they were great – smart, targeted, witty and creative. The AI completely overhauled the ending of one episode, and with those changes the whole thing was really good. He paused for a moment, then repeated that he had three years left before he would have to find a new job.</p><p>In 2020, I participated in an experiment that I gave a lecture on the following year, later published as a booklet titled My Algorithm and I.

An annual plan will start as soon as you want and is typically good value if you are planning more than one trip. We did a quick quote on Comparethemarket for a break in France compared with an annual policy covering multiple trips to the EU – prices started at £5.55 for a individual in their 40s spending one week away and at £12.15 for a year. (These are very basic policies – if you want larger cash sums covered or fewer exclusions on what you can claim for, you will need to pay more.) Most annual trips will have a cap on the length of each stay. In some cases this is 24 days, so make sure that’s enough for your purposes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jul/22/insurance-pets-and-phones-how-to-get-the-best-deal-on-holiday-costs">Continue reading...</a>

Alluding to her gruelling treatment for an unnamed condition, De Felice’s narration then rolls back to the past as she speaks of romantic relationships and student activism under Silvio Berlusconi’s administration, all charged with tumultuous passion. Sepia-toned images are projected on what looks like a fluttering fabric screen whose surface is flecked with subtle black ridges and marks.</p><p>Presented in this unusual fashion, footage of this era gains a highly textured, at times ghostly, quality.

In Liverpool in 1859, William’s wife was ill and he wanted her to be nursed at home. After she died he asked the nurse who had cared for her, Mary Robinson, to provide the same care for others among the city’s poor. Florence Nightingale saw the impact of this and wanted more people to be able to access this care. It was rolled out into the 18 nursing districts of Liverpool, which is where the term “district nursing” originated.</p><p>The Queen’s Nursing Institute is the oldest nursing charity in the world. It was founded in 1887 with a grant from Queen Victoria and has about 2,500 registered nurses who have spent more than five years working in the community.

<p>Campaigner Sophie Morgan is leading the fight to allow wheelchair users greater freedom when flying. Plus, Will Mellor meets the real people behind the Post office scandal. Here’s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong> <br />
 “We’re treated like luggage, like cattle.” This documentary’s opening footage of the reality of flying as experienced by disabled people is shameful. So much so that paraplegic TV presenter Sophie Morgan is taking the issue to the White House and Downing Street, and campaigning for laws to ensure the use of an invention that could allow passengers to stay in their wheelchairs while flying. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jul/22/tv-tonight-the-shameful-reality-of-what-flying-is-like-for-disabled-people">Continue reading...</a>

## Populism has plenty of false promises to solve Britain's problems. Labour will need to expose them | John Harris

<p>Sooner or later, the snake-oil charm of Nigel Farage and Reform will have to be tackled head-on – especially if Trump returns to the White House</p><p>For a politician who has usually avoided high-flown rhetoric, Keir Starmer is suddenly sounding remarkably ambitious. As he addressed the House of Commons after last week’s king’s speech, he said his government’s aim was “nothing less than national renewal”. But there was an even bigger story he wanted to tell, aimed not just at hard-right Tories and the chancers of Reform UK, but their political soulmates across the world. At that point, Donald Trump had just survived an assassination attempt and Joe Biden was still clinging on to his declining hopes of another presidential term, and it seemed as if Starmer wanted to do his bit to fill the moral breach: his government’s agenda, the Labour leader said, represented “a rejection, in this complicated and volatile world, of those who can only offer the easy answer – the snake-oil charm o

<p>She’s one of Britain’s greatest ever athletes – yet has often felt like a failure and fraud. She talks about her Olympic golds, the misery that came with them, and the joy she has found since she retired</p><p>Victoria Pendleton is driving us to the stables in Dorset. We’re off to see her two horses, Vesper and Sarah. She has two bags with her – one containing her cycling gold medals, the other crammed with carrots and apples. She is convinced she’s going to feed the horses the medals. At times, you sense she wouldn’t mind.</p><p>Ask Pendleton for her greatest achievement in sport, and she’ll tell you about an event that occurred after she retired. She’d only been riding horses for a year when she raced at Cheltenham in 2016, finishing two and a half lengths behind the great Nina Carberry in the Foxhunter Chase. She’s never felt so elated, she says. Does that mean more than the gold medals? “In some ways, because it was totally unexpected. You’re dealing with a live animal so you n

<p>In Athens, the birthplace of republican rule, a new exhibition is exploring art it inspired, from pop art shootings to spies lurking in the Parthenon. Ironically, dictators steal the show</p><p>No place on Earth should have more authority to speak about the enduring appeal of democracy than the place that first came up with it. But a new art exhibition in Athens seems reluctant to shout about its credentials. You have to walk right to the end of the National Gallery of Greece’s show, past 137 works by 54 artists, before you come across anything like a claim to authority – and even then it’s far from triumphant.</p><p>Rika Pana’s paintings of the Parthenon, set against backgrounds of melancholy blue and muddy green, accentuate not the steadfastness of the ultimate symbol of Athenian democracy, but its eventual ruin. In three paintings, from the series The Erosion of Civilisation, the pillars of the temple – commissioned by the radical democratic reformer Pericles in the 5th century

<p>Kyiv has freed 3,800 prisoners early to plug gaps in its army as military outfits compete to attract suitable convicts</p><p>Last year, Volodymyr Prysiazhniuk quarrelled with his father-in-law, Yuriy. Both men were drunk. “I’d had a litre of beer,” Prysiazhniuk recalled. The row escalated and he punched Yuriy twice in the head. The older man fell over – dead. In court Prysiazhuiuk admitted his guilt and told the judge he had called an ambulance. He got eight years for manslaughter.</p><p>Prysiazhniuk had reconciled himself to a long period behind bars. In June, however, he walked out of penal colony number 67, in the western Ukrainian town of Sokyriany, and got on to a bus. Several other inmates joined him. They said farewell to the Soviet-era jail, with its guard tower and salmon pink walls, and were driven to a military camp in the south-east of the country.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/22/ukrainian-convicts-recruited-fight-war">Continue reading
