<p>Google won’t kill third-party cookies in Chrome after all, the company said on Monday. Instead, it will introduce a new experience in the browser that will  allow users to make informed choices about their web browsing preferences, Google announced in a <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/privacy-sandbox-update/"><ins>blog post</ins></a>. Killing cookies, Google said, would adversely impact online publishers and advertisers. This announcement marks a significant shift from Google's previous plans to phase out third-party cookies by early 2025.</p>
<p>“[We] are proposing an updated approach that elevates user choice,” wrote Anthony Chavez, vice president of Google’s Privacy Sandbox initiative. “Instead of deprecating third-party cookies, we would introduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they’d be able to adjust that choice at any time. We're discussing this new path with regulators, and

<p>Condé Nast, the media conglomerate that owns publications such as <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Vogue</em> and <em>Wired</em>, has sent a cease-and-desist letter to AI-powered search startup Perplexity, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/cond-nast-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-ai-search-engine-perplexity">according</a> to <em>The Information</em>. The letter, which was sent on Monday, demands that Perplexity stop using content from Condé Nast publications in its AI-generated responses and accused the startup of plagiarism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move makes Condé Nast the latest in a growing list of publishers taking a stand against the unauthorized use of their content by AI companies, and comes a month after <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/18/forbes-perplexity-ai-legal-action-copyright">similar action</a> taken by <em>Forbes</em>.

<p>Wireless food probes are some the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-grilling-gear-143011296.html">best grilling gear</a> for keeping tabs on meat and other items while cooking. You don't have to dodge cords when you're flipping a steak or trying to wrap a brisket.

The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), a child protection charity in the UK, says that Apple reported just 267 worldwide cases of suspected CSAM to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) last year.</p>
<p>That pales in comparison to the 1.47 million potential cases that Google reported and 30.6 million reports from Meta. Other platforms that reported more potential CSAM cases than Apple in 2023 include TikTok (590,376), X (597,087), Snapchat (713,055), Xbox (1,537) and PlayStation/Sony Interactive Entertainment (3,974). Every US-based tech company is required to pass along any possible CSAM cases detected on their platforms to NCMEC, which directs cases to relevant law enforcement agencies world

<p>A faulty update from cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike caused a global outage last Friday, apparently affecting some 8.5 million Windows devices, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/outage-caused-by-crowdstrikes-disastrous-update-affected-85-million-devices-192703245.html">according to Microsoft itself</a>.</p>
<p>The update triggered a blue screen of death (BSOD), knocking offline systems used by hospitals, airlines, and banks. Only machines running Windows were affected — according to CrowdStrike, the total number of devices affected was “less than one percent of all Windows machines.”</p>
<p>The update “was designed to target newly observed, malicious named pipes being used by common C2 frameworks in cyberattacks,” according to CrowdStrike. Unfortunately, it included a logic error, crashing the OS. In the blog post on Saturday, Microsoft’s VP of enterprise and OS security, David Weston, wrote that the company is working with CrowdStrike to “develop a scalable solution” to fix the

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/outage-caused-by-crowdstrikes-disastrous-update-affected-85-million-devices-192703245.html">CrowdStrike outage</a> that started late on Thursday is still causing havoc as Delta was forced to scrap an additional 1,250 flights yesterday on top of the 3,500 already cancelled, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/more-us-flights-cancelled-wake-global-cyber-outage-2024-07-21/"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported. That has left tens of thousands of Delta fliers stranded waiting for new flights that could take days, forcing many to cancel or postpone trips. The airline has yet to say when it will resume normal operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delta has scratched a third of scheduled flights for a total of 5,000 since Friday, and delayed another 1,700. &quot;In particular one of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,&quot; said Delta C
