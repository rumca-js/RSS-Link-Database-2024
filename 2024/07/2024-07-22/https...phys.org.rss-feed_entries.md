A research team developed and validated a liquid single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip named "HbGBTS80K," which includes 80,080 SNPs evenly distributed across 18 chromosomes. This SNP chip effectively distinguished 404 rubber accessions into four groups in population genetic diversity analysis and detected the major gene HbPSK5 in GWAS for the number of laticifer rings. The HbGBTS80K chip is a valuable tool for accelerating functional studies and molecular breeding in rubber trees, addressing the inefficiencies of traditional breeding methods.

The human body's sense of touch is so important it can be found throughout the body, not just on the skin. Two tiny sensors of touch, Piezo1 and Piezo2, signal the lightest pressures and can be found monitoring the circulatory system, telling the body where its limbs are in space, and even sounding the alarm for bladder pressure. But a new study from Duke University shows that Piezo1 works differently than everyone thought.

Atomic nuclei come in different shapes, varying from football-like ("prolate") to pancake-like ("oblate"). Prolate and oblate shapes have different moments of inertia. This is a body's resistance to having its speed of rotation altered by an external force. Atomic nuclei having different shapes with different moments of inertia implies that it takes different amounts of energy to spin different nuclei.

A bitter taste is traditionally considered a warning sign of potentially toxic substances. But not all bitter substances are harmful. For example, some peptides and free amino acids taste bitter, even though they are non-toxic, nutritious and sometimes even vital for humans.

Among the vastly different ways of tackling a disease, controlling the genetic expression of cells is undoubtedly one of the most powerful. Over the past few decades, scientists have come up with dozens of innovative strategies that involve using messenger RNA (mRNA) to "force" cells to build specific proteins. These mRNA-based therapies have recently gained prominence as vaccines against infectious diseases like COVID-19. Additionally, they hold significant potential for treating cancer and genetic disorders.

## New study reveals contribution of mesoscale convective systems to floods in East Asia

East Asia frequently faces floods, leading to significant economic losses, casualties, and agricultural damage. Most summer floods in this region are caused by excessive rainfall. Mesoscale convective systems (MCS), large organized storms characterized by cumulonimbus clouds, play a significant role in these events. MCSs typically produce intense, concentrated, and long-lasting rainfall, which can trigger floods. Despite this, their contribution to major flood events in East Asia has received relatively little attention, largely due to a research gap between meteorology and hydrology fields. As a result, the quantitative relationship between MCS and major flood events at the climate scale has not been well established.

Magnetite, the most magnetic mineral on Earth, is increasingly being found in seafloor environments that are rich in iron and have high methane flux. But how it forms in such settings—whether by microbes that thrive near methane seeps or by processes that don't require life—is not entirely clear.

## Two-in-one mapping of temperature and flow around microscale convective plumes

Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have devised a way to measure both the temperature and velocity profiles of fluid in a convective plume at millimeter length scales in 3D. They combined near-infrared absorption imaging and image processing to separate the motion of tracer particles from snapshots of how light is absorbed, producing both a smooth velocity and temperature map.

Researchers from the School of Biological Sciences (SBS) and the Swire Institute of Marine Science (SWIMS) at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), in collaboration with National Chung Hsing University, have made an exciting discovery on the Hong Kong coast. They have identified two fiddler crab species: Tubuca dussumieri, previously recorded in old literature but never confirmed in recent times, and Tubuca. coarctata, which has never been seen in Hong Kong.

Hurricane season is here, with Hurricane Beryl already leaving a trail of damage after hitting Texas' shorelines. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting a record number of named storms in the Atlantic this year. As these events continue to increase, it's imperative to find solutions to help manage the inevitable hazards.

Languages have different ways of highlighting relevant information. Recent research shows that despite these differences, the consequences are the same: to trigger a brain response to process information more deeply. In an EEG study published in PNAS, led by the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics (MPI) in Nijmegen, researchers investigated Makhuwa, a Bantu language that highlights relevant information in a different way than many Indo-European languages. Results reveal a universal pattern of processing relevant information.
