								<p>Games Workshop is releasing a Warhammer 40k board game which pits Space Marines against Tyranids in the nightmare depths of a space labyrinth &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not Space Hulk. The newly announced Space Marine Adventures: Tyranid Attack has the same setting as the legendary board game, but that&rsquo;s about all it shares. In Tyranid Attack, &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/warhammer-40k/tyranid-attack-board-game">Continued</a></p>

								<p>Not every tabletop RPG fan has read Brandon Sanderson&rsquo;s Stormlight Archive novels, but most&nbsp;know their way around a d20. It makes sense, then, that the Stormlight RPG takes a lot of inspiration from existing RPG giants like D&amp;D and Pathfinder.

								<p>I was lucky enough to get an early review copy of the new Necromunda: Hive Secundus box set from Games Workshop, and my main takeaway so far is that the rulebook contains the most high octane, heavy metal, grimdark Warhammer 40k lore I&rsquo;ve read in years. I love Warhammer 40k lore in all its forms. &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/warhammer-40k-necromunda/hive-secundus-lore">Continued</a></p>
