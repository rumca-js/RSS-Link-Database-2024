While CrowdStrike has apologized, it has not mentioned whether or not it intends to provide compensation to affected customers. And when asked by CNN about whether it plans to provide compensation, its response did not address that question. Experts say they expect that there will be demands for remuneration and very possibly lawsuits. \n\n\"If you're a lawyer for CrowdStrike, you're probably not going to enjoy the rest of your summer,\" said Dan Ives, a tech analyst for Wedbush", "id": 907573, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/07/21/2146251/who-will-pay-for-the-costs-of-crowdstrikes-outage?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdotMain", "source_obj__id": 306, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Who Will Pay For the Costs of Crowdstrike's Outage?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-07-22T08:34:37.293879+00:00", "description": "Re-visiting the Napster era, Stephen Witt's book How Music Got Free has been adapted into a two-part documentary on Paramount+.

Very few organisations will buy software from an American firm that, in the past, has been vocal about the cyber-security threat posed by Beijing. Additionally, China is not as reliant on Microsoft as the rest of the world. Domestic companies such as Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei are the dominant cloud providers. \n\nSo reports of outages in China, when they did come, were mainly at foreign firms or organisations. On Chinese social media sites, for example, some users complained they were not able to check into international chain hotels such as Sheraton, Marriott and Hyatt in Chinese cities. Over recent years, government organisations, businesses and infrastructure operators have increasingly been replacing foreign IT systems with domestic ones.
