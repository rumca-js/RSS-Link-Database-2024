<p>Legacy virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solutions that rely on centralized servers and complex infrastructure are not well-suited for the dynamic and diverse needs of modern organizations. Instead, many are looking for a cloud-based alternative that reduces complexity and total cost of ownership.</p>



<p>A few years ago, legacy VDI solutions were vital to organizations seeking to bolster application delivery management, unified endpoint management, and security capabilities. But they are often expensive, difficult to manage, and prone to performance issues.</p>



<p>Desktop as a service (DaaS) solutions leverage the cloud to deliver virtual desktops on demand and provide many benefits that

<p>The advantages of cloud computing come with notable challenges that frustrate enterprises, particularly managing costs and optimizing resources. Desktop as a service (DaaS) is one notable cloud service that can be complex and requires careful planning and monitoring to avoid overspending and underutilization, leading many to turn to managed platforms that can ease those burdens.</p>



<p>Microsoft Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) stands out as a leading enterprise VDI solution, offering unparalleled scalability, security, and flexibility for organizations of all sizes. The virtual desktop operating system is used to securely host desktops and applications in the cloud. It is highly scalable and flex

<p>The US government has introduced new regulations that make it difficult for Western technology companies to export certain computer components to China. So, Nvidia is now in the process of developing a special version of its AI chip that can be sold to China without violating the new laws.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-preparing-version-new-flaghip-ai-chip-chinese-market-sources-say-2024-07-22/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, the chip is a variant of the B200, one of the processors in the Blackwell series launched in March.

<p>An interoperability deal Microsoft enforced by the European Commission in 2009 may have led the Windows-maker to open itself to the recent <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2872861/crowdstrike-ceo-apologizes-for-crashing-it-systems-around-the-world-details-fix.html" target="_blank">CrowdStrike-led outage</a>, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>In an interview with WSJ, a Microsoft spokesperson indicated the deal could have potentially kept Microsoft from completely locking down the Windows operating system for security purposes. Queries sent to Microsoft however did not elicit a response until the publishing of this article.</p>

<p>Dell had it all figured out. The venerable computer company wouldn’t force people back into the office. Instead, it would just insist that all <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dell-hybrid-workers-return-office-three-days-week-progression-innovation-2024-2" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">staffers show up at the office for at least three days a week</a>. </p>
