<p>Labour has brought forward a Bill giving the Office of Budget Responsibility a "fiscal lock" over future economic policy. This is one more step in the erosion of parliamentary democracy, says Andrew Collingwood.</p>

<p>The CrowdStrike debacle was not a harbinger of things to come if we introduce CBDCs, argues the Daily Sceptic's IT expert. A U.K. CBDC would be designated as Critical National Infrastructure and hence not be vulnerable.</p>
