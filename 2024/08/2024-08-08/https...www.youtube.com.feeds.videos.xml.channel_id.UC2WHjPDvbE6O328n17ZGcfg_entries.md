Out of pure spite, I've decided to make the world's shortest Java course to make it simple and straightforward for anyone to learn Java. Because according to a comment on my last video, "...anyone who use java can't really be taken seriously or professionally at this point. It's a dead language as far as current business standards go." I guess that commenter didn't realize 90% of Fortune 500 companies use Java.

So here it is, a course for a programming language that'll actually get you a job.
