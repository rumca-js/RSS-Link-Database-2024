The Babylon Bee Podcast looks at crazy lefty Tim Walz being chosen as Kamala Harris's VP pick. They analyze some of the many controversial bills he has signed and how he ran away from the call of duty. There was also a  stock market crash, tensions between Iran and Israel, and violence in the UK. They conclude with a lighthearted Red Lobster fact, subscriber headlines, and a closing hymn in honor of Apollo 11.
