Corey, which is actually a pen name representing a long-running collaboration between science-fiction writers Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck. “The Expanse” is their best-known work — consisting of nine novels that lay&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/alien-saga-from-the-expanse-creators/">Read More</a>

Gross bookings reached $28.8 million, up 6%, and room nights booked grew 10% to $98.9 million. Perhaps most notable in the company&#8217;s earnings release was a caution that the Seattle-based giant saw &#8220;a softening in travel demand&#8221; in July, causing it to adjust expectations for the rest of the year. Expedia&#8217;s stock fell initially after market close on Thursday but was up more than 7% later in after-hours trading.

The suit, filed in King County Superior Court, marks the beginning of what&#8217;s likely to be a complicated and drawn-out legal battle in the aftermath of last year&#8217;s loss of OceanGate&#8217;s Titan submersible and its crew. Nargeolet, a veteran of more than 35 Titanic dives, was one of the five people aboard Titan who died in June 2023 when the sub underwent a catastrophic implosion during its final descent to the Titanic wreck in the&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/titanic-nargeolet-oceangate-lawsuit/">Read More</a>
