Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Kamala Harris's new running mate seems to be guilty of stolen valor. That's a sin that Americans across the political spectrum universally condemn. So how did this guy end up on the ticket? And will it sink Kamala's presidential campaign? We'll discuss. Also, Tim Walz goes to a church that teaches God is nonbinary and encourages its congregants to celebrate Ramadan. What does that tell us about the kind of guy he is? And three black women won gold, silver, and bronze in gymnastics. But did they actually earn the medals, or has this become the DEI Olympics?
