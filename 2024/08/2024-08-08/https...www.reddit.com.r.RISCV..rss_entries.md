I wrote a simple CLI converted back then that was sufficient for me at that point but not very user friendly. I decided to make the tool easier to use so that other students have easier access

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I received my BPi F3 with 16 GB RAM yesterday. Unfortunately, the device constantly freezes without any error message or anything. The board just becomes unresponsive and sometimes the display (HDMI connected) garbles and turns red. I have tested with and without NVMe ssd connected (2 different ones). The CPU has a heat sink and fan connected. CPU Temperatures never seem to above 50Â°C. My power meter connected between mains and the power supply never reads more than 5-7 Watt. Generally, the board boots up properly but as soon as one does anything with it it freezes after a short time. Opening the browser, going to youtube and click the search box always freezes. Updating bianbu OS freezes during download of the packages. Writing a few hundred MB to the NVMe ssd: freeze. </p> <p>Things I tested: - Power supplies: DC in with 12V 5A, 12V 2A, 12V 2.5A , USBC 12V 3A, 5V 4A, and various other ones. - sdcard: 4 different ones. some are known to work on the v

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>I am writing a Zig port of xv6 for qemu-riscv64, and I am running into an issue getting Uart keyboard input; the plic is sending interrupts to the kernel, but for some reason, it never has any data. I've reread the mit c implementation about 20 times but If there's any tools that can help me figure out where I'm wrong or if anyone has some experience that would be great thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Puzzleheaded-Cut1522"> /u/Puzzleheaded-Cut1522 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1emu8lq/uart_on_virt_machine_qemu/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1emu8lq/uart_on_virt_machine_qemu/">[comments]</a></span>
