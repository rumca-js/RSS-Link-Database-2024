In today's Daily Fix:
WB Discovery held an earnings call recently, and it wasn't great news for their games division. WB Games took a hit this past quarter when Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League failed to ignite the Batman fanbase. The company is now looking to potentially license their famous IP, including DC characters and Harry Potter, to other non-WB game studios. But what will be left for their many in-house studios? WB is looking to grow their free-to-play business, so maybe expect more of those games in the future. And in other news, indie hit Vampire Survivors is finally coming to PlayStation later this month.
