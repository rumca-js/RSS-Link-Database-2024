## Laptop deals may be bigger than ever this year, analyst hints

<p>The tech industry’s breakneck pace of introducing new processors may be better for you than you thought. One analyst suspects that laptop retailers may be more interested in selling out older notebook stock than usual — to make space for the exciting new models.</p>



<p>AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm are rushing out new processors: AMD recently launched the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2353351/amds-ryzen-ai-300-is-built-to-dominate-thin-light-copilot-laptops.html">Ryzen AI 300 notebook processor</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2413682/intel-will-launch-its-next-mobile-core-chip-lunar-lake-on-sept-3.html">Intel is pushing ahead to Lunar Lake in September</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2407664/snapdragon-x-elite-review-gordon-dives-deep-into-qualcomms-flagship-chip.html">Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips</a> are driving fo

<p>Microsoft Clipchamp’s video editor is one of the company’s best products. AI is one of the company’s top initiatives. So, <em>voila</em>: AI is being added to Clipchamp in three big ways.</p>



<p>Two new features are being added today, to both Personal and Work accounts: background removal and noise suppression. But there’s an enormous new feature due in the fall: video creation via an AI prompt, with video, audio and transitions all selected by AI.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/708192/how-to-use-clipchamp-microsofts-video-editor.html">Clipchamp is Microsoft’s “built in” video editor</a> inside of Windows. It’s a Web app, but quite simple and easy to use. It might not have the power of professional tools like Da Vinci Resolve, but neither Paint nor Photos are designed to compete with Adobe Illustrator or Lightroom, either. All three are sim

## Nvidia GeForce Now expands to 2,000 streamable games

<p>Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming service has unique appeal to PC gamers, leveraging the collections they’ve already amassed on Steam, Epic, and other digital storefronts instead of paying for a big Netflix-style library — and the company has been expanding it ever since launch.</p>



<p>As of today, Nvidia’s servers can stream over 2,000 PC games. Not bad.</p>



<p>I checked the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/games/">master list of supported streaming games</a> on Nvidia’s promotional page just to see if they’re double-counting some games that are available on multiple storefronts. Nope! The list only includes single entries with storefronts following, so this isn’t some fine-print fudgery.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-new-games-august-2024/">latest weekly update</a> includes the early access version

## Score this ultra-fast 1440p Asus monitor for a ridiculous $199

<p>The 2560×1440 resolution (also called 1440p or QHD) has become the sweet spot for gamers who want sharper, more vivid visuals without having to sacrifice frame rates. But it’s tough to find a 1440p monitor that doesn’t cheap out on at least one of its key specs.</p>



<p>Well, this Asus gaming monitor hits all the important points and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Gaming-1440P-Monitor-VG27AQ3A/dp/B0BZR9TMBJ/">it’s just $199 on Amazon right now</a>. That’s $50 off its standard price.</p>



<p>The Asus TUF Gaming VG27AQ3A is a 27-inch monitor with 2560×1440 resolution and 180Hz refresh rate, plus compatibility with both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync. Pretty great right off the bat.</p>



<p>But best of all, at least for me, is that it uses a more color-accurate IPS panel that’s ideal for working with photos and videos (way better than cheaper VA panels).

<p>I never really thought you could have too many power outlets or USB ports — but then I saw today’s deal.</p>



<p>Amazon is selling <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SUPERDANNY-Protector-Outlets-Charging-Extension/dp/B08Z2ZKVXX/">this SUPERDANNY Surge Protector for just $25.99</a>, a 28 percent discount off its normal price, and this glorious behemoth of a power strip verges on overkill… in the best way possible.</p>



<p>The SUPERDANNY (we don’t normally capitalize full brand names, but <em>SUPERDANNY</em>!) offers up a heaping helping of not one, not two, but <em>22</em> grounded three-prong outlets for all your heavy-duty electrical demands.</p>



<p>What, that’s not enough? There are also six USB charge ports on tap — one Type-C, the rest Type-A — so you can plug in your phones and other USB-powered devices, bringing the total number of charging sockets up t

<p>Today, the first motherboard BIOS updates with fixes for Intel’s crashing CPUs are rolling out, from both Asus and MSI.</p>



<p>Intel’s fix is actually a microcode patch applied to the Raptor Lake-series processors to fix voltage errors. The patch is applied using motherboard UEFI-BIOS as a delivery method.</p>

<p>AMD is at the forefront here, with the laptop packing a Ryzen 7 5700U CPU (with eight cores, 16 threads) and Radeon graphics underneath the hood. It’s plenty zippy for office work, school work, and day-to-day tasks. It also comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage.</p>



<p>The higher RAM amount is nice, as we usually only see 8GB of memory at this price point. More RAM comes in handy when running multiple applications and when browsing the web.</p>
