Dr. Jordan Peterson sits down with country music artist John Rich. They discuss his new independent song release “Revelation,” the balance of artistic and commercial merit, recognizing constraints that detract from your proper orientation, discerning the spirits from the shadows, and what terrifies Jordan about the biblical Christ.

John Rich is a multi-platinum hit generator and music industry leader whose creative talents are matched only by his business savvy. He is also a proud father of two sons and recently celebrated his 13th wedding anniversary. Whether through a raucous party anthem or a sober reflection on hard times in the heartland, Rich’s ability to capture the American zeitgeist in song has made him one of the most successful and prolific entertainers in the music business today. In 2011, Rich impressed Donald Trump and American TV audiences with his business acumen and leadership skills, becoming the winner of Donald Trump’s Celebrity Apprentice and raising $1.5 million
