But there's more than meets the eye, like RISC-V and an additional PIO.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi Pico 2 tested in this video was sent by Raspberry Pi for review, they did not pay anything or have any input into the video's content, nor any review of it before it was published.\n\nHuge thanks to HalloSpaceBoy (who makes the PicoBoy) for sending over one of his PicoBoy V2 kits to test. If you want to buy one, he sent over coupon code 12661DF5 for 10% off any kit or prebuilt unit: https://www.tindie.com/products/hallospaceboy/picoboy-v2-the-ultimate-diy-console/\n\nFind out more about the Pico 2:\n\n  - My blog: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-pico-2-rp2350-adds-more-pio-risc-v-cores\n  - Raspberry Pi - Pico 2: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/\n  - Raspberry Pi - RP2350: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2350/\n\nOther videos and projects I referenced:\n\n  - Pico PCIe GPU: https://www.youtube.com/wa", "id": 997833, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXF_lVwA8A4", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg", "source_obj__id": 161, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/oXF_lVwA8A4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Raspberry Pi Pico 2: a RISC-V bet!", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
