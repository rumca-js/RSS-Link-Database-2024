<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I’m soon moving to a smaller but much nicer apartment (~700 sq ft) and I’m struggling to figure out how to keep (and fit) my board game collection without cluttering the space or having to hide them in the closet. My collection is not huge but it’s big enough to make this challenging. </p> <p>I’d love to hear some advice and see pics of how you manage to do it.</p> <p>P.S. I’m already planning on getting rid of games I don’t play that often.</p> <p>Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/According-Pick-4869"> /u/According-Pick-4869 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1enk471/board_game_collection_in_small_apartment/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1enk471/board_game_collection_in_small_apartment/">[comments]</a></span>

## Games that use Attack Modifier Decks or Action Decks

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have found myself recently not liking dice that much in board games for attacking (namely losing every single fight in my first game of Dwellings of Eldervale and ending the game with 0 glory). I really love the enemy attack deck and action modifier deck of Gloomhaven, and today saw that the kickstarter game Dragon Eclipse from Awaken Realms also uses a similar deck for deciding actions (which will probably sell me on backing it). I feel having these decks mitigates some of the luck, as you can edit them during the course of the game, and if you drew an unfavorable roll last turn (and if the deck isnt shuffled), you have more confidence in taking a more risky action. </p> <p>Of course dice are great for games like Dice Throne where multiple combinations of dice are viable. But honestly, for games like Catan, I rather just use a random number generator on my phone than using dice as I've had too many games where the resources I needed are never ro

I like the theme of it and the gameplay, however the element of randomness is a little off putting for me.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I impulsively bought Fallout: The Board Game because I'm a big fan of the franchise. However, after buying it, I found out that it isn't well-rated in the community. But I also discovered that the Atomic Bonds expansion would solve many of its problems. So, I bought the expansion too and now I want to know if I'll have at least a good enough experience to introduce me to the world of board games, or if I'll get frustrated and never want to play a board game again. Does Atomic Bonds make the game good?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BioMonster07"> /u/BioMonster07 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1emsvsl/fallout_board_game_as_my_first_board_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1emsvsl/fallout_board_game_as_my_first_board_game/">[comments]</a></span>
