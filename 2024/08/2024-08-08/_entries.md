Gerami violated his equity management account’s terms by improperly transferring 15 million stock shares in the first place, according to an Aug. 5 report by the law office of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, PC.

This week's huge selloff in global markets, triggered by an unwinding of yen-funded trades, is far from over and could eventually spread to credit markets, impair some banks and possibly hurt the U.S. dollar, fund managers say.  By Thursday, market volatility had subsided but stock markets struggled for direction and investors tried to guess how many more yen-funded leveraged trades remained to be unwound.  The market mayhem since last Friday -  which pushed Japan's Nikkei index into bear market territory and caused the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 to crumble 6% in five trading days - was triggered by a Bank of Japan rate rise last week, that gutted billions of dollars worth yen-funded trades as the yen soared 10% in a month.

Megacap and growth stocks swung between gains and losses in premarket trading and extended some pressure from the previous session, partly after Treasury yields rose on soft demand for a $42 billion sale of 10-year notes.  Global markets are experiencing heightened volatility this week after dour economic reports coupled with unwinding of currency carry trade positions pushed the Japanese yen higher after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates on July 31.  "U.S. weekly jobless claims will be very sensitive given the positions that have stacked up looking for the Fed to cut rates relatively aggressively by year end," said Marc Ostwald, chief economist & global strategist at ADM Investor Services.

Investors are struggling to figure out if the wide stock market meltdown stoked by weak U.S. recession worries and an unwinding of yen-funded carry trades is over.
