<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I have a Pi 4 with an ArgonONE v2 case. If I install the default Debian Bookworm (64 bit, lite) using the Raspberry Pi official Imager tool, and then run the ArgonONE script from their <a href="https://github.com/Argon40Tech/Argon40case">github page</a>, the behavior is as-expected - the fans are virtually silent and only turn on during thermal events (as defined by temp).</p> <p>If I do the exact same thing but choose Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS, the fans never stop running.</p> <p>I've already raised an issue on their GitHub page, but given they haven't replied to a single issue in 3+ years, so I'm not holding my breath. I've also emailed them in case they'll respond that way.

But after a while, the screen will start blinking or sometimes not work. I think it's just a power issue because it does the same thing with my laptop sometimes, but even when it's dark, the touch screen still works (I can see the mouse moving on the laptop screen when

Little checkup shows its also searching for a server with 192.168.0.15. Ok, fine. Bad practice to only use IP but whatever. I uninstall my lab, change the range to 192.168.1.*.</p> <

When I solder a 15 foot wire specifically made for LED strips, probably 18 ga. Only a 4 of the LEDs turn on white, but they don't fade or do anything. They should turn blue and fade. When I solder a shorter connection it works. When I try a different strip, it does the exact same thing. Any ideas why it isn't working as expected over a 15 foot distance? I quintuplets checked, the DI is green on both sides, 5v is red on tlboth sides, and ground is white.
