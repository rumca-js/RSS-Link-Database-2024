Linus is back at it again with another Tech Upgrade, this time for Sam our Jr Editor. He bought a new ROG Ally (Which Linus had to upgrade) a new fireplace (in the middle of Summer?!) and even decorated his Quest 3 headset with easily the worst sticker so far… Thanks AMD for continuing to help give our Staff Money to bother Linus with :)
