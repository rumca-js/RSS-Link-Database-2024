<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I'm currently trying to host a few services on a small homeserver setup using docker and connecting to those services via Tailscale. I found a guide from <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1282/docker">Tailscale</a> for setting up a tailscale node for each service and its working perfectly for containers like Immich, Mealie,... by simply adding the tailscale service to the docker-compose.yml file and replacing the ports section with <code>network_mode: service:immich-ts</code>.<br /> Now I want to add Seafile as another service but I'm getting an error from Portainer (where I manage all my containers/stacks). I changed the original docker compose file from <a href="https://manual.seafile.com/docker/docker-compose/ce/11.0/docker-compose.yml">Seafile</a> to a modified version following Tailscale's guide:</p> <pre><code>name: seafile services: seafile-ts: image: tailscale/tailscale:latest container_name: seafile_ts hostname: seafile environment

To keep my mind busy and as a culmination of months spent exploring databases and programming languages, I decided to create a side project—a classic URL manager. And why not share it online?</p> <p>Without any significant advertising, aside from a couple of Reddit posts and mentions by self-hosting communities like <a href="https://noted.lol/snapp/">Noted</a>, the project gained a small but encouraging user base. Their feedback inspired me to keep improving. Initially, I dove headfirst into feature requests and debugging issues, energized by these early users. However, after a few versions, I realized the code was becoming unmanageable. So, I recently decided to rebase the project, resolve outstanding issues, and here we are—with around 18k downloads on Docker Hub and about a hundred followers on

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I am trying to understand the difference in the cost of producing a single input token vs output token.</p> <p>Based on some articles, I came to the following conclusion:</p> <p>Input tokens processing scales quadratically, there’s no way around it, you have to compute attention (K and V by passing it through encoders) for each token with each other token.</p> <p>Output tokens scale linearly thanks to using KV cache (otherwise quadratic without KV cache, as linear tokens do) which is what everyone seems to do when hosting these models. I.e. you trade compute for memory, and try to be clever about how you store and compute all these stuff (like sparse, cache eviction…). I believe this is simply an empirically practical way around the quadratic scaling.</p> <p>Therefore, realistically, it’s really the memory capacity and bandwidth being the problem for output tokens rather than raw FLOPS. KV cache grows linearly with the sequence length regar

Y medio y luego salió un bloqueo de pago el cual dice que debo pagar y poner un pin para quitarlo específicamente es de Claro a lo que investigue es un blockware por ahí leí que se necesita una caja de desbloqueo ¿Quería saber si habria otra forma? la terminal es un Huawei Nova 9 la cual ya intente por adb y aparece &quot;User restrict&quot;<
