The Pico 2 has Raspberry Pi's latest silicon, the RP2350. But there's more than meets the eye, like RISC-V and an additional PIO.

The Raspberry Pi Pico 2 tested in this video was sent by Raspberry Pi for review, they did not pay anything or have any input into the video's content, nor any review of it before it was published.

Huge thanks to HalloSpaceBoy (who makes the PicoBoy) for sending over one of his PicoBoy V2 kits to test. If you want to buy one, he sent over coupon code 12661DF5 for 10% off any kit or prebuilt unit: https://www.tindie.com/products/hallospaceboy/picoboy-v2-the-ultimate-diy-console/
