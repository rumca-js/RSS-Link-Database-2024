Problem was, it was the last time Bol was in the right place all night. ­McLaughlin-Levrone, the ­greatest women’s hurdler in ­history, ran stronger, harder, and faster down the straight, and pulled right away from Bol, and everyone else, towards her second ­Olympic gold, and a rightful place as the ­greatest track athlete of her era.</p><p>By the time McLaughlin-Levrone reached the 10th hurdle, she was only racing her own world record, set at the US trials in June.

<p>The Oscar winner tries to rise above Eli Roth’s juvenile and derivative adaptation of the hit game but gets lost in the mess</p><p>Videogame fans will probably have a strong opinion on how the new sci-fi movie Borderlands fares as an adaptation of the game franchise. (A negative one seems most likely, based on any number of factors.) But for a different genre of nerd, Eli Roth’s long-delayed, faux-irreverent space adventure will feel like something out of 90s comic books, crossbred with contemporary superhero movies. Specifically, this incarnation of Borderlands is reminiscent of a third-tier title from a company nipping at the heels of DC or Marvel. It’s as if early-period Dark Horse or Image Comics tried their hand at ripping off Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy or DC’s Suicide Squad, in all their needle-dropping, ragtag boldness.</p><p>Lining up the knockoffs with their bigger-name equivalents is almost fun: Lilith (Cate Blanchett) is a distaff Star-Lord or, going back further,

But the song it sampled, the synth-laden Juicy Fruit by funk group Mtume, has its own rich history in hip-hop after initially topping the Billboard R&amp;B chart for two months in 1983. The track has underpinned Warren G’s g-funk opus Do You See in 1994, Faith Evans’s Faithfully in 2001, Let It Go by Keyshia Cole, Missy Elliott and Lil’ Kim in 2007, and Saweetie’s empowerment anthem Pussy in 2022. All told, more than 100 songs, largely rap tracks, have used Juicy Fruit in one way or another, thanks to a blend of nostalgia, sensuality and utterly brilliant drum programming.</p><p>“Juicy Fruit was on the cusp of R&a
