The list of games that Rockstar Games has released and changed the entire industry with is long- longer, perhaps, than most other developers out there. In terms of the quality and consistency of a developer’s output, there aren’t too many names that can be held up in the kind of incredibly high regard that Rockstar is. 

And yet, one area where the developer just can’t seem to move in the right direction is the frequency with which it releases titles. In fact, not only is Rockstar only releasing one major game every few years, the variety it used to exhibit in its output has also decreased dramatically. Here, we talk about why that is happening, and if we can ever look forward to something different.

Incoming is the sequel to 2011’s Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, and whilst Space Marine 2 doesn’t look to be a vast reimagining of the franchise’s established formula what developer Saber Interactive alongside publisher Focus Entertainment have demonstrated in previews and features shared up to now is a game much broader in scale and scope. 

Here, a fresh threat looms which must be eradicated against insurmountable odds. To support this relentless onslaught Saber Interactive have developed some nifty new tech, which we’ll go over in this video. Also included are explanations of the game’s new multiplayer modes, its co-operative capabilities, weapons, perks, combat mechanics, you name it. If it’s something different from the original, we’ve got it covered here.
