Using a newly developed metric that considered aerosols as tracers, they detected altered atmospheric transport patterns associated with climate change. They observed that the distance of transboundary air pollution moving east from China had shortened. Thus, long-term satellite-based Earth observations are crucial for early climate change detection and accurate evaluation of this trend.", "id": 998516, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/08/240808115233.htm", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "source_obj__id": 188, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Detecting climate change using aerosols", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
