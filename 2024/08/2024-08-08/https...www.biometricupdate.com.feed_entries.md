		Iain Corby of the Age Verification Providers Association (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/the-age-verification-providers-association">AVPA</a>) took the floor in New York at a Philippines-led <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=f_J6gY0sanY">UN hearing</a> to make the case that “age verification is convenient, accurate, cheap, privacy-preserving, secure, effective, accessible, inclusive and enforceable.”

Age verification laws are expanding across the globe, Corby says. “We’re seeing it in Australia where they’re going to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202405/australias-age-verification-trial-for-porn-sites-extends-to-cover-social-media">trial age verification</a>, the European Digital Services act requires it and they’ve alre
