BUT... I hardly ever use the natural hair brushes because of this and frankly I may as well not own them at this point. They're pristine, but that's because I rarely find myself using them for fear of ruining them and I may as well not own them.</p> <p>So... that said, who uses their fancy brushes with metals and how long do they last with scrupulous care in your experience?</p> <p>If they last a hot minute, like a few months, I may find that acceptable. </p> <p>I wash mine at the end of every session in brush soap.</p> <p>Thank you for your constructive responses.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/b

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of my friends likes to play Space Marines with lots of Heavy Support slots (I know that doesn't technically exist anymore, but it's the units). Our last match, he had 2 Eradicator squads, a 10 man block of Hellblasters with a Lt and a named Char, a Gladiator Valiant (It's normally a Lancer), and a Repulsor Executioner.</p> <p>My initial instinct is to take heavy armor, but from experience it just gets melted and then I'm screwed. So I've switched to Infantry to mitigate the damage.</p> <p>For context, I was playing Ultramarines. I used the, allegedly, very powerful Calgar/ApocBio/6Aggressors blob. Seemed like it would do great. Hellblasters came in from reserves and killed all the Aggressors and a Victrix in one shooting phase.</p> <p>On top of all this, he was playing Vanguard Spearhead, so anytime I was out of 12&quot;, I was getting -1 to hit. I played Firestorm Assault to try to get in his face and get the extra Strength while negating his -1

This dark and Grimey feel is something I love and I feel it's a good way to grimdark your otherwise out of place tau. Also decided to do a retro agasent base just so he popped more.
