Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-zombies-mode-gets-a-first-trailer-and-story-details">brief introduction</a> to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Zombies mode earlier this week, Activision and developer Treyarch have shared first gameplay details of what it's calling a "purely round-based" Zombies experience for this year's game.
</p><p>
Storywise, Black Ops 6's Zombies mode begins after a group of former Requiem members are liberated from the remote Terminus Island complex in the Philippine Sea by Maya Aguinaldo and Dr. William Peck. Maya is one of four playable Operators in this latest iteration of Zombies - she's joined by Grigori Weaver, Elizabeth Grey, and Mackenzie "Mac" Carver - and unfortunately for them all, Terminus Island is a bio-research station for Project Janus, and those pesky Dark

God of War Ragnar&ouml;k is making the jump from PlayStation to PC on 19th September, and ahead of its arrival, Sony has shared PC system requirements - which, among other things, reveals players will need to free up 190GB of hard drive space to play.
</p><p>
As per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/08/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements-revealed/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the minimum hardware players will likely need to get Ragnar&ouml;k running at 1080p with an average of 30fps at Low settings is a GTX 1060/RX 5500 XT, an Intel i5-4670K/Ryzen 3 1200, 8GB RAM, Windows 10, and the aforementioned 190GB SSD space.
</p><p>
Right at the other, considerably flashier end of the spectrum, it's recommended players hoping to hit an average of 60fps at 4K on Ultra settings have an RTX 4070 Ti/RX 7900 XT, an Intel i5-

Vampire Survivors - the acclaimed (and still doggedly vampire-free) minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle - is finally launching for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 29th August.
</p><p>
Vampire Survivors launched into PC early access back in 2021, where it immediately set tongues wagging - partly because it cost an absurdly generous &pound;3.99, but mostly because its mix of wave-based monster dodging and auto-bludgeoning is very blimmin' good indeed.
</p><p>
"Once this wave is done, once this boss is done, once I've unlocked a new character or item, I should really turn off the computer and go for a run. Maybe," wrote Christian Donlan in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-review-near-endless-rpg-popcorn">Recommended review</a>.

It's a game that pushes the limits of what Unreal Engine 5 can offer at this point in time, taking full advantage of its many features. Beautiful acting, amazing character models, stunning landscapes, and truly exceptional lighting all come together to create a moody, beautiful and atmospheric experience.</p><p>We recently had the chance to sit down with three key members from the Hellblade 2 development team at Ninja Theory: VFX director Mark Slater-Tunstill, environment art director Dan Atwell and audio director David Garc&iacute;a D&iacute;az.

This is what a blockbuster shooter should look like.</p><p>Arcade shooting games are, in truth, about fragility. Despite their reputation as gaming's most furious, excessive form, they almost universally place you at the controls of a weaponised weakling; a vessel that disintegrates after the briefest contact with a single enemy bullet.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not the case with Cygni: All Guns Blazing, a new shooter that insists it's OK to take dozens of enemy hits and stay in the game. That might sound like a reckless inversion of what makes the genre so special and rewarding. However, Scottish developer KeelWorks appears to have been meticulous in its subtle revolution of what

Krafton, the publisher of survival horror game The Callisto Protocol, forced developer Striking Distance to release the game early.
</p><p>
That's according to the game's director Glen Schofield, in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IIVia5aiUQ">Dan Allen Gaming</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-callisto-protocol/glen-schofield-interview">PCGamesN</a>) in which he discusses problems during the game's development.

</p><p>
Krafton, known for publishing PUBG, insisted the game release three months earlier than Schofield wanted. As a result, two and a half bosses and three or four enemy types were cut from the game.

You may want to skip the trailer if you're looking to go in completely spoiler free, but it's certainly worth a look to admire the dramatic production.

Gaming revenue for Warner Bros. Discovery has declined by 41 percent year-on-year due to the "weak performance" of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.
</p><p>
The decline was part of an overall four percent decrease across studio revenue (gaming, TV, cinema) as revealed in the company's latest quarterly earnings report.

Warner Bros. Discovery is still yet to give exact sales figures for Rocksteady's Suicide Squad game, though in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">earnings call in February</a> the company's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels stated the game had "fallen short of our expectations".
