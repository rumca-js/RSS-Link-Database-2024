  <p id="2Z0e9a">If you haven’t played <em>Doom</em> or <em>Doom II</em> for a while — or ever — a new re-release that Bethesda <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes?linkId=100000279162898">surprise-dropped</a> (<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1821578978462699748">sorta</a>) on Thursday might be the perfect excuse to jump in to the classic games. The re-release, which combines both games into one package called <em>Doom + Doom II</em> and is a free update for anyone who already owns <em>Doom (1993)</em> or <em>Doom II</em>, offers a long list of great new features — including a brand new single-player episode and online,

  <p id="GtNkyF">The Turkish government has blocked access to <em>Roblox</em> following a government investigation that found content that could lead to child exploitation. “According to our Constitution, our State is obliged to take the necessary measures to ensure the protection of our children,” Justice Minister Yılmaz Tunç says in <a href="https://x.com/yilmaztunc/status/1821259391087341579">a machine-translated post on X</a>. </p>
<p id="ZUJWRe">It’s unclear when <em>Roblox</em> might be unblocked in the country. “On Aug 7, we learned that Roblox was blocked in Türkiye, and we are working urgently to understand the issue with the goal of resolving it,” the company said <a href="https://corp.ro

<p id="Xq5MJR">One of DALL-E 3’s key improvements is that ChatGPT can come up with a prompt to make an image, which should make it easier to make images.
