EFF can’t be everywhere and in every fight, which is why back in 2016 we committed to building a network with grassroots organizations, and made the EFA a critical part of our work. Local organizers from within the community are better situated to build support and change in the long term. So when civil liberties and digital rights are under threat in your neck of the woods, we hope you </span><a href="https://efa.eff.org/allies"><span>find</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://efa.eff.org/pages/join"><span>become</span></a><span> a local EFA member.</span></p>

That's why EFF supports a ban on government FRT use. Half-measures aren't up to the task.</p>
