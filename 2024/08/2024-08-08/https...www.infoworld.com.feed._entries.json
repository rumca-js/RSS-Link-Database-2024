Once a product gets big enough (millions of users across thousands of businesses), it becomes a place where we can build applications. We\u2019ve seen it with Microsoft Office, Visual Studio, Dynamics, and more. Probably the fastest transition from product to platform was Teams, quickly becoming a host for workflow endpoints and quick interactions with line-of-business systems before gaining its own developer tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, Teams has quickly added new extension points, allowing a mix of different application types and services, including Microsoft\u2019s own extensions like its Bookings service.

FluentValidation is a validation library for .NET that provides a fluent interface to build strongly typed validation rules in your applications.
