<p>Readers respond to a piece by Neal Lawson on the party’s decision to expel activists who united to oust Jeremy Hunt</p><p>As a Green party member living in Jeremy Hunt’s new constituency, I was heartened to receive a communication before the general election inviting me to vote on whether the selected GP candidate, Steve Williams, should stand aside to help improve the chance of unseating Mr Hunt.

And, while the RSC still loyally gives its house dramatist solo credit, at least the first two acts of the play are by scholarly consensus attributed to George Wilkins, a minor writer and major inn-keeper.

<p>Australia have made a promising start to coach Joe Schmidt’s reign but will learn more about their standing in two rugby Tests against the Springboks</p><p>Shit is about to get real for Joe Schmidt’s Wallabies. The world champion Springboks have rolled into town for a two-Test showdown starting this weekend in Brisbane and concluding next Saturday in Perth. Australia will start as underdogs but a brew of hometown advantage and some radical new rules could turn this match on its head.</p><p>The opening Test on Saturday is the first sell-out for a Wallabies match at Suncorp Stadium since 2013. That year was the last time South Africa won at the venue, with Australia taking out all four meetings in Brisbane since then, the most recent a 30-17 victory for a 2-0 series sweep in 2021. The Wallabies retained the Nelson Mandela Challenge Plate the following year, but lost it in a 43-12 drubbing last July.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/09/wallabies-australi

This band of shaggy-haired Australian larrikins release records at such a furious clip – 25 in just over 10 years, and that’s before you even address the hatful of live albums they’ve dropped on Bandcamp in that time – that most casual listeners would be forgiven for not venturing in at all. Those albums are often concept-driven in a way that can be intimidating to those without any technical musical knowledge (three are based around microtonal tuning) or any interest in taking a massive bong rip before hitting play (2017’s Murder of the Universe is a three-part spoken-word album about cyborgs, monsters and human consciousness).

You can’t have failed to notice that the Olympics have been going on in Paris, so this is a quiz about (mostly) non-sporting Olympic things.

Have fun, guess well, and let us know how you get on in the comments!</p><p><strong>The Thursday quiz, No 172 – Olympic week!</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/08/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-172-olympic-week">Continue reading...</a>

## I have sciatica — now I never go anywhere without a small, hard, ball | Adrian Chiles

<p>I’ve got one for the car, one for the kitchen, and sourced one in Ireland recently that’s especially novel </p><p>I never go anywhere without a small, hard ball about my person. Sciatica, you see. In my case it involves a shooting pain originating somewhere in the depths of my left bottom cheek which, well, shoots down my leg. Something to do with the sciatic nerve being irritated or compressed. Most unpleasant, I tell you, and the longer I sit, the worse it gets.</p><p>I have only three routes to relief. One is to never sit down, which is impractical. The second is to be brutalised by a softly spoken Bulgarian masseur called Vlad, which is a wonderful if challenging experience, but too expensive to indulge in more often than every other week. The third is to sit on a hard ball. I was advised to try this by a physio friend, although I think it may sit outside the physiotherapeutic mainstream as it doesn’t come up on the internet. So proceed at your own risk. It was a hockey ball my

<p>From a quick message of support to a moan about your in-laws, the sound of a human voice is a blessing to a frazzled parent</p><p>What is it about the voice note that bothers so many people? I’ve seen it accused of all sorts – of being narcissistic, invasive, annoying – yet as a communication method, it continues to thrive. Having been a late adopter, I now send them all the time, usually while pushing my son around the city in his buggy (something that is impossible to do while texting).</p><p>Where once I felt annoyed when I received one, as though listening to another human being’s voice were simply too demanding, now I’m excited to hear what the person has to say, and how. Funny, sad, entertaining, long-winded, digressive, insightful; whatever their style, I can’t praise them enough.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/08/voice-notes-phones-messages-friends">Continue reading...</a>

## Lewis Major: Triptych review – intense movers trip the light fantastic

<p><strong>Assembly @ Dance Base, Edinburgh</strong> <br />The Australian choreographer revels in bodies sculpted by light but the impressive staging creates a chilly distance from these strong performers</p><p>The light show is incredible. In Australian choreographer Lewis Major’s piece Unfolding, a strip projected on to the floor makes it appear as if dancer Clementine Benson is balanced on a beam rotating around the stage. Elsewhere there are bubbles moving beneath the dancers’ feet, or what looks like a giant petri dish of ultra-magnified organisms that swell and recede across their bodies.<br /><br />
 Major has been mentored by the British dance-maker Russell Maliphant and his award-winning lighting designer Michael Hulls. You can clearly see the influence – beyond the fact the programme starts with one of Maliphant’s own pieces, Two x Three, a masterclass in purity of line and idea. Like Maliphant, Major revels in bodies sculpted by light, whether that’s the sharp contrasts of

<p>A richly rewarding account of how four literary giants created an erotic revolution in post-war American culture</p><p>The moment Marlon Brando strutted on stage in A Streetcar Named Desire in 1947, it was clear that a new kind of erotic American male had been born. It wasn’t just that Brando’s tight, sweat-stained T-shirt showed off his ripped torso and bulging biceps to perfection, nor that his unearthly beauty gave him a certain androgynous quality. It wasn’t even that his character, Stanley Kowalski, was a blue-collar hunk rather than a matinee idol. Rather it was the pent-up rage of Kowalski – that first entrance has him flinging a packet of bloody meat at his sister-in-law Blanche – which announced a man not so much unhappy in his skin as desperate to claw his way out of it. Streetcar’s submerged energies of gay love, sexual violence and insanity put the male psyche under the spotlight and found it more fragile than anyone could possibly have imagined.</p><p>In Strange Relati

<p>Kate Shortman and Izzy Thorpe on hard work, fake smiles and their real determination to reach the Olympic podium</p><p>Great Britain has never won an Olympic medal in artistic swimming – the sport previously known as synchronised swimming. But Kate Shortman, 22, and Izzy Thorpe, 23, are intent on making history – and defying glib misconceptions – in Paris.</p><p>This year they won Britain’s first world championship medals in the sport. And while artistic swimming may seem graceful and effortless, making it look easy is far from simple. The pair spend at least 40 hours a week working on their swimming, gymnastics, flexibility, yoga and routines – as well as lifting weights.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/08/smiling-so-you-cant-see-the-pain-why-artistic-swimming-is-so-tough">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Amputee war hero Oleksandr Budko will use his appearance as a contestant on The Bachelor to fight stigma – and hopefully find a partner</p><p>Oleksandr Budko doesn’t know exactly how he was wounded. Resting near the frontline with his mortar-fire support unit in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region, he lay down for cover in a trench while waiting for instructions from senior commanders, and started to fall asleep. Then everything changed in a moment: a shower of mud, the stench of scorched earth, and an intense pain. He hadn’t even heard the whistle of incoming fire, but it was soon clear that part of his foot was gone.</p><p>It was August 2022, the first summer of Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine – in the month afterwards, the Kharkiv region would be liberated from enemy forces by a surprise counteroffensive.

<p>From a row about an allegedly blasphemous biblical scene to a controversial boxing match, the Games have been hijacked by culture wars between Russia and the west</p><p>While sport has long prided itself on its capacity to promote peace and reconciliation, there was widespread anxiety before the Paris Olympics that the wars in Europe and the Middle East would poison the event. Thankfully, there have been no major security incidents. Yet geopolitical conflict has played out at the Games, including in the controversy over women’s boxing.</p><p>On the eve of the Olympics, many feared the worst. Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the ensuing Israeli invasion of Gaza, now exacerbated by the threat of an all-out regional war, brought back the ghosts of the massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympics, when Palestinian militants infiltrated the Olympic village, killing 11 members of the Israeli team.</p><p>Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an

<p>Every time the lead climaxes, she leaps into a parallel dimension. This show’s astonishing talent and ambition deserve to be lauded – and at least one scene will leave you feeling healed</p><p>The opening scenes – perhaps even the entire first episode – of the new seven-part comedy drama Slip (created, written, produced by and starring Zoe Lister-Jones) do not augur well. We meet Mae (Lister-Jones), a New York art curator in her late 30s, as she delivers a monologue about her discontents. Life is like “a super-banal dream”, like witnessing a version of your life, like merely watching and taking notes. She longs for more. It turns out that she is disgorging this depressed stream of consciousness to a 24-year-old barista (Jess Salgueiro), in response to a polite inquiry about her day. Mae and her uncharismatic husband of 13 years, Elijah (Whitmer Thomas), are in a rut – though barely rutting. Perhaps because “he dresses like if Kurt Cobain was a lesbian”. Or perhaps because, as Mae t

<p>The rise of artificial intelligence has sparked a panic about computers gaining power over humankind. But the real threat comes from falling for the hype</p><p>In Arthur C Clarke’s short story The Nine Billion Names of God, a sect of monks in Tibet believes humanity has a divinely inspired purpose: inscribing all the various names of God. Once the list was complete, they thought, he would bring the universe to an end. Having worked at it by hand for centuries, the monks decide to employ some modern technology. Two sceptical engineers arrive in the Himalayas, powerful computers in tow. Instead of 15,000 years to write out all the permutations of God’s name, the job gets done in three months. As the engineers ride ponies down the mountainside, Clarke’s tale ends with one of literature’s most economical final lines: “Overhead, without any fuss, the stars were going out.”</p><p>It is an image of the computer as a shortcut to objectivity or ultimate meaning – which also happens to be, a
