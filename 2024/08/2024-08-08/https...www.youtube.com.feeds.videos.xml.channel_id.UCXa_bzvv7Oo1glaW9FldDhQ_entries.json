In terms of the quality and consistency of a developer\u2019s output, there aren\u2019t too many names that can be held up in the kind of incredibly high regard that Rockstar is. \n\nAnd yet, one area where the developer just can\u2019t seem to move in the right direction is the frequency with which it releases titles. In fact, not only is Rockstar only releasing one major game every few years, the variety it used to exhibit in its output has also decreased dramatically. Here, we talk about why that is happening, and if we can ever look forward to something different.", "id": 998260, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8Ofb0kddik", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/G8Ofb0kddik/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why Has Rockstar Games Struggled To Release Games More Frequently?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-08T13:30:02+00:00", "description": "Incoming is the sequel to 2011\u2019s Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, and whilst Space Marine 2 doesn\u2019t look to be a vast reimagining of the franchise\u2019s established formula what developer Saber Interactive alongside publisher Focus Entertainment have demonstrated in previews and features shared up to now is a game much broader in scale and scope. \n\nHere, a fresh threat looms which must be eradicated against insurmountable odds.
