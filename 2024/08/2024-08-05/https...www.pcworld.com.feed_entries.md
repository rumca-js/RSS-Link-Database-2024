<p>In a landmark decision, a US district court recently found Google’s search and advertising business to be an illegal monopoly. But no sanctions were handed down, presumably left open for future determination.</p>



<p>For now, then, nothing will change. But the <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/VZTUTSQ/UNITED_STATES_OF_AMERICA_et_al_v_GOOGLE_LLC__dcdce-20-03010__1033.0.pdf?mcid=tGE3TEOA">277-page decision</a> (plus appendices) clearly labels Google as an illegal monopolist in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.</p>



<p>The court case began in December 2020 and has moved in fits and starts ever since, over a nine-week bench trial, over 3,500 exhibits, and evidence that reached into the petabytes, the court wrote. Plaintiffs included the US government and the State of Colorado.</p>

<p>When I build desktop PCs, I prefer them to look a little more grown-up than the usual RGB-bedecked gamer machines. (Yes, I’m a mature adult. Just don’t look at the plastic spaceships on my desk.)</p>



<p>Today, my favorite case—Fractal Design’s much-loved North—can be had for a rare discount: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Design-North-Slate-Gray/dp/B09V878FXQ/">it’s currently $110 on Amazon</a>, which is a sizable $30 off its sticker price.</p>



<p>The North is a standard ATX case design with some stylish wood accents on the front panel. Steel and aluminum construction, no extra lights, nothing that looks like it fell off a Gundam. It’s slick. This version is black with a walnut finish on the front and a mesh panel side (instead of tempered glass) for maximum ventilation. And yes, it’s the exact model that’s mounted under my desk as I type these wor

<p><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/nvidia-drivers-confirmed-to-cause-bsod-on-windows-pcs-without-certain-cpu-instructions/">Nvidia has confirmed</a> that new graphics card drivers will cause blue screen crash loops on Windows 10 PCs that can’t execute a certain CPU instruction called POPCNT (Population Count).</p>



<p>Specifically, older Windows 10 computers with CPUs that can’t handle the POPCNT instruction will crash during Windows bootup if installed with Nvidia’s graphics drivers from Release 555 (June 2024) or later.</p>



<p>Starting with Release 555, Nvidia’s drivers no longer support older CPUs without the POPCNT instruction, causing Windows 10 to blue screen upon restarting after driver installation.</p>



<p>If you have a supported Nvidia GPU but an unsupported CPU, <strong>do not install the latest Nvidia drivers from Release 555 or onwards</stro

<p>OpenAI disclosed Sunday that the company has new methods to tell if the content you’re reading has been authored by ChatGPT, though they haven’t been released.</p>



<p>The method of watermarking its own AI-generated content apparently works, according to OpenAI. But it also can be apparently easily duped. The company is also considering how releasing and applying the tool might be used to stigmatize groups that use AI as an actual writing tool, including those who can’t speak the language well enough to generate polished content. A second method, metadata, holds more promise.</p>



<p>OpenAI disclosed the new developments in an <a href="https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/">updated blog post</a>, released Sunday. The original post detailed how OpenAI was joining the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity

<p>Intel is having a bad time lately.

<p>Many folks use Google to manage their contacts. This means they can access them at any time on their computer using the browser and have the latest version of the database available on their Android devices at the same time. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, there’s no automatic synchronization with the Microsoft Excel program. To use the contacts in the Office tool, you have to export them from Google and import them back into Excel. Not sure how to export your contacts? We’ll guide you every step of the way.</p>

<p>AMD’s X3D-series Ryzen processors are a hit with PC gamers and system builders, and it’s easy to see why. These CPUs have a dramatic effect on game performance thanks to some extra 3D V-cache, a sort of “special sauce” design that boosts the pushing of polygons.</p>



<p>You’ll see them on sale from time to time, and right now you can take off a whopping $200 on the AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D, bringing its retail price <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-RyzenTM-7900X3D-24-Thread-Processor/dp/B0BTRRNK7T/">down to just $397.77 at Amazon</a>.</p>



<p>The Ryzen 9 7900X3D is the second-fastest CPU of its generation, with 12 cores maxing out at 5.6GHz. More importantly, it uses double the L3 cache (compared to its non-X3D variant) to boost game performance by a noticeable amount, even without touching the GPU.</p>



<p>And speaking of GPUs, AMD motherboards are compatibl
