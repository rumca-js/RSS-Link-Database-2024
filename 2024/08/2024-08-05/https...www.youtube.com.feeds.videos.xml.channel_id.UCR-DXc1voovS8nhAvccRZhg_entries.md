This is the first RISC-V motherboard I've been able to install in a normal computer case. How does it work? Is it ready for prime-time?

Huge thanks to Christopher Barnatt from @ExplainingComputers for talking to me about RISC-V for this video! And thanks to Milk-V for sending the board to test, and working with me to troubleshoot the WiFi issue I had.

Milk-V provided the two Jupiter motherboards I used in the making of this video, but did not pay for this review, nor have any input into it's content or production.
