France is one of the most famous countries in Europe, and Paris is probably the most famous city in the world. Paris is rightfully called "the city of light". It is not because of its extensive illumination — otherwise any major city would claim the title — but because the capital of France has been a center of education, arts and philosophy for many centuries.

Today Paris is a home for 2024 Summer Olympics
