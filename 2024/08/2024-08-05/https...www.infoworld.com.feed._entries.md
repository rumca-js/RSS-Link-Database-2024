<p>In 1995, a small group of programmers with big dreams <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2174329/javascript-creator-ponders-past-future.html">launched JavaScript</a>. It was going to be called Mocha or LiveScript, but then some savvy folks decided to jump on the Java-language bandwagon, which was already building a big head of steam.</p>



<p>The initial goals for the new scripting language were simple: Add a bit of life to static web pages (in those days, the only motion on a web page came from the <code></code> tag—which is long gone but not forgotten). At the time, JavaScript’s developers probably never dreamed that a tiny layer designed to double-check form elements would someday be t

<p>The clouds can’t stop spending on AI, even if their <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2514409/ais-moment-of-disillusionment.html">customers are starting to question</a> their own investments. Such disillusionment may be temporary, as <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/01/amazoncom-amzn-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/">Amazon CEO Andy Jassy</a> <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/01/amazoncom-amzn-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/">suggests</a>.

<p>The headless data architecture is an organic emergence of the separation of data storage, management, optimization, and access from the services that write, process, and query it. With this architecture, you can manage your data from a single logical location, including permissions, schema evolution, and table optimizations. And, to top it off, it makes regulatory compliance a lot simpler, because your data resides in one place, instead of being copied around to every processing engine that needs it. </p>



<p>We call it a “headless” data architecture because of its similarity to a “headless server,” where you have to use your own monitor and keyboard to log in. If you want to process or query
