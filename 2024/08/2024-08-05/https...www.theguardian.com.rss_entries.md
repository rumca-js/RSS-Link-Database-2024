<p>It was a seedy hotbed of sex, drugs, edgy music and A-list celebrities where Lou Reed and Andy Warhol partied alongside Blondie and Bowie. How did Max’s Kansas City fall apart?</p><p>‘It was the exact spot where pop art and pop life came together,” said Andy Warhol of Max’s Kansas City. “Everybody went there.” Indeed they did – from painters to poets, musicians to movie stars, and politicians to drag queens. A baby elephant was even photographed in there once.</p><p>Almost 60 years since it first opened its doors as a restaurant in New York in 1965 – “steak lobster chick peas,” read the sign – Max’s Kansas City has become legendary. “It was just where we hung out with friends,” says Peter Crowley, who booked bands for the watering hole and eatery. Crowley has now written his memoirs, Down at Max’s, with a focus on what many consider to have been New York’s wildest nightclub. “But looking back, it was responsible for the cultural future of America.

<p><strong>Edinburgh festival theatre</strong><br />Andreas Homoki’s clever ideas don’t quite survive the leap to Scotland but the singing is rich and the acting full of swagger</p><p>It is easy to understand the temptation: staging a new Carmen<em> </em>at Paris’s Opéra Comique, the very theatre that commissioned and premiered it in 1875, why not have the building itself, and its memories of Carmens<em> </em>past, play their own role in the action? The stumbling block comes when such a site-specific production ups sticks to an entirely new location. Ghosts, as everyone knows, don’t tend to travel well, and so the full resonance of Andreas Homoki’s time-shifting backstage Carmen fades once transplanted to Edinburgh’s Festival theatre.</p><p>If anything, an even heftier dose of meta-theatricality may have helped.

<p>Moodysson reunites the gang of hippies from his joyful 2000 sendup for a fun yet slightly sour sequel</p><p>More than 20 years ago, Lukas Moodysson directed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jul/13/1">the Swedish comedy Together</a>: set in 1975, it was about a bunch of hippies living in a Stockholm commune on a diet of chickpeas and porridge.

It’s a less lovable film; it is directed, I felt, with a bit of a sneer.</p><p>The year is 1999. The population of the commune has dwindled to two men: bearded Göran (Gustaf Hammarsten) and gentle-souled artist Klasse (Shanti Roney).

Pakistan had never lost a Test match in that city, so tried everything to frustrate their opponents, including cynical time-wasting on the final afternoon.

It’s a kit stadium, and after the Paralympics finishes, the two Olympic pools inside it will be drained, packed away, and put up again in their new, permanent, locations.

<p>From Vladimir Putin to Kim Jong-un, tyrants today seem stronger than ever. So are we stuck with them?</p><p>Last summer, thousands of Russian soldiers armed with heavy weaponry started going the “wrong” way up the road from eastern Ukraine to Moscow. The military leader&nbsp;Yevgeny Prigozhin had decided to revolt,&nbsp;turning Vladimir Putin’s own fighters against him. For a brief moment, it appeared as though the regime might collapse. The challenge was so serious that forces loyal to Putin built fortifications on the outskirts of the capital while armoured vehicles patrolled the city. When the Russian air force attempted to stop the rebels’ advance, Prigozhin’s men downed several helicopters and an aeroplane.</p><p>Less than 24 hours later, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/25/prigozhins-march-on-moscow-chronology-of-an-attempted-coup">the mutiny was over</a>.

<p>Reissued after a century, this lively, funny and harrowing debut follows a divorcee torn between sexual liberation and the compromised ‘safety’ of marriage in the 1920s</p><p>“This is the end. Why don’t I cry or something?” thinks the heroine of this novel.

The same smell rushes up when you pour boiling water on a pile of instant couscous or simmer Turkish semolina halva.</p><p>All of these things – pasta flour, couscous, semolina – are made from the same thing: <em>triticum durum</em>, or durum wheat –<em> grano duro</em> in Italian,<em> </em><em>duro</em><em> </em>meaning hard.

<p>★★★★☆ / ★★★☆☆<br />Two of J Lee Thompson’s early films – a gritty women’s prison drama and a postwar crime thriller – serve as a reminder that the director deserves more kudos as an artist</p><p>J Lee Thompson is a British director who could maybe do with a bit more auteur respect: here is a double-bill rerelease of two of his early black-and-white films from the 1950s. The Weak and the Wicked (★★★★☆) is a melodrama that came out in 1954 just before his wrenching classic Yield to the Night, which featured Diana Dors on death row. It is a tough women’s prison film as well, one that quickly morphs into a social-issue sermon; it is richly flavoured, speckled with comic interludes and gloriously cast with Glynis Johns as Jean, a young society beauty and gambling addict whose dud cheque leads to an appearance in court and whose head-girl demeanour never falters in the clink. She becomes a good pal inside to brassy blond Betty Brown, played by Dors.</p><p>The movie is adapted by dramatis

Just 10 minutes or so into the movie, this is the point where any lingering questions about why Disney never took Snyder up on the Star Wars pitch that became Rebel Moon, are blown out of mind – a comparison perfectly drawn and discarded. It’s also a moment that didn’t make it into the first version of the movie.</p><p>That version came out last December, a relatively normal-sized 134 minutes of sci-fi action, followed by an even-shorter second film in April. The adorable suicide-bombing creature comes from Snyder’s new director’s cut,

 This is the method I use for working out what to keep and what could go in my beauty routine. Answer these questions: what is your total spend on beauty treatments, procedures and shopping in a year? List everything and total it up. When you look at the treatments and procedures list, is there anything you instinctively love and get joy from? Highlight those in pink – they can stay. Next, highlight any you find unenjoyable or an obligation in blue. These are the ones to cut back on. Now do the audit. Which of the highlighted blue items could you safely do at home yourself? Or cut out? I’d rather do hair removal and nails at home because I hate how long the process takes. But I don’t want to stop having my hair extensions or a monthly massage –&nbsp;those feel worth it to me.<br />
 Next, look at what you’re spending on products. Are y

<p>Diverse businesses perform better – so why is sport so slow in appointing leaders from across every section of society?</p><p>On Thursday 22 October 1992, I attended an event in Crewe to hear Simon Armitage, a newly published poet, read his work. I remember the date because I still have the ticket and poetry recitals were not a normal night out for those of us who grew up in the pubs and clubs of Grimsby in that era. It was a night that changed my life as I glimpsed a possible world that could coexist alongside the heavy-drinking, sometimes scrapping, football-loving culture and the constraints men set themselves back then.</p><p>Some constraints were self-imposed, others were rooted in the ignorance and prejudice of the time. This was typified when, years later, my mum found out I liked the creative arts and her response was to ask if I was gay. A bizarre conclusion, unthinking and uneducated, but not unusual then. Simon was one of the first poets I saw – a cool young Yorkshireman

<p>It can be difficult to resist the urge to divulge that someone has been rattling around your unconscious. But it is worth proceeding with care</p><p>Talking about your dreams is a bit like describing the inside of your own mouth: intimate, personal but mostly dull. And yet, the urge to tell someone that they had a starring role in your dream is always extremely tempting. At least for me.

According to a groundbreaking study by geologist Minik Rosing, it is where life on Earth began, among the rock formations that have existed for nearly 4bn years. At the same time, the residents of Greenland are also bearing witness to what could be the first signs of our environmental annihilation, as the island’s icecap continues to melt at a terrifying speed under the effects of global heating.</p><p>The question of human survival is an overwhelmingly existential one. Frank’s film, however, also makes spaces for expressions of life both big and small. Intimate conversations with Greenlandic teenagers reveal their dreams for the future, as they look to find love, friendship and economic st
