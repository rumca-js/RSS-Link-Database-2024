We\u2019re not getting any of the big first party blockbusters that the platform has become so strongly associated with, but though the likes of The Last of Us, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man, Ghost of Tsushima, and what have you are currently waiting in the wings, Sony is filling the void with multiple smaller releases. \n\nAnd in that group of games, one in particular that\u2019s looking like a bigger deal than you would think is Astro Bot. As the first full-fledged console entry for the beloved platforming series, it is generating a fair bit of excitement, which is easy to understand, given how good Astro Bot Rescue Mission and Astro\u2019s Playroom both were. \n\nMeanwhile, what we have seen of Astro Bot itself so far has also looked incredibly promising. For all of these reasons and more, there\u2019s every chance that Astro Bot could end 2024 as one of the best and biggest games of the year.", "id": 979935, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRJ5pQJhLjY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/nRJ5pQJhLjY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Astro Bot Is Shaping Up To Be One of The BIGGEST Games of the Year", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-05T16:00:27+00:00", "description": "Games have gotten bigger and more content-rich over the years, but quantity isn\u2019t the only reason we feel compelled to continue playing a title.

However, Riot Games' Valorant is a different beast, combining tactical shooting and economy with abilities and Ultimates.\n\nDespite complaints over the years about its slower pace, it's carved an impressive spot in the market. With its recent launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, Riot Games delivers an extensive assortment of Agents and maps, several control settings, solid graphical and online performance, and more.\n\nWhile not every map is a winner, and the very nature of the gameplay can cause frustration, Valorant is an enjoyable competitive first-person shooter that rewards methodical play, quick reflexes, and sharp aiming skills. How the developer will handle console balancing and whatnot remains to be seen.
