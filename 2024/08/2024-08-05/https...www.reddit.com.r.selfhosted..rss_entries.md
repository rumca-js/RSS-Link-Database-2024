I could get them to set up WSL2 or a virtual machine on their end, but I think it would be a lot more convenient and consistent if I could self host a service that would allow them to SSH to a container that I'm hosting.</p> <p>What I'm thinking of is something like this:</p> <ul> <li>Service hosts on port 22</li> <li>When an incoming connection comes in, it creates a temporary container just for them and forwards them to it</li> </ul> <p>Potentially with authentication to stop unauthorized users from connecting.

In the past I have installed the apps via the Truenas catalog which has not been the worst, but more recently I installed an Ubuntu VM and operated the apps out of docker/portainer. I had some issues with the network bridge that i build from the NAS to the VM which led to the malfunctioning of the portainer. </p> <p>I am inquiring regarding possibly building a second server out of old parts I have around the house versus either trying again with the VM route or the truenas catalog route. Another option would be to buy second hand server off fb marketplace/Mini-PC which would be about the same price as parts i would need (~200$).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello</p> <p>I've been using Docker for several years, primarily for single-container deployments. Typically, I manage my containers using Bash scripts that collect all the <code>docker run XYZ</code> commands in one place. Additionally, I use a watchtower container, triggered via a cron job, to update all my containers. This setup is straightforward and easy to replicate.</p> <p>Now, I want to use services like Immich and Authentik, which rely on <code>docker-compose</code> files. It seems that these services generally require downloading a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, adding some configurations into a <code>.env</code> file, and then starting up the composition.</p> <p>Is there any tooling available to manage such setups? One concern I have is regarding updates. It doesn't seem practical to manually re-download the YAML file regularly. There should be some form of automation for this process. Am I missing something obvious?</p> <p>Additiona

Plex is running on proxmox, and storage is NFS share on synology.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Back when I first started self hosting, I'd use nginx reverse proxy or swag to expose my services to the web.</p> <p>I stopped doing that BC of products like wireguard. Now however, in considering self hosting a website to the web. I'm a bit more security conscious these days but don't want a second job in monitoring things. </p> <p>I use opnsense as my firewall. Preferably id like something to plug into that if I can, but I'm open to any ideas. What's the most secure but sane way to expose a VM or container to the web? Should I be looking at zenarmour? Or naxsi and crowdsec?</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cribbageSTARSHIP"> /u/cribbageSTARSHIP </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1eka6fq/seeking_guidance_on_how_to_best_approach_my/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1eka6fq/seeking_guidance_on_how
