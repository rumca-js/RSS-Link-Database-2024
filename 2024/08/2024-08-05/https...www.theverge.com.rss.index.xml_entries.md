  <p id="49yCmP">Elon Musk has revived his complaint against OpenAI after dropping a previous lawsuit, again alleging that the ChatGPT maker and two of its founders — Sam Altman and Greg Brockman — breached the company’s founding mission to develop artificial intelligence technology to benefit humanity.</p>

  <p id="4S2xQt">Yahoo is a giant in the world of fantasy sports, but its app hasn’t gotten a meaningful update in years. Ahead of the 2024 NFL season, though, the company is rolling out a completely overhauled version of the <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy/mobile/">Yahoo Fantasy Sports app</a> that brings both a cleaner design and a huge amount of new content for fantasy players.</p>

  <p id="p5M5VB">OpenAI has had a system for watermarking ChatGPT-created text and a tool to detect the watermark ready for about a year, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-tool-chatgpt-cheating-writing-135b755a">reports <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. But the company is divided internally over whether to release it. On one hand, it seems like the responsible thing to do; on the other, it could hurt its bottom line.</p>
