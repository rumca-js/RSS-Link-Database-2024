Does that also mean that with fewer than 20 pips you don't score anything since that divides out to less than 5? Similarly, I imagine 34 pips rounds up to 35, divides out to 7, and results in 10 points? Finally, how do you determine who starts each successive hand?

The majority of these were new games at GenCon. Most of the old stuff is in the &quot;What I played&quot; section as we picked up some games in the consignment store and tried them out, along with a couple of titles that were on the show floor. Given how many games I saw and some of them were brief overviews given I'm just going to give a few sentences on each.</p> <p>For reference my gaming preferences run the spectrum but I tend to enjoy mid to heavy weight euros and games with a strong theme that are reflected in the mechanics.<a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/Deliverator?sort=rating&amp;sortdir=desc&amp;rankobjecttype=subtype&amp;rankobjectid=1&amp;columns=title%7Cstatus%7Cversion%7Crating%7Cbggrating%7Cplays%7Ccomment%7Ccommands&amp;geekranks=Board%20Game%20Rank&amp;excludesubtype=boardgameexpansion&amp;own=1&amp;objecttype=thing&am", "id": 974807, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ekcjy5/what_i_playeddemoedsaw_at_gencon_2024", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "What I played/demoed/saw at GenCon 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-05T02:08:26+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Trying to remember the name of a game I had in the 1980s. Forever I thought it was Dungeon but after looking at various editions of Dungeon none are the game I remember. The game was like dungeon but you could be one of four characters. They were represented by plastic figures and player cards with attributes and such. They were Warrior, Mage, Elf and Dwarf. </p> <p>What I remember most was that there was four sets of spell cards that were represented by the elements: Fire, Water, Earth and Air. The Mage and Elf could cast spells. You divided the spells by the Mage choosing one group, the Elf choosing one group out of the three left and the Mage getting the final two so that the Mage had three groups and the Elf had one. Other then this the rest reminded me of Dungeon.</p> <p>Any ideas or am I misremembering?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Particular5172\"> /u/No-Particular5172 </a> <br /> <spa", "id": 974814, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ekccvz/name_of_game", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Name of game.", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-05T01:25:39+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ekbip3/just_played_my_first_game_of_canvas/\"> <img alt=\"Just played my first game of Canvas. \" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/yPnUhRJyyAm1SEvjOHeXRenFbQIoIuvZ98GLwRq-fSY.jpg\" title=\"Just played my first game of Canvas. \" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I had no idea this game existed.
