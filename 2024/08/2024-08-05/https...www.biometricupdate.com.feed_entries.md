		The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM) and Office of Procurement Operations held a Biometric Collection Devices (BCD) Industry Day on July 29 to discuss an upcoming requirement for BCDs.

		A pair of lawmakers in different states are objecting to state digital identity verification contracts held by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/socure">Socure</a>. At issue appears to be an objection to the use of personally identifiable data to identify persons, and a claim that the company’s terms of service clash with a new data protection law.

New York State Senator Jeremy A Cooney claims in a letter addressed to State Chief Information Officer Dru Rai that Socure is a “data broker,” and asks how the company was vetted prior to being awarded the state contract. Cooney is chair of the Senate Procurement and Contracts Committee.

		The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) has urged African countries to capitalize on the emphasis this year’s Africa Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Day places on linking civil registration and legal identity systems.

Africa CRVS Day is observed every August 10 and this year’s theme is “Strengthening the linkage of civil registration and vital statistics to legal identity systems through digitalization for enhanced inclusion.”

In a statement, ECA highlights the importance of the theme and posits that such linkage is “essential for promoting effective governance and societal development, protecting individual rights, ensuring efficient service delivery, reducing fraud and facilitating cross-border recognition.”

		A German police official is seeking a public debate on whether law enforcement in the country should be able to search the internet with facial recognition to identify dangerous criminals.

Friedo de Vries, President of Lower Saxony’s state criminal office (LKA), wants to the police to have the capability to search for offenders who could be sentenced to more than a year in prison by their face biometrics, according to <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Debatte-um-Gesichtserkennung-LKA-Chef-will-mehr-Befugnisse-9821996.html">heise</a>.

		Australia has restarted its plan to make digital credentials shareable across state boundaries. The plan, which had been shelved since last year, got a fresh jumpstart in the form of a seven-week “rapid discovery exercise” staged between March and May 2024, according to a <a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/digital-credential-sharing-resurrected-by-govts/">report</a> from InnivationAus.com.

Discussions centered on the new <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202406/new-south-wales-government-is-investing-millions-in-digital-identity">Digital ID</a> and Verifiable Credentials Strategy signed by states in June, which includes requirements to build and test sharing tools in line with ISO standards.

		Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act has been officially amended, with Governor J.B. Pritzker signing the changes into law on Friday. The amendments included in Senate Bill 2979 include the acceptance of digital signatures for consent, and make each single violation count only ones, even if it repeated.

The change in accrual means that businesses do not face separate damages for each day a particular employee clocked into work on a biometric time and attendance device, for example.

State lawmakers said the change will provide certainty for Illinois’ businesses, while still protecting their biometric data, reports <a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/illinois/article_33df4ebe-5116-11ef-9366-1f7f6d600f28.html">The Center Square</a>.

Our identity is under attack now more than ever, due in large part to the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). One form of identity fraud that has skyrocketed over the past year is deepfakes, or synthetic media that has been digitally manipulated to impersonate a person. These fraudulent impersonations can take many forms, including text, video, audio, and social media-based deepfakes, and as they continue to be successful, we can expect additional channels to be added to the alarming mix.

Deepfakes are not necessarily new, having been floating around the internet since <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/si
