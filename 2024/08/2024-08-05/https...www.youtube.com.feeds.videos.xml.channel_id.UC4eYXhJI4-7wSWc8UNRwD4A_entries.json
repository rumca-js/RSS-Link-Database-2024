By the time we finally got her in the office, she showed up ready to make it count, with a carefully arranged setlist she delivered in an impossible-to-miss, bright red, leather suit, backed by an incredible band.\n\nSpringsteen\u2019s set featured multiple surprises, including a version of the Ti\u00ebsto song \u201cHot Honey\u201d (a track she guested on when Ti\u00ebsto released it last month). She also performed a brand new song we\u2019re premiering called \u201cfeels good,\u201d a twisted tale about flirting with death, going to extremes and self-sabotage.\n\nSpringsteen also included a slow-burning version of \u201cghost in my guitar,\u201d swapping the electric guitar performed by Chris Stapleton on her album for a cello, before closing with a stripped-down version of the title cut to Twenty Something,", "id": 975265, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMW779WaDXs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "source_obj__id": 225, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/cMW779WaDXs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Alana Springsteen: Tiny Desk Concert", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
