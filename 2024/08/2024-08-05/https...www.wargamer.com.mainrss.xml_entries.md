								<p>Most of the changes made to the Dungeons and Dragons 2024 Player&rsquo;s Handbook have been for logical reasons. Rules that didn&rsquo;t make sense have been thrown out, and wording has been tweaked with common sense in mind. The whole thing is more approachable and sensible than D&amp;D has perhaps ever been. But Wizards of the &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/weirdest-changes-players-handbook">Continued</a></p>

								<p>Wizards of the Coast announced Mystery Booster 2 at Gen Con last week, and then immediately gave Magic: The Gathering fans the chance to play it in a draft. As a result, images of this product&rsquo;s experimental, hand drawn &lsquo;playtest&rsquo; cards have been doing the rounds on social media. From a card that just targets &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/mystery-booster-rival-tcgs">Continued</a></p>

								<p>Wizards of the Coast has shared some new details about its upcoming 3D Virtual Tabletop, which we now know is named Project Sigil. What&rsquo;s more, it has opened signups to the closed beta, so you might be able to play DnD with this software sooner than you&rsquo;d think.

								<p>The <strong>DnD 2024 Paladin</strong> is still recognizable in the new Player’s Handbook, but a host of small tweaks mean that the Dungeons and Dragons class feels <em>very</em> different. Wizards of the Coast has nerfed some of the Paladin’s more explosive features, but it’s also been very generous with the class’ resources and action economy. We’ve spent hours going through the 2024 Player’s Handbook, so here’s a guide that points out every update made to the<strong> One DnD Paladin</strong>.</p>

								<p>The MTG card Worldfire has a ridiculous effect. It exiles everything, including lands and all the cards in your hand or graveyard, and it sets each player to one life. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s prohibitively hard to play &ndash; costing nine mana &ndash; which is the main reason it was unbanned. But, thanks to a new Bloomburrow &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/mtg-card-worldfire-cruelclaw-spike">Continued</a></p>
