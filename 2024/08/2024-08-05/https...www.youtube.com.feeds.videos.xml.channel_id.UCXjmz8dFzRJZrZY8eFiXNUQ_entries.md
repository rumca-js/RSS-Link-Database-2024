Upon the release of District 9, it seemed like director Neill Blomkamp was on top of the world.  Adapting his short film, with the help of Peter Jackson, into one of the biggest sci-fi movies of the early 2000's gave him the pedigree to do almost anything he wanted.  Though his next several outings like Chappie and Elysium made it seem like Blomkamp might be a one hit wonder.  After several disappointing short films, and one studio feature in Gran Turismo, it seems Neill Blomkamps downfall isn't stopping anytime soon.
