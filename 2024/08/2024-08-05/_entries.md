NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury yields rebounded from one-year lows on Monday after a Federal Reserve official said weaker than expected jobs data for July does not indicate a recession, while solid U.S. services sector activity eased some fears that the United States is heading into an economic downturn.  An unexpected increase in the employment rate and fewer than expected job gains in July’s employment report on Friday sparked fears over a fast approaching economic downturn and caused a rapid repricing of expectations on when and how far the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates.  But Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said on Monday the data does not indicate a recession, while noting that Fed policymakers must carefully monitor changes in the U.S. economy to avoid being too restrictive with interest rates.

A meltdown in world equity markets in recent days is more reflective of a wind-down of carry trades used by investors to juice their bets than a hard and fast shift in the U.S. economic outlook, analysts say.  While Friday's weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data was the catalyst for the market sell-off, with Japan's blue-chip Nikkei index on Monday suffering its biggest one-day rout since the 1987 Black Monday selloff, the employment report alone wasn't weak enough to be the main driver of such violent moves, they added.  Instead, the answer likely lies in a further sharp position unwind of carry trades, where investors have borrowed money from economies with low interest rates such as Japan or Switzerland, to fund investments in higher-yielding assets elsewhere.

Global markets have kicked off the week in full selloff mode, with measures of volatility shooting up by the most on record in a single day, while equity futures and cryptocurrencies plummet, reviving memories of past crises.  A rise in Japanese interest rates on July 31 has made bets on a cheap yen - many of which funded purchases of assets with better returns - less profitable.  Tokyo's Nikkei index finished Monday with a 12% loss, the largest one-day drop since the aftermath of "Black Monday" in October 1987, when a stock market crash stripped nearly 15% off this index and 20% off the S&P 500.
