And that’s not even including the Borderlands movie, which technically isn’t canon, and might even spin off into its own cinematic timeline. Combine the tie-in movie with rumours about a potential Borderlands 4, and there’s no better time to dig back into the lore of Gearbox’s mad series.

You can also use Focus Mode to highlight wounds on a monster--these are formed by attacking the same spot several times--and deal extra damage when you strike these vulnerable spots. Additionally, you can zero in on exposed weak points, and deal even more-devastating attacks with Focus Strikes.</p><div>          </div><p>Another video
