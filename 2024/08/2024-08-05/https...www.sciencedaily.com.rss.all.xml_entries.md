Seeds, twigs, and insect parts found under two miles of ice confirm Greenland's ice sheet melted in the recent past, the first direct evidence that the center -- not just the edges -- of the two-mile-deep ice melted away in the recent geological past. The new research indicates that the giant ice sheet is more fragile than scientists had realized until the last few years -- and reveals increased risk of sea-level catastrophe in a warmer future.

In Brazil, climate and other human-made environmental changes threaten decades-long efforts to fight schistosomiasis, a widespread and debilitating parasitic disease. Now, researchers have developed models that can predict how the disease risk will shift in response to environmental changes.

## Nature's design marvel: How shark skin's denticles adapt to wide speed

New findings on how sharks achieve drag reduction could inspire the design of riblets for more efficient aircraft and boats. In their investigation of great white shark denticles, researchers found that ridge height and spacing play crucial roles in drag reduction at different swimming speeds. Higher middle ridges aid sharks in efficient cruising at slower speeds, while the lower side ridges become more critical for drag reduction during high-speed hunting bursts. The analysis also suggests that the speeds of an extinct giant shark, megalodon, may not much differ from those of the white shark.

## Ultrafine particles linked to over 1,000 deaths per year in Canada's two largest cities

A new study conducted in Canada's two largest cities has linked about 1,100 premature deaths per year to an unregulated air pollutant. Ultrafine particles (UFPs) primarily come from vehicle emissions and industrial activities. Canada's federal and provincial governments have not set concentration limits for UFPs, as they have for larger fine particles known as PM2.5.

## Improved chemokine homing enhances CAR T--cell therapy for osteosarcoma

Investigators identified a chemokine/chemokine receptor mismatch for osteosarcoma (i.e., osteosarcomas secrete chemokines for which CAR T cells do not express receptors). The researchers modified CAR T cells targeting the osteosarcoma antigen B7-H3 to express CXCR2 or CXCR6 receptors, which recognize chemokines (CXCL8 or CXCL16) secreted by osteosarcoma.

## Scientists and climate change: Extreme concern and high level of engagement

Scientists from across academic disciplines are extremely concerned about climate change. Many of them have already changed their own lifestyles or engaged in advocacy and protest, with even more being willing to do so in future. This is evident from a large-scale survey of scientists from all over the world.

## 'Laser view' into the avocado: New method reveals cell interior

Checking whether an avocado is hard or soft by looking at it? This would require recognizing how the plant cells behave behind the skin. The same applies to all other cells on our planet: Despite more than 100 years of intensive research, many of their properties remain hidden inside the cell. Researchers now describe a new approach that can determine the particularly difficult-to-detect mechanical properties of the cell interior by taking a closer look.
