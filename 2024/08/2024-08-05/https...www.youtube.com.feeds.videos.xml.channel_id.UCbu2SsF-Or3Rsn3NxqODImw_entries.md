The Borderlands franchise has a long and dense timeline, which spans hundreds of years of galactic history across 4 mainline games, a couple of narrative adventures, and the odd chaotic spin-off. And that’s not even including the Borderlands movie, which technically isn’t canon, and might even spin off into its own cinematic timeline. Combine the tie-in movie with rumours about a potential Borderlands 4, and there’s no better time to dig back into the lore of Gearbox’s mad series.

From the ancient origins of the mysterious Eridians through to the megacorp wars of New Tales from the Borderlands via the Vault Hunting adventures on Pandora, this video breaks down the long and complex timeline of the Borderlands franchise.
