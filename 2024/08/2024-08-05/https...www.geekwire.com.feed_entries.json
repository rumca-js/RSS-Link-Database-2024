Microsoft President Brad Smith got our attention this morning with a picture of a handsome dog on his LinkedIn. But he wasn&#8217;t just kicking off the new week with some simple clickbait. The image was Smith&#8217;s way of touting a new Microsoft-generated quiz to test if readers could determine the difference between real images and fake ones made with artificial intelligence. Microsoft says it created the Real or Not quiz as part of a broader effort to help improve AI literacy.

The ruling could force Google to change the way it runs its business, and impact several other ongoing antitrust lawsuits involving other tech giants including Amazon, Apple, and Meta.

Luscher, a neuroscientist at the University of Geneva, explained the biology of addiction in a talk at the Allen Institute last week. The event took place just blocks from downtown Seattle, where an increasing amount of overdoses are occuring, driven in part by synthetic drugs such as fentanyl. Luscher said fentanyl is 100 times more potent than morphine. &#8220;The onset of action is very fast,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is something that leads to its high addiction liability.&#8221; In a&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/the-biology-of-addiction-scientists-use-brain-studies-in-pursuit-of-therapies-amid-fentanyl-crisis/\">Read More</a>", "id": 979379, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/the-biology-of-addiction-scientists-use-brain-studies-in-pursuit-of-therapies-amid-fentanyl-crisis", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "The biology of addiction: Scientists use brain studies in pursuit of therapies amid fentanyl crisis", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-05T15:57:14+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/radpowerbike-1260x840.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Seattle-based Rad Power Bikes made more cuts to its workforce in July, the latest in a wave of layoffs that have impacted the well-funded electric-bike startup.
