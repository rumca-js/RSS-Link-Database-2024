"Super straight" is a new term, coined by a TikTok user in 2021, that asserts one is "naturally" and "inherently" not attracted to transgender people. This new sexual identity attempts to distance super straights from being seen as transphobic while still enacting transphobia, or discrimination or violence against trans people.

Melanin protects the skin—the body's largest organ and a vital component of the immune system—from the damaging effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. When the skin is exposed to UV radiation, melanin production is stimulated in melanocytes, with tyrosinase playing a key role in the biosynthetic pathway. However, disruptions in this pathway caused by UV exposure or aging can lead to excess melanin accumulation, resulting in hyperpigmentation.

Most bottom-dwelling marine invertebrate animals, such as sponges, corals, worms and oysters, produce tiny larvae that swim in the ocean prior to attaching to the seafloor and transforming into juveniles. A previous study led by researchers at the University of Hawai'i (UH) at Mānoa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) unlocked the mystery of how the floating larvae responsible for establishing marine biofouling settle and metamorphose: specific bacteria in biofilms are a signal that they have found the "right spot."

Wound infections, particularly associated with burns, are a serious health problem causing high morbidity and mortality. Aside from hygiene and basic dressings, antibiotics are the standard treatment for serious wounds. However, cost, access, and emerging bacterial resistance, make their use difficult and ineffective, especially when a course of treatment is not completed. Globally, a huge number of deaths occur because of infected burns especially in low- and middle-income countries, and most commonly in rural areas.
