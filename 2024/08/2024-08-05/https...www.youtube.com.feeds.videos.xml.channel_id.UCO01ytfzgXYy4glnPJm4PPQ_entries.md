Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a new parenting trend has become very popular, especially among millennial parents. It's called "gentle parenting," and like so many other new-age parenting techniques, it is guaranteed to turn your child into a terrible human being. Also, the media and the Harris campaign claim that Trump backed out of a debate with her. They're lying, of course. And a judge in Arizona rules that unborn human beings cannot be called “human beings” because the term "human being" is, apparently, partisan. Plus, the female boxer assaulted by a male boxer at the Olympics has now come out and issued an apology to the man.
