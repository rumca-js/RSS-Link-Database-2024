<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hope everyone is well, with all the Google maps/LinkedIn scraping going on was hoping to find someone with large csv/datasets with already completed scans, right now more or less a hobby/educational personal use. If you got some recent scans and willing to share please mail me. Thanks! Have a great day</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ifnbutsarecandynnuts"> /u/ifnbutsarecandynnuts </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ekx4co/google_maps_linkedin_business_datasets/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ekx4co/google_maps_linkedin_business_datasets/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to scrap a page and successfully retrieve JSON data within HTML using Python with requests and Beautiful Soup 4. However, they changed something. Now, I can‚Äôt find that specific div containing data using requests and bs4. The div is there if I open the page in a browser and view the source code. I used Selenium with a waiting time of up to 60 seconds for the page/JS to load completely. Still, no luck.</p> <p>Using selenium and bs4 to dump the source code‚Ä¶ it shows all the html/js, excluding that specific div.</p> <p>Can anyone advise me on how to approach this?</p> <p>Afraid to share a link here, but I will gladly send it to inbox</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nazgyl"> /u/nazgyl </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ekmpnt/noob_in_need_of_some_advice_python_requests_bs4/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/commen

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know this is shady topic so I'll understand your potential aversion. </p> <p>I am in need of scraping one specific user's activity log, mainly all text he wrote in group discussions and comments. I stumbled on his account randomly yesterday and after visiting his profile I found really shitty behaviour. I started manually scrolling his profile and gathering his toxic engagements with plan to send it to moderation and write a journal entry exposing his redflags, but there's way too much of activity from him.</p> <p>Thoughts?</p> <p>Tried scrolling through his profile but after 10 minutes I reached only beginning of 2023, while I wonder how bad it was in years before.</p> <p>The only scraping experience I have is using someone's Collab to download rule34 pics, but I wrote some for fun things in js myself too.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mypossiblepasts"> /u/mypossiblepasts </a> <br /> <span><a
