Underwater fiber-optic cables, carrying transactions worth trillions of dollars a day, are central to the U.S.-China tech war. These cables that run across the seabeds of the earth carry important information like emails, bank payments and military communications, which are an appetizing target for espionage and surveillance. 

The U.S. has been among the global leaders in installing fiber-optic cables, but in 2008, cable-laying company Huawei Marine Networks brought China into the ranks of global leaders in the industry.
