Here\u2019s why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Efficiency is achieving a desired outcome using the least resources possible, such as time, effort, energy, or money. It reflects how well a machine, system, or process converts inputs into outputs without unnecessary waste.\u00a0In engineering, it can mean the ratio of a machine\u2019s valuable work to the total energy expended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Efficien", "id": 982455, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3481646/is-efficiency-on-your-cloud-architects-radar.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.infoworld.com/feed/", "source_obj__id": 468, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Is efficiency on your cloud architect\u2019s radar?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-06T08:30:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"remove_no_follow\">\n<div class=\"grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"article-column__content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine a world where measuring developer productivity is as straightforward as checking your fitness stats on a smartwatch.
