<p>Somewhere out there could be an alternate universe where Microsoft exists without Windows, but probably not. Microsoft without Windows is almost unimaginable, given how globally popular the operating system has become over the decades.</p>

## Logitech: ‘Forever mouse’ was just a (bad) idea

<p>Take a deep breath, everyone. Logitech’s “forever mouse” won’t be coming to market after all.</p>



<p>Logitech’s idea of a mouse that you’d buy once and pay for forever is just a “peek” into a possible future, Logitech said, in a statement sent to PCWorld and other publications. The company has no plans to bring it to market and will keep selling its existing mice, which you pay for, then own for the life of the mouse.</p>



<p>Newly-minted Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber suggested the idea of a forever mouse in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, where she suggested that the concept of constantly paying for updates was somehow like buying a luxury item. The idea is that you’d constantly pay a fee to update the mouse with drivers and new features and hold onto it…forever?</p>

<p>If you think phishing scams only happen over the internet, you’d be dead wrong. In fact, there are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2371413/most-common-phishing-scam-types.html">many different types of phishing scams</a>, including a recent type that occurs via traditional mail.</p>



<p>In Germany, the <a href="https://www.polizei-praevention.de/aktuelles/gefaelschte-briefpost-im-namen-von-diversen-banken-mit-qr-code.html">State Office of Criminal Investigation of Lower Saxony</a> recently warned people about phishing attempts via mail in the form of fake letters that purport to come from their banks.</p>



<p>Some of these phishing letters look surprisingly close to the real deal, and some even contain personalized information. Complete with official logos, they give the impression that they’re authentic.</p>

<p>Whether you’re capturing a snippet of important information or a funny moment in a game, taking a screenshot is something most people do on a day-to-day basis. Taking a screenshot is relatively straightforward, but there are smarter ways to do it. Windows 11’s screen capture tools are a lot more advanced than the ones Windows 10 offers. Heck, you can even film what appears on the screen! </p>



<p>In our guide, we lay out all the tips between the two systems. Read on to learn more.</p>
