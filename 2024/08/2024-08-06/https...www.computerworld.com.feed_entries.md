<p>Long before Taco Tuesday became part of the pop-culture vernacular, Tuesdays were synonymous with security — and for anyone in the tech world, they still are.  Patch Tuesday, as you most likely know, refers to the day each month when Microsoft releases security updates and patches for its software products — everything from Windows to Office to SQL Server, developer tools to browsers.</p>



<p>The practice, which happens on the second Tuesday of the month, was initiated to streamline the patch distribution process and make it easier for users and IT system administrators to manage updates.  Like tacos, Patch Tuesday is here to stay.</p>

<p>In a major setback for Google, a US District Court has declared the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3481539/google-is-a-monopolist-that-violated-antitrust-laws-court-finds.html">search engine giant a monopoly</a>, asserting it used its dominance in the online search market to stifle competition.</p>



<p>This ruling is likely to increase regulatory scrutiny and changes in Google’s business practices, potentially allowing more room for competitors to gain market share.</p>



<p>Google has said it will appeal the ruling, which adds to its other legal challenges.</p>



<p>A separate trial focusing on Google’s advertising practices is scheduled for later in 2024.</p>
