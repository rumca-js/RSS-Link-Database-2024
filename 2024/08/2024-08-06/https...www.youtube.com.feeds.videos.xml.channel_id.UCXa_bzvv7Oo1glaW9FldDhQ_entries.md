The game all comes down to a few core strengths then - the art, the aesthetic, the atmosphere, and the exploration. All of that is great. Pretty much everything else has caveats, or stumbles greatly in its execution, from the story being entirely obtuse, the combat being either completely trivialized or undermined by the poor camera and controls, and the game’s jank constantly getting in the way and generating friction for the player.

Massive Entertainment's Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.

Here, we're going to talk about notable sequels of 2024 in both groups- some that have released and made their mark, and others that are yet to come but are generating no small amount of excitement.
