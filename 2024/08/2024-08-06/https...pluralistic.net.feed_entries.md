Today's links Circular battery self-sufficiency: 125m of tons of battery material is one *seventeenth* of our annual road transportation oil extraction. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2014, 2019, 2023 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Circular battery self-sufficiency (permalink) If we are going to survive the climate emergency, we will have to electrify &#8211; that is, transition from burning fossil fuels to collecting, storing, transmitting and using renewable energy generated by e.g. the tides, the wind, and (especially) the Sun.

This is characteristic of big engineering projects, which explains why so m
