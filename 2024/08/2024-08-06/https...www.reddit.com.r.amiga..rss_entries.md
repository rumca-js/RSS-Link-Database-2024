## What does 1mb memory upgrade for A500+ do for you?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There's a trapdoor memory upgrade for the 500+ that adds 1mb for a total of 2mb. On AmigaKit it says that it's useful for using Whdload. However wouldn't most add-ons that give the 500+ hard drive support already have memory on them? Is it purely only really useful for if you have an old side-car hard drive in the side port? Or does it have any other common uses on a 500+ when you're not doing productivity work?</p> <p>I remember back in the day my dear departed mum got me a memory expansion for my 500+ for Christmas one year because she must have asked what she could get me and the person at the computer shop said it was an essential upgrade if I didn't have one. I guess they were only thinking that I must have had a 500. My whole childhood I didn't realise that it was doing nothing and that the 'extra ram detected and utilised' screens would have shown up without the extra memory. I only thought about it again recently when I re-acclimatised myself
