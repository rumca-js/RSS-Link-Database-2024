## Smashing idea: how East Germany invented ‘unbreakable’ drinking glasses

<p>In the 1980s, a company called Superfest pioneered extra strong glass – but it disappeared with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Now it’s making a comeback</p><p>The glass is narrow at the bottom but bulges out a third of the way to the top. As with the classic British “nonik” pint, the bulge makes the glass easier to stackand gives your thumb and index finger somewhere to rest. The name is spelled in fading letters near the rim and means “super tight” or “super strong” in German, which one might assume to be a reference to the drinker’s solid grip. In fact, it hails the glass’s extraordinary durability.</p><p>This is Superfest, East Germany’s “unbreakable” drinking glass. Invented in the industry-rich but resource-poor socialist German Democratic Republic, Superfest glasses were designed with the aim of making them last five times longer than ordinary drinking glasses. They were soon found to be 10 times more durable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/article/2024/

That would be the just and normal response to hearing the name “Joe Rogan” in 2024. Even Rogan himself seems to think so; on his new standup special Burn the Boats, he does a whole bit about the Fear Factor segment that got the show canceled – that is, actually canceled, as in when a show is taken off the air, like a fading reality show or a great five-season sitcom (RIP, Newsradio!). This is distinct from the Joe Rogan type of canceled, which is where you command an audience of millions, a salary of millions, and a Netflix standup special where you joke about being repeatedly “canceled” for your supposedly harmless antics – presumably also in front of millions.</p><p>This is a remarkable trajectory for someone who hosted a second-tier reality show 20 years ago.

As a public affairs marine, Vance avoided the pressures of combat during the Iraq war, tasked instead with escorting the media through war zones, embedding himself with combat units to diarize their routines, and snapping photographs. He also liaised with local Iraqi residents, played soccer with school children, and handed out candy, as a show of good will on behalf of an occupying military force. On one occasion, Vance gave a tiny pencil eraser to a child, who received the bauble as if it were some great gift. “His face briefly lit up with joy,” Vance writes, “holding his t

Of the 92 people on board, Juliane was the only survivor – and it would take her 11 days to walk to safety</p><p>Juliane Diller’s mother had booked herself and her daughter seats in the penultimate row of Lansa flight 508 from Lima to Pucallpa in Peru, to reunite with her husband for the Christmas holidays.

<p>The housing market has left Gen Z divided, with some stuck with their parents feeling like children, and us renters living without company</p><p>I felt as if I had hit the jackpot when I graduated, quickly got a job and found a small flat in Sheffield I could (just about) afford to rent with my partner. I’d got it “right”: I’d avoided moving back to my childhood bedroom, and at age 22 I felt like a proper grownup. But with each week that passed an uneasiness grew, as it became apparent I wouldn’t be celebrating these achievements with close friends. They had worked just as hard, applied for jobs every single day, and gained work experience and top grades – but many ended up moving back home with their parents.</p><p>In 2011, half of young people in England and Wales <a href="https://blog.ons.gov.uk/2024/04/12/our-changing-population-is-there-for-all-to-see/">had moved out at age </a>21.

As in, you better feel good about this movie or its admirers will get very cross and maybe call you names. Such may well be the case with this Mexican comedy-drama about an unorthodox schoolteacher (winningly played by Eugenio Derbez); it is a film that a certain constituency of viewers is going love so passionately that woe betide any who might suggest that it is profoundly manipulative and unabashedly sentimental.</p><p>That said, there’s no gainsaying the skills of director Christopher Zalla and the cast, which is why, by the end, Radical earns the tears of bittersweet joy it yanks out from even the grouchiest of grouches. Zalla co-wrote the script with Laura Guadalupe, working from
