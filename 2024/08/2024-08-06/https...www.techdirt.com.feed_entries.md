It hasn&#8217;t been a fun few years for once-respected tech news outfit CNET.

What began as an attempt to challenge the constitutionality of the DMCA&#8217;s terrible anticircumvention provision has now backfired.

Unfortunately, the political rhetoric in this country has been controlled by Republicans who continue to insist the last election was &#8220;stolen,&#8221; despite a complete lack of evidence. This isn&#8217;t helping anything. And raiding the Capitol to overturn election results accomplished little else than allowing people [&#8230;]
