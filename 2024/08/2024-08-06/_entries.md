A federal appeals court on Tuesday said a Citigroup vice president was not entitled to a share of a $400 million civil fine that the bank agreed to pay in October 2020 over its risk management failures.

Miller said Citigroup's conduct violated its $700 million settlement in 2015 with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over its credit card business, and its $35 million settlement the same day with the OCC over its marketing practices.

Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted losses of at least 3% each on Monday after weak economic data raised worries of a U.S. recession and the unwinding of sharp positions of carry trades that fund high-yielding assets.  U.S. central bank policymakers pushed back on Monday against the notion that weaker-than-expected July jobs data means the economy is in recessionary freefall, but also warned that the Federal Reserve will need to cut rates to avoid such an outcome.  Traders currently see a 75% chance of a 50-basis-point cut in Fed interest rates in September, down from 98% on Monday and expect the year-end rates at 4.25%-4.50%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.

Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK.B) may have shocked some over the weekend when it was disclosed that it had cut its massive Apple (AAPL) stake in half as it released its latest round of quarterly earnings results. With a massive cash mountain that’s since grown to be even more towering, there are many unanswered questions when it comes to Berkshire, Apple, and the road ahead. Despite the giant question marks, I remain bullish on Berkshire Hathaway stock. As you’d expect, t

Wall Street analysts are almost unanimous in their view that semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) will rocket higher. However, options traders apparently have a different take, placing contrarian wagers against NVDA stock. The situation has now become a matter of which narrative investors trust more. In my opinion, the market is the ultimate arbiter, and it’s not giving the warm and fuzzies over the tech juggernaut. Therefore, I am bearish on NVDA.

Investors said the aftershocks of a massive carry trade that has reverberated through global financial markets wasn't done yet, with more unwinding in the days ahead raising the risk of shake-outs to other assets.  Concerns about the markets were exacerbated by investors winding down yen-funded trades that had been used to finance the acquisition of stocks for years after a surprise Bank of Japan rate hike last week.  The so-called 'carry trade' is commonly used in currency markets where investors borrow money from economies with low interest rates such as Japan or Switzerland, to fund investments in higher-yielding assets - this time stocks - elsewhere.

A powerful rally has lifted Japan's Nikkei and Asian stock markets, and European and U.S. stock futures indicate they will follow too.  Given the confluence of factors that drove the selloff - Japan's rate hike, an unwind of yen-funded global trades, weakness in U.S. jobs and Middle East tensions - strangely, all it took was a soothing message from central bank officials to turn things around.  As Europe wakes up, the Nikkei is up 9%, nearly erasing the 12.4% decline on Monday that pushed it into bear market territory.

Shares in the dominant technology stock TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, climbed 5.6% after jumping more than 6% in early trade.
