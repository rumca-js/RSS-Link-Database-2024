 Florida International announced what could end up as a 10-year agreement on Tuesday with international recording artist, Grammy winner and entrepreneur Armando Christian Pérez – the Miami native better known as Pitbull – to put his name on their college football stadium.<br /><br />
 Pérez will pay $1.2m annually for the next five years, the university said, for the naming rights. He will have an option in August 2029 to extend the deal for another five years and continue the rebranding.<br /><br />
 “Yes, we’re going to create history in Pitbull Stadium,” Pérez said during a news conference in Miami. “This isn’t just an announcement. This is a movement. This is truly history in the making.”<br /><br />

<p>Euphoria’s Hunter Schafer is a convincing scream queen in this Germany-set chiller which prioritises mood over plot</p><p>There’s a dizzying amount to see and hear in German film-maker Tilman Singer’s brash style-over-substance horror Cuckoo, a film that pokes and prods and screeches with <em>just</em> about enough vim and volume to keep us mostly engaged. As the work of a newish-to-the-scene director, it’s a big, bold flex, and one that serves as more than ample evidence that he can be trusted to take on, and add flavour to, far more commercial movies. As proof of his ability as a writer it’s far less persuasive, a script that could generously be labelled opaque and more fairly called frequently incoherent.</p><p>How much one will be turned off by such hazy, haphazard plotting will be a matter of personal taste and in a period that’s seen the horror genre beset by films prioritising mood and atmosphere above all else, it will probably find its unbothered audience.

<p>With catchy tunes and endless zingers, this hit comedy is finally on a London stage but only for two nights. When will it get a full run? That is the question …</p><p>What’s the sign of a good musical? You leave the theatre humming the songs. And a great one? You’re also humming them in the interval, the next morning and on and on for days. That’s what happened when I first saw a rollicking production of Something Rotten! <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/jun/28/canada-shakespeare-stratford-festival-something-rotten-musical">at Canada’s Stratford festival</a> at the start of summer. Now, the day after its first London performance in a different concert version, it’s happening again.</p><p>But if this is one of the catchiest musicals I’ve ever seen, it’s also one of the funniest as it recounts downtrodden and jealous Renaissance playwright Nick Bottom’s attempts to outsmart the cocksure William Shakespeare.

<p>From the vegan sausage roll, to free food and drink for employees, Greggs has always had my vote. And now it seems customers agree</p><p>At the height of the vegan sausage roll furore, I was idly looking around for other things to like about Greggs, beyond that the bakery giant had enraged Piers Morgan. I was already a fan, on account of its Tottenham cake, an outsized slab of sponge with an unnaturally pink icing. That treat was invented by a Quaker in Tottenham and originally sold for a penny a slice, although that was 150 years ago; the price, at the peak of my fandom (2007), was £1.20.</p><p>Anyway, back in the vegan era (2019), I found an employee chatroom praising the chain as a broadly OK employer, with one standout comment that, even though staff were technically allowed only hot drinks for free, they regularly got a load of baked goods as well, with one sales assistant saying he ate £10 to £15 worth of free food every lunchtime.

<p>This compelling chronicle of post-Soviet Russia by the BBC’s former Moscow correspondent captures vividly the tyranny and dark comedy of the president’s rule</p><p>In August 2021 <a href="https://x.com/sarahrainsford?lang=en">Sarah Rainsford</a> flew back to Moscow from a reporting trip in Belarus. After a mysterious wait at passport control, a border guard approached. He produced a piece of paper. Reading with a “solemn air that was almost theatrical”, he intoned: “Sarah Elizabeth, you are banned from entering Russia as a threat to national security.”</p><p>Rainsford, the BBC’s Russia correspondent, was being expelled. After some hours at Sheremetyevo airport she was allowed to enter the country. Foreign ministry officials, however, soon made clear her reprieve was temporary. They told her she was being kicked out for good. It was, they said, a “mirror response” after the UK government refused to renew the journalist visa of a suspected Kremlin spy in London.</p> <a href="https://

<p>A heroine who looks good in Lycra and a love interest with no chemistry don’t leave you wanting more, despite Duchess’s sequel-friendly ending</p><p>So derivative that it almost qualifies as a type of financial instrument, this crime thriller is clearly investing in its own future as a low-budget franchise, given how sequel-friendly it leaves the conclusion. Much will depend on whether viewers take to its titular heroine, scrappy Londoner Scarlett Monaghan (Charlotte Kirk). Our leggy heroine graduates from minor crimes such as pickpocketing drunks to more advanced forms of larceny when she hooks up with mid-level gangster Robert (Philip Winchester), whom she describes in voiceover as the love of her life. That assertion isn’t all that convincing given how little chemistry there is between the two leads, but who are we to question the feelings of fictional characters?</p><p>At least there is no need to ponder too long on the authenticity of their affection once the locus of action s

<p>I took a cruise with thousands of fellow lunatics to find out how this much-mocked rock band became so beloved</p><p>It’s high noon on a blazing April day, which is the ideal time to be sitting in an Irish pub aboard a cruise ship the size of a small asteroid. The bar is called O’Sheehan’s – pronounced “oceans” – and it’s located deep within the belly of the boat, just above the teppanyaki joint, the sake bar and the lustrous duty-free shops. This consciousness-altering diorama of infinite seas and Guinness-themed paraphernalia is where I meet Colleen Sullivan, a 46-year-old woman with a beehive of curly red hair and arms encased by plastic wristbands. She wants to tell me how Creed changed her life.</p><p>We are both here for Summer of ’99, a weekend-long cruise and concert festival for which Creed – as in the Christian-lite rock band that sold more than 28m albums in the US and yet may be the most widely disdained group in modern times – are reuniting for the first time in 12 yea

<p>From fairy porn to romantasy via the Omegaverse, publishing is sexier than ever. The reason? A big shift in gen Z and millennial attitudes to respectability and shame ...</p><p>I spent a fortnight reading nothing but smut and I don’t need to give you a reason. But since there is one, here it is: business is booming in the publishing world of love and sex. Aficionados draw fine distinctions – between romance and erotica; “steamy” and “smutty”; fantasy and saga fiction – and endlessly subdivide the genres, but the takeaway is that the stigma around what used to be called “books that women like” has gone. And, as the UK literary agent Alice Lutyens puts it: “The steamier the sex, the better the book does.”</p><p>I started two books simultaneously, which just happened to span the gamut, from the almost completely chaste The Stars Too Fondly, by Emily Hamilton, to the most pornographic thing I’ve ever read (and I’ve read De Sade): Heat Clinic, by Alexis B Osborne. So, I could give you a

<p>Dissidents released by western efforts backtrack – ‘Ukraine must win’; Kyiv targeted with missiles and drones. What we know on day 895 </p><p>Ukrainians have reacted angrily to <strong>calls by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/01/evan-gershkovich-other-foreign-citizens-freed-russia-prisoner-swap">freed Russian political prisoners</a> to ease sanctions that affect ordinary Russians</strong> and for the two sides to enter negotiations. Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was serving 25 years in prison, had asked the west to consider whether sanctions hitting ordinary Russians were “unfair and counterproductive”. The Ukrainian lawmaker Iryna Gerashchenko was among those who responded, saying: “I no longer believe in any good Russians.” After a wave of criticism, Kara-Murza told the BBC he <strong>accepted that Russian society shared “responsibility for what the Putin regime is doing</strong> … Putin can’t be allowed to win this war.
