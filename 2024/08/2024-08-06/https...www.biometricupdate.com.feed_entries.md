		Contrary to several media reports, delays in passenger processing at South Africa’s largest airport are not due to problems with the biometric system being installed by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia">Idemia</a> – because the new system is neither due nor live yet.

It is clear that air passengers are experiencing excessive delays, with the Board of Airline Representatives of South Africa (Barsa) requesting a meeting with the country’s Home Affairs Minister to discuss the problem, <a href="https://www.travelnews.co.za/article/delays-disruptions-sa-airports">South Africa’s Travel News</a> reports. It has also been confirmed to <em>Biometric Update </em>that Idemia has split with its local partner, InfoVerge, leading to a <a href="https:

		The World Economic Forum (<a href="https://www.weforum.org/">WEF</a>) says data standards, ethical AI and diaspora are the keys to the future digital economy of countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In an <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/06/ethical-ai-diaspora-aseans-digital-economy/">article</a> published in late June, the WEF argues that a collaborative effort to harmonize data protection regulations and create a regional framework for cross-border data flows will enable more efficient trade and attract foreign investment to the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202401/digital-transformation-plans-progress-in-asean-region">ASEAN region</a> – especially if the diaspora can be leveraged for international activation.

		Changi Airport in Singapore has implemented facial and iris recognition to verify travelers' identities, allowing for passport-less immigration clearance.

The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has begun a phased rollout of the system, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/singapore-announces-passport-free-biometric-clearance-at-borders-from-2024-updated">provided by</a> <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia">Idemia</a> at Terminal 3 on August 5, 2024, for arriving Singapore residents.

		As new deepfake tools become increasingly accessible, there is a growing risk of undermining trust and security. Even cyber hackers with minimal skills can use these tools to carry out scams.

With the proliferation of AI-generated audio and video content on social media, companies are now seeking to incorporate deepfake detection models into their security infrastructure. This is especially important as synthetic content can even bypass biometric facial verification.

Reality Defender has engaged in collaborative efforts with Respeecher and ElevenLabs with the aim of enhancing its detection platform. Trend Micro has implemented upgrades to its Trend Vision One platform in order to address the GenAI deepfake content. Finally, Hiya has acquired Loccus.ai with the intention of b

		When a person creates a fingerprint template by pressing their finger against a biometric scanner, the scanner is generally not capable of telling whether each scan is of the same finger of the same person. In unattended biometric enrollment situations, this creates a risk of fraud, with one of the people whose biometrics were combined with another’s posing as them for authentication, according to a new patent application from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/mastercard">Mastercard</a>.
