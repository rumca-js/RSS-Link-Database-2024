I remember I saw some comments on this sub about how bad the cardboard quality was but I didn't think it would be this bad. It feels so cheap and flimsy, like the kind of quality for cards you shouldn't shuffle but just use directly on the table. Shuffling feels awkward and you feel like the cards will damage, deform or tear.</p> <p>Really terrible quality and it's a shame because the game itself is awesome and the theme/style is quite elegant and breezy. I paid the equivalent of 23 US dollars here in Mexico and out of all the games that I recently got (Dominion, Skull King, Cat in the Box, and even a 4-dollar Bicycle deck of standard cards) this has by FAR the worst quality or rather, the only one that I would consider bad.</p> <p>Are all cards by Pandasaurus Games like this or did I just get a copy from a bad batch?

I did enjoy it, and it was fun, my only issue was that even after secondary play throughs at my local board game place i found it abit difficult in terms of always having to look up rules and if something is allowed or not allowed, that was my gripe with it, but the concept seems really nice and really fun, and I feel like it could be fun and I would love to collect sets. On the other hand, I found Marvel United online (which not available at my local board game store to try) and it seemed really fun and simple with lots of characters too. My issue was i\u2019m not sure which to start buying sets in.
