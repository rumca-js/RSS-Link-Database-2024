For thousands of years, plants have evolved in the presence of wildfires in the Cerrado, Brazil's savanna-like biome. Scientists at São Paulo State University (UNESP) studied the effect of smoke on seed germination for 44 plant species typical of the Cerrado, as reported in an article published in Plant Ecology, where they stress that their findings could be used to optimize the restoration of degraded areas.

Warming global climate is changing the vegetation structure of forests in the far north. It's a trend that will continue at least through the end of this century, according to NASA researchers. The change in forest structure could absorb more of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, or increase permafrost thawing, resulting in the release of ancient carbon. Millions of data points from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) and Landsat missions helped inform this latest research, which will be used to refine climate forecasting computer models.

At concerts, in stadiums, in nightclubs, or during group dances on the beach, what helps people move to the same rhythm the most is bouncing, a simple movement that acts as a facilitator of synchronization among people. This is the result that has emerged from studies conducted by researchers at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT; Italian Institute of Technology) in Rome to understand the mechanisms that guide synchronous movements in dance. The origin of this discovery could be linked to the bouncing that humans experience as infants through the movement of maternal walking.

For many plants, more branches means more fruit. But what causes a plant to grow branches? New research from the University of California, Davis shows how plants break down the hormone strigolactone, which suppresses branching, to become more "bushy." Understanding how strigolactone is regulated could have big implications for many crop plants.

Hosts and their parasites are in constant competition. Through genetic diversity, the host can change in such a way that infection is no longer possible. However, the parasite adapts quickly—and the game starts all over again. This is also referred to in evolutionary biology as the "Red Queen model" after the character in the book Alice in Wonderland who keeps running without getting anywhere.

Throughout the ages, they have developed "psychological tactics" to endear themselves to adults and thus enhance their chances of survival. This prolonged dependency is believed to have driven the evolution of complex signaling mechanisms to help infants attract and maintain adult attention.

Waterhemp is a nuisance for any crop producer, but in snap bean fields, the weed's stem segments can break off during harvest, contaminating the crop with inedible look-alike "pods." However, snap bean is harmed by many of the herbicides registered for waterhemp, leaving producers with few chemical solutions.

In spring 2021, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of Germany's 16 federal states instituted an ad ban, forcing retailers to stop all print advertising in that state for three weeks. The state did so under the assumption that such a ban would limit contacts during the pandemic. However, banning print advertising is also being discussed as a way to conserve natural resources, including the paper and water required to produce printed advertising materials, and a way to help reduce carbon emissions.
