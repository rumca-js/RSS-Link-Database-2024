Stop leaving yourself vulnerable to data breaches. Go to my sponsor https://aura.com/knowledgehusk to get a 14-day free trial and see if any of your data has been exposed.

Microsoft is ruining Windows. It just keeps getting worse. Whether it be their insistence on AI and cloud garbage, or just a general sense of incompetence, I can’t help but feel like the operating system has seen better days.

Normally I wouldn’t care too much, big tech ruins another thing, whatever.

But the problem is Microsoft has such a dominant market share that you can’t really escape them.

I guess unless you use a Mac or something I don’t know.
