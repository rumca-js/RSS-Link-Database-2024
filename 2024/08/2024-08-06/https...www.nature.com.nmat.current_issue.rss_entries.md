<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 06 August 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01966-1">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01966-1</a></p>New design paradigms are needed to advance the performance of solid polymer electrolytes beyond conventional systems. The role of a helical secondary structure is now shown to greatly enhance the conductivity of solvent-free polymer electrolytes using cationic polypeptides with a mobile anion.
