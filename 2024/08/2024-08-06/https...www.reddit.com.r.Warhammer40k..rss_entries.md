Your Watch has been reduced, limited to being commanded by weak and fragile mortals.</p> <p>We have felt the same pain. From the glory days of 3.5 to middling codices, Heldrake nerfs, and 1W marines in 8th edition. But we persisted, and our desire for a powerful gaming experience paid off.</p> <p>There is a path for you to continue your fight against your enemies. Pick up a Chaos codex.</p> <p>Yes, it may seem blasphemous to join Chaos, but in truth your army complements the forces of Chaos. We share the same base sizes and most of your units are analogous to our own. You don’t even need to add spikes to your armor or change your colors. Primaris are more than welcome to join, we don’t discriminate when it comes to genetic alterations to Astartes. Your Corvus Blackstars can be vectors for Heldrake possession.</p> <p>We have 5 armies to cater to any play
