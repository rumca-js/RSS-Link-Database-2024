In today's Daily Fix:
Xbox has revealed the new titles coming to Game Pass as part of Wave 1, and that's Mafia: Definitive Edition, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, and Creatures of Ava, which is a Day 1 title for the service. In other news, the creator of Balatro has taken steps to ensure the game can never be used to promote actual gambling, despite the game revolving heavily around poker. Creator LocalThunk has added a clause to his will that states Balatro can't be sold to a casino or gambling company (but that might not stop the likely many Balatro copycats from selling out). And finally, the remake of the cult classic zombie action game Lollipop Chainsaw won't be releasing on its September 25th date—it's getting moved up two weeks.
