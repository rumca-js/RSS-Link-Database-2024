<p>Efficiency is achieving a desired outcome using the least resources possible, such as time, effort, energy, or money. It reflects how well a machine, system, or process converts inputs into outputs without unnecessary waste. In engineering, it can mean the ratio of a machine’s valuable work to the total energy expended.</p>
