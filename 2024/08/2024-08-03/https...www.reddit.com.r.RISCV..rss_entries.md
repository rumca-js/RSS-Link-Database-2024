<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am entering a competition soon, where you will have to design a single-cycle CPU using RISC ISA. and from what I have heard it is judged on how many features are implemented, (out of order, pipelining, etc.) So basically the more performance enhancement features that are implemented, the better. My question is, for a beginner in HDL although I have taken computer architecture courses and digital logic before. What should my priorities be when designing it? And what features are a must? What should I add to make it 'special'. I apologize for not providing enough information but this is what is available to me atm. The competition organizers are new as its the second iteration of this competition and they rarely provide useful information unfortunately.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/im_ppe_lelXD"> /u/im_ppe_lelXD </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ej00sm/question
