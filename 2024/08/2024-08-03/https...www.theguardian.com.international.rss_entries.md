The crowd were going wild on all four sides of the arena and yet for a few moments she simply stared at the roof, at the cameras and the scaffolding and the lights. For Ledecky, the pool has always been her freedom and her safety.

Maybe, people think, this young manager is the real deal. But they play against an elite side and lose. The cumulative effect of playing against high-class opponents every week takes its toll. The players who swaggered through the Championship become error-prone and, in the Premier League, those mistakes are punished. Confidence dwindles. Form deteriorates. Results go against them.

<p>This deeply funny series about a woman who leaps into a parallel life every time she orgasms is slick, interesting and full of excellent dialogue. It’s ideal late-night summer viewing</p><p>It’s summer, so we don’t really actually want any new culture. This is one of those strange revelations that I have about this time every year and then manage to forget again almost immediately – so I am surprised upon re-realising it again 12 months later (a similar one is: every October, I will start to feel profound dread, to the point where I’ve set up a recurring calendar entry on the first of the month that just warns: “Dread”).</p><p>It is too hot and you can’t find that fan you bought and the Olympics are on and the sun is out, and there’s at least one of those evenings where you decide to walk home from work because it’s so nice out and impromptu plans are always being arranged and you’re having your dinner outside so you can’t watch House of the Dragon because you’re too busy swatting

<p>It has sandy beaches, hilltop towns and emerald seas to make fans of Italy swoon, yet this southernmost region remains an undiscovered gem</p><p>Let’s start with an exclusive: “Italian town wants more tourists and cruise passengers.” It’s true that many in Italy are fed up with the country’s 22 million annual visitors, and that its most celebrated city has banned cruise liners and makes tourists pay a daily tax, but in deepest Calabria, as in several other areas, overtourism is not&nbsp;an issue – rather the opposite.</p><p>The main piazza in Santa Severina, a few miles from the Ionian coast, is dotted with bars and cafes beneath the walls of a Norman fortress and the dome of a Byzantine church. There’s a&nbsp;small formal garden leading to a terrace with wonderful views – we are more than 300 metres (980ft) high – over the Sila mountain range.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/article/2024/aug/03/calabria-italy-tourists-seen-as-blessing-not-curse">Continue reading...

<p>Cold-brew coffee is expensive to buy because it takes time to make, but it’s effortless and cheap to DIY</p><p>Today’s recipe gives you two cups of coffee for the price of one. A cafetiere of fresh coffee brews in about four minutes, after which time the coffee should be decanted, so it’s not too strong or bitter. The spent grounds left over still have plenty of flavour and caffeine left in them, so save them to make cold brew. Cold brew coffee is really expensive to buy, because of the time it takes to make it and the cost of the packaging, but it’s surprisingly easy and effortless to make at home.</p><p>Cold brew coffee is less acidic and less bitter than hot brewed coffee, but it is quite heavily caffeinated even when made with spent coffee grounds, because of the long infusion time. Sometimes, I ask my local cafe for a bag of spent grounds to make a big, three-litre batch of cold brew for the week ahead. I usually enjoy my coffee black, but when I fancy a treat, I sometimes mix

The push is fuelling a surge in civilians fleeing, with requests for evacuation in the area increasing about tenfold over the past two weeks, according to a volunteer helping people leave. Russia’s gains of about 57 sq km (22 sq miles) in the space of a week are the third-largest recorded since April after they made only modest gains in June, Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with the Black Bird Group, told Reuters.</p><p><strong>Russian forces are using wa
