<p>Whether clustered in grids across rolling hills or nestled up close to hedges, mobile homes are the subject of Dorset photographer Jethro Marshall’s latest book, <em>Prefab Scout</em>. Shot out of season along the Jurassic Coast in south-west England, the homes are captured free of people and their belongings, revealing modernist forms that are, Marshall says, “equal parts regimented Soviet, free-living American and British kitsch”. The series is part of a wider project documenting the everyday character of the south-west. For Marshall, it was also a chance to revisit his childhood through adult eyes. “As a kid, our family holidays were often six miles west to Devon. This is about appreciating the modern, functioning countryside.” </p><p>• <a href="https://the-modernist.org/products/prefab-scout">Prefab Scout is published by The Modernist (£20)</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2024/aug/03/the-secret-lives-of-mobile-homes-in-pictures">Continue readin

<p>From a children’s classic to a novel of forbidden love, Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Kaliane Bradley, Donal Ryan and more recall their formative reading experiences</p><p>I really did not want to come of age. My primary school had a playing field with a lush, unmown border full of cow parsley, nettles and tall grasses. You could find newts and frogs and birds’ nests in there. Why would I want to be cast out of the Garden of Eden? Then, when the rest of my class was exiled to Big School, I was held back and got to do year 6 all over again. I could not believe my luck. At the same time I was filled with an overwhelming awareness that I was living on borrowed time.
