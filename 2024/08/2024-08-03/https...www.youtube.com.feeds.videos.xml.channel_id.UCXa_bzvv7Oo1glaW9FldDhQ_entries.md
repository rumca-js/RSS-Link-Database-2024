The missteps and fumbles associated with Deadlink - whether inherent or inadvertent - are ultimately an unconvincing argument against playing the game. 

Especially if you are a fan of the cyberpunk aesthetic, or a fan of quick first person shooters, or a fan of the rogue lite structure that Hades perfected and so many other games have since leveraged to their benefit, you will find a lot to like and enjoy here. 

Deadlink in almost no way breaks any new ground, but it does not need to. It achieves every single thing that it sets out to do, and it does almost all of it extremely well. What few mishaps and mistakes happen along the way would be missing the forest for the trees.

The horror genre is brimming with first person indie titles attempting to scare the crap out of you with a laundry list of jumpscares, but few of them are as good at doing that as The Mortuary Assistant. 

Two years on from its original PC release, the horror title is making its way to consoles with a definitive edition re-release, and it is well worth looking into. Not only does it boast engaging gameplay and surprisingly solid writing and storytelling, it is also legitimately one of the scariest, most terrifying games in recent years. 

Though it has technical issues, and though its gameplay is dragged down a bit by issues with its controls, The Mortuary Assistant is easy to recommend to anyone who enjoys horror.
