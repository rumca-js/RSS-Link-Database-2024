Deep in the rainforest you can find the Yanomami. This Amazon Tribe are an extremely isolated people living on the Border between Brazil and Venezuela. They worship nature, and blow hallucinogenic Yopo powder into their noses to go to war with demons, and cast spells on rival tribes.

I join them for 2 days hunting, fishing, and going to war in our minds.
