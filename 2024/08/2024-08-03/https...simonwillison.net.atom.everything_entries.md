<p>we've long wanted to do release notes that describe each model's differences, but we also don't want to give false confidence with a shallow story.</p></blockquote><p class="cite">&mdash; <a href="https://twitter.com/sandersted/status/1819294298124218427">Ted Sanders (OpenAI)</a></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/danthegoodman1/EpicEnv">EpicEnv</a></strong></p>
Dan Goodman's tool for managing shared secrets via a Git repository. This uses a really neat trick: you can run <code>epicenv invite githubuser</code> and the tool will retrieve that user's public key from <code>github.com/{username}.keys</code> (<a href="https://github.com/simonw.keys">here's mine</a>) and use that to encrypt the secrets such that the user can decrypt them with their private key.
