Selling off a big chunk of its Apple holdings was the quarter's biggest news — Buffett once called the company's stake in the iPhone maker a pillar of Berkshire’s business that he intended to hold indefinitely.  The other major investment moves Buffett made during the quarter included continued cuts to its investment in Chinese EV maker BYD and selling off some of its Bank of America stock.

While I’m conscious that the exponential growth we’ve seen in AI-related stocks has led to pockets of overvaluation, I believe Celestica remains undervalued at the current price.

Warren Buffett appears to have soured on stocks, letting cash at Berkshire Hathaway soar to nearly $277 billion even as the conglomerate posted a record quarterly profit from its dozens of operating businesses. The $276.9 billion cash stake as of June 30 soared from $189 billion, in part because Berkshire sold another large portion of its stake in Apple. Second-quarter operating profit rose 15% to $11.6 billion, or to about $8,073 per Class A share, from $10.04 billion a year earlier, with nearly half coming from underwriting and investments in Berkshire's insurance businesses.
