My question is, for a beginner in HDL although I have taken computer architecture courses and digital logic before. What should my priorities be when designing it? And what features are a must? What should I add to make it 'special'. I apologize for not providing enough information but this is what is available to me atm. The competition organizers are new as its the second iteration of this competition and they rarely provide useful information unfortunately.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/im_ppe_lelXD\"> /u/im_ppe_lelXD </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ej00sm/question", "id": 969106, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ej00sm/questions_regarding_singlecycle_cpus", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "source_obj__id": 471, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Questions regarding single-cycle CPU's", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-03T04:05:52+00:00", "description": "&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CarlosDelfino\"> /u/CarlosDelfino </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://basicaodaeletronica.com.br/category/biblioteca/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1eiu40t/criei_um_site_para_compartilhar_meu_aprendizado/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 968287, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1eiu40t/criei_um_site_para_compartilhar_meu_aprendizado", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "source_obj__id": 471, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Criei um site para compartilhar meu aprendizado em eletr\u00f4nica anal\u00f3gica, com o sucesso do site transformei numa plataforma de conhecimento em eletr\u00f4nica espero a visita de voc\u00eas.", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
