When the game ends and farms are scored, players can move meeples out of the City of Carcassonne's Market and onto farms. How do you determine which player moves their meeples first? Do players have one chance to move all their meeples at once into whichever farms they want, and if so, can they split the meeples across multiple farms? Or do you score farm by farm, with players deciding whether to move meeples into that farm or to save them for a different farm to be scored later, and if so, how do you decide which farm is scored first?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Original_Yak_7534\"> /u/Original_Yak_7534 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eitzg8/the_count_of_carcassonne_farm_scoring/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.", "id": 968266, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eitzg8/the_count_of_carcassonne_farm_scoring", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "The Count of Carcassonne: farm scoring", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-03T03:41:13+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eitngr/descent_act_2_question_about_syrus_hero_card/\"> <img alt=\"Descent Act 2, question about Syrus Hero card... \" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/mrd8v0v4edgd1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab85679f9d493d4eeae5fc4549199dbcb772067f\" title=\"Descent Act 2, question about Syrus Hero card... \" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>For 'The Turning' ability, can I do both the 1-fatigue action and the 2-fatigue action, placing 3 fatigue for 5 successes? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Coffeman94\"> /u/Coffeman94 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/mrd8v0v4edgd1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eitngr/descent_act_2_question_about_syrus_hero_card/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 968267, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eitngr/descent_act_2_question_about_syrus_hero_card", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://preview.redd.it/mrd8v0v4edgd1.jpeg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ab85679f9d493d4eeae5fc4549199dbcb772067f", "title": "Descent Act 2, question about Syrus Hero card...", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-03T03:34:30+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey Everyone, I'm currently looking for the small box bloodborne the board game expansions listed below.</p> <ul> <li>Margo's Loft,</li> <li>Bergenworth,</li> <li>Upper Cathedral Ward</li> <li>Blood Moon Box,</li> </ul> <p>Unfortunately I live in New Zealand so cannot find them anywhere for less than $400 a pop.

Also please let me know if I'm posting in the wrong place. I'm going to a large family reunion and wanted to know what games to get that are good for many ages? Family members range from 2 years old to 90 years old and I want a few games that will have a good mix of ages so everyone is involved but also ones they will genuinely enjoy. We're not religious or spiritual and we also aren't very conventional so swearing and banter/roasting is also not a problem if that helps. Thanks!</p> <p>Edit: sorry not trying to focus on the 2 year old they'll be easy to keep happy. More meant games that kids and teens and people in their 20s play but will also interest people in their 40s and 60s. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Flashy_Disk\"> /u/Flashy_Disk </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eiqivx/games_for", "id": 969521, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eiqivx/games_for_all_ages_literally", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Games for all ages (literally)", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-03T00:05:38+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Look, grand touring exists and the game has stick-based gearshift and explicit drifts, I don\u2019t think this is that much of a stretch lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Creative_Nose5238\"> /u/Creative_Nose5238 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eipbzf/is_it_normal_to_play_regular_formula_d_without/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eipbzf/is_it_normal_to_play_regular_formula_d_without/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 967816, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eipbzf/is_it_normal_to_play_regular_formula_d_without", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Is it normal to play regular formula d without using the F1 cars", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
