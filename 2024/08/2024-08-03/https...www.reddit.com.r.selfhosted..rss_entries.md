Bitwarden lets you self host your password manager. My internet is too unstable for me to host it locally, so i need to use cloud storage. Is it more secure to use a service like vultr or oracle to host bitwarden vs just using it regularly? Bitwarden claims they use on device encryption to where not even they can see your passwords. So i have two questions </p> <ol> <li><p>Is it actually more secure for me to host bitwarden in oracle or vultr vs using bitwarden non self hosting</p></li> <li><p>Would oracle shutting down on me periodically make it not feasible for me to use it?
