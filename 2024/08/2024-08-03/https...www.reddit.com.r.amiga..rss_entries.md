<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I've been trying to get a bunch of things on some handhelds I have to make my life easier since I'm fine with my real systems. Weirdly I dont have an amiga but I have 2 C64s, but thats another thing.</p> <p>Anyway long story short, with emulation I was planning to go the route of ADF files but it seems the easier option for a full set of amiga games is the ipf. I know the difference between the two, but I'd like to know which ones easier to use with emulators.</p> <p>Side question regarding Amiga Forever... I see an option that says 3 DVDs if you pay for the higher tier thing. Are they supposed to have every game released on these? And has anyone had much experience using this with multiple systems like windows and android and how they differ in use. Thanks for the help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vlaurn"> /u/vlaurn </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ej3qup/qu

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Help! I recently acquired an Amiga 500 with a gotek preinstalled. </p> <p>Initially the ribbon cable was installed upside down which I've now fixed. </p> <p>But I cannot seem to get past the workbench screen. I have the 3-digit LED model with 2 buttons only.</p> <p>Whether I have a USB inserted or not, I get F-F on the display. </p> <p>I can't seem to find any instructions on how to use the buttons exactly, but here's what I get. </p> <p>Holding both buttons together gives me rSt which I assume means reset?</p> <p>Pressing or holding left button does nothing. </p> <p>Pressing or holding right button displays 3 and then 29 and then goes back to F-F. </p> <p>I've followed the instructions for Flashfloppy with AUTOBOOT and HXCDFE files, correctly formatted USB, and some game files to test. </p> <p>Any tips much appreciated. </p> <p>Thank you. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yeah1526"> /u/yeah1526 </

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys, so I'm currently using a tracker to create the music for a friend that is making a new game for the amiga 500. I have currently got a small song/MOD down to 5.87KB. But once I add more samples to the song, it easily bumps up the size to over 60kb. What is the best way to keep the song/MOD small? And is it possible to find small samples possibly in bytes to load into the tracker?</p> <p>I'm quite new to using a tracker than the DAW's I'm currently used to so this is a great experience. Have any of you guys had this issue with making music for the amiga?</p> <p>An how is it possible to fit so many MOD's into 1 game? I seen Shadow Of The Beast 2 had 14 songs? :O</p> <p>Thanks in advanced guys!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ZEKAVEO"> /u/ZEKAVEO </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1eixgm0/making_music_for_the_amiga_is_challenging/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa

I have asked if they carry any Commodore Amiga computers. Likely store owner said &quot;yes&quot;. Drove up an hour and found two of these goodies in an known state, no power supplies... Just two computers. I could not have them being distroied as I have had one of these in early 1990s. They are not in a perfect condition I can tell, but would like to have one of them restored to working condition and keep for my self and the other one for someone that shares same sentiment
