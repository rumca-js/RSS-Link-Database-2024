Lego is the world's largest toy company but it's gained a reputation for being an expensive hobby. Since 2007, Lego has released dozens of sets that cost over $300. The most expensive Star Wars sets cost $850. And prices for vintage Lego sets can reach over $1,000. These high prices have caught the attention of thieves, who in some cases have stolen about $300,000 worth of Lego. So, how did we get here? How did Lego go from a children's toy to a collector's item? And why is it so expensive?
