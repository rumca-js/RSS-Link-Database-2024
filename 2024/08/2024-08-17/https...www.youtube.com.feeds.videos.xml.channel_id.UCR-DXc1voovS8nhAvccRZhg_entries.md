The Radxa X4 unites an Intel N100 SoC with a Raspberry Pi RP2040. The best of both worlds, right?

Let's explore thermals, power delivery, peripheral and OS support, and even take Linux and Windows for a spin on the PCIe Gen 3x4 NVMe SSD!

I purchased all the devices used in this video, there were no sponsorships; halfway through testing, Radxa sent a review unit in addition to the one I bought and tested, but all my testing was performed on the retail unit.
