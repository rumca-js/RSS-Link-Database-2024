<p>If financial regulations have been breached, it is only right that punishment follows but once a sport stops being decided on the pitch it is in trouble</p><p>“We want to move to a new system that people have confidence in and can comply with,” the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, said this past week, “and move away perhaps from normalising asterisks against league tables or long-running regulatory&nbsp;cases.”</p><p>That is surely right. That doesn’t mean a free-for-all or a return to the days of unregulated spending, but any competition is undermined if it becomes common practice for points won one week to be taken away by a committee the next. There appears a serious possibility of at least four clubs being docked points&nbsp;this season.

<p>Robert De Niro was so taken by Nobuyuki Matsuhisa’s cuisine that they went into business … the rest is notoriety</p><p>Some meals are more memorable than others. In 1988, Robert De Niro met the English director Roland Joffé, with whom he had recently made <em>The Mission</em>, at a restaurant in Los Angeles called Matsuhisa. The restaurant had opened a year earlier and Joffé had become a regular, but it was De Niro’s first visit. The actor ordered black cod miso – a discreet slab of marinated fish topped with a single strand of pickled ginger root – and drank the Japanese sake Hokusetsu.</p><p>At the time there were few Japanese restaurants in De Niro’s native New York – the <em>New York Times</em> felt the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/nobus-matsuhisa-turns-30-an-oral-history-sushi-restaurant-tom-cruise-couldnt-get-1008251/">need to explain</a> to its readers what sushi was as late as 1995 – and the freshness of the taste of that fish on De Ni

<p>A memoir of one couple’s years in hospitality captures the strange alchemy of running a restaurant</p><p>My intense interest in restaurants may be traced all the way back to childhood, when I coolly set up my own little place in the Victorian outside loo at my dad’s (somewhat of a hipster location, I think now). A short-lived but highly memorable establishment – at my funeral, there will doubtless be ye olde sibling jokes about how I misspelled lettuce – everything on the menu had been drawn by me in felt tip, and then cut out by hand. Service was brisk, orange squash was complimentary, and the atmosphere in the kitchen was straight out of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/oct/05/the-bear-review-should-you-watch-this-genius-kitchen-drama-immediately-yes-chef">The Bear</a></em>.

There’s a whole little world organising its life around a parasol and a few colourful towels.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2024/aug/17/embroidered-summer-holiday-scenes-in-pictures-la-filature">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the world heats up, methane released from thawing permafrost and warming tropical wetlands is intensifying climate breakdown. But curbing it is achievable</p><p>Controlling methane provides our best, and perhaps only, lever for shaving peak global temperatures over the next few decades. This is because it’s cleansed from the air naturally only a decade or so after release. Therefore if we could eliminate all methane emissions from human activities, methane’s concentration would quickly return to pre-industrial levels. Essentially, humans have released in excess of 3bn tonnes of methane into the atmosphere in the past 20 years. Quashing those emissions within a decade or two would save us 0.5C of warming. No other greenhouse gas gives us this much power to slow the climate crisis.</p><p>If the Earth keeps warming, though, reducing emissions from human activities may not be enough. We may also need to counter higher methane emissions in nature, including from warming tropical wetl

<p>There is method to the apparent madness of the tycoon’s prolific 24-hour output</p><p>Elon Musk doesn’t stop tweeting. Over just seven days last week, he made nearly 650 posts to the social network he bought in November 2022 and half-heartedly rebranded as X. In addition, he spent nearly three hours battling through technical problems he would later attribute to an unproved hacking attack in order to host a “conversation” with Donald Trump, as well as livestreaming himself playing a couple of hours of Blizzard’s swords-and-sorcery game Diablo IV.</p><p>The sheer volume of his content would be impressive enough on its own, but even as someone so addicted to posting that he spent more than the budget of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/03/off-the-map-the-secret-cities-behind-the-atom-bomb-manhattan-project">the Manhattan project</a> to buy the site, Musk’s consistency is alarming.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/17/a-week-in-tw
