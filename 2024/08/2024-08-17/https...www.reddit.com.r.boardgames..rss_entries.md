After doing a few chapters we left the game sitting around for a few years and I had to move abroad. </p> <p>I find it really hard to make it work with other players again, since the new players tend to rotate. I've read that it can be turned into a normal Betrayal game after the campaign is finished, but found no guide on how to do it without actually playing in through. The box has been laying in my room for years and at this point I want to skip the Legacy experience and just play it normally. If anyone could help me I would really appreciate it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rdei"> /u/rdei </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eut9wm/turning_betrayal_legacy_into_standard_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/com
