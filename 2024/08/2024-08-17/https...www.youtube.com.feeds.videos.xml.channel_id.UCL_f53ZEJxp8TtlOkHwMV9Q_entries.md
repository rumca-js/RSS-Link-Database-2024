Dr Jordan B. Peterson’s address to the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship’s event in Germany in July provided a rallying call for good people to step up.

“What does it mean for a country to descend into the grip of the totalitarian nightmare? ...it means that every single person who is an inhabitant of that country has decided to hold their tongue when they've been called upon to say what should be said."

Speaking at ARC, Jordan Peterson’s warning is that these catastrophes don’t just occur overnight, but that there is a journey towards them that is marked by silence.

“Good people have a burden on their conscience. The burden requires them to speak…And they refuse the call.”

We are at a turning point in our societies. The health of a society relies upon the responsibility and courage of its people. Jordan’s call is emphatic: “Speak the truth while you still can.”
