<p>Manager sees team show early spirit as he tries to find the right combination before opener against Manchester City</p><p>An otherwise inconsequential incident in Chelsea’s final pre-season friendly against Inter last Sunday gave Enzo Maresca hope that what may appear like a random collection of 43 footballers are developing into a team. Levi Colwill was kicked and wrestled to the ground by Inter’s veteran centre-back Francesco Acerbi and all hell broke loose, with most of Chelsea’s players piling in to support their teammate and surround the referee, Sam Barrott.</p><p>It was not quite the “Battle of the Bridge”, that violent clash between Chelsea and Tottenham eight years ago that produced 12 bookings and £600,000 in fines from the Football Association, but for Maresca it was an encouraging sign that his emerging group are prepared to fight for each other.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/17/enzo-maresca-chelsea-premier-league-football">Continue

<p>The manager remains as motivated as ever, as quest for seventh league title in eight years kicks off at Chelsea</p><p>Pep Guardiola enters his ninth Premier League season as Manchester City’s head coach with the same question he has faced for years: how does he motivate himself after such success? He knows it is coming and the answers arrive with great detail and a glint in the eye.</p><p>Guardiola’s future will be constantly running in the background until either he announces he will leave once his contract expires in the summer or signs an extension, but in the meantime there are matches to win.

<p>The art of improv is in the air as comedians have battled blackouts and other interruptions – with the result of rekindling the festival’s spirit</p><p>Walking around Edinburgh this month, you might have noticed the unusual number of standup comedians performing their shows outdoors. These natural basement-dwellers have been flushed out of their venues by various fire alarms and outages, including a city-wide power cut that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/03/iconic-edinburgh-fringe-venue-deflates-due-city-wide-power-outage-21353561/">caused the partial deflation</a> of the giant purple cow inflatable in George Square. Oh, the humanity.</p><p>It would be only too easy to view the inflatable as a metaphor for the bloat of the festival itself, slowly collapsing under its own weight.
