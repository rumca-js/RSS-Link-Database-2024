The grand scale of the environments, the dense swarms of tyranids, the absolute carnage of combat - it's all back in Space Marine 2, enhanced by the impressive technical capabilities of the Swarm engine. Focus Entertainment recently shared a preview build of the PC version of the game, and we're eager to share our impressions with you. We're liking what we see - but Space Marine 2 pushes hardware, which poses interesting challenges to the current generation of consoles, especially on the CPU side.</p><p>Saber Interactive has taken on development duties for this game, and our first impression is that it's done a fantastic job of capturing the Warhammer 40,000 aesthetic", "id": 1018548, "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-a-technologically-ambitious-sequel-that-can-look-stunning", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SPACE-MARINE-SITE.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 -

a game where you have to fold paper to solve puzzles - came from a brainstorming session where Newfangled Games' founders and brothers, Henry and Fred Hoffman, folded the paper of their hand drawn levels, then noticed that the puzzles on the front and the back could combine to make an even bigger puzzle. This one magic idea stuck from the off - but Newfangled Games' debut indie didn't always look like the polished puzzler it is now.
