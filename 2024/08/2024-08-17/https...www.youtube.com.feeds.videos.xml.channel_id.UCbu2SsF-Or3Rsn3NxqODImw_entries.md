Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down a range of the pro'er Bri'ish weapons of the Fallout: London mod, including the Covert, the Fusion Converted Zap Sniper Rifle and the Enfield: Electric Boogaloo. There's even time for a bit of sightseeing with a visit to the Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield and the British Museum. Blimey! 

Jonathan had so much to say about Fallout: London that we've split this video into two parts, so look out for Part 2 next week. 

We want to introduce some Q&amp;As into the episodes, so if you've got a question for Jonathan or the Expert Reacts team, leave them in the comments section and they may be answered in a future episode.

In the latest video in the Firearm Expert Reacts series, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down guns from Fallout: London, and compares them to their potential real-life counterparts.
