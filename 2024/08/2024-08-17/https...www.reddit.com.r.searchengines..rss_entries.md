<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all</p> <p>Understand my question discriminates against all the small startups but I wanted to ask if there is a way to block all search engines except Google, Bing and Brave?</p> <p>The reason is quite simply content whether it be porn, violence, AI powered or otherwise. </p> <p>I have forced safesearch for Google and Bing via my host files, and I reckon I will need to go through CNAME/DNS for Brave. Witht this said, I want to exclude all other content from my computer. </p> <p>Roughly speaking I could take a long list of search engine urls and add them to my Freedom/ColdTurkey/HomeGuard software, or I could map their DNS records to redirect to one of the 3 Search Engines I use. </p> <p>Would anyone be able to contribute to this query?<br /> Best, T</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Spartan3764"> /u/Spartan3764 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1euhaf2/is
