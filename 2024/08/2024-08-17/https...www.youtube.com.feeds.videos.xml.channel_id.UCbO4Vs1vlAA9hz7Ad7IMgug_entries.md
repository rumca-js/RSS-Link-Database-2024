Siocast was first featured on the Vostok, a large Remote for Infinity, but has now moved into their smaller Silhouette 2 Profile Models. Let's see how it holds up on these smaller casts after over a year of development. 

Big thanks to Corvus Belli for the complimentary advance copy of the models to review.
