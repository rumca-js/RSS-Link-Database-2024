Our review and benchmarks of the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X CPU focus on workstation and production tasks, but also feature gaming benchmarks and comparisons against Intel and AMD alternatives. These include AMD Zen 4 alternative CPUs, like the 7900X, 7800X3D (for gaming), and 7950X, as well as Intel's i7-14700K and i9-14900K. We have another couple dozen CPUs in the tests as well, including prior generation R9 5900X and R9 3950X CPU benchmarks. Testing also features the R9 7900.
