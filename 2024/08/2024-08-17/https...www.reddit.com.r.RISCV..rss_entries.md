<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a Security Engineer and am considering learning RISC-V to experiment with it it shardware for cryptography. Its why I asked about the Cryptographic Extensions earlier.</p> <p>Here I ask all of you about how helpful is the RISC-V community. I heard RISC-V is easy to pick up. But how does the RISC-V treat newcomers that are brand new to hardware design like myself? How have they helped you in your goals and visions in researching security if you are reading this and are doing security projects?</p> <p>How clear is the documentation, books, and online resources?</p> <p>In general did it improve your problem solving skills in addressing security concerns important to you? </p> <p>Are there any other related communities you recommend in addition to RISC-V that have the above qualities?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fosres"> /u/fosres </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comm

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to program a ch32v003 f4p6 chip to give adjustable PWM outputs for motor control which is the priority and later maybe audio. I am using the mounriver ide in c.</p> <p>So far I've been able to create PWM signals using <a href="https://pallavaggarwal.in/2023/09/23/ch32v003-programming-pwm-output/">https://pallavaggarwal.in/2023/09/23/ch32v003-programming-pwm-output/</a> and I've been able to choose between PWM signals using a switch but I'm unable to stop or change the PWM signal once it's started. </p> <p>If I try to put a delay between multiple PWM commands then the program just runs the last command and skips the delays. Without the ability to control it, I can't even start the motor without tapping the cables together to simulate a throttle pulse width. </p> <p>Honestly, even an example of dimming an LED using PWM would be a massive help in figuring it out. Examples are hard to find or understand.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitte
