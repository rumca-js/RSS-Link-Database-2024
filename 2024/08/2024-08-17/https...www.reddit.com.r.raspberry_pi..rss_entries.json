Both are available on amazon, I have no affiliation of course -- just thought it was a solid value.</p> <p>I wrote up a short review, with a couple benchmarks comparing the BC711's performance on my i5 7500 desktop vs the Pi 5. Tested it in Gen 2 and Gen 3 config.txt variations.</p> <p>As for the SSD... for 16 bucks, was it new? No. But SMART says only 6 hours and 300 GB written... so I'm pretty darn happy honestly.</p> <p>My revi", "id": 1016577, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1euraj2/added_a_gen_3_128_gb_ssd_to_my_pi_5_for_25_hat", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "source_obj__id": 470, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/YCYXZmxCPpbNuCQbbNDn0ukhYo7jF4PEPzidYNB-Owo.jpg", "title": "Added a Gen 3 128 GB SSD to my Pi 5 for $25 (hat included!)", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-17T13:53:54+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am using my pi 5 to stream video as part of a larger project but running into issues with the basic setup. </p> <p>On the Pi side I am running `rpicam-vid -t 0 --listen -o tcp://0.0.0.0:8554` </p> <p>I can connect from both my laptop (ubuntu) and desktop (win11) in vlc with `tcp/h264://192.168.0.23:8554` but it only displays an initial frame though in the command stdout (Maybe its using stderr?) that it seems to begin recording on connection but is for some reason failing to stream this to the client. </p> <p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated, outputting to a file does seem to work correctly.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Funtycuck\"> /u/Funtycuck </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1eui9z2/issues_with_local_tcp_streaming_only_displaying/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1eui9z2/issues_with_local_t", "id": 1016579, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1eui9z2/issues_with_local_tcp_streaming_only_displaying", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "source_obj__id": 470, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Issues with local TCP streaming only displaying first frame", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-17T12:37:32+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello to everyone.</p> <p>I'm trying to display and control my Android device (it's the Raspberry P 4,where I have installed Android 14 AOSP) through my PC (where I have installed Ubuntu 24.10) and my interest has fallen to scrpy.

Problem is that the connection does not work.
