We're liking what we see - but Space Marine 2 pushes hardware, which poses interesting challenges to the current generation of consoles, especially on the CPU side.</p><p>Saber Interactive has taken on development duties for this game, and our first impression is that it's done a fantastic job of capturing the Warhammer 40,000 aesthetic

This one magic idea stuck from the off - but Newfangled Games' debut indie didn't always look like the polished puzzler it is now. There were some conceptual design bumps in the road, a trip to Boxpark Shoreditch, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> deal to chase before they could reach Paper Trail's true potential.</p><p>In the release version of Paper Trail, you play as Paige, who runs a
