ABOUT FATHOM
We think it’s insane that so many people and businesses are still taking manual notes. Creating notes manually is both time-consuming and stressful, especially when attempting to hold a conversation. Furthermore, even when done meticulously, manual notes often lack crucial context compared to hearing something first-hand.
We started Fathom to rid us of the tyranny of note-taking. With Fathom, you can let AI take on the drudgery of note-taking while you stay engaged in your human-to-human conversation. And, people seem to love what we've built so far:

Figures showing a much larger-than-expected contraction in U.S. manufacturing activity last month followed purchasing managers index data earlier on Thursday that painted a similar picture in Germany, Japan and China.

"This isn't that unusual as we passed the economic torch from the perception of growth to needing government intervention with lower interest rates to stabilize the economy," said Tom Plumb, chief executive and portfolio manager at Plumb Funds.

The process of overcoming these barriers is known as "mainstreaming nature," and in an article recently published in Science, Eli Fenichel, Knobloch Family Professor of Natural Resource Economics, and a group of leading environmental and economic policy experts explain its benefits and the process the Biden-Harris Administration has used to begin mainstreaming nature into U.S. policymaking.

The fear now is that the Fed may be behind the curve in easing rates, and traders have priced in an even greater chance of a 50-basis-point cut next month, versus the previous consensus of 25 bps.
