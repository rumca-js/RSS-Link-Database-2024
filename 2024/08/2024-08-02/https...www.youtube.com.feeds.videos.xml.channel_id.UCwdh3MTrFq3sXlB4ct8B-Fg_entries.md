The glassy, coloured lenses on Space Marine helmets are a great source of detail and character. In this video, Adam will show you how to paint lenses in three different ways – an easy-to-do Contrast method, a Battle Ready approach that'll get your Space Marines looking sharp, and a guide to painting the wide visors that can be found on high-tech headgear across Warhammer 40,000 and Necromunda.

Here is a list of the paints we’ll be using, but the techniques you’ll learn here can be applied with a variety of different colours:

Base
Khorne Red
Mephiston Red

Layer
Evil Sunz Scarlet
Fire Dragon Bright
Wild Rider red
White Scar

Contrast
Blood Angels Red

Shade
Nuln Oil

Technical 
Contrast Medium

If you're new to painting, our Citadel Colour Painting Essentials playlist hosts an array of beginner-friendly videos to help you get started.
