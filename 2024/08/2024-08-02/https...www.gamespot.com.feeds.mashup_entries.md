<p>The tagline for the original 1979 Alien film famously said that "in space, no one can hear you scream." What that expression neglected to mention is that the Xenomorphs appear to have very good hearing, and they seem to pick up on almost every sound in a spaceship or colony. That ability is on full display in a new preview clip from the next film in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alien-romulus-trailer-brings-back-the-horrifying-silent-screams/1100-6523928/">Alien: Romulus</a>.</p><div>          </div><p>The clip features Isabela Merced as Kay, one of the ill-fated group of young people who thought it would be a good idea to scavenge materials from derelict ships. In this scene, Kay is unarmed and attempting to slip by a Xenomorph. And the alien in question seems to be actively looking for Kay and listening intently as she tries to stay as quiet as possible. It's reminiscent of the way Jane Levy's character hid from Don't Breathe's blind killer, Norman Nor

Surprisingly, it mixed in a few tender moments between bouts of vehicular carnage, as a driver lamented about the state his car was in after he'd taken it out for a quick destruction-derby ride and "overreacted" a bit on the track.</p><p>Wreckfest was a smashing success for THQ Nordic when it first came out several years ago, with the game being hailed as a spiritual successor to the FlatOut and Burnout series of games. Wreckfest spent four years in early access on PC before it received a full release in 2018, with PS4 and Xbox One versions arriving a year later.</p><p>The original game featured a fine balance of precision driving, strategy, and treating your car like a battering ram when all other options had been exhausted, and it looks like those elements will be present in Wreckfest 2 as well.

We've just had our only MCU movie of the year with Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, and the second of two TV series is coming in September with Agatha All Along. The slowdown is much needed, since the franchise has become overburdened with tons of separate, unrelated plot threads and very little synergy between any of the various properties--some consolidation is desperately needed.</p><p dir="ltr">We're sort of in a holding pattern on that front, since the few MCU projects on the calendar in 2024 don't appear to have much big picture significance--presumably things will start coming into focus with Thunderbolts and the new iteration of Fantastic Four next summer</p><p dir="ltr">With things in the MCU being the way they are, there are probably at le

Caped Crusader takes Batman back to his noir-inspired roots and reimagines his early days of donning the cape, cowl, and fin-less gloves as he's trying to figure out how to strike fear into the hearts of criminals.</p><p>Batman is such a malleable character, though, and has acted as a scientist, adventurer, mentor, and detective throughout more than 10 animated series--going through some int

<p>Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, two senior executives at Bungie, were both part of the recent round of layoffs, according to a new report. Speaking on his Game Mess Decides <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszLbBLdM3Y">podcast</a>, Jeff Grubb confirmed that the duo were working on Payback, a new game set in the Destiny universe, but were let go as part of sweeping job losses at the now PlayStation-owned studio.</p><p>"[Smith and Noseworthy] were labelled as working on Payback. It was going to be the next big thing for Destiny, but not Destiny 3," Grubb said. "Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy are no longer at Bungie. They were let go.
