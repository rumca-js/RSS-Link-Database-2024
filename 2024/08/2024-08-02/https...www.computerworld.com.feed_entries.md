<p>Apple beat expectations in its third quarter and has wind beneath its wings on strength of the recent <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3477982/apple-is-ready-for-government-and-your-business.html">Microsoft/Crowdstrike debacle</a> that cost companies billions of dollars.

<p>Six years ago, the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1717848/will-net-neutrality-repeal-kill-the-next-youtube.html">end of net neutrality in the US</a> meant that carriers such as AT&amp;T and Verizon were free to prioritize certain services at the expense of others.</p>



<p>Since becoming taking office in 2021, President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s administration has been trying to reverse that decision and restore net neutrality. Those efforts hit another snag this week when the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decided to block the government’s plans to reinstate rules that were in place before 2018.</p>

<p>After two years of massive layoffs at IT companies, 2024 was expected to be a year of recovery for the IT industry. While there are early signs of that, with global IT spending expected to increase 8% to cross $5.1 trillion in 2024 according to Gartner, jobs continue to be impacted in the sector. Some of the layoffs being seen this year are an extension of job cuts announced in 2023.</p>



<p>Last year, tech giants including Amazon, Cisco, Facebook parent company Meta, Microsoft, Google, IBM, SAP, and Salesforce—as well as many smaller companies —announced sweeping job cuts.</p>

<p>Intel is making a strategic shift toward AI as it grapples with significant financial difficulties, including an 85% year-on-year drop in second-quarter profit. The company has also announced that it’ll slash over 15,000 jobs as part of its effort to reallocate resources toward AI technology.</p>



<p>In light of ongoing financial struggles and escalating competition from AMD and Nvidia in the AI chip market, Intel is intensifying its investment in the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2138358/can-intels-new-chips-compete-with-nvidia-in-the-ai-universe.html">development of next-generation AI chips</a> and the expansion of its chip fabrication capabilities.</p>

<p>These days, a relatively clean and uncomplicated Windows 10 or 11 system disk might be home to more than 250,000 files and 90,000 folders. A more complex, application-heavy system disk might contain between half a million and a million files. My Windows 10 production PC has over 2.9M files and 750K folders, for example. My brand-new Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x Copilot+ PC has over 250K files and 55K folders. That’s a lot of stuff!</p>



<p>Indeed, all those files need not necessarily hang around. That’s why it’s a good idea to practice regular disk hygiene. This is exactly what is explained and explored here, with plenty of examples and screen shots to illustrate the cleanup process. Best of all, the t
