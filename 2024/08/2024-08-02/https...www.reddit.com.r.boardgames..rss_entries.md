<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I went into a coffee shop/board game lounge this morning and am very intrigued. My wife says she loves board games but honestly, we don’t have any. With kids 3 and 6, it’s been difficult to imagine them participating. Is there a recommended “starter” board game for our family that might hopefully get us hooked and diving deeper? We love the idea of family board games nights!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Matt_Shatt"> /u/Matt_Shatt </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eiozd1/good_board_game_for_young_beginner_family/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eiozd1/good_board_game_for_young_beginner_family/">[comments]</a></span>

## Can we discuss Abyss? Specifically the drawing locations part….

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I freaking love abyss! Have loved it for years. Always play with all expansions every damn time.</p> <p>2 players - 60 plays 3 players - 30 plays 4 players - 5 plays</p> <p>When you have 3 keys you look at the available locations and/or your draw 1, 2, 3, or 4 locations and choose.</p> <p>Why draw less than 4? I tangentially get that it creates more available locations for players to look at…. But it has an almost negligible impact on the game. Should you pay for each beyond 1? Or 2? A pearl? An ally? </p> <p>How do we make this more meaningful? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GrittyWillis"> /u/GrittyWillis </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eioull/can_we_discuss_abyss_specifically_the_drawing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eioull/can_we_discuss_abyss_specifically_the_drawing/">[comments]</a></span>

## In general, do you think BGA helps publishers sell more copies of physical games or makes them sell less copies?

I did my own tokens for Targi and honestly the clay ones also look like shit but at least it has a distinct feel compared to cardboard squares with an image of the resource on top.</p> <p>Games often use coins and they're difficult to recreate with clay. It has to be round, with some markings for the theme and value and look somewhat decent. That's difficult to do with zero arts and crafts skill and clay.

I'm new to this community and I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for me to post this in, but I'll give it a try.</p> <p>I've been watching the Paris Olympic Games and, by doing so, I've unlocked a memory of a board game I haven't played in probably around 14 years.</p> <p>This board game celebrated the 2008 Beijing Olympics. I believe it was a Johnson &amp; Johnson promotion, given to customers who bought a certain amount of their products. It had a unique aspect, in the way that the playing pieces were tiny little versions of Johnson &amp; Johnson products. It came in a small box, and I think the board itself resembled a running track.</p> <p>Another thing I think may be important to mention (due to certain regional promotions): this game was bought in Portugal. If my memory is accurate, I'd love to know if anyone else remembers or still has this board game. I've tried to find it online but haven't had any luck. The only clue

## Terraforming Mars - Which one and which expansion?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I am sorry if this may be a silly question, but it is 2 days that I am looking into Terraforming Mars and there is simply too much variety for me to understand as a new player.</p> <p>I first went (almost) straight to the OG <strong>Terraforming Mars</strong>, almost bought it when I read that in two players isn't probably the best experience, and I would play it almost always in two. I also read that &quot;Prelude&quot; can help two player games, but still better with more players. I am also seeing &quot;Prelude 2&quot; it is coming out, it is still for the OG TM?</p> <p>So keep reading, I found they made another game (that first I thought it was just another expansion) called <strong>Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition</strong> which seems better suited for few players and make for that exact purpose. I see two expansion for this, but I think the best suited it is &quot;Crisis&quot; as the other seems built for more players.</p

The box was properly shrink wrapped and a foam outer casing measured nicely in the box for a lovely tight but safe fit . Every single big box Kickstarter I’ve received has had either this level of care or some variation of it except one …. Frosthaven. My Frosthaven came in a cardboard box with extra card board for that tight fit but no shrink wrap just 2 of those circle stickers at the base to “reassure “ you it’s brand new . The lid was warped ( whether from moisture in shipment or from contents moving around I don’t know ) , and one of the side corners was split from top to bottom . Contacted cephalofair and they basic
