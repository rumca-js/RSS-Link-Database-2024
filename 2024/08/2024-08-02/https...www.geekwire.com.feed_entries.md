Sana broke ground on the 80,000 square-foot facility one year ago after switching from a site in Fremont, Calif. The Bothell facility will house Sana’s proprietary cancer drug program. The cell and gene therapy company plans to manufacture other drugs at the same site in the future. “To build a facility, you have to know your process,” said Sana CEO Steve Harr, “and to know your process&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/sana-biotechnology-cuts-the-ribbon-at-new-manufacturing-facility-near-seattle/">Read More</a>

AI2 Incubator, the Seattle-based startup organization and venture firm, revealed this week that it will operate and help fund the new center, billed as the &#8220;AI House.&#8221; The idea is to host a physical space for AI-related events and a place for founders, investors, researchers, and nonprofits to interact. Seattle has a ton of AI talent, but there&#8217;s not &#8220;a culture of talking about it, or gathering at events,&#8221; said Yifan Zhang, managing director at the AI2 Incubator.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ai-house-in-downtown-seattle-will-serve-as-a-hub-for-ai-startups-and-entrepreneurs/">Read More</a>

It&#8217;s not totally clear what can actually provide value to everyday work —&#160;but there are certainly some early signals of adoption. That was our takeaway after speaking with Seattle founders, investors, and innovators at the AI2 Incubator&#8216;s annual summer party on Thursday evening. The BBQ bash, hosted by the Seattle-based firm that invests and incubates AI-focused startups, was the perfect place to get a pulse on popular AI apps and services that folks are using.
