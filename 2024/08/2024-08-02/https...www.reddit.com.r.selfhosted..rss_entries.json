I need help deciding between DigitalOcean serverless and AWS Lambda.</p> <p>I've used DigitalOcean before and it's easy to work with, but I'm worried about handling high traffic since AWS offers triple the free usage. However, AWS seems more complex to set up.</p> <p>My team is comfortable with DigitalOcean but is open to learning AWS. We'll be using MongoDB Atlas for the database.</p> <p>Any advice on which platform to choose?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AdditionalPhase7804\"> /u/AdditionalPhase7804 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1eifryy/digital_ocean_vs_aws_serverless/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1eifryy/digital_ocean_vs_aws_serverless/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 965580, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1eifryy/digital_ocean_vs_aws_serverless", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Digital ocean vs aws serverless", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-02T16:33:02+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have a VPS but my provider does not have snapshots functionality. </p> <p>I have my files backed up to google drive so if my VPS breaks, I have to reinstall and restore files.

Essentially my kids reward and punishment system revolves around their allowance so being able to just ask Google to take 50 cents or add 1 dollar here and there would be really cool. If this does not exist any devs out there that want to make a freaking harry potter house cup system please do so it would be very cool.
