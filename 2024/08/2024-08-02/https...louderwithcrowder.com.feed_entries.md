Avoid the press until after her speech at the convention. Then hold a "press" "conference." Question one will be how enchanted it is to be the first Black woman running for president. Questions two and three will be lay-ups to attack Donald Trump. We might get a policy question around question five. Then the media will go back claiming anything she said prior to announcing she's running for president doesn't count. Why? On Thursday, three different clips made their way around X-Twitter showing why.</p><p>Like in 2017, wh

"But Brodigan, Khelif isn't trans. She's intersex, we think." The story was confusing at first, and still is. Since the media writes around issues like this so as not to get canceled over using a wrong pronoun, at first, it appeared as another example of a guy c
