Sana broke ground on the 80,000 square-foot facility one year ago after switching from a site in Fremont, Calif. The Bothell facility will house Sana\u2019s proprietary cancer drug program. The cell and gene therapy company plans to manufacture other drugs at the same site in the future. \u201cTo build a facility, you have to know your process,\u201d said Sana CEO Steve Harr, \u201cand to know your process&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/sana-biotechnology-cuts-the-ribbon-at-new-manufacturing-facility-near-seattle/\">Read More</a>", "id": 967727, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/sana-biotechnology-cuts-the-ribbon-at-new-manufacturing-facility-near-seattle", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Sana Biotechnology cuts the ribbon at new manufacturing facility near Seattle", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-02T19:26:49+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_2439-1260x840.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Plans are moving forward for a new hub in downtown Seattle focused on AI startups, with support from city and state leaders. AI2 Incubator, the Seattle-based startup organization and venture firm, revealed this week that it will operate and help fund the new center, billed as the &#8220;AI House.&#8221; The idea is to host a physical space for AI-related events and a place for founders, investors, researchers, and nonprofits to interact. Seattle has a ton of AI talent, but there&#8217;s not &#8220;a culture of talking about it, or gathering at events,&#8221; said Yifan Zhang, managing director at the AI2 Incubator.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ai-house-in-downtown-seattle-will-serve-as-a-hub-for-ai-startups-and-entrepreneurs/\">Read More</a>", "id": 966657, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ai-house-in-downtown-seattle-will-serve-as-a-hub-for-ai-startups-and-entrepreneurs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "\u2018AI House\u2019 in downtown Seattle will serve as a hub for AI startups and entrepreneurs", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-02T16:16:38+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Choi_2022_hi-res-download_4-750x500-1.jpg\" width=\"750\" /><br />Yejin Choi, who was named a 2022 MacArthur Fellow and one of Time&#8217;s Most Influential People in AI for her work in natural language processing, is leaving the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) in Seattle. She plans to move to California and continue working in the field. Her new position hasn&#8217;t been finalized. Her departure was announced internally at Ai2 and the UW Allen School of Computer Science &#38; Engineering over the past week.

It&#8217;s not totally clear what can actually provide value to everyday work \u2014&#160;but there are certainly some early signals of adoption. That was our takeaway after speaking with Seattle founders, investors, and innovators at the AI2 Incubator&#8216;s annual summer party on Thursday evening. The BBQ bash, hosted by the Seattle-based firm that invests and incubates AI-focused startups, was the perfect place to get a pulse on popular AI apps and services that folks are using.

Lots of people dream about building out a team, raising investment, going public, and becoming the next Facebook or Amazon or Microsoft. But the reality is that most startups fail, and the entrepreneurial journey can be excruciatingly difficult, lonely, and painful. Not everyone should make the startup leap. Longtime Seattle startup operators and investors, speaking at the Seattle Venture Day event on Thursday as part of Seattle Tech Week, were asked to give &#8220;brutally honest advice&#8221; that might make people think twice about launching a startup.
