The first edition was published in 1745\u20131746 in Lw\u00f3w (Lviv); the second edition was updated and expanded in 1754\u20131764.\nThe first part of the full title was: New Athens or the Academy full of all science, divided into subjects and classes, for the wise ones to record, for the idiots to learn, for the politicians to practice, for the melancholics to entertain issued...\nThe book uses the Polish language as the main text, and primarily Latin for the in-line references. Chmielowski also included anecdotes in the text, and tales about strange and exotic topics.\"\n\nMore on Wikipedia: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowe_Ateny\n\nJoin membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg/join\nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channe", "id": 966774, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2KO-qVmUMs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg", "source_obj__id": 447, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/N2KO-qVmUMs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Is This History's WORST or BEST Book? | Tales From the Bottle", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
