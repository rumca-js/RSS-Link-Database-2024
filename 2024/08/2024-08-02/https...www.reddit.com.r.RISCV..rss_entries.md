<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I recently obtained a Banana Pi BPI-F3 with a SpacemiT K1 chip, and I was curious how to tap into the power of the 2.0 TOPS NPU/AI Accelerator. I tried a few things, but I'm unsure if I'm using the NPU. My main goal is to run some small and simple language models on the board just to see how much I can accelerate the inference of said language model compared to standard CPU usage. I tried a few things.</p> <ol> <li><p>Compiling Ollama. I compiled Ollama with Clang 16 with O2 optimization, mllvm, auto-vectorization, and the RISC-V RVC 1.0 vectorization techniques enabled through march=. I know this probably won't directly affect model inference, but part of this was to also see if I could get auto-vectorization working. At the same time, I figured that optimizing the thing running the models could potentially help (even if marginally).</p></li> <li><p>ONNX inference.
