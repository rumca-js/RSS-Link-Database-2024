Poland's first encyclopedia is a pretty terrible encyclopedia, but it is funny!


"Nowe Ateny (New Athens) is the abbreviated title of the first Polish-language encyclopedia, authored by the 18th-century Polish priest Benedykt Joachim Chmielowski. The first edition was published in 1745–1746 in Lwów (Lviv); the second edition was updated and expanded in 1754–1764.
The first part of the full title was: New Athens or the Academy full of all science, divided into subjects and classes, for the wise ones to record, for the idiots to learn, for the politicians to practice, for the melancholics to entertain issued...
The book uses the Polish language as the main text, and primarily Latin for the in-line references. Chmielowski also included anecdotes in the text, and tales about strange and exotic topics."
