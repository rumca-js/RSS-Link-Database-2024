This means that your Python app can gain all the functionality that exists on your Operating System\n\nWe will also learn how to create custom Functions. Functions are basically small programs within your project. This allows you to write a routine once, and then simply call it later when you need it in the script.\n\nThe class will go over:\n- Sending Command to the Operating System\n- Receiving the results of Commands\n- Overview of Command Line apps you can access\n- Building custom functions\n- How function returns work", "id": 967775, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zl8vBkKAWQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCD4EOyXKjfDUhCI6jlOZZYQ", "source_obj__id": 102, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6Zl8vBkKAWQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Python: Custom Functions and OS Module", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
