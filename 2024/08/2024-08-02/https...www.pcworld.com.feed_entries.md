<p>These days, paying sticker price for games on Steam only makes sense in very specific cases. Most of the time, you’re better off waiting until a Steam Sale event hits—if you care about saving money, anyway.</p>



<p>But when is the next Steam Sale? How many of them are there each year? Here’s everything you need to know before you check out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-many-steam-sales-are-there-per-year">How many Steam Sales are there per year?</h2>



<p>There are usually<strong> four major Steam Sales every year</strong>, with one taking place in each quarter: a Spring Sale in spring, a Summer Sale in summer, an Autumn Sale in fall, and a Winter Sale in winter.</p>



<p>Those dates are usually fixed well ahead of time and they generally happen around the same time every year. But in between those dates, you’ll also see numerous smaller Steam

<p>Remember playing <em>Street Fighter</em> at the arcade as a kid, wishing for your own machine at home so you could play all day? Well, now that you have adult money, your wish can come true.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I have areas in my house where Wi-Fi just poofs out of existence. These Wi-Fi dead zones can be really annoying and they aren’t always easy to fix.</p>



<p>If you have Wi-Fi dead zones that can’t be fixed, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WiFi-6-Mesh-System-AX3000/dp/B09PRB1MZM" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">TP-Link Deco AX3000 mesh system is down to $170 right now on Amazon</a>—down from its original $280—and it might just be the solution you need.</p>



<p>The TP-Link Deco AX3000 is a mesh Wi-Fi system (also known as whole home Wi-Fi) that eliminates weak Wi-Fi signals and provides coverage of up to 6,500 square feet, which is likely far more than you actually need.</p>



<p>Mesh Wi-Fi performs better than traditional Wi-Fi boosters and range extenders at fixing dead zones. The end result? More stable Wi-Fi interne

<p>Rental services are everywhere now. If you can’t outright afford something pricey, you can usually find someone who will lend it to you for a monthly fee, whether it’s a home, a car, a couch, or a DVD.</p>



<p>So, maybe it’s not all that surprising that someone is now renting out full-fat gaming desktop PCs, but it <em>is</em> surprising to hear that that “someone” is case and accessory maker NZXT.</p>

## Intel extends Core chip warranty to soothe customers

<p>Intel has extended the warranty period on its 13th- and 14th-gen Core desktop chips for an extra two years, the company said late Thursday, in an attempt to reassure customers that they could buy with confidence.</p>



<p>Normally, Intel’s <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/13th-Gen-Limited-Warranty-Terms-and-Conditions.pdf">warranty terms</a> for its 13th- and 14th-gen Core processors cover three years. If you’ve purchased either a boxed processor or a system from a PC maker, Intel guarantees that that chip will conform to the company’s specifications and will be free from defect. Now they’re covered for five years total.</p>



<p>Why? Everything changed when problems were discovered with Intel’s latest Core chips, which suffered unexplained crashes and BSODs for months. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/240592

<p>Logitech’s vision of a “forever mouse” isn’t just a bad idea. It’s predatory, and a practice that’s not only bad for consumers but doesn’t even make sense as an actual product.</p>



<p>Here’s what’s going on. Recently, Logitech’s new chief executive Hanneke Faber <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206847/logitech-ceo-hanneke-faber-mouse-keyboard-gaming-decoder-podcast-interview">spoke</a> to The Verge’s Decoder podcast, where Faber mentioned that she’d recently been shown an example of a “forever mouse.” The idea, she said, was that you’d <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/452384/best-gaming-mice.html">buy a well-made mouse</a>, with great software and services that you’d constantly update, and never throw away.</p>



<p>That sounds great. But then the other shoe dropped: “The business model obviously is the challenge there,” she said. “So then software

<p>Intel’s 13th- and 14th-generation Core desktop CPUs have been the subject of controversy for months now, with instability and performance issues resulting in crashes and permanent damage for many users.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2368768/intel-denies-root-cause-found-for-cpu-instability-continues-to-investigate.html">Intel has been investigating the problem for a while</a> with regular promises of a fix, and we now know that all 13th- and 14th-generation Intel Core processors with a Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 65 watts or more can cause your PC to crash and blue screen.</p>



<p>According to Intel, the thermal and power protection mechanisms in the BIOS/UEFI were disabled by motherboard manufacturers at the factory to allow Core processors to run at high voltages and frequencies for extended periods of time, and this contributes to the
