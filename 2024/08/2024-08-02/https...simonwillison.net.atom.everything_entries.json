We had to pre-train models, post-train them to power the experiences that make Character.AI special, and build a product platform with the ability to reach users globally. Over the past two years, however, the landscape has shifted \u2013 many more pre-trained models are now available. Given these changes, we see an advantage in making greater use of third-party LLMs alongside our own. This allows us to devote even more resources to post-training and creating new product experiences for our growing user base.</p></blockquote><p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://blog.character.ai/our-next-phase-of-growth/\">Character.AI</a></p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/fine-tuning\"", "id": 967703, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/2/characterai/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Quoting Character.AI", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-02T18:15:28+00:00", "description": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15012\">Extracting Prompts by Inverting LLM Outputs</a></strong></p>\nNew paper from Meta research:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We consider the problem of language model inversion: given outputs of a language model, we seek to extract the prompt that generated these outputs.
