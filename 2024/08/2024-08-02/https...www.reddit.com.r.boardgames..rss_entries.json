I'm new to this community and I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for me to post this in, but I'll give it a try.</p> <p>I've been watching the Paris Olympic Games and, by doing so, I've unlocked a memory of a board game I haven't played in probably around 14 years.</p> <p>This board game celebrated the 2008 Beijing Olympics. I believe it was a Johnson &amp; Johnson promotion, given to customers who bought a certain amount of their products. It had a unique aspect, in the way that the playing pieces were tiny little versions of Johnson &amp; Johnson products. It came in a small box, and I think the board itself resembled a running track.</p> <p>Another thing I think may be important to mention (due to certain regional promotions): this game was bought in Portugal. If my memory is accurate, I'd love to know if anyone else remembers or still has this board game. I've tried to find it online but haven't had any luck.
