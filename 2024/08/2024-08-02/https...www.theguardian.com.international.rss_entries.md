<ul><li>French hero claims 200m medley in Olympic record</li><li>Duncan Scott gets silver, and Ben Proud second in 50m</li></ul><p>Once more final, one more gold, and one more Olympic record for Léon Marchand. This one was in the 200m individual medley, and when it was all over, in 1min 54.06sec, the roars carried far and wide across the city, even delaying the track races six miles away at the Stade de France because the cheering for him there was so loud. Back at the swimming, Marchand was all of a sudden so tired he could hardly raise an arm to celebrate. He hung on the lane divider, smiling, then finally hauled himself out of the pool to salute the crowd.</p><p>It was Marchand’s 11th race in six days, his fourth gold, and his fourth record. Great Britain’s Duncan Scott was closest to him, but truth be told that wasn’t very close at all. Scott won the ­silver in 1min 55.31sec. It was his eighth Olympic medal.

<p>The great American author and civil rights activist’s works offered prophetic warnings, generosity of spirit and clarity like no other when it came to race relations</p><p>2 August 2024 marks the centenary of James Baldwin’s birth, a good time for a renewed appreciation and celebration of this great American author and civil rights activist. From his early teenage years as a Pentecostal preacher, he possessed precocious oratorical skills that powerfully moved an audience in call and response, and when as a young man he left the pulpit, he carried his gifts with him, believing that religion would not suffice to create the needed change in race relations, but that his writing could.</p><p>***</p><p>If we do not now dare everything, the fulfilment of that prophecy, recreated from the Bible in song by a slave, is upon us: God gave Noah the rainbow sign, No more water, the fire next time!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/aug/02/where-to-start-with-james-baldwi
