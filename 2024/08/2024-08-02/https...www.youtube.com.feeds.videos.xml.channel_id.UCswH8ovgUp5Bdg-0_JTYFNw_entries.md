In this in-depth interview, Adam Carolla and I expose the authoritarian impulses behind COVID-19 lockdowns, the media's manipulation of COVID narratives, and the decline of meritocracy in entertainment. Carolla shares his scathing critique of California's governor Gavin Newsom, and how censorship of comedians has caused comedy to get EVEN more brash. This no-holds-barred conversation is a must-watch for anyone seeking to understand the forces shaping our turbulent times.
