<p>There are jokes! And a relationship you can genuinely get invested in! A couple of pleasing twists take place in Daryl’s French adventures – even if they’re largely predictable</p><p>An exhausted hero alone. A warehouse full of walkers! An injury, a narrow escape. Strangers! Tentative alliance! Treachery! Worse injury, unconsciousness. A silent observer setting up a plotline for later episodes. The hero waking up in a place of sanctuary so we can all catch our breaths for a moment. A true alliance formed. A quest begins.</p><p>Does it matter that I could have written this before watching the first episode of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon just as easily as I did after it? No, it does not. For that is the beauty and the asininity of the Walking Dead franchise. The Dixon spin-off is the latest to arrive on these shores, though it was one of the earlier ones to be produced, thanks to Daryl (Norman Reedus) being such a favourite with the fans, and has been out in the US for more than a

<p>Russian composer whose sparse musical landscapes create a spiritual ambience of meditative calm</p><p>Alexander Knaifel, who has died aged 80, did not set out to be a composer. As a student in the 1960s, he studied the cello with Mstislav Rostropovich until injury intervened. Then he redirected his energies towards composition, at a time when the Khrushchev thaw could accommodate the musical modernism of the Soviet Union’s second avant-garde period (the first having come in the years around the 1917 revolution).</p><p>But the cello retained a significant role in Knaifel’s output. Rostropovich went on to commission and premiere three religious works that reflected both Knaifel’s adoption of Russian Orthodox Christianity around 1970 and his conviction, which appealed to Rostropovich, that experience can be heightened by performers thinking – “silently intoning” – a text as they playe the music.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/aug/02/alexander-knaifel-obituary">Con

<p>Ibrox chief John Bennett says Rangers are ‘compelled to win’ but Brendan Rodgers’ side are superior on and off pitch</p><p>It took 15 minutes of a recent in-house interview for the Rangers chairman, John Bennett, to offer the kind of triumphalism people at the Ibrox should know by now to avoid. “This is a club that needs to win,” said Bennett. “That won’t change. Rangers is compelled to win.”</p><p>Bennett should brush up on his recent history. Rangers have one league title since 2011. Their League Cup record in the same period is identical. They have lifted the Scottish Cup once since 2009. Rangers still exist, still function, still have tens of thousands of season-ticket holders despite winning precious little. We are living in an era of Celtic domination in Scottish football. It is strange for someone of Bennett’s intelligence to trot out this tired mantra, because it will invite inevitable pressure from restless supporters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/arti

<p>The musician traces the story of her grandfather, from his life as a pianist and composer in Hungary to surviving the concentration camps in wartime Austria</p><p>Roxanne de Bastion’s family biography begins with a piano, old and weathered from decades of use. As a child, Roxanne knew it had been in the family for more than a century, but it wasn’t until her father died and she inherited the instrument – along with a treasure trove of old letters, photos, sheet music and cassette tapes – that she learned of its history. The piano, a baby grand Blüthner, had belonged to her late grandfather, a Hungarian Jew called Stephen de Bastion, who had worked as a composer and pianist in the 1930s. During the second world war, he was sent to a Russian labour camp, where he suffered horrifying abuse. From there, after being abandoned by his captors, he made the journey home on foot (of the 1,070 Jewish men sent there, eight made it home).</p><p>But that wasn’t the end of Stephen’s torment, sinc

<p>The Turkish teen is poised to achieve the landmark rating at September’s 193-nation chess Olympiad in Budapest</p><p>Yagiz Erdogmus is not yet a name in the same league as the quartet of Indian and Uzbek teenagers who have stormed into chess’s world top 10 during 2024, but the 13-year-old Turk is still among the most promising international talents, increasingly gaining plaudits for his dynamic classical style. He is also on a career path of early records which follows in the footsteps of Magnus Carlsen, Alireza Firouzja, Fabiano Caruana and others.</p><p>Erdogmus is already the ­youngest current grandmaster and the fourth youngest GM in ­history. He reached the verge of another significant milestone last week, when a strong performance in the Turkish League in Ankara advanced his Fide world ­rating to 2599, just below the 2600 level which traditionally marks a high class GM and which is roughly equivalent to a place in the world top 200 players.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardia
