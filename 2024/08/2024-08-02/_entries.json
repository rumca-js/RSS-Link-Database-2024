However, much of the research focuses on controlled datasets such as HumanEval, which fail to adequately represent how developers actually utilize LLMs' code generation capabilities or clarify the characteristics of LLM-generated code in real-world development scenarios. To bridge this gap, our study investigates the characteristics of LLM-generated code and its corresponding projects hosted on GitHub. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot are the most frequently utilized for generating code on GitHub. In contrast, there is very little code generated by other LLMs on GitHub. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code are often small and less known, led by individuals or small teams. Despite this, most projects are continuously evolving and improving.

manual notes. Creating notes manually is both time-consuming and stressful, especially when attempting to hold a conversation. Furthermore, even when done meticulously, manual notes often lack crucial context compared to hearing something first-hand.\nWe started Fathom to rid us of the tyranny of note-taking. With Fathom, you can let AI take on the drudgery of note-taking while you stay engaged in your human-to-human conversation.
