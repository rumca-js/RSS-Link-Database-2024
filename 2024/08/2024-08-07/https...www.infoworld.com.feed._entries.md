<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2336682/jdk-23-the-new-features-in-java-23.html">Java</a> application startup times would be improved by making classes of an application instantly available, under a proposal being floated in the OpenJDK community. </p>



<p>The JEP (JDK Enhancement Proposal) at <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/483">openjdk.org,</a> titled “Ahead-of-Time Class Loading & Linking,” would boost application startup speed by having these classes made available in a loaded and linked state when the HotSpot JVM starts. This would be achieved by monitoring the application during one run and storing loaded and linked forms of all classes in a cache for use in subsequent runs.

<p>In the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2520759/full-stack-development-with-react-and-spring-boot-part-1.html">first part of this tutorial</a>, we created a Todo application with a React front end and a Spring Boot back end. In the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3478086/full-stack-development-with-java-react-and-spring-boot-part-2.html">second part</a>, we added a local MongoDB instance for storage. Now we’ll move the application into a production environment using MongoDB Atlas, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335833/how-to-deploy-with-vercel-and-mongodb-atlas-without-even-trying.html">Vercel </a>for the React front end, and a Spring virtual machine to host the b

<p>With any mention of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a> and AI in general, we need to be clear that our goals should be to make people’s lives better, not just to cut costs. From my perspective, we need to focus on how this technology—and yes I view AI as an enabling technology, not a product—enables really smart people who have really stressful jobs. Namely systems administrators, site reliability engineers, enterprise architects, network admins, database admins, and others, sometimes collectively referred to as operations people. These are my people, so I will address their concerns.</p>
