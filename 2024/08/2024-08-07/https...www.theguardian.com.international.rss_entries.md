But it’s a pyrrhic victory for a losing cause</p><p>On Tuesday night, Representative Cori Bush lost in a Democratic primary election to challenger Wesley Bell, whose election campaign was overwhelmingly financed by pro-Israel groups such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac).

Ahead of the Olympics I spoke to Andy Hodge, one of our greatest rowers. He told me how, plagued by injury and illness, he battled to get to his third Games, in Rio. “Every day I was expecting my body to break,” he said, and this helped him come up with what he describes as a “relieving psychology”, which went like this: “Just keep going until your body breaks and when it does, you’ve given it a good shot.” Relieving? Hmm, if it’s got to the stage where the idea of breaking your body is affording you anything approximating relief, then you’re living in a world most of the rest of us don’t inhabit, and living a life few doctors could recommend. On the start line at Rio, Hodge said to himself: “I’m going to go and I’m going to actually break my body. This is the

Denise was an extraordinary competitor who won gold in the heptathlon at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, at a time when little was expected of GB athletes. But, 24 years later, she explained how horrendously she had been treated as a mum.</p><p>Denise described it as “a very lonely experience” because, after giving birth in 2002 to her daughter, Lauryn, she was told that her coaches and other support staff would only talk to her once she was back on “the performance pathway”. She was isolated and felt like “a performing animal with no heart and soul”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/07/team-gb-are-reaping-the-rewards-of-a-transformed-

<p>This elegant portrait of an expat couple’s day-to-day lives delves into the complexities of love, home and social expectations</p><p>Turkish author Ayşegül Savaş’s third novel is an erudite and elegant meditation on modern life and modern love. It opens with a moment of panic, when a married couple decide to start house-hunting. At this point, Asya and Manu have been living together in a foreign, unnamed city in a foreign, unnamed country for several years. We’re told by Asya, a documentary film-maker, that they first met at university, and back then were only “playing out our adulthoods rather than committing to them”. On weekends, they would leave the university campus to spend the day in town, among adults whose lives seemed at once real and unreal to them: “real, because that was how we imagined actual life in the abstract; unreal, because it did not seem we would ever be like them”. But now Asya worries that it’s time “<em>to make a life</em>, as some people called it”.</p><p>

I was just fascinated by that image.” But it was only with the arrival of Adam – a lonely mixed-race night worker in a fast-food outlet – that he found a character and a story capable of bringing the image to life, in what would become his debut feature film, Sky Peals.</p><p>At first, Adam seems like a textbook example of how not to create a movie protagonist.
