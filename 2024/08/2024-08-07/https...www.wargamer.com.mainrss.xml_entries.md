								<p>As more detailed information comes out about the new rules in the 2024 DnD Player&rsquo;s Handbook, the powergamers are getting stuck in, finding busted interactions and combos that will make DMs throw out their carefully balanced encounters in frustration, at least until the upgraded Monster Manual comes out in 2025 to level the playing field. &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/overpowered-weapon-mastery-nick">Continued</a></p>

								<p>The DnD 2024 Bard sings the same songs you know from fifth edition, but some of the tunes have markedly changed. Magical Secrets, Bardic Inspiration, and the Bard subclasses have all had a costume change for the 2024 Player&rsquo;s Handbook.

								<p>If the full version of Space Marine 2 sustains the quality in the latest preview build, it could be both a landmark third person shooter, and the best Warhammer 40k game ever made. This <strong>Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2</strong> preview is based on time with a prerelease build of the game, consisting of the 'Voidsong' campaign mission, and two of the PVE multiplayer ‘Operations’ missions.</p>

								<p>The <strong>Lego Batman Dark Knight Tumbler</strong> set harkens back to a simpler time. In 2005, way before the over-saturation of superhero movies, Christopher Nolan rebooted the Batman franchise. Understandably the second installment in the series, The Dark Knight has become a cult classic, and this set is an homage to one of the movie's most iconic aspects: the Batmobile.</p>
<p>It should be no surprise that the movie which holds an impressive 94% on Rotten Tomatoes also went on to inspire something that is not only one of the <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/batman-lego-sets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">best Batman Lego sets</a>, but one

								<p>The MTG card Experimental Confectioner has undergone a major 567% price spike in the past few weeks, boosted by new synergies. This Wilds of Eldraine card was exclusive to Jumpstart packs in the 2023 set.
