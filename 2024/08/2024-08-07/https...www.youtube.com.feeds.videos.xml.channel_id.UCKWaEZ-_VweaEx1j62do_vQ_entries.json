Explore our interactive demo \u2192 https://ibm.biz/BdKSby\nLearn more about the technology \u2192 https://ibm.biz/BdKSbM\n\nJoin Martin Keen as he explores Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), a crucial technique for refining AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs). Martin breaks down RLHF's components, including reinforcement learning, state space, action space, reward functions, and policy optimization. Learn how RLHF enhances AI by aligning its outputs with human values and preferences, while also addressing its limitations and the potential for future improvements like Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF).\n\nAI news moves fast.
