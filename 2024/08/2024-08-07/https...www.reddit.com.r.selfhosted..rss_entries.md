<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone. I created a 'self-hosted s3'-like service which can store files in buckets, which you can then download, rename, and delete. It supports presigned urls uploading (and thats basically the only way to upload right now) and it's entirely configurable using environment variables, which makes it very easy to automatically deploy this in some weird infrastructure.</p> <p>It's still in *very* early beta, but i'm looking for feedback to see how i can improve!</p> <p>It's made in Node (bun to be specific), but i provide prebuilt binaries for the lazys.</p> <p>You can try it out here: <a href="https://github.com/dandanthedev/littletinystorage">https://github.com/dandanthedev/littletinystorage</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Extension_Way5818"> /u/Extension_Way5818 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1emqbjg/littletinystorage_a_little_tiny_file_storage/">

Been working great. No problem for a while.</p> <p>Recently I learnt how using the myQnapCloud to access the NAS outside the house had a vulnerability to it, so, quickly research and installed Tailscale on my devices and NAS and setup my firewall to exclude all but my Tailscale IP's and Local Network (QuFirewalls &quot;include subnets only&quot; prebuilt profile + Tailscale IPs). Seems to work great, no issues within my personal network.</p> <p>The problem is that now I can no longer sync with my friends NAS via Syncthing. Syncthing is saying its unable to find connection to his Server.<br /> The solution to this when this happened to Syncthing breaking on my personal network was to put the Tailscale IP (100.xxx.xxx.xx) in the &quot;Addressess&quot; box as <code>tcp

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I normally use <a href="https://www.strong.app/">https://www.strong.app/</a> for tracking my workouts but I am looking for self hosted alternatives.</p> <p>I see Ryot (<a href="https://github.com/ignisda/ryot">https://github.com/ignisda/ryot</a>) has some potential but is it any good?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I use Apple Photos for managing my primary photo library, but I'm looking for a self-hosted software for well... memes. Memes and just photos that I want to keep, but don't really want clogging up my main library.</p> <p>For that reason I don't need Immich or anything with geotagging, facial recognition, or really anything with a lot of resource-indulgent overhead.</p> <p>Ideally also as a phone app available on iOS.</p> <p>Any ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kypsylano"> /u/Kypsylano </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ely4ad/basic_photo_management_software_for_a_meme_library/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ely4ad/basic_photo_management_software_for_a_meme_library/">[comments]</a></span>
