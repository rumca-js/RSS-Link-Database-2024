The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/apple-intelligences-secret-instructions-just-got-revealed-heres-what-they-reveal-about-the-ai-chatbot">screen captures of those instructions</a> provide a peek into Apple’s efforts to influence its GenAI deployment, and also illustrate the steep challenges in controlling an algorithm that is simply trying to guess answers. </p>



<p>The more explicit and contained an instruction, the easier it is for GenAI to understand and obey it. Therefore, some of the Apple instructions, such as “You prefer to use clauses in

<p>Hey Google: We need to talk.</p>



<p>As part of my admittedly unusual “job” (emphasis on the air quotes, ’cause it’s way too fun to feel like work!), I hear from some of the most passionate enthusiasts of your products every single day.

<p>And right now, El Googster, lemme tell ya: People aren’t too happy with what you’re got goin’ around Google Assistant and its ongoing devolution/kinda-sorta transition into Gemini.</p>
