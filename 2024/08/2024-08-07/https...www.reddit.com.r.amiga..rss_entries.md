<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have an NTSC Amiga 2000 and I swapped the agnus so I can use PAL mode with my Commodore 1080 monitor. Prior to the mod, I had a multisync Trinitron 15/25/31khz CRT that I had hooked up with an AGA-2000 flicker fixer but I took out the flicker fixer cuz I wasn't sure it would be safe to run it with the PAL agnus. I was wondering does anyone know if that flicker fixer would be safe to try in PAL? The link to the card below says there might be a PAL specific version. Would it be possible to convert it? </p> <p><a href="https://bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=374">https://bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=374</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Krackmayor"> /u/Krackmayor </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1emjgsa/aga2000_flicker_fixer_ntsc_to_pal/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1emjgsa/ag

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This PC game was released in May this year(yes, 2024). The graphic resolution is only 320x180. Yet, the rich color and lighting effects bring back the memory of Amiga games. Even the music. The game is only 32MB in size.
