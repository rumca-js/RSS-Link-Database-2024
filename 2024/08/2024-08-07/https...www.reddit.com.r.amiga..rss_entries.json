Prior to the mod, I had a multisync Trinitron 15/25/31khz CRT that I had hooked up with an AGA-2000 flicker fixer but I took out the flicker fixer cuz I wasn't sure it would be safe to run it with the PAL agnus. I was wondering does anyone know if that flicker fixer would be safe to try in PAL? The link to the card below says there might be a PAL specific version. Would it be possible to convert it? </p> <p><a href=\"https://bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=374\">https://bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=374</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Krackmayor\"> /u/Krackmayor </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1emjgsa/aga2000_flicker_fixer_ntsc_to_pal/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1emjgsa/ag", "id": 992873, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1emjgsa/aga2000_flicker_fixer_ntsc_to_pal", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/.rss", "source_obj__id": 458, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "AGA-2000 Flicker Fixer NTSC to PAL", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-07T15:59:59+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1emfl2s/is_the_secret_of_monkey_island_the_true_goat_or/\"> <img alt=\"Is The Secret of Monkey Island the true GOAT (or should that be three-headed monkey?) of the point-&amp;-click genre?
