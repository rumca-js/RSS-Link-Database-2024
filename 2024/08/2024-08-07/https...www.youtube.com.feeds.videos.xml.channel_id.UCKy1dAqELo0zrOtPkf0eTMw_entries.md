In today's Daily Fix:
Sony is admitting their sales numbers for the PS5 are down year-over-year, but it's not all bad news. Monthly active users are actually up (meaning the people that have PS5's are playing them a lot more), and according to Circana, the console market overall is holding strong. The Nintendo Switch is only a million or so units away from taking the PlayStation 2's crown as best-selling console of all time, and the Xbox Series consoles are keeping pace with the much-loved Xbox 360 in terms of sales. In other news, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor is heading to last-gen consoles, despite what was previously claimed that PS4 and Xbox One would not be able to handle it. And finally, fans of Prey and Dishonored should be quite pleased with the new game from Arkane Studios' co-founder.

What’s the state of House of the Dragon? After a pretty uneven House of the Dragon season 2: it may be leaning into some franchise pitfalls. After House of the Dragon season 2 episode 7, we could have headed into an epic battle! Alas House of the Dragon season 2 episode 8 did not go that way, and instead drew a line to the greater Game of Thrones George RR Martin-verse/IP. In this House of the Dragon Breakdown, we’re checking out where the series is pointing ahead and beyond just having that House of the Dragon ending explained. Did you expect something different for the finale following the events of House of the Dragon season 2 episode 7? Trailer footage hid the truth, obviously, of what would change the house of the dragon. Reaction from fans has been mixed, with some annoyed at what actually went down in House of the Dragon season 2 episode 8. Trailer shots indicated more from the Dance of Dragons, Rhaena, The Greens, The Blacks, and more; we should have predicted the Alicent and

## Disney Plus Password Sharing Crackdown Kicks Off in September 2024 - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

September is shaping up to be the month that Disney+ really cracks down on password sharing. On a recent Disney financial call, CEO Bob Iger confirmed they would still be implementing this business tactic, and gave some details about why: “We started our password sharing initiative in June. That kicks in, in earnest, in September. By the way, we've had no backlash at all to the notifications that have gone out and to the work that we've already been doing.” Not sure what type of backlash he was expecting - the best way to protest this in subscriber’s eyes is likely to cancel their subscriptions. But Disney’s streaming business apparently made a profit for the first time this quarter, so not sure what the numbers are in that regard. But with this news, Disney also plans to increase its ad free subscription, doubling in price from what it was  when it launched in 2019. Ad free will be $15.99 come October 17th.
