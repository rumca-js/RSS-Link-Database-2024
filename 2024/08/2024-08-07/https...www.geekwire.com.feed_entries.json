VCsforKamala, a pledge initiative created last week by Seattle-based investor Leslie Feinzaig, hosted a video-conferencing call on Wednesday to encourage donations and to discuss how a Harris presidency would boost innovation in America. Feinzaig, founder of Seattle venture firm Graham &#38; Walker, launched VCsforKamala in response to recent\u00a0support for Donald Trump\u00a0from deep-pocketed entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen \u2014 a trend that sparked\u00a0intense political debate\u00a0across the tech industry. \u201cI felt the&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/vcsforkamala-jumps-on-zoom-fundrai", "id": 994340, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/vcsforkamala-jumps-on-zoom-fundraising-trend-hosts-call-with-investors-and-techies", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "\u2018VCsforKamala\u2019 jumps on Zoom fundraising trend, hosts call with investors and techies", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-07T22:24:59+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"949\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/limeglider1-1260x949.jpeg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />I&#8217;ve had some scary wobbles riding scooters on some of Seattle&#8217;s less-than-smooth roadways. Thankfully I&#8217;ve never hit the pavement. But during a test ride Wednesday, I may have fallen for Lime&#8217;s latest electric micromobility device.

The closures inside the 3-year-old Amazon Orland Delivery Station reflect broader tensions between the tech giant and the business owners and drivers responsible for getting its packages to porches and doorsteps around the world. Beacon Logistics notified the California Employment Development Department on June 11 that it would be ceasing operations at Amazon Orland facility, laying off 91 employees, according to public records.

Hundreds of people are converging on Seattle this week to consider that question at the annual convention of the Mars Society.

It&#8217;s a clever solution for roadside charging. It keeps walkways clear and perhaps even more importantly, it safeguards the cables from thieves searching for the copper contained in EV charging cables. But there&#8217;s one problem with the fix. Only the slower-charging cables can be coiled and retracted. The technology doesn&#8217;t work for the stiffer cables at fast charging stations that contain more copper and are being stolen citywide, leaving EV drivers&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-searching-for-solutions-to-charging-cable-thefts-while-meeting-ev-driver-demand/\">Read More</a>", "id": 991496, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-searching-for-solutions-to-charging-cable-thefts-while-meeting-ev-driver-demand", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Seattle searching for solutions to charging cable thefts while meeting EV driver demand", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
