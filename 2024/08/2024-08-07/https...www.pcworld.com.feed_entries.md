<p>Just because you’ve switched to Windows 11 doesn’t mean you have to say goodbye to the familiar look of Windows 10. You can have the benefits of Windows 11 without giving up the old look, which is great if you think the old look is more appealing.</p>

<p>The other day, I sent my dad—who’s old enough to remember programming computers with punch cards—a photo of a two-terabyte M.2 drive. He replied: “The first Burroughs 5700 mainframe I worked on had a two-<strong>mega</strong>byte drive about the size of two washing machines.”</p>



<p>Well, according to Western Digital, next Christmas I might be able to send him a tiny SSD with literally <em>eight million times</em> as much storage.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koesW3xMKtY">immortal words of Weird Al Yankovic</a>, “You dig giant robots, I dig giant robots, we dig giant robots, chicks dig giant robots.” With apologies to said chicks for unnecessary specificity, there’s no better way to enjoy giant robots than in video game form. And one of the best giant robot games ever made, <em>Titanfall 2</em>, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1237970/Titanfall_2/">on sale today for just three greenbacks</a>. </p>



<p>I’ve <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1501165/an-eulogy-for-titanfall-a-shooter-series-that-deserved-better.html">poured out my love for this game</a> and its predecessor before, bemoaning the fact the publisher EA and developer Respawn seem to have abandoned it in favor of Star Wars and battle royale.

<p>The passage of time is hard on computer parts. Sometimes it’s about how much they wear down over time; other times, it’s the fact that older parts get set aside and forgotten, only to be left behind by time.</p>



<p>For instance, it may seem like PCIe 4.0 just arrived to supercharge NVMe SSD speeds, but that was in 2018! We’ve already moved on to PCIe 5.0, with PCIe 6.0 devices still on their way and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2287853/pcie-7-0s-first-draft-could-arrive-in-2025-at-up-to-512gb-s.html">PCIe 7.0 slated for 2025</a>.</p>



<p>So, it’s not uncommon to upgrade PC parts—and when you do, you have to figure out what to do with those components you’ve retired.</p>



<p>If you have an older SSD or HDD taking up space in storage and you don’t know what to do with it, here are a few ways you can get more mileage out of it without throwing it

<p>It’s easy to spend a lot of money on a laptop, but you don’t <em>have</em> to. In fact, most people don’t need to spend much at all. Whether you’re on a budget or you’re buying for a student or child, sometimes the best laptop is the one that’s most affordable.</p>



<p>But just because you’re <em>spending</em> less doesn’t mean you should <em>settle for</em> less. To make sure your laptop won’t leave you frustrated and pulling your hair out, there are a few key specs that you shouldn’t compromise on—or else you’ll probably regret your purchase.</p>



<p>What counts as a budget laptop?

<p>AMD confirmed today that prices for its next-gen Ryzen 9000 desktop processors, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2415611/best-buy-leaks-ryzen-9000-prices-and-theyre-cheaper-than-expected.html">previously leaked by Best Buy</a>, are accurate. Surprisingly, these prices represent a decrease relative to the prior generation.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/AMDRyzen/status/1820956835794358451?s=19">An official X/Twitter post</a> says that the Ryzen 7 9700X will be priced at $359 (down $40 from its previous Ryzen 7 7700X) and the Ryzen 5 9600X will be priced at $279 (down $20 from its previous Ryzen 5 7600X). They’re hitting the streets August 8.</p>



<p>Following a week later on August 15th will be the Ryzen 9 9950X, $649, and the Ryzen 7 9900X, $499. Those are cheaper than their 7000-series models by $50 each. While not as low as the initial Best Buy leak
