<p>This police drama’s at its best when it does bold, dastardly action, with Dougray Scott every bit as compelling a lead as Idris Elba. Shame about the more po-faced scenes …</p><p>Many elements of Irvine Welsh’s Crime are extremely old school. Its fashionably tailored lead, Ray Lennox, is a grizzled detective with substance abuse issues (played with brooding intensity by Dougray Scott). Mysterious characters from his past may be the key to solving the case. We meet corrupt, powerful figures, who have ties to a criminal underbelly, and an understanding therapist who helps him to cope with the grotesque crimes in the shadowy streets of urban sprawl.</p><p>The second series, which is also based on Welsh’s novel of the same name, opens with Lennox back on the beat after a breakdown that was a result of last season’s events and his pursuit of “Mr Confectioner”. He is now struggling to stay sober – which is made increasingly difficult given that a new killer is castrating victims before c

I found such performative virtue signalling counterproductive and divisive.

To understand the significance of this toppled statue, we need to make sense of how the country got to this point.</p><p>In 1947, Pakistan comprised two territories: West Pakistan (now Pakistan) and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). A chasm opened up between the two halves, driven in part by linguistic difference (Urdu was the national language, despite East Pakistan speaking Bengali).

As we begin, Ward takes the role of the trans woman in question, while Cowgill plays Greer. We compare their adornments: red lips, blond extensions and silk gown versus pearls, tight curls and the modern uniform of Greer’s intellectual descendants, the “adult human female” T-shirt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/aug/07/ugly-sisters-review-germaine-greer-underbelly-cowgate

<p>Harris has chosen someone from and of the midwest and someone who is no ‘hillbilly’ with fluid values</p><p>Vice-President Kamala Harris has selected the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, as her running mate and this big decision reflects more conventional history than inside-the-DC-beltway convention wisdom. While pundits focused mainly on which possible choice could help her ticket win a battleground state, their focus was on either Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes) or Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona (11 electoral votes). In this hotly competitive race, either selection made good sense in the scramble for a majority of the electoral college.</p><p>But we have to go back to 1960 when the young Massachusetts senator John Kennedy picked the Texas senator and majority leader, Lyndon Johnson, to be his running mate to find the last time selecting a candidate who actually brought a state with him was the dominant concern. Johnson and Kennedy hated each other but the

<p>This ambitious, multi-perspective novel about the politics and preciousness of water ranges from ancient Mesopotamia to contemporary London</p><p>As water scarcity grows, sea levels rise around the world and scandals over the illegal dumping of sewage into our rivers and&nbsp;seas continue, a novel about the politics and preciousness of water is timely.
