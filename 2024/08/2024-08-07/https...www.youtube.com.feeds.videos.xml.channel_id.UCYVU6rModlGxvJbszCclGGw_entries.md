If you have an understanding of privacy you will have this internal battle of wanting to connect with friends and family on dangerous social media platforms vs. staying away but feeling alone and ostracized.

In this video, I'll discuss the limited things you can do if you do in fact install Whatsapp, Instagram and Linkedin. These are very dangerous platforms and are specifically identified because they are "real identity" sites where your identity is determined to be accurate.

If you want to use these platforms, you can but with some pretty difficult procedures and limitations. If you do not want to use these platforms, this video will actually make it apparent to you why you're not missing anything and are saving yourself.
