Xu Bing's "Book from the Ground: from point to point" is written entirely with pictograms. This copy is actually my wife's book -- she owned it before we met. When I first saw it, I was amazed by how easy it was to read and by how much your imagination had to get involved! I wonder how different the story is to different minds... In researching the book, I learned about Xu Bing's other art works, including "Book From The Sky." I also reccomend looking up "Introduction to Square-Word Calligraphy" and "Dragonfly Eyes."
