Additionally, the powers that be are the ones who deem what is hateful and what is permissible. And in the progressive pursuit of La La Land, law-abiding citizens are turned into criminals for thought crimes, whether that is what they intended or not. </p>
<p>The UK has lost its mind and has announced that authorities will start rounding up people who retweet something the government does not like. </p><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">BREAKING: UK authorities will round up and charge citizens who RETWEET any material deemed as "inciting hatred" <a href="https://t.co/p2j0nazREc">pic.twitter.com/p2j0nazREc</a><br />— End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) <a href="https://twitter.com/EndWok

<p>So while the Harris campaign has just vowed to trash the Second Amendment, JD Vance called out Tim Walz for lying about his military service and abandoning his troops. </p><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">You know what really bothers me about Tim Walz?<br /><br />When the US Marine Corps asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. <br /><br />When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.

<p>Who would have guessed that one of the most radical Democrats in Congress would become even more radical when things don’t go her way? </p>
<p>Radical Squad Democrat Cori Bush<a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-far-left-progressive-rep-cori-bush-loses-missouri-dem-primary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u> lost her primary</u></a> last night in a landslide vote. However, rather than respect the democratic process and maturely accept defeat, she has become even more unhinged and has warned voters they should be afraid for daring to second-guess her. However, in the same breath, she also threatened to “tear down” the pro-Israel group AIPAC which spent $9 million to campaign against her. </p><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-twee

<p>Harris claimed the economy would thrive under her administration by “bringing down costs” and every American would own a home. However, she failed to elaborate that she is “bringing down costs” as a result of her being the second most powerful person in the world, but in the same breath, implies it has everything to do with “price gouging.” </p>
<p>“[She’s] campaigning against herself,” Crowder said. “They can’t run on a policy platform so they just projec
