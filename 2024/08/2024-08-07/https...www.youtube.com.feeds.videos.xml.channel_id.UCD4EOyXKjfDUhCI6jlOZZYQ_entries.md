Bro... Do you even API???

ChatGPT is a great tool, but you're locked into the interface that OpenAI gives you. With the OpenAI API you get the power of ChatGPT but can build your own tools and systems using Python to extract the power of AI.

You can create a script to scrape and extract value from your own data, use AI to to make it more natural to "talk" with your systems, and build services with your own guard rails for your users.

OpenAI provides amazing functionality to make your scripts and systems do some very remarkable things. It's not actually "AI", but it's still darned cool and amazing...

The class will go over:
- Overview of the OpenAI API account
- Pricing and overview of models
- How to crea
