<p>We are excited to announce the continuation of Seth Larsonâ€™s work in the Security Developer-in-Residence role through the end of 2024 thanks to continued support from <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev">Alpha-Omega</a>. (This six month extension is intended to align the renewal period for this role with the calendar year going forward).<br /></p><p>The first year of the Security Developer-in-Residence initiative has been a success, seeing multiple improvements to the Python ecosystem's security posture. These improvements include <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/08/psf-authorized-as-cna.html">authorizing the PSF as a CVE Numbering Authority</a>, migrating the CPython release process <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-33">to an isolated hosted build platform</a>, and <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/software-bill-of-materials-now-available-for-cpython.html">generating comprehensive Software Bill-of-Materials documents<
