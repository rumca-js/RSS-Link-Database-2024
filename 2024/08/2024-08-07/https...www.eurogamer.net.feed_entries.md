Eli Roth's Borderlands movie is nearly here, and early impressions are starting to trickle in - and, well, they're not <em>great</em>. Critics have taken to social media to brand the live-action film adaptation of Gearbox's looter-shooter everything from a "huge misfire" to a "disaster".
</p><p>
The Borderlands movie has, of course, been in the works for some time now. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-in-the-works">initially announced</a> back in 2015 before utterly vanishing in a puff of elongated silence. Then, just as it looked like the project was dead and buried, Gearbox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hostel-director-eli-roth-is-helming-the-borderlands-movie">re-announced it</a> in February 2020, this time with Hostel director Eli Roth at the helm.

Since then, the high-profile likes

Ready at Dawn - the studio behind the likes of Lone Echo and The Order: 1886 - has reportedly been shut down by its currently owner, Meta, after over two decades of operation. The news follows heavy job cuts at the studio last year.
</p><p>
Ready at Dawn Studios was founded in 2003 by former members of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> and Blizzard, and was initially known for its work adapting Sony's Daxter and God of War franchises for the PlayStation Portable. In 2015, its first original game, The Order: 1886, released to mixed reviews on PS4, and the company would later shift its focus to VR.
</p><p>
Its first VR project was 2017's acclaimed sci-fi adventure Lone Echo, followed by standalone multiplayer spin-off Echo VR (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meta-and-ready-at-dawn-to-

Epic Games has announced it's ditching a long-standing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> promise that Battle Pass items will never be made available to buy at a later date - although it's implementing an 18-month wait period before items can appear in its in-game shop.
</p><p>
It's a rule Epic has been accused of breaking before, specifically when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-fans-furious-summer-drift-style-being-sold">released a beachwear version of Fortnite's season 5 poster boy Drift</a> for purchase in 2019 - but the practice of releasing paid variants of previous Battle Pass characters has become commonplace in the years since.
</p><p>
Now, though, Epic is ditching the rule entirely so that any previous Battle Pass item can be sold in the Fortnite Shop, provided 18 months have pa

Exactly one year (and four days) after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s version 1.0 release, developer Larian is celebrating the highly acclaimed RPG's first anniversary by releasing a whole bunch of revealing players stats. Which, among other things, confirm that 30 percent of the 30 percent of players who opted to sex Halsin sexed Halsin in bear form.
</p><p>
Larian's <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1821186927779004770">newly unveiled birthday stats</a> get pretty granular, and I'll be glossing over the spoiler-y ones here (as well as the ones that mean absolutely nothing to me because I'm still prancing round the crash site right at the start desperately wishing I had more time to play).

Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-takes-you-on-a-tour-of-its-hyrule">Nintendo released a fresh trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, that's due out next month.
</p><p>
The game stars the titular princess in the leading role for the first time and includes a new Echo mechanic, where Zelda can essentially copy and paste elements from the world to explore and solve puzzles.
</p><p>
The new trailer focused on giving a tour of Hyrule, showing off its various regions, and the new power Bind that allows Zelda to attach herself to (and move with) objects and enemies.

Today we're looking at the first two processors, the six-core 9600X at &pound;269/$279 and eight-core 9700X at &pound;339/$359.

This is one of those franchises where the brand itself becomes the thing some fans want to play: it must be grim, it must be dark, it must have sufficient gore, and must have both recognisable nods and oblique references that adhere strictly to our "Core Brand Values". Also, I suppose, there should be a video game in there somewhere.</p><p>Worry not though, any fan-Inquisitors in the audience: in the slice of Space Marine 2 I played, I ran more or less the entire gamut of 40K-isms within the first couple minutes - and admittedly, I think that's brilliant. Your squad of Space Marines bicker about treachery and point fingers over presumed betrayals of the Empire, before unloading from their transport into a vast, embattl

This is Nintendo's fault, inevitably. Super Mario Bros, sure. But then when the Super Famicom came around, they threw Super into almost every game that came out. It remains the easiest upgrade pitch of all time, and the most intoxicating. Why do I need to buy these games again? Because now they're <em>super</em>.</p><p>Anyway. Super Dungeon Muncher had me at "Super". But it also had me at "Dungeon Muncher". A dungeon crawler where you have to move fast to keep ahead of the fact that a monster is eating the actual dungeon? Yes please. What an easy sell. Or rather, what a magnificent pitch.</p><p>The game is currently fun and moreish rather than truly magnificent in the playing of it, admittedly, bu

## UK actors' union Equity introduces minimum rates to address "systemic low pay" for video game performers

Equity, the UK actors' union, has introduced new minimum rates in a bid to address "systemic low pay" for performers and improve working conditions in the industry.
</p><p>
Pay for actors in the UK has not only stagnated beneath inflation rates, but has been significantly lower than in America and Canada despite working with the same game developers.
</p><p>
The new rates are solely intended for AAA game development, rather than indie developers. Further, they are minimum fees as a starting point for negotiation.

</p><p>
According to its latest financial report, Sega's net sales for video games increased by 34 percent, leading to a huge rise in profits.
</p><p>
It attributes this increase in part to the inclusion of Rovio, along with the release of Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance in the most recent quarter.
