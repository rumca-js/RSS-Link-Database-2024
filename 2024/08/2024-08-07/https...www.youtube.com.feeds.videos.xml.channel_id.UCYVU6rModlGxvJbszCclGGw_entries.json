These are very dangerous platforms and are specifically identified because they are \"real identity\" sites where your identity is determined to be accurate.\n\nIf you want to use these platforms, you can but with some pretty difficult procedures and limitations. If you do not want to use these platforms, this video will actually make it apparent to you why you're not missing anything and are saving yourself.\n\n\n-----------------------------------\nBrax Virtual Phone, De-Googled Phones, BytzVPN, BraxMail, BraxRouters are available on https://brax.me.
