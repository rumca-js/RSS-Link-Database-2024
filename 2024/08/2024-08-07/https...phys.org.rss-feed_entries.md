This is roughly equivalent to the width of a hair split into 10,000 strands. Their new method was published in Nature Photonics.

A seismic shift occurred in astronomy during the Scientific Revolution, beginning with 16th-century polymath Copernicus and his proposal that the Earth revolved around the sun. By the 17th century, famed engineer and astronomer Galileo Galilei refined Copernicus' heliocentric model using observations made with telescopes he built himself. However, it was not until Kepler's observations that the planets followed elliptical orbits around the sun (rather than circular orbits) that astronomical models matched observations of the heavens completely.

This is precisely why magnetometers—devices used to measure magnetic fields—are flown on almost all missions in space to benefit the Earth, planetary, and heliophysics science communities, and ultimately enrich knowledge for all humankind.
