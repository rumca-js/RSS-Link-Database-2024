This copy is actually my wife's book -- she owned it before we met. When I first saw it, I was amazed by how easy it was to read and by how much your imagination had to get involved! I wonder how different the story is to different minds... In researching the book, I learned about Xu Bing's other art works, including \"Book From The Sky.\" I also reccomend looking up \"Introduction to Square-Word Calligraphy\" and \"Dragonfly Eyes.\"", "id": 994107, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoY0InCTRlg", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC6nSFpj9HTCZ5t-N3Rm3-HA", "source_obj__id": 383, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/PoY0InCTRlg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "A Book With No Words", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
