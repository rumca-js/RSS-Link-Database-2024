<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to preface that I am pretty new to the &quot;scene&quot;, I am still learning lots, very much a newbie. </p> <p>I was watching this talk the other day: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9jvLsvkmdM">https://youtu.be/L9jvLsvkmdM</a></p> <p>And there were a couple of comments criticizing RISC-V that I'd like to highlight, and understand if they are real downsides or misunderstandings by the commenter. </p> <p>1- In the beginning, the presenter compares the instruction size of ARM and RISC-V, but one comment mentions that it only covers the &quot;I&quot; extension, and that for comparable functionality and performance, you'd need at least &quot;G&quot; (and maybe more), which significantly increases the amount of instructions. Does this sound like a fair argument?</p> <p>2- The presenter talks about Macro-Op Fusion (TBH I didnt fully get it), but one comment mentions that this would shift the burden of optimization, because you'd have to have clever trick

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I've been trying to simulate the vector crypto zvbc instructions on spike but struggling with what the vector operands should be according to the LMUL or EMUL. For example the vclmul.vv instruction is not working for any other then LMUL = 1. Now I don't know whether it is only reserved for LMUL=1 or if I am writing the wrong operands because I can't find anything related to it specifically stated in the vector crypto spec. Can anyone help me by referring me to parts of the spec I am missing to know about this?</p> <p>Please note that I am not overlapping vector operands</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Few-Employment-1462"> /u/Few-Employment-1462 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1em6hac/riscv_vector_crypto_extension/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1em6hac/riscv_vector_crypto_extension/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Latest Advancements of RISC-V Architecture in the software ecology. Looks promising!</p> <p>As we all know, at the early stage of the development of a new instruction set architecture, it often adopts the method of compatibility with software of other architectures to expand its own ecosystem, such as Apple’s Rosetta 2 and Microsoft’s Arm64EC, which both run the X86 architecture software on top of the ARM architecture system.</p> <p>As an emerging instruction set architecture, RISC-V is in dire need of rapid development and expansion of its software ecosystem. To this end, openKylin community RISC-V SIG has actively carried out binary translation and participated in the development of the open source project box64. Up to now, it has submitted and merged more than 20 PRs, added GTK3, nettle and other dynamic libraries and function packaging, improved the RISC-V dynamic recompile module and other functions, and contributed more than 2,000 lines of code
