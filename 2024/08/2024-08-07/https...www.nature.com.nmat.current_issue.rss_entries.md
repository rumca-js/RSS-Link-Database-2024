<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 07 August 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01970-5">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01970-5</a></p>Both reusability and sensing capability of biosensors are required but usually challenging to achieve. Here a reusable and highly sensitive epidermal growth factor receptor sensor based on a drug-mediated organic electrochemical transistor is reported.
