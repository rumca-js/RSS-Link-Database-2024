Deathbound is a new Souls-inspired action RPG that puts players in the shoes of up to four distinct characters at the same time. The game features a combat system that heavily encourages switching between your characters all the time, and each character comes equipped with their own fancy gear, attacks, and special abilities. 

All of this is paired up with one of the most fun combat systems in the genre, which encourages fast-paced action and an aggressive playstyle over the more defensive style that Soulslike games are known for.

Game Science's Black Myth: Wukong launches on August 20th for PS5 and PC, following six years of development and nearly four years after its first trailer dropped. Since it wowed players with its gorgeous visuals and tight combat all those years ago, the hype has only grown further.

As the developer revealed more gameplay, it became clear that the title is not a Souls-like or even a full-blown open-world game but a linear experience emphasizing boss fights. The term "boss rush" is used to coin such titles, and it's not exactly new. However, there's been some back-and-forth discussion on that tag for Black Myth: Wukong.

Some argue it's not a boss rush, as if the term is taboo, while others express hesitation over purchasing since it may not meet their expectations. Either way, here's why it's a good approach for the title.
