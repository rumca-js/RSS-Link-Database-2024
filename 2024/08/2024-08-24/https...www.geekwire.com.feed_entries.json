Starliner, which has been in the midst of its first crewed flight after years of delay, will be reprogrammed to make an uncrewed departure from the space station next month. Top mission managers said today that they decided unanimously to make a dramatic change in what was originally expected to be a test flight lasting only&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/nasa-says-boeing-starliner-craft-will-land-empty-with-its-crew-returning-months-later/\">Read More</a>", "id": 1054246, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/nasa-says-boeing-starliner-craft-will-land-empty-with-its-crew-returning-months-later", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "NASA says Boeing Starliner craft will land empty, with its crew returning months later", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-24T20:11:02+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"starbucks\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"952\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/starbucksHQ-1260x952.jpeg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Starbucks is taking some heat for its decision to set up a remote office for its new CEO. GeekWire earlier this month reported on a hybrid work arrangement for Brian Niccol, the former Chipotle CEO who was tapped to lead the struggling Seattle coffee giant. The arrangement, revealed in a regulatory filing, doesn&#8217;t require Niccol to be based at the company&#8217;s Seattle headquarters and creates a new remote office in Newport Beach, Calif., where he currently resides. Starbucks says the Seattle HQ will be Niccol&#8217;s primary office, and he&#8217;ll still be required to follow the company&#8217;s hybrid work policy, which&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/hybrid-policy-for-new-starbucks-ceo-sparks-debate-over-remote-work-corporate-jet-emissions/\">Read More</a>", "id": 1053398, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/hybrid-policy-for-new-starbucks-ceo-sparks-debate-over-remote-work-corporate-jet-emissions", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Hybrid policy for new Starbucks CEO sparks debate over remote work, corporate jet emissions", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-24T15:56:06+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/zengence_cover_landscape_2560x1440-1260x709.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />At first glance, Deepwell DTX\u2019s Zengence (pronounced like \u201cvengeance\u201d) is what video game fans might call a rail shooter. At the start of the game, you\u2019re sent down a one-way path that\u2019s lined with hostile \u201cWraiths,\u201d but they\u2019re initially invisible. To reveal the Wraiths, you use your VR headset\u2019s microphone to conduct what\u2019s essentially a rhythmic breathing exercise with an audible hum, in time with Zengence\u2019s music. When you do so on the beat, you send out a magical orb that breaks the Wraiths\u2019 concealment. That\u2019s when you can start a fight, using the crystalline pistols your avatar holds in&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/this-virtual-reality-game-encourages-rhythmic-breathing-to-help-with-mental-health/\">Read More</a>", "id": 1053399, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/this-virtual-reality-game-encourages-rhythmic-breathing-to-help-with-mental-health", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "This virtual reality game encourages rhythmic breathing to help with mental health", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-24T13:30:00+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"544\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/album-art.png\" width=\"894\" /><br />For a while now, we&#8217;ve been doing an occasional GeekWire Podcast segment called &#8220;My AI,&#8221; about the latest AI tools grabbing my attention and changing the way I work. But we&#8217;ve been missing a fun musical intro or jingle for the &#8220;My AI&#8221; segment that would really solidify its place on the show. My colleague John Cook&#8217;s attempts to improvise a &#8220;My AI&#8221; theme song don&#8217;t really count, as he would readily admit. So naturally, we asked ourselves, could AI solve this problem? We quickly discovered that the answer was yes.
