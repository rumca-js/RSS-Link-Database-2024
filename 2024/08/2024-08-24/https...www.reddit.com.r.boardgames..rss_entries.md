<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The category was clothing, for reference mini skirt and mini dress were accepted for the letter m.</p> <p>we were later on the letter i and itsy bitsy teeny weeny yellow polka dot bikini was put.</p> <p>We said that it should be allowed as itsy bitsy means very small and so does the word mini. The item for m was the skirt but was accepted on the adjective mini. Itsy bitsy is a synonym for the word mini (meaning they have the same meaning) so was accepted by the size of the skirt and no the skirt itself. So we believe that Itsy bitsy teeny weeny yellow polka dot bikini should be accepted as it is also being categorized by the size of the bikini and not the bikini itself.</p> <p>Furthermore, another argument was that a mini skirt is used as a description on websites but if you go on boo hoo and and search up itsy witsy bikini they come up and on their description say itsy witsy.</p> <p>what do you think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is something about 2 player games that feels just right.<br /> I think it has to do with the fact that the designer chooses to stick to that player count, hence being able to streamline and make the best design without having to give up game quality to make it playable with more players.</p> <p>Smaller games like Watergate, Radlands, Air land and Sea, Blietzkrieg or Sky Team feel so clean and engaging. I think also the lower count allows you to be interested in whats going on be it your turn or not.</p> <p>But bigger games like Star Wars: Rebellion, Twilight Struggle, War of the Ring or Stronghold also handle the asymetry and the game design superbly.</p> <p>Not to mention some 2 player versions of multiplayer games like 7 Wonder Duel, Splendor Duel or Codenames Duet, which I enjoy way more than their original version.</p> <p>And then there are games that once I have tried them at 2 I am reluctant to play with more players. 51st State, Res Arcan

We have quite a variety of people come from younger kids around 10, to older people in their 80’s and their skills range just as much. We have intellectually disabled who like playing candy land all the way to people playing war games and pushing figurines around the table.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My partner and I have played Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 about 2 years ago and we loved it. Over the last year, we have been playing a lot of games with another couple and wanted to start up a legacy game with them. </p> <p>We're considering Season 0 as a good starting point since we loved Season 1, but all the reviews I see suggest playing Season 1 first. We obviously have, but they have not. We would be willing to buy and play a new Season 1 campaign, but are afraid that our prior knowledge of story beats will affect their experience, since a lot of the joy comes from not knowing what comes next in a legacy game. Is it okay to just start with Season 0, or do people think it's better to go with Season 1 with half of us replaying it and half having it be new?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/I2Iisanexcellentsong"> /u/I2Iisanexcellentsong </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.co

They were managing (with some help) but it was a little too complicated to keep them interested. For example, the gear shifting mechanic didn't make any sense, since they have no concept of what a gear stick even is.</p> <p>I then thought I could try using the same cards that you use for playing the solo game... Perfection. </p> <p>For anyone not familiar with the game, the solo game leverages some AI cards that are designed to challenge you, but without all of the overhead. It's perfect for younger kids to use and be legitimately competitive.</p> <p>Using this AI deck, the kids are able to play one
