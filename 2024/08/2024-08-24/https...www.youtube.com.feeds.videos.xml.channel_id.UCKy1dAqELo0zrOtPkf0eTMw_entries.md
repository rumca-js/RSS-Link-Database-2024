Atomfall is a survival-action game that, believe it or not, claims to be inspired by real-life events. According to Steam it takes place after the Windscale nuclear disaster in Northern England. In our Atomfall gameplay we learn the ropes as it's quickly made apparent that guns do not work as well as you'd might think, and that survival will require a bit of stealth and luck.

Madden NFL 25 reviewed by Will Borger on Xbox Series X, also available on PlayStation 5 and PC.

There’s a lot to like in Madden NFL 25. The on-field action is the best it's been thanks to BOOM Tech and the additions from College Football 25. The presentation upgrades are very welcome too, but the modes are functionally the same. Ultimate Team is still a Skinner Box, Superstar is still mediocre, and the Skills Trainer really needs an update to help newer and lapsed players along. Franchise is the best thing here, and it also still needs help. The improvements it did get are nice, but long overdue, and you don’t get a parade for doing things you should have done years ago. EA seems content to continue skating by on being the only company with the NFL license, and that’s not a way to remedy the same old things that have been dragging Madden down for years.

Take a look at the latest featurette for Wicked featuring Director Jon M Chu, Ariana Grande, and Cynthia Erivo as they discuss the powerful bond of friendship between Glinda and Elphaba

Wicked, the untold story of the witches of Oz, stars Cynthia Erivo (Harriet, Broadway’s The Color Purple) as Elphaba, a young woman, misunderstood because of her unusual green skin, who has yet to discover her true power, and Ariana Grande as Glinda, a popular young woman, gilded by privilege and ambition, who has yet to discover her true heart. 

The two meet as students at Shiz University in the fantastical Land of Oz and forge an unlikely but profound friendship. Following an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Glinda's unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, while Elphaba's determination to remain true to herself, and to those around her, will have unexpected and shocking consequences on he
