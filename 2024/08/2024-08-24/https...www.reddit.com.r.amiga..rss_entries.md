He's had all this since the late 80's, I doubt either of them have been turned on for at least 10 years.</p> <p>They're in surprisingly good shape, the batteries are a little corroded, cases need restoration, motherboards are dirty and dusty but don't look too bad. Both power supplies are full of dog hair and dirt/dust, will need to disassemble and clean before attempting to power them on. No keyboards and only 1 amiga mouse.</p> <p>Right now I'm disassembling them and getting ready to ship them off for cleaning and repairs.</p> <p>Anyone know where to find keyboards/accessories?</p> <
