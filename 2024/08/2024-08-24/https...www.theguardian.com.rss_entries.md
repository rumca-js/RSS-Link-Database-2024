<ul><li>Serb says players think some get preferential treatment</li><li>Calls for governing bodies to ‘have a better approach’</li></ul><p>Novak Djokovic has called for anti-doping rules in tennis to change in the light of Jannik Sinner’s recent case and he says that he understands why players have questioned whether doping cases are treated equally.</p><p>“There is a lot of issues in the system,” Djokovic said. “We see a lack of standardised and clear protocols. I can understand the sentiments of a lot of players that are questioning whether they are treated the same. Hopefully the governing bodies of our sport will be able to learn from this case and have a better approach for the future. Collectively there has to be a change, and I think that’s obvious.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/24/novak-djokovic-demands-change-in-doping-rules-after-jannik-sinner-case">Continue reading...</a>

Hopefully I can take that momentum into tomorrow. It’s going to be a tough day. The winds are going to be high. There could be rain as well. I’m going to keep a positive attitude. Take it one shot at a time. I played really well the first two days, so I’m going to take that momentum into tomorrow.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/202

<p>Having the richest owners has not led to immediate success amid concerns the club are no longer a priority for the PIF</p><p>“I wish,” the Newcastle fan said, “that my club should have the richest owners in the world.” The monkey’s paw twitched.

<p>A couple of games into the season Mikel Arteta must feel as though this really could be his year. Arteta knew his side were fortunate when Ollie Watkins missed a sitter in each half and Arsenal had just watched another Aston Villa chance go to waste. Then Arteta brought on Leandro Trossard, the quiet king of scoring big goals, and the substitute scored with his first touch to pave the way to an impressive victory. “Trossard again, ole ole,” sang the away support, a nod to the Belgian’s timely interventions against Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Manchester City and Wolves last season.</p><p>Thomas Partey doubled Arsenal’s advantage with a shot from the edge of Villa’s 18-yard box and while it was not plain-sailing, Arteta’s side ultimately could have won by a bigger margin. Martin Ødegaard, the Arsenal captain, skied a chance to make it three after 80 minutes, seconds after Ricardo Calafiori, signed from Bologna this summer, entered for his debut.

<p>Forget Hollywood depictions of gun-toting robots running wild in the streets – the reality of artificial intelligence is far more dangerous, warns the historian and author in an exclusive extract from his new book</p><p>Throughout history many traditions have believed that some fatal flaw in human nature tempts us to pursue powers we don’t know how to handle. The Greek myth of Phaethon told of a boy who discovers that he is the son of Helios, the sun god. Wishing to prove his divine origin, Phaethon demands the privilege of driving the chariot of the sun. Helios warns Phaethon that no human can control the celestial horses that pull the solar chariot. But Phaethon insists, until the sun god relents. After rising proudly in the sky, Phaethon indeed loses control of the chariot. The&nbsp;sun veers off course, scorching all vegetation, killing numerous beings and threatening to burn the Earth itself. Zeus intervenes and strikes Phaethon with a thunderbolt.

<p>The rather under-celebrated pasta salad is the ultimate make-ahead summer meal, with endless spins to keep things fresh</p><p>The pasta salad is an unsung hero. It’s never seen on the menus of fancy restaurants, but variations on the theme appear steadfastly on kitchen tables and in the ready-made food sections of supermarkets in a way that suggests people love them, even though no one really talks about them. At its best, a pasta salad is a joy of a meal, because it demands very little of the cook. It can be thrown together in minutes, and in advance, and will then happily sit on a table waiting for people to help themselves. The world needs more pasta salads, I think.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/aug/24/vegan-recipe-courgette-tomato-pasta-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

Looking back, she asks if their fragile heroines played a part in her increasingly dangerous attempts to lose weight</p><p></p><p>The Christmas I was nine, what I really wanted was a sparkly rainbow My Little Pony and a corset. I didn’t like My&nbsp;Little Pony – I have always regarded large animals with trepidation and was immune to all horsiness, real and imagined – but I&nbsp;was being bullied at my school in northern&nbsp;England and had observed a correlation between social status and the possession of garish plastic horses. The bullying was all between girls, no violence but months of ostracism. If anyone spoke to me, the ringleaders punished her. If anyone accidentally touched me or my&nbsp;possessions, she ran around wiping off the “Sarah-germs”. If I spoke in class, they mocked, but mostly they pretended I wasn’t there.

<p>An idiosyncratic study of women who leave their children, from Doris Lessing and Muriel Spark to Joni Mitchell</p><p>When Begoña Gómez Urzaiz dropped her younger son off at nursery for the first time, her friends asked her if she had cried. “A little bit,” she fibbed, not wanting to confess that her overwhelming feeling was one of gratitude and relief. For a few blessed hours she would be free to&nbsp;get on with her work as a journalist, without determined little hands pulling the laptop socket out of the wall and a small voice insisting that it&nbsp;was time to play horses.</p><p>Urzaiz, who is based in Barcelona, lied because she didn’t want to come over as anything less than a perfect mother. This is Spain, after all: a country still sluiced by what she calls “the maternal idolatry imposed by the Francoist, national-Catholic agenda”. Divorce wasn’t even legal until 1981. Yet she admits that she’s always had a&nbsp;sneaky appetite for stories of women who abandon their children

For years, I possessed a remarkable superpower: I could turn almost any work opportunity that came my way, no matter how exciting, into an unpleasant emotional drama, simply by agreeing to do it. Once I’d accepted a deadline or signed a contract, there was now another person in the world who might be growing impatient that I hadn’t finished yet, or who might end up disappointed in what I produced – and the thought that they might be harbouring any negativity towards me felt hugely oppressive.

<p>Get little hands busy on these fun recipes for meatball pastry puffs and a tzatziki dip with crisps and chives</p><p>There’s often a gulf between the way that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/29/10-best-kids-recipes?view=mobile">cooking with kids </a>is portrayed –<strong> </strong>everyone smiling at each other adoringly, working together in harmony and laughing at a brilliant joke – and the reality. We’ve all been there. My top tips to help things move in the right direction are as follows. Make sure to employ little hands as much as possible, to roll, crunch or squeeze. Make food that can be eaten by hand, and that can be served in individual portions, to give a sense of agency and ownership – think cookies, meatballs, mini pastries, stuffed crepes. For the same reason, serve dips and spreads in individual portions, too. Don’t start cooking when everyone is already ravenous. And, crucially, always have plenty of parsley to hand if coriander is likely to

<p>In the first of his columns during the Paralympics, Ade Adepitan argues that improved performances at Paris 2024 will only highlight the lack of change for disabled people in society</p><p>The Paris Paralympics are nearly here and, apart from London, it will be the first Games in Europe for 20 years. I am looking forward to it. I’m also intrigued because I believe these Games will provide an important gauge of where the Paralympic movement is at, testing the awareness of disability sport and of disability issues in general.</p><p>I still think London 2012 was a bit of an anomaly because of what Seb Coe did with LoCog and Channel 4 with the broadcasting. There was a lot of clever advertising around it, using the fact that we in the UK love a touch of cheeky humour. It pushed at taboos, asking: what can we say about disability? Do we have to tiptoe around it? And it allowed disabled people to have a voice, to relay our point of view. One of the perspectives people had never really gr

Using him as an illustrative point in Think Like a White Man (my 2019 satire on being Black in the professional world), I compared Kwarteng’s hairline to the wonky lines of a colonial border, among many other quips, yet my critiques and roastings of the talented Mr Kwarteng were never personal, as I’d never had the opportunity to meet him properly.

There’s something about the magic combination of fresh cucumber, sea salt and chilli that is particularly enlivening and makes the tastebuds sing, while salting the cucumber first, for 30 minutes or longer, will not only season it, but will also help revive any lost crunch. This recipe is inspired by Jez Wick and Lauren Evers, who run the kitchen at <a href="https://www.ozharvest.org/refettorio-ozharvest-sydney/">Refettorio OzHarvest in Sydney</a>, where they pair smashed cucumber with a cooling whipped tahini blended with lemon juice and olive oil, as well as a vibrant green coriander oil. In the name of simplicity, however, I’m serving it just as it is, with some optional garlic and coriander.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/aug/24/how-to-turn-the-end-of-a-cucumber-into-a-lip
