The on-field action is the best it's been thanks to BOOM Tech and the additions from College Football 25. The presentation upgrades are very welcome too, but the modes are functionally the same. Ultimate Team is still a Skinner Box, Superstar is still mediocre, and the Skills Trainer really needs an update to help newer and lapsed players along. Franchise is the best thing here, and it also still needs help. The improvements it did get are nice, but long overdue, and you don\u2019t get a parade for doing things you should have done years ago. EA seems content to continue skating by on being the only company with the NFL license, and that\u2019s not a way to remedy the same old things that have been dragging Madden down for years.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Madden", "id": 1050623, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viE6hT9upzw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/viE6hT9upzw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Madden NFL 25 Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-24T00:00:46+00:00", "description": "Take a look at the latest featurette for Wicked featuring Director Jon M Chu, Ariana Grande, and Cynthia Erivo as they discuss the powerful bond of friendship between Glinda and Elphaba\n\nWicked, the untold story of the witches of Oz, stars Cynthia Erivo (Harriet, Broadway\u2019s The Color Purple) as Elphaba, a young woman, misunderstood because of her unusual green skin, who has yet to discover her true power, and Ariana Grande as Glinda, a popular young woman, gilded by privilege and ambition, who has yet to discover her true heart. \n\nThe two meet as students at Shiz University in the fantastical Land of Oz and forge an unlikely but profound friendship.
