<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If someone had physical access to my raspberry pi 5 and my external hard drive containing docker volumes running my services, is it game over for security? Is it possible to encrypt these devices i.e. the SD card and the external hdd in an 'automated' way that hardens security from IRL bad actors whilst also not compromising functionality of self hosting services? For example, I can keep using Jellyfin under normal circumstances but if someday a bad actor decided to take my hard drive containing all my data it'd be encrypted. Same for my SD card. I don't really see how this is feasible but if it were, it'd give me a great sigh of relief to know that I can implement higher security around potentially sensitive data.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lj_theoneandonly"> /u/Lj_theoneandonly </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1f09kqe/securing_server_from_a_bad_actor_w

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi All!!</p> <p>I (27) have been playing darts in a league with a guy (80+) for the past 5 years. I gave him my old TV as he had a 20”, and now he has 55” and free view (free cable for our US friends). He is so grateful, but can only watch live TV.</p> <p>I am trying to figure out how I can give him access to my film collection for little to no money… As far as I know, he has never used the internet, and has a ‘brick phone’ that calls and texts. The freeview works via antenna, so the tv is far from ‘smart’.</p> <p>What’s the best/easiest way for me to give him access to lots of films/tv. The TV supports USB, but it is 15+ years old (and was £200 when I bought it) so I don’t expect it to run everything (file formats/large USB drives).</p> <p>I looked into NVidia shield, but thought it was overkill. And a PC seems okay, but with no internet I can’t access remotely, and I don’t want him to try to deal with windows/linux (or me having to visit repeatedly)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!</p> <p>How do you ensure you'll be able to transfer your services from the cloud to your own hardware?</p> <p>I recently joined this subreddit and have developed a growing interest in self-hosting most of the services currently provided by third-party companies and other projects (like Kuma Uptime, Vercel -&gt; Coolify, iCloud Photos -&gt; Immich, etc.). Unfortunately, I don't have any hardware at the moment, so I would still need to use some cloud providers. However, I would really like to have all my data on dedicated hardware at home eventually.</p> <p>My question is, do you have a strategy in place for moving most or all of your data and projects from one cloud provider to another? And from the cloud to your own hardware?</p> <p>Thank you so much for your time, and I hope you're having a great day!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Da_v_id2002"> /u/Da_v_id2002 </a> <br /> <span><a href="http

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I'm looking for a way to have my own version of OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc., but without having to pay for a monthly subscription. Essentially, I want something like how GitHub is used for code, but that I can use for my Word documents, PDFs, and other personal files.</p> <p>In addition, I’d love something that works similarly to how I use Phone Link to access pictures on my phone—basically, being able to easily access and sync my files across devices.</p> <p>One key requirement is that I need to be able to access my files from outside my home network. For example, if I create a file on my laptop while I'm at university, I want it to automatically sync and be available on my PC when I get home.</p> <p>Does anyone have recommendations for a good self-hosted solution? I’d prefer something that’s relatively easy to set up and manage. I’ve heard a bit about NAS and some tools like Syncthing, but I’m not sure what would work

I have a rough idea of ​​how I want to route my traffic and secure my services, but I'm not sure how best to implement it.</p> <p>My understanding is that traffic should be routed like this: Internet -&gt; VPS (with a Wireguard server) -&gt; Homeserver (VM with a Wireguard client and reverse proxy) -&gt; Service</p> <p>I already have a Proxmox Server, a Cloudflare Domain Name and a cheap VPS.</p> <p>What would be the best way to set all of that up?<br /> Also how would I separate my game server or website VMs from the rest of my network? I don't have a managed switch, but I would assign the same VLAN tag in Proxmox to all VMs that should communicate with the reverse prox
