The fifteen games featuring on this rundown take full advantage of the medium\u2019s interactivity to provide an emotionally captivating, truly memorable experience. \n\nThe other thing these games demonstrate is that great storytelling can occur across numerous genres beyond action RPGs and single player adventures (although these feature heavily too). \n\nHorror games, for instance, deliver emotionally charged payoff by mixing well-conceived characters through a carefully crafted, suitably twisted narrative.

Between the epic set pieces and excellent battles, there are some additional things to discover, leading to secret bosses and areas.\n\nCertain side quests can start simply enough but spiral into battles against multiple secret bosses, to say nothing of locations like Purple Cloud Mountain that would be missed without venturing off the beaten path. Some of these bosses are far from easy, and it can be a big ask to venture off the beaten path.\n\nHowever, besides bonus rewards, items, and equipment, there are crafting materials for stronger weapons to unlock.
