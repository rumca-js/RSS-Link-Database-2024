Always mix your thin-set mortar before applying KERDI-FIX. I use ALL-SET mixed to the membrane water ratio. I apply painter's tape to the tub such that it's just below the height of my tile. Then I apply the KERDI-FIX, thin-set, and banding. It's critical to make the banding as flat as possible so that it doesn't interfere with the tile floor.
