Here's the gist:</p> <ul> <li>It's a web app that runs on your own hardware</li> <li>It can manage multiple scraping containers for you</li> <li>You can interact with your scrapers from any device with a web browser</li> </ul> <p>This project is the result of looking for a way to search Ebay, Craigslist, Offerup, and Facebook Marketplace (spaghetti code willing) at the same time. You could build a container for it that searches for job sites, pirated movies/textbooks, or whatever else you want to aggregate.</p> <p>On its own, it's not particularly powerful, but if the community develops apps for it, it could be pretty awesome. I'm halfway through building this.
