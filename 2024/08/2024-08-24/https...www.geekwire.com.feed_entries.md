Starliner, which has been in the midst of its first crewed flight after years of delay, will be reprogrammed to make an uncrewed departure from the space station next month. Top mission managers said today that they decided unanimously to make a dramatic change in what was originally expected to be a test flight lasting only&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/nasa-says-boeing-starliner-craft-will-land-empty-with-its-crew-returning-months-later/">Read More</a>

GeekWire earlier this month reported on a hybrid work arrangement for Brian Niccol, the former Chipotle CEO who was tapped to lead the struggling Seattle coffee giant. The arrangement, revealed in a regulatory filing, doesn&#8217;t require Niccol to be based at the company&#8217;s Seattle headquarters and creates a new remote office in Newport Beach, Calif., where he currently resides. Starbucks says the Seattle HQ will be Niccol&#8217;s primary office, and he&#8217;ll still be required to follow the company&#8217;s hybrid work policy, which&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/hybrid-policy-for-new-starbucks-ceo-sparks-debate-over-remote-work-corporate-jet-emissions/">Read More</a>

At the start of the game, you’re sent down a one-way path that’s lined with hostile “Wraiths,” but they’re initially invisible. To reveal the Wraiths, you use your VR headset’s microphone to conduct what’s essentially a rhythmic breathing exercise with an audible hum, in time with Zengence’s music. When you do so on the beat, you send out a magical orb that breaks the Wraiths’ concealment. That’s when you can start a fight, using the crystalline pistols your avatar holds in&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/this-virtual-reality-game-encourages-rhythmic-breathing-to-help-with-mental-health/">Read More</a>

But we&#8217;ve been missing a fun musical intro or jingle for the &#8220;My AI&#8221; segment that would really solidify its place on the show. My colleague John Cook&#8217;s attempts to improvise a &#8220;My AI&#8221; theme song don&#8217;t really count, as he would readily admit. So naturally, we asked ourselves, could AI solve this problem? We quickly discovered that the answer was yes. The results from our experiments with two AI-based text-to-music&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/geekwires-quest-for-an-ai-theme-song-opened-our-ears-to-the-debate-rattling-the-music-industry/">Read More</a>
