The proof of concept wasn't packaged and had a number of code-rot issues, so I dove in and fixed up a lot of them and build a cmake install script and a python module.</p> <p>With the new smi_leds module you can choose to drive 8 or 16 LED strips (at install time) and then using C/C++ or Python you can write a simple program to drive all the strips. Setup and install is fairly simple and I've tested on a pile of RPi models.</p> <p>The code is up on github: <a href=\"https://github.com/mayhem/smi_leds\">https://github.com/mayhem/smi_leds</a> and the PyPi module is here: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/smi-leds/\">https://pypi.org/project/smi-leds/</a></p> <p>There is a demo video and hardware wiring guide included! I hope is useful for someone!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;", "id": 1053090, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1f0dsjf/driving_up_to_16_ws2812b_led_strips_with_one_rpi", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "source_obj__id": 470, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Driving up to 16 WS2812b LED strips with one Rpi", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-24T18:25:49+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1f0c1k6/pi_3b_bcm2837b0_autopsy/\"> <img alt=\"Pi 3B+ - BCM2837B0 Autopsy\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_yIHwNVIvKv5b0wp0Hvrs_AQ1Do3ZJKbVKdXYfkt9Mk.jpg\" title=\"Pi 3B+ - BCM2837B0 Autopsy\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Well, one of my Pi 3B+'s died yesterday after a wiring mistake, so I decided to take a look at the SoC at the heart of the Pi, and take a measurement of the die, which is really, really small (roughly 48mm\u00b2 - 6x8mm).</p> <p>Die shot from Electronupdate's Pi Zero2 W teardown, in the BCM2837B0 it should be mirrored, since it's a flipchip die, and the one in the RP3A0 is a wire bond die</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;
