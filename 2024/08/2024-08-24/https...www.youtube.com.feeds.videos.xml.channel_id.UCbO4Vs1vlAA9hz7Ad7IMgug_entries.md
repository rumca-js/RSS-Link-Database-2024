Perfectly timed for a launch at NOVA Open 2024, Austin and the team at Death Ray Designs are putting out three new boxes for STEEL RIFT in their 'Quick Build' series. 

At $45 the new 2-Player Starter set contains six HE-Vs, bases, arc gauges, decals, 2D Terrain and out-of-the-box quickstart teams and rules. 

The Akamatsu and Cerberus Team boxes can be quick start boxes on their own and lean into the Close Quarters supplement and at $35 can also form an entry point into the game!

If you're a retailer and are looking to get your hands on these, contact Justin at justin@deathraydesigns.com !

Hero Scape is one of the original gateway products of the early 2000s to the world of miniature wargaming. Back through Hasbro: Pulse, this Renegade designed game is available for Pre-Order! This $45 (unpainted) or $65 (Painted) starter is a complete game in a box and a great candidate for accessible introductions to tabletop wargames.
