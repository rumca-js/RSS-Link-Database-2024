## Weird 403 behaviour

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My scraper currently only spoofs the user agent header. So I have 30 ipv4 proxies sending like 30 requests per 3 seconds. I know as it stands it is likely to get blocked due to not the correct headers. I need to learn the language a bit before I can implement rotating headers.</p> <p>What is happening is that I'll run the script for an hour and no issues. All of a sudden all IPs will be returning 403s. Closing the script and reopening will have it working again fine for another hour or few hours. Same user agent.</p> <p>What could be causing this? What potentially changes between closing and reopening the program? The IPs don't get blocked.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fuarkistani"> /u/Fuarkistani </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1epuvg4/weird_403_behaviour/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1epuvg4/weir

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is there a website where I simply put a link in and it scrapes the site and puts all the words into a pdf! Prefer itâ€™s free! I want to use it for college research so if it has longer descriptions according that would also be good. Any ideas or simple ways to do so?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Visible_Birthday3289"> /u/Visible_Birthday3289 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1eprfe8/website/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1eprfe8/website/">[comments]</a></span>
