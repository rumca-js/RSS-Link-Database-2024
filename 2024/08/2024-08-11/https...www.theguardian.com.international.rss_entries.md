And frankly, everything has looked softer and more joyful seen through the lens of the Paris 2024 Olympics over the past 19 days. The last of which came to a formal end in Saint Denis with a closing ceremony that was genuinely uplifting in its echoes of the Summer Games that preceded it.</p><p>It was fitting the final note in Paris should be another show of colour. These have been the most beautiful and cloudless of Games. Olympic lore dictates that closing ceremonies will always end up feeling like an overblown imposition.

Tuesday (Lola Petticrew) is a 15-year-old girl caught in the claws of an unspecified terminal illness.

But there’s something about Tuesday’s spirit and empathy that stops Death in his tracks. Tuesday washes the filth from Death’s feathers, buying the parrot a temporary respite from the cacophony of the world’s suffering that fills his head. In return, he lets her live a little longer: her mother, Zora (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/04/stardom-is-not-a-worthy-pursuit-julia-louis-dreyfus

Ask me instead when I was most excited, and I’ll tell you it was in the mid-1990s. Oh to be a teenager again, with Britpop on the radio, TFI Friday on the telly, and English football in the midst of a golden era. The birth of the Premier League had brought glamour to the game but there were still enough old-school vibes in those early days to make it feel relatable, and that was no more so the case than in the 1995-96 season as Tony Yeboah and Georgi Kinkladze scored <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/17/golden-goal-georgi-kinkladze-southampton">goals from the Gods</a> while West Ham wore shirts sponsored by Dagenham Motors.

Crashing waves. HD. Photo-realistic.</p><p>“Is that Land’s End?” my partner asks absentmindedly as she looks at my screen. The prompt I entered into the generator was supposed to be an expression of AI vertigo, but I clearly need to brush up on my prompting skills because the image generated is not the apocalypse I had in mind.

<p>The kids would be OK, but would our friend ever forgive us?</p><p>We were back in Ireland for a wedding last week. My brother-in-law Darragh was marrying his girlfriend Emilie in a lovely ceremony in Dublin, meaning we had to source a babysitter for our kids when every single family member within 100 miles would be attending said wedding with us.</p><p>Miraculously, our friend Mary stood up to the plate, offering to take both kids to her mum’s house in Wicklow, keep them occupied with her own kids for the whole day, and preside over the communal sleepover that followed. She was offering 24 hours of free childcare out of the goodness of her heart, and to say we were grateful would be an understatement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/11/finding-someone-to-look-after-our-toddler-all-day-and-night-is-a-big-ask">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Jayden Daniels rushes for touchdown for Commanders</li><li>Joe Burrow looks strong in return from wrist injury</li></ul><p>This year’s No 1 overall draft pick, Caleb Williams, showed signs of promise in his preseason debut, overseeing a pair of drives ending in field goals in the Chicago Bears’ 33-6 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Saturday.</p><p>The 22-year-old out of USC completed four of seven attempts for 95 yards, and also converted a third-and-nine by bolting out of the pocket for a 13-yard gain. Though he was not perfect – Williams was late in nearly throwing an interception on a play wiped out by a Bills defensive penalty away from the ball – the quarterback oversaw the Bears gaining a combined 152 yards and seven first downs on 20 plays over two possessions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/11/nfl-preseason-roundup-no-1-pick-caleb-williams-outstanding-in-bears-debut">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It hits all the right notes – and yes, you can actually play it</p><p>This is a story about listening to your inner voice. Fear not, this column has not become about life coaching. But it’s all relevant. I got sent some chocolate this week, in the form of a record, a&nbsp;7in ‘vinyl’ single. ‘I think you can play it,’ I gaily said. ‘No you can’t,’ said someone who will remain nameless and fancies themselves an aficionado. ‘Oh,’ I said, feeling deeply stupid, as if I’d watched too much <em>Willy Wonka</em>. ‘You can’t play a&nbsp;chocolate record,’ they added, ‘because it’d ruin the needle.’</p><p>Subdued, I snapped into this thick disc of 70% cocoa chocolate and ate it. The chocolate maker (from ‘bean to music’ they class themselves), <strong><a href="https://cocoarunners.com/shop/nadalina-chocolate-record/">Nadalina</a></strong>, is from Split in Croatia, and the man behind it, and on the record, is Marinko Biškić, a&nbsp;former singer in a&nbsp;punk band.</p> <a href="https://www

<p>Mainstream politicians have legitimised the far right to rebrand racism as white identity</p><p>“The British soul is awakening and stirring with rage at what these people are doing,” the <em>Spectator</em>’s Douglas Murray told former Australian deputy prime minister John Anderson. The comment might sound like a response to the recent riots, but was actually recorded last year (the edited clip of the old interview was uploaded on Anderson’s website last week, but has since been taken down).</p><p>By “these people”, Murray meant immigrants. “I don’t want them here,” he insisted. “I’m perfectly willing to say that, because it needs to be said.” The police, Murray argued, had lost control of the streets and “if the army will not be sent in, then the public will have to go in, and the public will have to sort this out themselves, and it’ll be very, very brutal.” The comments might sound like a prescient warning. They sound also like a dangerous apology for the violence.</p> <a href="ht

<p>Growing emphasis on military training for civilians reflects heightened nationalism under Xi Jinping – and a growing risk of war over Taiwan</p><p>At Beijing Jiaotong University’s affiliated elementary school, a class of children, maybe six or seven years old, stand in a line in a rainbow painted hallway. A boy holds a replica handgun, and behind him other students grasp unwieldy fake assault rifles. Fake police flak jackets cover their blue and white tracksuits, and their heads swim inside too-big artillery helmets. In other photographs students practise drills, salute visiting soldiers, and arrange themselves on a sporting field to spell out “I [heart] u” next to a Chinese flag.</p><p>In the post that includes the <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4MDIwODAxNA==&amp;mid=2767938803&amp;idx=2&amp;sn=7610d183d33efac0b017a0ad9dee25fd&amp;chksm=bfb02a3f912a16d00b4b0fa5e6f2d5375af0dc9a3691bc585ecf6b8023f9c87db1d0b84c754d&amp;scene=27">photos</a>, published online in April, th
