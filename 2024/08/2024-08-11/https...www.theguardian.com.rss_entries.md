<p>The discovery of a decaying body in South Wales was just the beginning of a breathlessly twisty case spanning five decades, two continents – and where the prime suspect was already dead</p><p>We tend to refer to murders as whodunnits, says DCI Gareth Morgan, but he believes a better term for the extremely odd case that unfurled under his watch in south Wales during 2015 would be a “who-is-it?”. When a heinous, seeping package – a decaying corpse half-preserved in more than 40 layers of wrapping – is discovered in the village of Beddau, a woman named Leigh Ann Sabine – who recently died of brain cancer – quickly becomes the prime suspect. The problem is, police cannot work out who it is she has killed.</p><p>Ultimately, The Body Next Door is not really a who-is-it or even a howdunnit; it is – far more compellingly – a how-could-she-do-it? We first encounter Sabine through the eyes of her neighbours in Beddau (whose pronunciation seems to be a local bone of contention, but the reside

So did their opponents, judging by the red and white-checked caps that sank into knees on the bench at the far side of the pool.

It was lost on nobody that their bitterest rivals were the ones forced to endure the celebrations.</p><p>Did it mean something extra to Serbia’s players to win another gold against their neighbours, with whom such a turbulent history runs deep in and away from the sporting arena? “Yes,” Cuk said simply, after a medal ceremony prefaced by ecstatic celebrations with a sizeable travelling support. “Yes, yes, and yes.”</p> <a href="https:/

<p>If there is one thing you are guaranteed from the opening weekend of the Championship season, it is a tidal wave of hyperbole that is easy to get swept away in. What we see in the early August sunshine almost always fails to translate into reality by the time we reach May and on the basis of what Wayne Rooney’s first game as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/25/wayne-rooney-confirmed-as-plymouth-argyle-manager">Plymouth Argyle manager</a> delivered here, he will certainly be hoping that is the case.</p><p>Results and performances on the opening weekend can often feel seismic one way or the other: after all, it’s the only sample size we’ve got to go on. To that end, there’s never too much to read into things when you drill down into it that much but to suggest this was an inauspicious start for Rooney in the Argyle dugout would be putting it mildly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/11/sheffield-wednesday-plymouth-champio

<p>Colleges have been placed in an impossible position. Bridget Phillipson should heed their concerns</p><p>The post-16 educational landscape in England and Wales is patchy and messy. It is also unequal and unfair. For the most academic students, the expectation is that they apply to university after studying A-levels for two years. Currently, around a third of young people follow this route, and while by no means perfect, it is at least clear. The same cannot be said for the options faced by the other two-thirds. The reform of the other qualifications on offer to this age group has resulted in a <a href="https://feweek.co.uk/phillipson-defends-risible-partial-level-3-defunding-pause/">worrying standoff</a> between government officials and those on the ground.</p><p>The introduction of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/20/vocational-t-levels-england-ofsted-report">T-levels</a>, under the Tories, was meant to be a levelling up measure – to put vocational learning

<p>Severe cases of far-right violence need to be recognised as terrorism and not ‘thuggery’, write Rusi researchers</p><p>The recent riots in the UK, sparked by the Southport stabbings, have exposed troubling double standards in how society perceives and responds to far-right violence compared to Islamist extremism.

Porter had worked in television and was already a prizewinning playwright – it was perhaps inevitable that the novel would be cinematic and dramatically satisfying. If there was occasionally a feeling that the author didn’t assert total control over her narrative, that she might have trimmed the two-page list of characters at the start, these were minor complaints

<p>This otherwise fascinating account of childhood in a disturbingly liberal commune is somewhat marred by ‘poetic’ excesses</p><p>At the time of Charles and Diana’s wedding in 1981, Susanna Crossman was nearly nine. “We are against it,” she recalls, “but we watched it anyway… It was beautiful, but I know marriage is a patriarchal institution, a capitalist trap, a snare. You can read about it in <em>Spare Rib, </em>or if you ask community members, someone will tell you marriage is legalised rape.”</p><p>For 15 years from the age of six, Crossman lived with her mother, brother and sister on what would generally be called a commune – though members insisted on the word “community”. Fifty people shared a 60-room house on a 31-acre estate in the English countryside, but they were very clearly divided, she writes, into “two distinct social groups”: the Adults and the 18 Kids, between two and 10 years old.</p><p><em>Home Is Where We Start: Growing Up in the Fallout of the Utopian Dream</em>

<p>A visual tribute to doctor Elena Zadik, who overcame trauma and career obstacles to become a pillar of her northern community, is a real treat</p><p>Miriam Gold’s first book is a kind of magic trick. Outwardly, it is so deceptively simple: some pictures, a (very) few words. In the hand, small and solid and scrappy, it feels like something its author might have pulled from an old cedar trunk or the back of a lavender-scented drawer. But don’t be taken in. It brings with it an unfathomable power and richness.<strong> </strong>Even the flintiest heart could not possibly be immune to its beautifully stitched charms<em>. </em>I want to wrap it in brown paper and string, and give it to everyone I know.</p><p>Part memoir and part biography, it tells the story of Gold’s beloved granny, Dr Elena Zadik. By the time her granddaughter knew her, Zadik was a longstanding GP in the former mill town of Leigh in Lancashire: a woman who knew all her patients by name, who loved her job so much she wo

<p>Doug Liman directs the usually bankable duo in this disappointingly slow and predictable crime comedy</p><p>The proven pairing of Matt Damon and Casey Affleck (so effortlessly natural together in Gus Van Sant’s slacker disaster flick <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,4267,1028354,00.html">Gerry</a></em>) is not enough to salvage <em>The Instigators</em>. Directed by Doug Liman cosplaying Steven Soderberg, this plodding botched heist comedy follows bankrupt former marine Rory (Damon) and ex-con Cobby (Affleck, who co-wrote the screenplay and is overly generous with his character’s share of the dialogue). The pair attempt to steal a stash of dirty money from a corrupt politician, but find themselves on the run with all of Boston’s cops in pursuit. It should be pulpy fun powered by car chases and zippy repartee, but <em>The Instigators</em> is a dispiriting and predictable drag of a movie.</p><p>In select cinemas and <a href="http

They also create space for this fringe rookie to ply her choicest comedy – as when she puts her audience on the spot, asking us to assess her looks.

What a delight to explore Paris’s vast network of cycle paths, most of them separated from the car traffic.

<p>Ilana Glazer and Michelle Buteau fizz in the Better Things creator’s directorial debut, a rapid-fire riff on pregnancy, motherhood and female friendship</p><p>Motherhood changes everything. Or that’s the received wisdom anyway. However, Eden – Ilana Glazer, who also co-wrote the film and rattles out her lines with a flip, crackling energy that veers between the scatological and the screwball – didn’t get that particular memo. A freewheeling, terminally single yoga teacher from Astoria, Queens, she is not about to let an unplanned baby derail her life. Her personality (large, loud, tirelessly hedonistic) is stamped on to every aspect of her pregnancy. Her birth plan features helium balloons and tiaras; she has already compiled a Spotify playlist of party bangers for the delivery room. And holding her hand through it all, Eden assumes, will be her best friend since childhood, Dawn (Michelle Buteau).</p><p>But Dawn has a demanding career and family of her own: a newborn whose birth pr

Don’t get me wrong: it’s a perfectly decent light dry white, at a fair price, with gentle melon, greengage and gooseberry flavours – a wine that inhabits a happy halfway house between the liveliness of sauvignon and the fleshier fruitiness of a southern French chardonnay. It’s not the most exciting white of this price around, even in the Tesco range. But what makes it noteworthy is the grape variety, floreal, which is one of a few recently bred hybrid varieties created by crossing European <em>Vitis vinifera</em> grape varieties with wild Asian and American vines.

<p>This canteen-style Korean has big, nerdy ideas and is likely to put a smile on your face </p><p><strong><a href="https://www.bokman.co.uk/">Bokman</a>, 3 Nine Tree Hill, Cotham, Bristol BS1 3SB. All dishes £8.50-£24, desserts £6.50-£8, wines from £27</strong></p><p>Over the years, I’ve come to love a pre-order. It wasn’t always the way. For a long time, I considered the whole point of restaurants to be spontaneity. At home you usually know, hours before, what you will be eating. It’s a matter of practicality; of ingredients bought and preparation begun. But you can push into a restaurant without any idea what you’ll be having for dinner. Then you get given a list. You choose. They bring. It’s a miracle. But eventually I got swept up in the calm thrills of ordering in advance. There is still a list. You still get to choose. But the delicious anticipation, the thought that there is a nice, bespoke thing in your future, is extended.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/articl

## My sister buys posh food, but most of it ends up in the bin

<p>Is this really about sibling rivalry? Turn inwards and ask yourself what is motivating your thinking towards your sister</p><p><em><strong>The question</strong></em><strong> </strong><em>My </em><em>sister spends a significant percentage of her modest income on expensive boutique groceries from </em><em>farmers’ markets and other high-end food stores. “To each their own” is my view. Fancy foods make her happy and that’s great. She doesn’t spend her money on cigarettes or lottery tickets, etc. And she only occasionally buys alcohol or goes to restaurants.</em></p><p><em>The thing is, a lot of the food she buys ends up rotting and getting tossed in the bin. This has been going on for years. Fancy cheeses, fancy ice-cream, yoghurt, crackers, bread and all kinds of organic produce rots in her kitchen. She literally wastes well over £1,000 every year on food she never eats. It’s tragic, but what’s worse is that she often complains about not having enough money to spend on other prioriti

## Doctors should push back against the BMA’s opposition to Cass review

<p>I am appalled that part of the leadership of our profession has rejected the conclusions of the report into gender identity services</p><p>I applaud Sonia Sodha’s clarity and incisiveness. The de facto rejection of the Cass report by the BMA council is unconscionable (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/04/bma-stance-on-puberty-blockers-defies-first-principle-of-medicine-first-do-no-harm-cass-review">The BMA’s stance on puberty blockers defies the key principle of medicine: first, do no harm</a>”).</p><p>As a late-career GP, I have watched closely the debates around the treatment of adolescent gender dysphoria unfold over the past decade. There have been many red flags: the administration of experimental treatments with potential lifelong adverse consequences to vulnerable children; the influence of campaigning organisations on clinical decision-making; the exceptionalism used to justify overriding accepted standards of evidence and ethics.</p> <a h

## Fusion power might be 30 years away but we will reap its benefits well before

<p>Discoveries made in pursuit of nuclear fusion have potentially huge practical applications in everything from curing cancer to superior batteries for EVs</p><p>When James Watt’s first commercial steam engine was installed in March 1776 at Bloomfield Colliery, Tipton in the West Midlands, it was hailed as a mechanical marvel. Yet few could have anticipated the way steam engines would change the world.</p><p>Developed initially to pump water from mines, the technology was adapted across so many industries and applications that it sparked the Industrial Revolution. Now, according to those working on the development of fusion energy power plants, we are on the cusp of a similar transformation. “I see this whole endeavour as having the characteristics of a general purpose technology in the same spirit as Watt,” says Lu-Fong Chua, chief strategy officer of TAE Power Solutions in Birmingham.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/aug/11/nuclear-fusion-research-tae-p

I love listening to the birds, pottering with my plants or picking up Red Robin leaves from the hedges. As a former athlete, I do a lot of wholesome work on wellbeing and the mind.<br /><br /><strong>What’s for lunch?</strong> I like my Sunday roast: crunchy, fluffy potatoes, lashings of gravy, lots of vegetables and a lovely big fat pudding. Or I’ll cook fish or pasta with my son. He’s 26 and still lives at home. I can’t get rid of him! I’m not complaining, I love his company.</p><p><strong>Sundays growing up?</strong> I was abandoned as a baby, then I spent 14 years in children’s homes. That’s why I’m advocating the importance of rejuvenation for the care system sector.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/11/sunda

<p>Thousands of rifles are in the hands of civilian militia who freely mobilise every night, with police and the state accused of being powerless</p><p>As the sun began to slip behind the verdant Manipur hills, Kolom Rabi prepared for a long night ahead. Hurriedly he slung a cartridge belt over his shoulder, strapped on a walkie-talkie and grabbed his shotgun. In the surrounding houses, dozens of his neighbours – farmers, students, teachers and office workers by day – donned their green army fatigues and picked up their rifles, before gathering in a sandbag-lined bunker on the village outskirts to await instructions. Tonight, it was Rabi’s turn to be the commander of this makeshift civilian militia.</p><p>“The Indian state has failed to provide us security so we have been protecting ourselves with our own guns for over a year now,” said Rabi. “I don’t know when this will all come to an end.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/11/unregulated-vigilante-armie
