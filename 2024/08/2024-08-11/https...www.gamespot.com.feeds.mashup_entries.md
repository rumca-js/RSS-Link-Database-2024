<p>It's been two years since Disney announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disneylands-avengers-campus-is-getting-a-third-attraction/1100-6507409/">a new Marvel attraction</a> at California Adventure's Avengers Campus featuring King Thanos as the villain. Earlier this week at D23, Disney <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disneylands-avengers-ride-vehicle-debuts-at-d23/1100-6525685/">shared a look at the vehicle</a> that guests will be riding across the multiverse in. Now, the name of the attraction has been revealed as well. It's going to be called Avengers: Infinity Defense.</p><p>The story behind the attraction is that Tony Stark has developed new portal technology that can take riders to different worlds. But that's also attracted the attention of King Thanos, a version of the Mad Titan who won the Infinity War in an alternate reality. Since Avengers Campus is set in alternate MCU where Thanos never snapped half the universe out of existence, the heroes don't

But there's one currently existing ride at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-galaxys-edge-a-guide-to-disneys-new-them/1100-6467294/">Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge</a> in Disneyland and Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom that's going to get a few familiar faces. The Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run ride will feature a new mission that incorporates The Mandalorian and Grogu.</p><p>Lucasfilm creative executive Dave Filoni came on stage at D23's Disney Experiences panel to make the announcement. Filoni noted that Epic Games' Unreal Engine--which already helped Lucasfilm produce The Mandalorian through the virtual set known as The Volume--will be used to incorporate Din Djarin and his adoptive son, Grogu, into Smuggler's Run.  </p><figure style="width: 1300px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4348661-themandalorianandgrogsmuggler%27srunfull.jpg"

<p>Most people who buy Pez candy probably aren't thinking about the flavor of the little brick tablets much at all (none taste very good). Pez is all about the iconic plastic dispensers featuring characters from popular media franchises. Pez Dispensers have become collectibles since first debuting in the US in the 1950s (the candy itself is nearly 100 years old). There aren't very many Pez Dispensers themed around video game franchises, but if you're an Animal Crossing fan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V1VSC5L?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Amazon has a limited-time deal on a 12-pack featuring Tom Nook, K.K.
