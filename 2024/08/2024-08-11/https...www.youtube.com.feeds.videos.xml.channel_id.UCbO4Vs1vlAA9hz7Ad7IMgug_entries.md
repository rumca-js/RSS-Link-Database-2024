Welcome back to Inside Tabletop. In this series I talk to people that live and work in Gaming, getting them to share their insights on the business of game entertainment. 

Today I'm sitting down with series-favourite Chris from Lords of War Games and Hobbies as we discuss our take-aways from the launch of Warhammer: Age of Sigmar (2024).
