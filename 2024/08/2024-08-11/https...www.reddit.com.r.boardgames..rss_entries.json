It's so subjective to post a rank, and you really can't expect people to judge based on any criteria.</p> <p>It's tough to decide what would make the best anything. In sports, or other fields with numerical results, we often categorize it with some metric as the best -right now- or the most consistent over a long period of time.</p> <p>The analogue to that for best game would likely be most sold, or a more nebulous &quot;most games ever played&quot;/&quot;most playtime dedicated.&quot; But maybe a game is more than the amount of time you spend playing? </p> <p>There are a lot of undoubtably popular games, but to some degree a popular game is attractive because it's a shared unicersal experience. Is chess the best version of the &quot;chess-like&quot; games because it's the most popular? Or could there be a better variant that simply hasn't captured any attention?
