<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just got my hands on an A1200 with a defect HDD which I am replacing with a memory card. I was thinking in upgrading it with more memory, better cpu and maybe networking and HDMI. There seem to be so many different options out there, so what would your recommendation be to get the best bang for the bucks? I also have the original A1200 ROM's - should I invest in upgrading them ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Far_Outlandishness92"> /u/Far_Outlandishness92 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1epht1i/upgrading_an_a1200/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1epht1i/upgrading_an_a1200/">[comments]</a></span>
