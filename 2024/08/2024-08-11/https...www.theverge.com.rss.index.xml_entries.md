  <p id="IhMXb1">If you’ve ever wondered what happens to all those self-driving taxis when the world is asleep, one YouTube channel has you covered. Since the beginning of the month, software engineer Sophia Tung <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/h53xlXu_6C4">has been livestreaming</a> a San Francisco parking lot that Waymo is renting to give its robotaxis somewhere to go during their downtime.</p>
<p id="eVoDwf">Tung told <em>The Verge </em>via email that the company appeared to “partially” take over the lot on July 28th then later took over the entire lot. Waymo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24184814/waymo-waitlist-robo

  <p id="wOde9u">So far, the only way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24209910/apple-intelligence-ios-18-preview-siri">try out Apple Intelligence features</a> on an iPhone is through the iPhone 15 Pro. The entire iPhone 16 line is expected to get the features this fall, but “you can also bet” the iPhone SE, coming “as early as the beginning of 2025,” will have it too, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495">says <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark

  <p id="70GAxG">Longtime Google rivals like Yelp and DuckDuckGo received a huge victory Monday when a federal judge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit">ruled that Google is an illegal monopoly</a>. But their statements on the ruling expressed restraint. That’s because the work of restoring competition has just begun, and the judge has yet to decide what that work will include. With a lot of options on the table, Google’s competitors are pushing for changes they believe will help their businesses, which might be harder than it sounds.</p>
