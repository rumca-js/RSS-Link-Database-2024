		In the last week, at least four class action lawsuits have been filed in response to what has been described as the biggest breach of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on record. More than 200 gigabytes of nearly 3 billion records containing the PII of an unknown number of “U.S., Canadian, and British citizens” - including Social Security numbers and criminal records – were stolen in a hack of the computer systems of <a href="https://nationalpublicdata.com/">National Public Data</a>, a Florida-based data broker.

Data brokers in the U.S. buy, aggregate, disclose, and sell billions of data elements on Americans with virtually no oversight and “little financial incentive to protect consumer data,” says the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

For over a decade, biometrics that leverage unique biological traits to verify identities have been widely adopted for user authentication. However, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has given fraudsters new tools to circumvent biometric methods such as fingerprinting, facial recognition and voice identification. As technology evolves, it is crucial to assess and address potential vulnerabilities with biometric authentication to ensure ongoing security and continued effectiveness of anti-fraud measures.
