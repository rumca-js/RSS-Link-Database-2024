Jack Black has said that Tenacious D will be back - when the time is right. It follows a backlash caused by a joke Kyle Gass made about the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. At the time, Jack Black cancelled the band's tour and put all "future creative plans" on hold. So is there a future for Tenacious D? And should everyone be watching what they say on stage now and can it ever be a safe space?
