		The deepfake detection boom has taken a financial turn in China, with the announcement of the Global Multimedia Deepfake Detection Challenge 2024, a contest sponsored by the Inclusion Conference on the Bund and digital conglomerate <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/ant-group-applies-for-palm-biometrics-patent-for-retail-purchases">Ant Group</a> (of which Alibaba is majority owner).

A news release promises a total prize pool of 1,000,000 Chinese yuan (around US$137,000) to be won by entrants that can innovate, develop and test deepfake detection models that are more accurate and effective in a series of real-world scenarios. Registration closed on July 31 and testing is currently in progress. Results are to be announced in early September.

		For many small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in the UK, government contracts are still out of reach: Despite an increase in direct procurement spending with SMEs over the past six years, their share of overall public procurement has remained steady at around 20 percent, according to procurement data published by the British Chambers of Commerce and market intelligence firm Tussell this month.

According to Tussel’s <a href="https://www.tussell.com/gov/blog/sme-procurement-tracker-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">analysis</a>, the UK government spent £39.7 billion (roughly US$51.8 billion) with SMEs last year. Median earnings per SME have grown since 2020, from £25,000 ($32,800) to £32,000 ($41,800).

However, the bulk of procurement contracts (34 perce

		Compression of digital images can cause a loss of detail that removes the value of images containing biometric data, prompting a team of researchers to explore the potential of new compression techniques based on artificial intelligence.

The loss of data caused by strong JPEG compression can be observed visually, say the researchers from Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg in Germany, who wrote the paper: “<a href="https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10823">Trustworthy Compression? Impact of AI-based Codecs on Biometrics for Law Enforcement</a>.”

Their research indicates that AI-based compression impacts different modalities to varying degrees. Iris biometrics performance is significantly degraded with the use of such images, while fingerprint biometrics pe

But despite the popularity of quick payments offered by ApplePay, GPay, and PayPal, a new study is questioning their security and warning that changes in authentication methods are necessary to avoid identity theft and fraud.

Researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Pennsylvania State University analyzed the security of financial transactions through digital wallets, focusing on authentication, authorization, and access control security functions.

One of the issues identified is a weakness in how authenticati

		In the absence of broad federal legislation that specifically prohibits or restricts the use of AI, the vacuum has and is being filled by a hodge-podge patchwork of legislation and legislative proposals at the state level to address the more recent digital privacy issues that the emergence of AI has brought with it. And few of the laws that have been passed by states regulating AI within their borders can be considered comprehensive.

Many of the enacted or proposed state laws that address AI target the use of AI in the processing of users’ personal data and requiring the right of users to opt-out.

It’s become a tapestry of quilted laws the U.S. Congressional Research Service (CRS) said in a recent issues for Congress <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf

		<em>By Olivier Koch, VP of Applied AI, <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a></em>

Today, hundreds of millions of people use tools like ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas, or Midjourney to create new visuals. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have become part-and-parcel of our daily lives and are propelling the arrival of a new digital era. We now work more efficiently, can better meet professional or creative challenges, and accelerate new innovation.

But AI now has much more intrinsic value than supporting our daily tasks. It is integral to powering our critical services and keeping society running, whether that’s facilitating loan agreements or providing key access to higher education, mobility platforms or medical care.
