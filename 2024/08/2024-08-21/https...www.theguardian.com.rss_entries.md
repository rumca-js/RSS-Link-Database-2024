The president did, indeed, look perkier, borne aloft by the gratitude of 23,000 people in the hall and the millions beyond it for the fact he is no longer seeking re-election. By itself, this moment would have lifted the occasion above the norm. But the Democratic convention this year is so uniquely dramatic, so unprecedented in US history, that it rivals and possibly outstrips even President Obama’s nomination in 2008. And Biden’s heart-wrenching appearance was just the beginning.</p><p>“When we fight, we win,” said Kamala Harris in her opening speech on Monday and there it was, that strange moment of realisation that what she was saying might actually be true.

<p>Famous for unhinged debauchery, this weekend Reading and Leeds festivals will see the debut of the Aux, a stage dedicated solely to podcasts. So is chatting the new rock’n’roll?</p><p>It’s a tough time to be an artist who plays arenas. Earlier this year, the Black Keys made headlines when they canned an entire American arena tour due to catastrophically low ticket sales; same goes for Jennifer Lopez, who rebranded a flailing album tour as a greatest hits show before scrapping the thing altogether. If your name doesn’t begin with “Taylor” and end with “Swift,” ticket sales just aren’t a sure thing like they used to be.</p><p>If you’re a podcaster? Well, that’s a different story.

<p>‘Is it an image of neglect or of a tight, safe community? It’s a picture full of ambiguous information, taken in the centre of a neighbourhood that rose up against an oppressive state’</p><p>I grew up near Penny Lane in Liverpool but I didn’t see many blue suburban skies. Just like any other northern industrial city, it was kind of desolate. Bomb sites everywhere. As I got older, it became harder to tell which bomb sites were from the war and which had been inflicted by Liverpool city planners.</p><p>I started taking photographs in my teens after failing to get into medical school. I worked for a while for the ambulance service, transporting elderly and disabled people to and from day centres. It took me all over the city, including condemned streets where people were still living in sad and deprived conditions in houses marked for demolition. Later, while studying photography at the Polytechnic of Central London in 1973, I went back to one of those streets with my camera.</p> <a h

Eager to promote the growing public interest in artists from Bulgaria, the Middle East and across Africa, they were encouraged by the massive success of Paul Simon’s Graceland album the previous year, which had spliced his New York songcraft with the music of South African artists such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo.

But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/well/loneliness-mental-health-age.html">data</a> published last month shows that single women are <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/loneliness-experts-usa-australia-netherlands-b2537245.html">disproportionately affected</a> by this little-discussed issue.</p><p>Researchers found that loneliness follows a U-shaped pattern: there’s an uptick at the start and end of adulthood, but it drops during middle age, when many of us are preoccupied with families, relationships and career building. But for single women who don’t follow this trend, self-reported loneliness is disproportionately high.</p><p>Georgina Lawton is the author of Raceless: In Search of Family, Identity, and the Truth About Where I Belong</p><

<p>Millicent Martin and Denholm Elliott also star in Clive Donner’s 1964 satire on class, filled with macabre twists</p><p>There is some addictive raffishness and raciness in this 1964 British black-comedy satire for which screenwriter Frederic Raphael adapts a short story by American mystery writer Stanley Ellin; Clive Donner directs with cinematography by Nicolas Roeg. Alan Bates plays a pushy, plausible young fellow called James Brewster, employed in an upmarket “auctioneer” house – ie estate agent’s – in London’s West End, a firm greedily taking advantage of the construction boom.</p><p>Brewster is competent and hardworking but deeply ashamed of his lower-class background and his poor old mum and dad, and suspects he would do much better in the company if he had some patrician polish; his boss Mr Horton (Harry Andrews) is at present more enamoured of his airily entitled colleague Hugh (James Villiers) who is dating Horton’s daughter Ann, played with mischievous sensuality by Milli
