<p>The recent launch of AMD’s desktop Ryzen 9000 family of processors was a bit of a mess, and AMD officially admits it — along with providing new, optimized code that improves overall performance.</p>



<p>The new code, which is optimized for improved branch prediction performance, should deliver gains of between 0 to 13 percent depending on the application, AMD says. It will also benefit older Ryzen chips (albeit by a smaller amount).</p>



<p>Furthermore, the new code won’t be distributed via PC makers or BIOS updates, but as a Windows 11 beta preview.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="whats-in-amds-ryzen-9000-patch">What’s in AMD’s Ryzen 9000 patch?</h2>



<p>As soon as the new code is applied, gaming performance should improve. However, AMD appears to be playing it somewhat cautiously, and there are still unanswered questions.</p>

<p>AMD’s X3D processors, outfitted with extra V-cache that can boost performance for 3D games, are all the rage with system builders.

<p>Windows is chock-full of mildly infuriating quirks that seemingly exist for no reason. One of those quirks is the fact that you can’t use the same camera in multiple apps simultaneously (at least without a third-party app that virtually clones your webcam feed).</p>



<p>Speculation abounds as to why Microsoft imposes this restriction. Perhaps it has something to do with privacy or security. Or the possibility of collisions when different apps try to adjust the webcam’s settings in contradictory ways. Or maybe it has to do with performance issues, which really was an issue back in the days when PCs were weaker and webcams sucked up a lot of processing power.</p>



<p>Whatever the reasons, things have changed and Microsoft is finally allowing multiple apps to access the same webcam at the same time (as reported by <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2024/08/2

<p>Laptops are ideal for taking course notes. They’re portable enough to carry with you to every class, they have built-in keyboards and touchpads for fast typing and navigation, you can doodle and sketch with a digital pen, and you can record your lectures with the laptop’s built-in microphone (most of the time, anyway).</p>



<p>But none of that matters if you don’t have a great note-taking app. You’d be severely limited if you only had Notepad, for example, whereas you could have near-unlimited flexibility if you had a note-taking app that could draw notes, insert images, attach files, etc.</p>
