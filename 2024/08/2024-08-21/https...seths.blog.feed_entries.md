I came across this (ironically) anonymous quote recently: &#8220;The offline world is full of sticks, but the internet only has carrots.‚Äù When we come together in groups, it can bring out the best in people. When those groups are anonymous, porous and transient, though, the opposite can happen. And mobs never helped anyone, ever.
