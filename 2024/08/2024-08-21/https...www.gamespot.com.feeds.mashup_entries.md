<p>Warframe 1999 is Warframe's all-new story expansion coming later this year. This expansion places players in a more-grounded environment on an alternate earth rather than the space-themed confrontations Tenno are so used to, as seen in the Level Infinite showcase.</p><p>Warframe 1999 is set on New Year's Eve, when Arthur and his fellow Hex members battle technological monstrosities, ride atomicycles--reminiscent of a motorcycle--through the streets, solve Snake-like puzzles, and face a Corrupted Lich boy band.</p><p>Players will have to complete the Whispers in the Walls expansion before stepping into the world of 1999 since this story expansion continues the story of Albrecht Entrati, the Orokin scientist. Entrati's whereabouts and secrets are what drive the story expansion's player-character, Arthur, voiced by Ben Starr, to push forward. Players will have to be careful since old and new enemies will impede their path.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-1999-lo

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> Vessel of Hatred is coming in October, and Blizzard just gave fans all kinds of new details about what's coming in the expansion at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5715/">Gamescom</a>, including how a massive "first-of-its-kind" cooperative dungeon, the Dark Citadel, will require players to team up to earn its exclusive rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">The dungeon is ruled by the First Khazra, who uses the citadel to experiment on villagers in an effort to resurrect a powerful demon. It will be up to players to put a stop to it, and in a first for the series, it will require players to group up. The Dark Citadel will be playable with a minimum of two players, but Blizzard is recommending a full party of four to conquer its challenges. The dungeon will become available upon reaching the endgame, and players will need to complete an introductory quest

<p>Lego has officially revealed its line of Mario Kart sets, as six of the iconic racing machines are lining up for launch in 2025. These were first teased back in March, and the sets will include buildable versions of Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Baby Peach, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Toad on their signature vehicles. Like other big Lego releases, there's a mix of quick-build kits and more-elaborate sets, and in a cool nod to the games, the karts even feature working mechanisms that allow them to fire green and red koopa shells.</p><p>The sets are also compatible with previously released Lego Super Mario figures, as Mario, Luigi, and Peach will play vehicular sound effects when they interact with these new kits. Pricing starts at $15 for the Yoshi bike and maxes out at $80 for Baby Peach and her Grand Prix set. These will be officially released on January 1, 2025, so good luck trying to maintain a New Year's resolution to avoid buying more Lego. Here's a quick breakdown of what you'll find i

<p>"Google is horrible."</p><p dir="ltr">This was among the first things that Raccoon Logic creative director Alex Hutchinson said to me as I settled in to learn about his studio's newest game, Revenge of the Savage Planet. He followed this up with a promise to elaborate further as the presentation progressed. I would ultimately be shocked by how much of the nearly two-hour showcase and interview would be about this topic.</p><p dir="ltr">Raccoon Logic consists of a bunch of Montreal-based developers that, after working together on games like Assassin's Creed and the Batman Arkham series, went on to form Typhoon Studios in the late 2010s. In early 2020, that studio put out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/journey-to-the-savage-planet-video-review/2300-6452079/">Journey to the Savage Planet</a>, an action-adventure game that was largely met with praise.

<p dir="ltr">All eyes might have been on the Rev-8 land vehicle introduced to Starfield yesterday, but the update also provides another treat for the eyes. Bethesda Game Studios has revealed that Xbox Series X display settings are now matched on Series S. That means 60fps is available as an option on the smaller system.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1826009323342016643">On X</a>, Bethesda detailed the visual enhancements as part of Starfield's August update.
