The startup has developed a tool called Digital Winglets that helps passenger and cargo airlines optimize their fuel use while at flying at cruising altitudes. The software incorporates real-time data about wind, weather, the speed and weight of a plane, air traffic and other parameters, along with a plane&#8217;s Aircraft Performance Model, which includes details on the specific characteristics of the aircraft, its engines and the degradation of these components over time.

Surreal Holdings of Alpharetta, Ga., alleges that AWS wrongly terminated their broader software development agreement and owes more than $1.27 million. According to the suit, Amazon cited Surreal&#8217;s promotion of the Emirates project on its website, and its inclusion of the AWS and Emirates logos in a site footer, as breaches of confidentiality to justify terminating the larger agreement.

For roughly $40,000, that scenario could be a reality. The upcoming Christie&#8217;s auction of more than 150 assorted items from the Paul G. Allen Collection will feature computing equipment and artifacts, historic letters, artworks, space-related memorabilia and more. An array of computers once housed at Seattle&#8217;s Living Computers Museum + Labs have grabbed much of the pre-sale attention because of Allen&#8217;s establishment of the now-closed institution and his history with Microsoft and personal computing.
