This makes me a bit nervous, because when I move home from work, I wouldn't exactly be happy with spending 2 hours on every of the 3 new colours I just ordered of the same brand, for example.</p> <p>I absolutely adore the concept and would love to dive into it myself, but this ha some on the fence.</p> <p>what is you guys' perspective on the matter.</p> <p>edit: the person I know has a bambulab X1C and I was looking at possibly getting a bambulab a1 mini</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr

The settings, the calibrations and all the failed prints after tweaking to get some more juice out of the machine. </p> <p>Now for my question, when are you not a beginner anymore? I’ve watch a ton of YT vids about “buy this beginner friendly printer!” or “the perfect printer for a beginner” and so fourth. </p> <p>For me, I feel like I passed that beginner stage already after a week of twiddling with the machine. However, I haven’t gone into messing with gcode yet, or if I ever will. </p> <p>And some say, that a beginner friendly printer is a printer you need to learn everything about, while others say a beginner friendly one is a printer you can just hit print on your phone and it prints it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sensicase"> /u/sensicase </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://w
