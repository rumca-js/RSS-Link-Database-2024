<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 21 August 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01984-z">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01984-z</a></p>A polymer-free 3D printing technique of metals and alloys, using two-photon decomposition and optical force trapping, is presented. It achieves dense and smooth nanostructures with a resolution beyond optical limits.
