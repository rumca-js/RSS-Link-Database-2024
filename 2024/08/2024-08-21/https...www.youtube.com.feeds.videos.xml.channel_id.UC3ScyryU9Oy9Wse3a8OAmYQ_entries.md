Tracey Quillen Carney is Delaware’s First Lady. From 1984 to 2002, she worked as a writer in then-Senator Joe Biden’s office in Wilmington, and later worked on the Judiciary Committee staff during Biden’s term as chairman.

The following interview was conducted by the Kirk Documentary Group’s Mike Wiser for FRONTLINE on May 29, 2024, prior to Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential race. It has been edited for clarity and length.
