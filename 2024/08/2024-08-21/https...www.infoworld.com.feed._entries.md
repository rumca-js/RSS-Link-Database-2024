<p></p><p>More than 97% of respondents to GitHub’s <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/research/survey-ai-wave-grows/">AI in software development 2024 survey</a> said they had used AI coding tools at work, but only 38% of US-based developers said their organizations actively encouraged adoption. The survey report was released on August 20. </p>



<p></p><p>Of the four countries featured—the USA, Brazil, Germany, and India—only the United States found a shortage of organizations actively encouraging adoption. The survey polled 2,000 non-student, enterprise respondents, with 500 from each country. The majority of respondents were developers, engineers, and programmers. </p>

<p>During the opening of <a href="https://focus.dotnetconf.net/agenda">.NET Conf Focus on AI</a> on August 20, Microsoft’s Scott Hanselman described AI and .NET as a “match made in heaven.” Hanselman, who is vice president of the developer community, cited the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2337328/copilot-runtime-building-ai-into-windows.html">Copilot</a> AI-based pair programming tool as one example of a .NET integration with AI.

<p>Microsoft has released a new, updated set of its Phi <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3480593/small-language-models-and-open-source-are-transforming-ai.html">small language models</a> on Hugging Face, which it claims outperforms similar offerings from rival model providers, including Meta and Google.</p>



<p>In an update to the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2337210/microsoft-unveils-phi-3-family-of-small-language-models.html">Phi 3 platform released in April</a>, the cloud services provider unveiled three Phi 3.5 models under the open MIT License — Phi 3.5-MoE-instruct, Phi 3.5-mini-instruct, and Phi 3.5-vision-instruct.</p>

<p>It can sometimes be overwhelming keeping up with everything happening in the world of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/javascript">JavaScript</a>, but I think JavaScript developers mostly know we are lucky. We get to work in a space where smart people are constantly generating new ideas. We are surrounded by peers who are freely available and actively engaged, a high-water mark in open source creativity.</p>



<p>There are various ways to stay abreast of the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3479069/11-reasons-the-new-javascript-isnt-like-the-old-javascript.html">changing JavaScript landscape</a>, but possibly the most comprehensive is to watch for the results of the annual <em>State o

<p>The most powerful and flexible data science tool is a programming language. Sometimes the only way to properly solve a data science problem is to roll your own solution, even if it’s only a few lines of code. But programming languages can also take time to master, and the language you choose will be influenced by many things, including your existing programming experience, the problem scope, and whether you need to prioritize execution speed or development speed.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll look at three of the programming languages with the biggest impact on modern data science. These languages are critical not only for their power and speed, but also for convenience and how they enable da

<p>One of the most exciting developments in API security is the growing consensus that API discovery and risk assessment are necessary first steps to improve API security. However, several factors make the API attack surface difficult for an organization to discover and measure without purpose-built tools.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3269878/what-is-an-api-application-programming-interfaces-explained.html">APIs</a> are dark by their very nature. You can’t just fire up a web browser and explore all your APIs running in production. Many organizations experience a loss in visibility into their operations as they have transitioned from web-based to API-based systems. The bigges

<p>Facebook parent Meta’s AI research team is working on developing what it calls a Self-Taught Evaluator for <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2338327/large-language-models-are-the-new-cloud-battleground.html">large language models (LLMs)</a> that could help enterprises reduce their time and human resource requirements while developing custom LLMs.  </p>



<p>Earlier this month, the social media giant’s AI research team, dubbed Meta FAIR, published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02666v2">paper on the technology</a>, which claims that these evaluators could help an LLM create its own training data — synthetic data — for evaluation purposes.</p>
