## Xbox Boss Phil Spencer Explains Why Indy Is Coming to PlayStation 5 - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
Xbox dropped a new trailer for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle during yesterda's gamescom 2024 Opening Night Live festivities. But aside from the new gameplay footage, behind-the-scenes peeks, and cool cinematics, the biggest thing to come from that trailer was that it's arriving on PS5 next year. That would make Indy the latest first-party Xbox game to make its way to a competing console following Pentiment, Hi-Fi Rush, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded (not to mention Call of Duty). Xbox's Phil Spencer explained the decision in a roundabout way, that basically boils down to those games that they brought to Nintendo Switch and PS5 did really well, and Indiana Jones has a much better chance of selling well if the PS5 gets it, too. Also, Secret Level, a new Prime Video show from Tim Miller and Blur Studio, was revealed and we think we spotted Keanu Reeves in it.
