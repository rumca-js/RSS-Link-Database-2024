<p>While NASA and Boeing engineers swear they are nearing a decision on how to best return Starliner crew members Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to Earth, the astronauts apparently have had plenty to do in the meantime.

<p>I graduated from college a whole six years ago, but I will always remember my very first college move-in. It was rainy, there was a line to use the elevators, and I saw lots of parents holding Keurig coffee makers that wouldn&#8217;t fit in the housing cart packed with a Tetris level of efficiency. As [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Around 4.5 billion years ago, a Mars-sized protoplanet referred to as Theia had a very bad day. Its orbit set it on a collision course with another, larger protoplanet, and the two came together with such force that Theia was essentially obliterated. In fairness, the other protoplanet didn’t fare much better: the force of the [&#8230;]</p>

The roughly 50 million-year-old animal lineage shows evidence of their own culture, can take down yachts, hunt predators in groups, and may even have their own alphabet. Now, a new study of humpback whales (Megaptera [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Did anybody mention that becoming a homeowner would turn you into a full-time DIYer? Renters aren’t immune, either. A scuff in your living room paint? That’s annoying enough.

But with all the universe to choose [&#8230;]</p>
