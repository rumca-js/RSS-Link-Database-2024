But it feels like extra busy-work that slows us down \u2013 and they hardly ever catch any bugs anyway\u2026\n\nMaybe we\u2019ve even tried TDD, and felt that it was just adding even more ceremony to the problem with no real advantages.\n\nBut the advantages are definitely there! We just need a good grounding in what TDD _actually_ is (and isn\u2019t) and how to do it properly \u2013 especially in the context of C++, which brings its own idiosyncrasies and", "id": 1036705, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdkq_07GGQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "source_obj__id": 420, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/pTdkq_07GGQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Interview With Phil Nash (Accelerated TDD: For More Productive C++) - CppCon 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
