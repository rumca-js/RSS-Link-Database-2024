	X-Twitter under Elon Musk has been a mixed bag, though mostly positive. One major improvement, the majorest improvement, was the expansion of "Community Notes." Now the media and the "independent" "fact" checkers get fact-checked themselves. Corporate journalismers no longer get away with spreading bullplop on behalf of Democrats. Case in point: Axios got busted for shilling on behalf of Kamala Harris AGAIN! This time, about price controls.

<p>Night ONE of our two night DNC Live Fact-Checking Extravaganza. Up first, Weird Tim Walz. <strong><a href="https://rumble.com/c/StevenCrowder" target="_blank">The fun starts TONIGHT at 9:00 PM Eastern on Rumble</a>.</strong></p>
<p>This one could prove to be tricky because, at this point, what HASN‚ÄôT Tim Walz lied about? He‚Äôs lied about his military service, how his children were made, about being a head coach‚Ä¶ the list goes on. But we have the best team in the business to fact-check ALL of it!</p>
<p>And of course, we‚Äôll have the notorious LwC Drinking Game rules. Because no one should have to sit through a Tim Walz speech sober. Just ask Kamala Harris.</p>
