What does that mean for the future of these tools? Here is my take on this: for the community having someone pour money into it can create some challenges. For the PSF and the core Python project this is something that should be considered. However having seen the code and what uv is doing, even in the worst possible future this is a very forkable and maintainable thing. I believe that even in case Astral shuts down or were to do something incredibly dodgy licensing wise, the community would be better off than before uv existed.</p></blockquote><p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/8/21/harvest-season/\">Armin Ronacher</a></p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/python\">python</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/uv\">uv</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/astral\">astral</a>, <a ", "id": 1036431, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/21/armin-ronacher/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Quoting Armin Ronacher", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-21T01:29:54+00:00", "description": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/alsuren/sixdofone/blob/3ed09b930b1bf6e553b382588ab41d0c43a52744/app.py#L1-L14\">#!/usr/bin/env uv run</a></strong></p>\nThis is a really neat pattern.
