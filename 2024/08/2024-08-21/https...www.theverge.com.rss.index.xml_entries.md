  <p id="YMtiY9">Microsoft’s latest monthly security update is wreaking havoc on dual-boot Windows and Linux systems. The software giant issued a security patch last week to fix a two-year-old vulnerability in the GRUB open-source boot loader used by lots of Linux devices. Microsoft’s patch wasn’t supposed to hit dual-boot devices, but many have found it has and it’s now stopping their Linux installs from booting properly.</p>

  <p id="vhyTej">JBL has announced an upgraded version of its first wireless earbuds with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23328582/jbl-touchscreen-tour-pro-2-charging-case-one-m2-features">touchscreen charging case</a>. The new JBL Tour Pro 3’s case features a larger screen and now works as a transmitter, broadcasting audio to the earbuds from a wired source such as a plane’s in-flight entertainment system. However, that larger screen also comes with a steeper price tag. They’ll sell for $299, which is nearly $50 more than the JBL Tour Pro 2.</p>
