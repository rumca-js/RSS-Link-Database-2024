<p>Her career has been defined by her status as an insurgent critic. But she and the Democratic establishment need each other</p><p>She spoke loudly and with confidence, gesticulated broadly, and returned, several times over the course of her seven-minute remarks, to the struggles of working families. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman from New York and standard-bearer for the post-Bernie Sanders US left, may have been an unlikely choice for a lengthy primetime speech at the Democratic national convention’s opening night. The last time she spoke at the Democratic convention, in 2020, she was given just a minute and a half, in which she indicted the party establishment from the left and endorsed Sanders’ campaign for the nomination, which by then had failed.</p><p>But this time, the party showcased Ocasio-Cortez as one of its prime talents, and her rhetoric was starkly different.

But my family’s story is just one piece of the puzzle. Indian-American food is some of the most exciting and accessible Indian cooking out there. It’s a cuisine shaped by waves of immigration, resourceful home cooks and generations determined to preserve their heritage while creating new traditions that honour their adopted homeland along the way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/aug/21/indian-american-recipes-kale-pakoras-keralan-fried-chicken-khushbu-shah">Continue reading...</a>
