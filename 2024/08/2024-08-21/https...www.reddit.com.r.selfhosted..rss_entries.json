I know usb DAS systems should generally be avoided for a nas... and especially for something like TrueNAS. Are there similar concerns for using a usb DAS as a small storage pool for a jellyfin server? It will not be shared out over a network or used for anything other than jellyfin nor will it be running anything other than perhaps an mdadm array. Also only 2 drives so not a huge pool.</p> <p>Edit - I realize I could have phrased my question better. I get the diff between a NAS and DAS... I see it said many times that a usb das should not be used as the storage on a NAS system, that you should always attach via sata or even better an HBA in the server... etc...
