Representatives from the Mayor’s Office, the Office of Economic Development, and the Office of the Waterfront and Civic Projects gathered at City Hall Wednesday for a media roundtable to recap the first year of Mayor Bruce Harrell’s Downtown Activation Plan to revitalize the city core post-pandemic. &#8220;Downtown is going through a major metamorphosis, and it&#8217;s certainly not easy and it&#8217;s not always linear,&#8221; said&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/a-year-into-downtown-activation-plan-reviving-seattle-relies-on-more-than-return-of-office-workers/">Read More</a>

The startup has developed a tool called Digital Winglets that helps passenger and cargo airlines optimize their fuel use while at flying at cruising altitudes. The software incorporates real-time data about wind, weather, the speed and weight of a plane, air traffic and other parameters, along with a plane&#8217;s Aircraft Performance Model, which includes details on the specific characteristics of the aircraft, its engines and the degradation of these components over time. The company&#8217;s Digital Winglets tool ingests all of this information&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattles-apijet-lands-4-5m-grant-from-the-faa-to-enhance-tool-for-fuel-efficient-flights/">Read M

Surreal Holdings of Alpharetta, Ga., alleges that AWS wrongly terminated their broader software development agreement and owes more than $1.27 million. According to the suit, Amazon cited Surreal&#8217;s promotion of the Emirates project on its website, and its inclusion of the AWS and Emirates logos in a site footer, as breaches of confidentiality to justify terminating the larger agreement. The lawsuit, filed Aug. 15 in U.S. District Court in Seattle, links to&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/software-firm-sues-amazon-in-contract-dispute-over-emirates-vr-experience-at-dubai-airshow/">Read More</a>

For roughly $40,000, that scenario could be a reality. The upcoming Christie&#8217;s auction of more than 150 assorted items from the Paul G. Allen Collection will feature computing equipment and artifacts, historic letters, artworks, space-related memorabilia and more. An array of computers once housed at Seattle&#8217;s Living Computers Museum + Labs have grabbed much of the pre-sale attention because of Allen&#8217;s establishment of the now-closed institution and his history with Microsoft and personal computing.

But while generative AI may help level the playing field by providing students who normally wouldn’t have access to college tutors or advisors, the ethical implications of using these tools are still unclear, at all levels of education. “This is a huge question in education right now,” said Jennifer Rubin, a senior researcher at foundry10. “What does ethical use of generative AI look like?” In the study, Rubin found&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/study-shows-how-students-and-teachers-are-using-ai-for-college-essays/">Read More</a>
