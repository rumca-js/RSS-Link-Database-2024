Black Myth: Wukong on the PS5, just like its PC counterpart, is a fantastic experience. But what about performance? Are there any graphical modes? How is the image quality? How stable is the game?

The PS5 version comes packed with three different graphical settings: Quality, Balance and Performance. Each of those modes perform well and although there is scope for improvement and further optimization, the minor issues aren't a deal breaker by any means.

Black Myth: Wukong excels in engaging combat, intriguing boss fights, exploration and solid progression system. Although the lack of an in-game map hurts the experience, its negatives don't ever eclipse the many positives the game has.

Black Myth: Wukong is a must play for fans of the action role playing genre, and is one of the best games available on the PS5.
