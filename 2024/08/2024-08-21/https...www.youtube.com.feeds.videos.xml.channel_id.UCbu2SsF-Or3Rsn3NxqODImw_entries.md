History is built in layers. 

This was the key concept Firaxis kept in mind as it planned Civilization VII, the next entry in its long-running 4X strategy series. Civilizations are not static; they rise and fall, and new cultures take over and build on top of them. With Civ VII, Firaxis is aiming to make its playable journey through history more dynamic than ever, capturing how civilizations themselves change and adapt over time.
