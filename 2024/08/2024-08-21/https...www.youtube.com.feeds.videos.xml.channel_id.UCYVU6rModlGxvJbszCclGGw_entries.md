You give your mobile phone number to any Internet platform that asks for it. They claim it is for your security as a Two-Factor Authentication method. The truth? It is for KYC - to ID You. It is your ID card on the Internet.

It is not a given that you accept this. Because when you willy nilly just give them your phone number, it will often result in a complete loss of privacy, where everything you do is tied to your real identity.

I will give you solutions to determine if you're being scammed, and how to protect yourself if the site still requires a phone number. Some requests are valid so you need to be able to tell.
