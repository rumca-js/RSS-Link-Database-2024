<p>More than half a year since its launch, Apple’s Vision Pro has attracted only muted interest from businesses. The augmented reality headset holds greater appeal to large firms, however, as well as in particular industry sectors.</p>



<p>That’s according to a recent International Data Corporation (IDC) survey <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US52500924" target="_blank">report</a>, which polled 402 US-based IT managers and employees with responsibility for purchasing AR/VR devices.</p>



<p>The survey, conducted in June this year, showed that 35% of the repondents were “very interested” or “somewhat interested” in the device.</p>

<p>The lawsuit is the latest in a series of high-profile legal actions brought by copyright holders against AI companies for their use of protected materials including a

<p>Teams users can now access work, education, and personal accounts in the same app, Microsoft announced on Tuesday.</p>



<p>Microsoft introduced the original Teams app for workplace collaboration in 2017, with a separate app for conversations with friends and family appearing in 2020. Users had to install two different Teams apps on their PCs if they wanted to use the platform for both work and personal text chats and video calls.</p>



<p>Now users can access both their personal and work accounts from a single Teams app for Windows 11, Windows 10, and macOS, Microsoft said in a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/unified-teams-app-for-work-personal-and-educati

<p>Last week, Microsoft released a security patch that is supposed to fix <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2022-2601" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">CVE-2022-2601</a>, a two-year-old vulnerability in the GRUB bootloader.</p>



<p>However, something went wrong with the update and as a result, Linux-based systems refuse to boot on computers with dual operating systems.</p>



<p>When users try to boot the system, they get an error message saying “Verifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation. Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation.”</p>

<p>Data encryption is critical. Whether you’re using a PC provided by your employer or working from your own personal computer, encryption ensures that thieves and anyone else who might get their hands on your PC can’t view any sensitive private data.</p>



<p>Storage encryption can be complex on Windows PCs. This guide will tell you everything you need to know, including the difference between traditional BitLocker encryption and new “Device Encryption,” how to ensure your PC’s data is safe, and how to encrypt removable devices — just in case.</p>
