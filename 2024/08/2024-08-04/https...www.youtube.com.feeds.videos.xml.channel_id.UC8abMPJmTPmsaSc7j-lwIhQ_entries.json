Created by French inventor and artist Charles-\u00c9mile Reynaud, this short film predates traditional cinema, offering a fascinating glimpse into the earliest experiments with projected moving images.\n\nReynaud didn't just make a film; he created a whole system for its presentation.  His invention, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique (Optical Theater), was a complex apparatus that projected hand-painted images onto a screen, creating the illusion of movement. Each image was meticulously drawn on a transparent strip, then mounted onto a band with perforations. This band was then manipulated through the projector, allowing Reynaud to control the timing and flow of the story.", "id": 973274, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IotbPZ7DCqs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC8abMPJmTPmsaSc7j-lwIhQ", "source_obj__id": 241, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/IotbPZ7DCqs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "(1892):  Pauvre Pierrot, the oldest animation movie.", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
