I see a thing that I love, like VR, and I like to imagine the best outcomes for it. You know, like Sony actually bringing a new Astrobot to the PS VR2, or say, smaller, lighter, cheaper headsets for all. Obviously I'm disappointed every time - newer headsets seem to be getting <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-unveils-3499-augmented-reality-vision-pro-headset\" target=\"_blank\">impossibly expensive</a> and, well, of course Sony's gone done a Sony with the PS VR2.</p><p>One of my biggest dreams though, is that one day, in the future, every game released would come with a hybrid VR mode. A simple toggle at the start, like Capcom put in Resident Evil 7, that gives players the choice to either experience the game in VR, or enjoy it in flat screen on whatever TV or monitor they choose. </p><p>While this dream seems", "id": 972803, "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-running-in-6dof-vr-lets-us-live-out-the-fantasy-of-a-hybrid-future", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/b1_HcQK0XF.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Visions of Mana running in 6DoF VR lets us live out the fantasy of a hybrid future", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-04T11:07:16+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Key-Art-2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>Humble Games' last release before the studio was \"restructured\" last week, B&otilde;: Path of the Teal Lotus, has launched a Patreon to support the game \"in these uncertain times\".</p><p>Writing on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, developer Squid Shock said that whilst it did not fault the team's work, Humble's changes \"have meant we have missed out on critical post-launch support, which may put our studio's future at risk\".</p><p>Although Humble has disputed the statements of former staff that characterised the layoffs as a shutdown, instead insisting laying off its staff is merely a \"restructuring\", Squid Shock also describes the changes as \"shutting down\".</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-final-release-before-restructuring-has-launched-a-patreon-in-these-uncertain-times\">Read more</a></p>", "id": 972804, "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-final-release-before-restructuring-has-launched-a-patreon-in-these-uncertain-times", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Key-Art-2.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Humble Games' final release before \"restructuring\" has launched a Patreon \"in these uncertain times\"", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
