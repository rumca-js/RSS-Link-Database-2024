A new CBS News poll finds Kamala Harris with a slight edge over Donald Trump nationally and tied across the battleground states, and CBS News elections and surveys executive director Anthony Salvanto joined "Face the Nation" to discuss its latest findings. Calling it a "big reset," he pointed out that President Biden, when he was still in the race, trailed Trump by 5 points, but with Harris as the presumptive nominee, "you see more Democrats now say not only are they excited about Harris as the nominee, but that they're going to vote," Salvanto said. Core Democratic constituencies are saying they're going to vote, including Black and women voters, Salvanto said. He also noted that on the question of having the mental and cognitive ability to serve, she leads Trump.

Wall Street Journal assistant editor Paul Beckett, who was tasked by the Journal with coordinating its effort to secure the release of reporter Evan Gershkovich, discussed the Journal's open and "loud" approach. "The Russians didn't give us much of a choice because they came out and said he is a spy — total nonsense. But what were we going to do, then, I mean, we had to very, very quickly and very loudly, make it very clear to the world that he works for the Wall Street Journal and The Wall Street Journal only," he said in an interview with Ed O'Keefe on "Face the Nation." But Beckett also said he thought the Biden administration "had an idea of what it would take to get him back from the moment he was seized. And I don't think that changed. For all our noise, I don't think the dynamic changed."
