<p>House of the Dragon 2&#215;05 &#8220;Regent&#8221; is the fifth episode of the second season of House of the Dragon. It follows up the incredible episode, &#8220;The Red Dragon and the Gold.&#8221; That episode was, justifiably, viewed as one of the best episodes of the series and was the highest rated one of the season. Unfortunately, House of the Dragon has slipped this episode as the incredible escalation in scale and spectacle is followed by a bunch of meaningless naval gazing.

User terms and conditions apply. And, well, wouldn’t ya know it, the hero has succumbed to the most unlikely of deaths due to an injury somewhere they probably weren’t as impervious as everywhere else. Or they were missing their impenetrable macguffin. So let’s break apart the history and myths of the unbreakable heroes as it were and see what’s what! HERO 1: ACHILLES You’ve probably heard of him, famous for his mommy dipping him in the river Styx (record scratch). Except…that’s a myth on top of the myth that’s been around for a long time and constantly retold until it’s been believed. In the original Iliad, Achilles bleeds. And, if it bleeds, you can kill it! Wait, wrong franchise. But anyways, in the earliest version of the Iliad, his mother, the witch Thetis, wants to try to drown Achilles i
