The game features three playable factions, each with wildly different gameplay styles and aesthetics, as well as an emphasis on online multiplayer and co-op. For newer players, the game also features a \u201cBuddy AI\u201d that can help them out by taking care of some of the upkeep often required in longer multiplayer matches. \n\nWhile its campaign is quite short owing to its early access launch, Stormgate still has plenty of content for fans of the genre. The multiplayer mode has plenty of modes, and most interestingly of all, each of the factions is different enough where it might sometimes feel like you\u2019re playing an entirely new game.", "id": 973454, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4K_ItpjCsk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/W4K_ItpjCsk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Is This the StarCraft 3 You've Been Waiting For?
