It follows up the incredible episode, &#8220;The Red Dragon and the Gold.&#8221; That episode was, justifiably, viewed as one of the best episodes of the series and was the highest rated one of the season. Unfortunately, House of the Dragon has slipped this episode as the incredible escalation in scale and spectacle is followed by a bunch of meaningless naval gazing. Basically, not much happens in this episode and what does happen is of questionable storytelling merit. If that sounds like I&#8217;m being extra harsh on this episode, I am. It&#8217;s slow and reminds me that we could have used some of this time to expand on the previous season&#8217;s hefty-duty politics that were rushed through.

And, well, wouldn\u2019t ya know it, the hero has succumbed to the most unlikely of deaths due to an injury somewhere they probably weren\u2019t as impervious as everywhere else.
