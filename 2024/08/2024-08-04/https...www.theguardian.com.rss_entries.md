<p>A fuller appreciation of the sounds that surround us can transform your life</p><p>The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche wrote that life without music would be a mistake. I agree, but I’d expand the frame to include a wide variety of other human and non-human sounds. For me, the world is often auraculous or “ear-marvellous” – full of noises, which, to cite Caliban in Shakespeare’s <em>The Tempest, “</em>give delight and hurt not”.</p><p>Among my earliest memories as a small child is the sound, on a summer evening, of a peal of church bells echoing off the hillsides around the village in Hampshire where my grandparents lived. Over the years since then I have been intrigued by sounds of almost every kind – though I do exclude a few, such as some of those in the genre of music known as “noise”, which a friend says he finds soothing, but which I find about as welcome as putting my head in a buzzsaw.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/04/ear-marvellous-how-to-

<p>When Nadia Nadarajah takes the stage at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre from tonight as Cleopatra, she will fulfil a longheld dream: to show others how far you can go as ‘a deaf brown woman who uses sign language and doesn’t speak’</p><p>The day before our interview, in a third-floor studio decked out like a 1990s school gym, I get a brief glimpse of actor Nadia Nadarajah in action. It’s just gone 2pm, late in this unique production of <em>Antony &amp; Cleopatra</em>’s third rehearsal week of four. Opening night is just weeks away, next door in the 1,500 capacity Shakespeare’s Globe. Printouts line the walls: sketches of costumes; history factsheets; headshots of the 50+ strong on and off-stage team. Collectively, theirs is a grand ambition: to bring, for the first time, a bilingual English/British Sign Language production to the main stage in a major British theatre for a full-length run for deaf and hearing audiences alike. Its cast of 14 are split near equally between hearing and de

<p><strong>Williamson Park, Lancaster</strong><br />Andrew Pollard turns Lewis Carroll’s classic into a delightful quest, tirelessly acted and cleverly designed</p><p>We are sitting in a wooded dell, ranged on felled tree trunks around a small clearing. The summer’s evening is warm; fairy lights in bunting twinkle between branches. Four children arrive, with their stomping, snapping, camping-trip leader, Miss Dodgson. “Where are we?” she barks. One of the children, Lewis, consults a map: “Wonderland.” Dodgson snatches it from him: “Unfold it, silly! Now see what it says – Water on Blanding!” As it turns out, of course, Lewis is right. We are all in a wonderland of sorts – the make-believe world created by the Dukes theatre company in Williamson Park.</p><p>Andrew Pollard’s script reframes Lewis Carroll’s 1865 story as a quest. When Lewis is snatched by the vicious and voracious Jabberwock, Alice sets out to rescue her fellow camper. Encounters along the way provide the “weapons” she w

<p>My daughter must have nursery rhymes… It is one of her gravest crimes</p><p>My daughter slumps in the crook of my arm. She’s so tired she keeps rolling her head on to my shoulder and rubbing her eyes with tiny fists. But those fists are clenched with determination. We are in her bedroom and she won’t sleep until she gets her story so, to delay this further, she rejects every book in our house, save for one: a bumper compendium of nursery rhymes designed explicitly to test my patience.</p><p>She must know I don’t like this book, both because I am a learned and sophisticated man and because I show her every other book beforehand. She glides right past her old favourites, made from thick card and showing animals or vehicles with paws, bumpers, ears and headlamps made from different strips of material – Velcro, cotton, laminated card – solemnly intoning that this puppy or that bus cannot belong to her because it’s too scratchy, soft or shiny. Those are real literature, even if I do won

<p>The new liquid blushers make beauty into art </p><p>Unlike powder blushers that can easily go down the 80s soap star route, liquid blushers leave a natural flush that blurs the lines between the blush and your skin. A soft, subtle effect – like a Turner watercolour. Back in the day, however, liquid blushers didn’t work on darker skin tones – I remember seeing my liquid blusher disappear into nothingness on my skin. Now they are better formulated, and many have skincare benefits.

But this is not a surprise: we are on the island of Tinos, outside one of the holiest sites in Greece.

<p>A brown-paper-wrapped delight for your child, or inner child</p><p>I feel I talk a lot about tuck boxes. This is maybe because, ignoring conveniently the dark side of them, I do fetishise boarding schools. This was fuelled early by Enid Blyton’s St Clare’s books. Books to which I returned often, way into adult hood, when the world seemed too big.</p><p>There was always clear justice in Blyton’s books: you do good and you come good, you do bad and, well, you’re forgiven because you’re sorry and promise to do better. This was justice, and reflection, often lacking in the topsy-turvy real world. And then there were the tuck boxes, brimming with implausibly paired goods, such as sardines and tinned peaches and birthday cakes, that defied delivery services to arrive intact and raring to be sliced into greedily.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/aug/04/notes-on-chocolate-an-outrageous-tuck-box-treat">Continue reading...</a>

The thing the vines love most about the coast is ultimately the same as what leads us to the beach when the mercury rises: the sea regulates the temperature, taking the edge off extremes of heat and cold. That helps ensure a slower, more even ripening of the grapes, preserving acidity and ultimately producing more balanced, lively wines.
