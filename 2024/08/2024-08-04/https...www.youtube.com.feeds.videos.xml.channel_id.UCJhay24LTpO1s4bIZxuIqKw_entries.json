This talk will take you through forty years of file IO from the viewpoint of a game programmer trying to squeeze every last ounce of speed from their device. Along the way, expect answers to questions like:\nWhy do we have files?\nWhat is a filesystem?\nWhy should we avoid buffered file IO?\nHow do we optimise unbuffered file IO?\nHow might the standard help us in future?\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2024/\nSponsored By think-cell\n---\n\nGuy Davidson\n\nGuy Davidson has been writing games for most of his life now. He is a co-author of Beautiful C++. He serves on the ISO C++ standards committee and the UK programming languages standards committee. He plays the piano and sings quite a lot.\n---\n\nThe ACCU Conference is the annual conference of the ACCU membership, but is open to any and all who wish to attend.
