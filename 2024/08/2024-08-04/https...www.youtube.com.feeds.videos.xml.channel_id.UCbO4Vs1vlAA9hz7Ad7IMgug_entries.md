Welcome back to Inside Tabletop. In this series I talk to people that live and work in Gaming, getting them to share their insights on the business of game entertainment. 

Today I'm sitting down with series-favourite Chris from Lords of War Games and Hobbies as we discuss our take-aways from the 2023-24 Games Workshop Annual Report. 

That coffee you see in the foreground seems to have messed up the focus on my camera, which I didn't discover until after. Luckily we correct this in the next couple videos... but the audio is all that matters anyway. 

If you're a Patron; this episode is also available as an exclusive audio Podcast today as well!
