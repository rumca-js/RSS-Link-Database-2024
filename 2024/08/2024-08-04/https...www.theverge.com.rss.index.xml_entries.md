  <p id="LNkIcn">It’s impressive watching Apple sell people virtually the same Apple Watch design year in and year out, adding a feature here and there but changing precious little about the way it looks. It’s also fine — nobody actually needs to buy a new watch annually, but it does make the yearly refresh sort of ho-hum.</p>

  <p id="dCCNtC">We’ve been living with social media for a long time now — Facebook opened up to the public in 2006 — and that means a lengthy trail of posts stretching back through the years. While this does let you take a nostalgic trip into the past with just a few clicks, it can also bring up some embarrassing and awkward memories.</p>
