<p>Sean Wang’s award-winning debut is a tender, semi-autobiographical portrait of a 13-year-old skateboarder and his devoted immigrant mum in 00s California</p><p>It takes a certain maturity to make – and appreciate – a good coming-of-age film. Sean Wang’s debut feature is the tale of Chris Wang (Izaac Wang, no relation to the director), a Taiwanese American boy growing up in the Bay Area, California, in the late 00s – a time of AOL Instant Messenger and emo punk posturing. But it’s also about Chris’s mum, Chungsing (Joan Chen), offering a compassionate insight into the struggles of an immigrant parent that few self-involved 13-year-olds could muster.</p><p>The tender teen years have been lovingly chronicled by successive generations of first-time US film-makers, but up until fairly recently it was rare for kids such as Chris – the children of immigrants from places like India, Korea, China and Iran – to see their young lives reflected on screen with any kind of cultural specificity.
