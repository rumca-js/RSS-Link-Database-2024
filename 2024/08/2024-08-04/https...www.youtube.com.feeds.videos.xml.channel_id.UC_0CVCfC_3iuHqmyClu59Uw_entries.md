In this video we put together a super cheap 
4240 1080P Bazzite Linux gaming pc with used parts from eBay. you can also use this setup with windows installed but I really wanted a living room gaming pc with a nice console style interface like the steam deck but wanted a bit more power. This Budget gaming pc is powered by a Ryzen 5 3500 and backed by an AMD Radeon RX 590 and handles 1080P gaming very well like Cyberpunk 2077, Ghost of Tsushima, Skyrim, and many more.
