<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Our modem is far from the balcony and the connection isn't stable when we're at the balcony, so I decided to use my Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB) as Wi-Fi hotspot (sorry if I'm using incorrect terms, English isn't my mother tongue and I'm new into this hobby). Since I'm using the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS, I created Wi-Fi hotspot using the WLAN menu on the taskbar following <a href="https://astroisk.nl/astronomy-in-the-field-setting-up-a-raspberry-pi-5-as-a-wifi-access-point/">this guide</a>. Initially it was working fine, but then I tried to install Pi-hole and had to meddle with some configurations such as dnsmasq because of port overlapping. I couldn't get Pi-hole to start working so I uninstalled it but now my devices can't connect to the hotspot and give IP assignment error. My first thought was that it's probably related to dnsmasq service so I reinstalled dnsmasq and checked the configuration files but saw that some configuration files seem to

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I've connected my Bluetooth headphones successfully, and they work fine in other programs (eg Firefox).</p> <p>But when I launch Kodi, they are disconnected, as if Bluetooth has been shut off. They do not appear in Kodi's audio settings.</p> <p>Upon closing Kodi, they immediately reconnect to the pi (which is how I know they're disconnecting when it launches).</p> <p>I've tried installing and removing PulseAudio and the pulse audio Bluetooth module, and futzing around with trying to force Kodi to use the headphones on advancedsettings.xml without luck - probably because they're not even connected while Kodi is open.</p> <p>I sshed in to see what was going on with the Bluetooth, and discovered something bizarre. If I am sshed in to the pi while launching Kodi, it works perfectly. The headphones remain connected, sound plays normally through the headphones in Kodi. But, if I disconnect the SSH session, shortly afterwards the headphones disconnect again.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I am using a Waveshare IVP hat to gather the tachometer signal from my '77 MBZ W123. There is no tachometer signal build into the car, so I figured the best way to get it will be to use a hall sensor and some magnets.</p> <p>I determined that the easiest place to epoxy magnets is on the power steering pump pulley. This position lets me mount the hall sensor close enough, and keep the magnets cool enough such that the don't reach their Curie temperature.</p> <p>I prototyped my idea but taping these magnets to the circumference of a Ryobi 18V drill and held the hall sensor close enough to pick up the field. I wrote some code utilizing the <a href="http://ina129.py/">INA129.py</a> example code that is supplied on the Waveshare website to, over the course of 0.1 to 1 second, determine how many passes it detected, then calculate the RPM from that. For reference, the IVP hat uses I2C to communicate with the Pi.</p> <p>My code snippet is pasted
