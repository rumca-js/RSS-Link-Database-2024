Hey Theorists, what a WILD season it's been on House of the Dragon! The faceoff between Rhaenyra Targaryen vs Alicent, Aemon, and Aegon has been one for the Game of Thrones record books. Then throw in Daemon and his crazy antics and you have yourself a real BATTLE for the Iron Throne. Of course we already _know_ what's going to happen and who will end up on the Iron Throne because of George R.R. Martin's extended readings, but today we're asking who truly BELONGS on the throne...
