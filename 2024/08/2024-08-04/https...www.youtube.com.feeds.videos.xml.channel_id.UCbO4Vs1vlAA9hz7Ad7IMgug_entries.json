In this series I talk to people that live and work in Gaming, getting them to share their insights on the business of game entertainment. \n\nToday I'm sitting down with series-favourite Chris from Lords of War Games and Hobbies as we discuss our take-aways from the 2023-24 Games Workshop Annual Report. \n\nThat coffee you see in the foreground seems to have messed up the focus on my camera, which I didn't discover until after. Luckily we correct this in the next couple videos... but the audio is all that matters anyway. \n\nIf you're a Patron; this episode is also available as an exclusive audio Podcast today as well!\n\nGMG is publicly supported.
