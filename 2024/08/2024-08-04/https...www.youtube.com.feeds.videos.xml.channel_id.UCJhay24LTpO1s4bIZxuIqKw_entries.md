File IO - Past, Present and Future - Guy Davidson - ACCU 2024
---

File IO is a fundamental aspect of system programming. This talk will take you through forty years of file IO from the viewpoint of a game programmer trying to squeeze every last ounce of speed from their device. Along the way, expect answers to questions like:
Why do we have files?
What is a filesystem?
Why should we avoid buffered file IO?
How do we optimise unbuffered file IO?
How might the standard help us in future?
