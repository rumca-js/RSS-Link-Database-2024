<p>In the early 20th century, the Wright brothers’ first flight barely left the ground, lasting just 12 seconds. But within a few decades, airplanes revolutionized global travel and connected the world in ways previously unimaginable. Today, a similar pattern is unfolding with artificial intelligence as it transitions from a niche innovation to a ubiquitous tool that is reshaping industries worldwide. Technical revolutions like this can be visualized and understood using a framework called the “S-curve.”</p>



<p>The S-curve is a graphical representation of how technology matures over time. It starts slowly, with early adopters, specialized use cases, and technocrats. As the technology proves its

Like many others, this organization made the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2336040/cloud-migration-is-still-a-pain.html">leap to the cloud</a> with the promise of scalability, agility, and cost efficiencies ringing in their ears. However, a conspicuous gap emerged as the company continued to migrate operations online.

			<p><em>Polymorphism</em> refers to the ability of some entities to occur in different forms. It is popularly represented by the butterfly, which morphs from larva to pupa to imago. Polymorphism also exists in programming languages, as a modeling technique that allows you to create a single interface to various operands, arguments, and objects. <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2255818/java-challengers-3-polymorphism-and-inheritance.html">Java polymorphism</a> results in code that is more concise and easier to maintain.</p>
<p>While this tutorial focuses on subtype polymorphism, there are several other types you should know about. We’ll start with an overview of all four types of polym
