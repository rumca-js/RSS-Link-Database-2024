Why are we here? As the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song suggests, we are stardust, the result of chemistry occurring throughout vast clouds of interstellar gas and dust. To better understand how that chemistry could create prebiotic molecules\u2014the seeds of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere\u2014researchers have investigated the role of low-energy electrons created as cosmic radiation traverses through ice particles. Their findings may also inform medical and environmental applications on our home planet.", "id": 1030571, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2024-08-extraterrestrial-chemistry-earthbound-possibilities.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 30, "page_rating_contents": 95, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed", "source_obj__id": 251, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2024/extraterrestrial-chemi.jpg", "title": "Extraterrestrial chemistry with earthbound possibilities", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-20T03:30:01+00:00", "description": "Up to a quarter of Europe could be suitable for rewilding, a new analysis has revealed.", "id": 1030573, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2024-08-rewilding-scottish-highlands-uk-30x30.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 30, "page_rating_contents": 95, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed", "source_obj__id": 251, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2024/rewilding-scottish-hig.jpg", "title": "Rewilding Scottish Highlands could help the UK hit 30x30 conservation goal", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-20T03:00:02+00:00", "description": "Researchers from the group of Prof. Carles Bo at the Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia (ICIQ-CERCA) have described a computational methodology that simulates complex processes involving different chemical species and diverse conditions.
