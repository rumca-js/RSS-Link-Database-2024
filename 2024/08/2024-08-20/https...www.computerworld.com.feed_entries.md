<p>Britain’s new Labour government is the latest legislature to consider how it might make it easier for digital workers using always-on technologies to turn them off at the end of the working day.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MakeWorkPay.pdf">Labour’s Plan to Make Work Pay</a>, published before it won the UK’s July general election, it promised to address the issue, saying “We will bring in the ‘right to switch off’ so working from home does not result in homes turning into 24/7 offices.”</p>

<p>Zoom has raised the webinar attendee limit to one million users to enable large-scale events on the video meeting platform.</p>



<p>Zoom has proved an effective fundraising and voter engagement tool for Democratic political groups in the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election, with several celebrity-led events held in support of candidate Kamala Harris pushing the limits of the app.</p>



<p>One call, targeting white women, was so popular that it <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/07/white-women-harris-broke-zoom/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">exceeded Zoom’s pre-existing 100,000 attendee cap</a>, prompting the vendor to raise the limit to 200,000 on a temporary basis.

<p><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1615878/microsoft-unveils-loop-and-a-new-collaborative-office-doc.html">Announced in 2021</a>, Loop is essentially Microsoft’s answer to the emergence of a new breed of flexible document creation apps such as <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1618681/coda-and-notion-turn-up-the-heat-on-microsoft-office.html">Notion and Coda</a>.</p>



<p>The Loop app, available with certain Microsoft 365 subscriptions since November 2023, is more complex than it may seem at first glance. It can serve as a shared workspace that multiple colleagues can edit in

<p>One of the best parts of owning a Google Pixel phone comes down to an oft-forgotten role these modern mobile devices play in our lives — and that’s the role of acting as, y’know, an actual <em>cellular telephone</em>.</p>



<p>It sounds almost funny to say in our current call-averse culture, but ask any Pixel owner, and they’ll tell you the same thing: Google’s Pixel-specific software makes the act of placing and receiving regular ol’ voice calls far more pleasant than you ever thought possible. Whether you’re dealing with calls regularly for business or even just fielding (or perhaps dodging) the occasional incoming call for <em>any</em> purpose, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/16

<p>In case you hadn’t noticed, humanoid robots have joined the workforce. </p>



<p>An evergreen staple of science fiction, autonomous AI-driven machines with feet, legs that bend at the knee, torsos, arms with hands and fingers, all topped with a head are now being deployed in real workplaces. </p>



<p>Specifically:</p>



<ul>
<li>Amazon is piloting the use of Agility Robotics’ humanoid robot, Digit, in logistics operations — mainly for picking up empty bins and returning them to where they can be filled again with merchandise. </li>

<li>Mercedes-Benz is collaborating with Apptronik to explore the use of the Apollo humanoid robot in manufacturing. (The robots deliver assembly kit
