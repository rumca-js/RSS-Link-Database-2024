Beach is one of the rare cases of a lead designer on Civilization staying in charge across multiple entries, having overseen Civ 6 before Civ 7, and who's worked on the series since long before that. A physicist turned game designer &ndash; Beach also worked on the launch of the Hubble telescope, a key part of the Civ 6 scientific victory &ndash; he's also a self-confessed history nerd. As quickly evidenced.</p><p>Stood in front of a room of eager press waiting to hear the first bit of real information about a new entry to the series, Beach instead opts to pull up a map of London, under Roman rule, sourced from Encycl

It's been two years since Mafia developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-3-developer-confirms-new-mafia-development">confirmed it was working on a new entry</a> in its open-world crime series, and the time has finally come for it to be revealed to the world. It's called Mafia: The Old Country and is heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year.
</p><p>
While 2016's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a> shunted the series forward in time to the late 60s (the first two games spanned the 1930s, 40s, and 50s between them), The Old Country is going backward, presenting players with a "gritty mob story set in the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily."

Bethesda's first big expansion to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, Shattered Space, will launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S on 30th September.
</p><p>
We got a quick look at the upcoming addition tonight during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-time-where-to-watch">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live, in a trailer that mostly focused on the REV-8 land vehicle included in August's free game update.
</p><p>
Ahead of launch, marketing for Starfield felt fairly sober and dramatic - it's fair to say tonight's video takes a more upbeat tone. Previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-lack-of-ground-vehicles-is-a-deliberate-choice-bethesda-says">Bethesda's Todd Howard said that the lack of land vehicles was a de

</p><p>
Tonight also brings an initial look at gameplay from Don't Nod's latest teen adventure, which has a dual timeline split between 1995 and 2022, when its young protagonists are now adults - and dealing with the consequences of their/your actions.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> - the Microsoft-owned-Bethesda-release set to arrive on Xbox and PC this year - is also coming to PlayStation 5.

I have been enthralled by Indiana Jones ever since I was a little girl - but despite this deep affection, coming away from a hands-off preview of MachineGames' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, I just can't let myself get overly excited about the upcoming release just yet.</p><p>While I'm still looking forward to playing another narrative-driven adventure game, with that fun 'afternoon popcorn flick' energy Great Circle undoubtedly has, my immediate reaction from this first extended demo is to worry this is all it will be, leaning just a little too heavily on fan nostalgia and a tried and tested formula, but without the innovation to trul

Masters of Albion marks Molyneux's return to the genre he is widely credited with creating. It ditches his studio 22cans' previous focus on mobile development to instead target consoles as well as PC. And it's being made with help from several of Molyneux's old colleagues at his previous studios - Lionhead, Bullfrog - whose design CVs, like Molyneux's own, include a litany of 90s and 2000s classics.</p><p>On paper, all of this should inspire a positive reception.

Developer Ustwo Games has revealed its widely acclaimed Escher-esque puzzler <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monument-valley">Monument Valley</a> will return for a third outing on 10th December, and it'll be exclusively available to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> subscribers on Android and iOS devices.
</p><p>
Monument Valley 3 is described as protagonist Noor's "most extraordinary adventure yet", and it'll see players searching for a new source of power before the light of the world fades forever.
</p><p>
It promises "stunning new art styles and impossible landscapes", alongside "innovative mechanics and fresh ways to approach challenges". And one of its big new features comes in the form of sailing, with players able to roam the world - and solve some of its puzzles - by boat.

In first-person, you'll be able to do many of the things you could in those entries - including boshing your enemies in the face with your fists, grappling across gaps and using various other bat-gadgets, plus switching on Detective Vision.

ARC Raiders - the free-to-play PvPvE extraction shooter from The Finals developer Embark Studios - has resurfaced following an extended period of retooling, and is now launching as a premium title for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 next year.
</p><p>
If you're struggling to remember much about ARC Raiders, that might be because few details have been shared since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-ea-and-dice-exec-patrick-soderlund-teases-new-project">announcement back in 2021</a>. It was originally set to release in 2022, but its launch has continued to slip since then - first into 2023 so Embark could <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embark-studios-arc-raiders-delayed-into-2023">focus on The Finals</a>, and latterly while the studio continued to tinker with the title following a <a href="https://

Civilization 7, the very long-awaited latest instalment in developer Firaxis' 4X beloved strategy series, finally has a release date and will be launching for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on 11th February next year.
</p><p>
But that's not all! As well as providing a date for strategy fans to furiously circle in their 2025 calenders, Firaxis has provided a first look at Civilization 7 in action, following June's striking, if ultimately rather uninformative, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-seemingly-leaks-ahead-of-official-reveal">cinematic reveal trailer</a>.

It's been nearly four years since Tarsier Studios waved goodbye to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> after being snapped up by Embracer Group, giving developer Supermassive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-3-in-development-from-dark-pictures-studio-supermassive">a crack at</a> the much-loved Bandai-Namco-owned horror series. So what's Tarsier been doing since then? Well, it turns out the studio hasn't quite shaken off its fascination with spooky kids in scary places, as one look at its latest project, the newly unveiled Reanimal, makes clear.
</p><p>
Reanimal's gloomy nightmare-fairytale aesthetic, its gangly-limbed monsters, and its two young protagonists - all evident in its announcement trailer - are unquestionably reminiscent of Tarsier's Little Nightmares series. A

Announced during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-time-where-to-watch">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live, Dying Light: The Beast is a solo or four-player co-op experience pitched as a "tight" 18-hour ride through a fresh area of the franchise's world.

Dying Light protagonist Kyle Crane, once again voiced by Roger Craig Smith, returns here, a decade on. In-game, Crane has been in captivity, and experimented on. The upside? You have zombie DNA powers to unleash that beast on enemies.

Amazon Games has announced King of Meat, a new game from ex-Lionhead and Media Molecule developers.

</p><p>
Developer Glowmade is led by Jonny Hopper who previously worked for Lionhead on the Fable series and Media Molecule on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/littlebigplanet">LittleBigPlanet</a>, along with other staff from those companies.

Bully, Rockstar's enjoyable schoolboy adventure game, is now available as part of the GTA+ subscription on PlayStation, Xbox and "soon" on compatible iPhone and Android devices. 
</p><p>
Rockstar announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-has-remembered-bully-exists">Bully would be coming to GTA+ earlier this year</a>, back in April. We've been waiting for word on exactly when ever since.
</p><p>
It's great to have an easier way to play Bully again - though Rockstar describes the GTA+ catalogue as "rotating", so it's unclear how long it'll stick around. Also on GTA+? LA Noire, Red Dead Redemption, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-definitive-edition">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a>.

Paradox Interactive's streak of game delays continues with the news its Chinese-Room-developed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> is now targeting a release in the "first half of 2025", rather than its previously announced "late 2024" window.
</p><p>
In a post <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/whats-next-for-bloodlines-2">on its website</a>, Paradox called the delay a "proactive decision" derived from its commitment early this to deliver "high-quality games" to its players. "Though [Bloodlines 2] is in a good enough place that we could have maintained our planned release window," it continued, "Paradox and The Chinese Room collaboratively decided to prioritise polish."

If you'd be paying by more normal methods, the Series X would be &pound;321.75 and the Series S would be &pound;178.49. However, the way
