<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My son and I went in on an Elegoo Saturn 3 and after leveling, etc., our very first print failed. Whatever. Being completely ignorant, I tried to pry the failed material from the release film and pierced the film. Then, being the magnificent moron I am, I thought it must be a layer of failed resin and proceeded to pull it all off. Now, I have no way to get my resin tray off without the resin spilling EVERYWHERE because I'm a dummy. </p> <p>anyone have any pointers, or am I just going to have to sop the resin up with paper towels? and Figure It Out?</p> <p>I've also ordered a 3-pack of replacement films, one of which I shall install after this debacle is cleaned up. Really just looking for guidance/thoughts on how to clean this mess up.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dingomalloy12"> /u/dingomalloy12 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1ewt3ad/tifu_and_pierced_th
