								<p>At Wargamer, we reckon some of the most impactful and memorable experiences in tabletop adventures - whether it's <strong>DnD</strong> or any other tabletop RPG - come from character deaths. And <strong>Pathfinder 2e</strong> publisher Paizo clearly agrees, as it's giving away free copies of the game's Player Core rulebook (snazzy Sketch Cover edition) to fans who share tales of their characters' demise.</p>

								<p>Riftway Cataclysm, an indie miniature wargame that&rsquo;s free to download and can use any miniatures at all, first came to Wargamer&rsquo;s attention thanks to some great model conversions of dinosaurs with laser eyes. They&rsquo;re the work of David Rogers, an experienced Warhammer tournament player with respectable placings at the massive Las Vegas Open competition: Riftway &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/warhammer-tournament-grinder-riftway-cataclysm">Continued</a></p>

								<p>I never want to watch Alien: Romulus again, but I do want to turn it into a tabletop RPG adventure. The newest entry in Ridley Scott&rsquo;s franchise left me profoundly disappointed. However, its highlights &ndash; and its flaws &ndash; make it ideal fodder for Free League Publishing&rsquo;s existing TTRPG, Alien: The Roleplaying Game. Released in &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/alien-rpg/romulus">Continued</a></p>

								<p>Thunder Junction, the first Magic the Gathering plane inspired by Western films, was &ldquo;not a unique take on the genre&rdquo; and &ldquo;felt paper thin&rdquo;, according to head designer Mark Rosewater. Reflecting on the past year&rsquo;s Magic releases in his annual State of Design retrospective, he says &ldquo;we were too on the nose with our tropes&rdquo;. &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/head-designer-thunder-junction">Continued</a></p>
