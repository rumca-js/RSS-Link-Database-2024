<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi I’m playing around with a Bosch ME7 engine control unit. I have read the binary from the Infineon C167 microprocessor. I’d like to see what it looks like in assembly code. I’ve tried a couple things, at some point I have selected the C167CR-4RM but how can I input the .bin file to be disassembled? Or am I going about this the wrong way? I have no idea what I’m doing! Thank you </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WearyAssistance354"> /u/WearyAssistance354 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.keil.com/download/product/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1ewprr4/keil_uvision_infineon_c167/">[comments]</a></span>
