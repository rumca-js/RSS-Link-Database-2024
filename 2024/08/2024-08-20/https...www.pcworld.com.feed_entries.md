<p><em>Editor’s Note: Microsoft began shipping its unified Teams experience beginning on August 20, 2024. While Teams will eventually update itself to deliver the unified experience, you can also <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app">download the new Teams app</a> directly.  The original story, published on March 13, continues. </em></p>



<p>Have you been confused by Microsoft Teams, which offers one app for consumers and another for business users? If so, those days may be ending. </p>



<p>Microsoft is testing builds in the Windows 11 Canary and Dev Channels to streamline Teams into something that makes a little more sense: a single app. Build 26080 brings with it a unified Teams experience, allowing you to simply switch between accounts and environment rather than load separate apps for business users and consumers. You’ll simp

<p>Hackers aren’t just nerds rapidly typing away in dimly lit rooms, as seen in the movies. More and more threats are coming from what are known as “state-level hackers,” who are  teams of people — either employed directly or contracted by a government — who attack other governments, corporations, and agencies.</p>



<p>Not long ago, security researchers spotted North Korean hackers doing just that with a recently patched Windows vulnerability.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gendigital.com/blog/news/innovation/protecting-windows-users">Gen Digital</a>, a consortium of researchers from security software vendors like Norton, Avast, Avira, and AVG, says it spotted North Korean state-level hackers using a Windows zero-day exploit.

<p>Adjustable actuation keyboards, which allow you to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2250508/what-is-an-adjustable-actuation-keyboard.html">set soft or hard presses to register keystrokes</a>, are all the rage among dedicated gamers. But Valve is calling foul on one of the newest features enabled on Razer and Wooting keyboards.</p>



<p>Players who enable the “Snap Tap” mode on adjustable actuation keyboards in <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> online might get flagged for cheating.</p>



<p>We’re getting deep into the weeds of keyboard tech here, so let’s take a step back for a second: Snap Tap is a function that detects simultaneous input on two different keys and only activates the one that was detected last. That difference can come down to mere milliseconds thanks to the super-fast polling rates of today’s gaming keyboards.</p>

<p>Monitors with Nvidia’s G-Sync technology, which <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423202/g-sync-vs-freesync-amd-nvidia-monitor.html">syncs full frames between the graphics card and display panel</a> to prevent tearing, are more expensive than their AMD FreeSync counterparts. That’s because full G-Sync capabilities require an extra electronics board inside the display.</p>



<p>But according to a recent press release, new G-Sync gaming monitors from Acer, AOC, and Asus won’t need that extra board.</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/mediatek-g-sync-displays/">“G-Sync Pulsar” standard</a> is made in cooperation with chip designer MediaTek and allows the motion-smoothing tech to be integrated into a monitor’s existing primary electronics board instead of breaking it out into a separate module.</p>

<p>Hard disk drives (HDDs) offer some of the best price-to-performance value when it comes to data, and that value goes even further with larger storage capacities. You’ll really feel the price advantage of HDDs over SSDs once you enter the realm of 4TB drives and larger. </p>



<p>Whereas a 1TB SSD is often only slightly more expensive than a comparable HDD today, a 4TB SSD can cost anywhere from $200 to $300 while a 4TB HDD can be had for about $80 to $120.</p>



<p>But price isn’t the only way HDDs come out ahead. Here’s another significant advantage: HDDs are more reliable for longer-term storage of data. Big digital files (e.g., videos) and large collections (e.g., photos) can be safely archived on HDDs for years, whereas data on inactive SSDs can be lost over time as the drives leak electrons.</p>

<p>When a laptop has finally outlived its usefulness, it can be tempting to discard it, both mentally and literally, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">move on to your next laptop that’s better, faster, lighter</a>. It’s an exciting time!</p>



<p>But before you do, hold on. Don’t just throw your old laptop in the trash. For starters, you’ll want to wipe it clean of all your personal data. After that, you might be able to recoup something from it. And even if you can’t—or simply don’t want to—reclaim value from your old laptop, you <em>still</em> shouldn’t just throw it away.</p>

<p>If you had any doubts about silicon cooling chips being the wave of the future, this should help convince you: Now there are two companies operating in that space. xMEMS has announced the XMC-2400, a competitor to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1388332/new-airjet-chips-can-double-a-laptops-performance.html">Frore Systems AirJet</a> that was announced less than two years ago. </p>



<p>What xMEMS is calling the xMEMS XMC-2400 µCooling chip isn’t a direct competitor to AirJet’s laptop processor coolers, though. For now, it’s aimed at smartphones and tablets, as well as SSDs. Nevertheless, that puts it on a collision course with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2198477/frore-launches-airjet-mini-slim-cooling-chip-as-frores-law-begins.html">Frore’s AirJet Mini Slim</a> and its future roadmap.

<p>Can AI be used ethically for school work? It depends upon who you ask — quite literally.</p>



<p>That’s because less than two years after ChatGPT was originally released in November 2022, the attitudes towards AI in the classroom still vary widely. High schools have viewed AI as a crutch at best, and at worst as a tool for cheating. But several universities leave generative AI use entirely up to the discretion of the person teaching the course.</p>



<p>In general, however, the answer boils down to a single golden rule: Students should develop their own answers, incorrect or not. Any AI assistance — from editing to research to actual writing — may be seen as a violation of an academic honor code that some schools require. If AI <em>is</em> used, the thinking now is that it should be cited, like a footnote.</p>
