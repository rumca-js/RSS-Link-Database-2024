Hardware news follows a busy two weeks of AMD Zen 5 CPU releases. AMD is still in the news, but this time, it's with a rumored "new" Ryzen 5 5500X3D CPU. Other rumors include those of a 4090D with double the VRAM and an RTX 4070 SKU with downgraded VRAM to GDDR6. In actual news, the GPD Pocket 4 has some really cool modular configurations (such as a SIM card add-on slot), the Meta Quest 3S has seen a leak, Valve is bringing Steam OS to the ASUS ROG Ally, and the US government wants to make it easier to get out of recurring subscription payments.
