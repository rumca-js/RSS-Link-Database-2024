<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi self-hosters,</p> <p>It's been a while since I posted about the latest release of Isaiah, and I thought that now would be the perfect time to let you know about the biggest release so far : <strong>Support for</strong> <code>docker-compose.yml</code> <strong>files, and Docker Compose projects, with many commands and a dedicated UI to manage everything smoothly.</strong></p> <p>Thanks a lot for the 90+ stars on Github and the 18K+ pulls on Docker Hub, and I'd like once again to give a huge mention and thanks to <code>Vinylwalk3r</code> on Github for the issues, ideas, and conversations leading to this big release.</p> <p>As a reminder, Isaiah is a fully open-source and self-hostable app that enables you to manage your Docker stacks, containers, images, volumes, and networks from your browser. It was built as a clone of the lazydocker project for the web, and it even supports opening terminals inside your containers / server right inside your browser

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! I have been reading a lot of posts on this subreddit in an effort to find the best way to remote into my main desktop from my laptop, and while I've found a lot of leads, there aren't a lot of clear answers that satisfy everything I want. So, I'm asking if there's a way to remote into a PC with:</p> <ul> <li>The ability to turn the PC on, either from sleep or a full shutdown (WOL is an option for me, but if I could do it without having to turn that on that would be great)</li> <li>Secure access (meaning there won't constantly be a risk to either of my computers when using the service)</li> <li>easy setup</li> <li>keeping the installed programs at a minimum, as I'd rather not install 50 different programs just to remote into my PC</li> </ul> <p>My main usage case is both gaming and work related, so a low latency option will be appreciated. Thanks, y'all!</p> <p>Edit: I also want whatever solution to be free, and open-source is prefered!

Recently those breaks are coming almost after every song (or every other song) and now, instead of 10/20 seconds they are 3 minute OR MORE! I had a 5 minute commercial for 1 product followed by 1 song then another long ass commercial (the commercials are longer than the songs!) </p> <p>So it’s time to break away, I have tons of music cd’s from back in the day, the music I was listening to on YT anyways, it was just a nice library. I don’t want to have to pay some monthly (or even yearly) subscription.. so what do folks suggest??</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Battlewear"> /u/Battlewear </a> <br />
