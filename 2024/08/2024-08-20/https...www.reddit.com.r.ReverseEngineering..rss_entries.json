I have read the binary from the Infineon C167 microprocessor. I\u2019d like to see what it looks like in assembly code. I\u2019ve tried a couple things, at some point I have selected the C167CR-4RM but how can I input the .bin file to be disassembled? Or am I going about this the wrong way? I have no idea what I\u2019m doing! Thank you </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WearyAssistance354\"> /u/WearyAssistance354 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.keil.com/download/product/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1ewprr4/keil_uvision_infineon_c167/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1029812, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1ewprr4/keil_uvision_infineon_c167", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/.rss", "source_obj__id": 476, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Keil uVision Infineon C167", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-20T05:03:10+00:00", "description": "&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Major-Ad-4196\"> /u/Major-Ad-4196 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/Aran404/SpotAPI\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1ewnabj/spotapi_enjoy_spotify_playback_api_without_premium/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1029505, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1ewnabj/spotapi_enjoy_spotify_playback_api_without_premium", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/.rss", "source_obj__id": 476, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "SpotAPI: Enjoy Spotify Playback API Without Premium!", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
