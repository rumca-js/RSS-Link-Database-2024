		The <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/about/who-we-are">Association for Progressive Communications</a> (APC), a network of organizations working for the positive use of the internet and digital technologies, has warned that the deployment of technologies such as biometrics to push the universal birth registration agenda must be done in ways that prioritize data safety, privacy and pluralistic gender perspectives.

This call headlines the content of a <a href="https://www.apc.org/sites/default/files/apc-submission_ohchr_birth-certificates-tech_august2024.pdf">briefing note</a> published recently by the network which is made up of 70 organizational members and associates present in 74 countries.

		Authorities in Pakistan have begun blocking SIM cards registered to national digital ID cards found to be invalid or fraudulent following the August 16 deadline.

People with blocked SIM cards can restore their mobile services only by obtaining a new digital ID card from NADRA, and then performing biometric identity verification.

The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) confirmed that deactivations are underway, according to <a href="https://www.samaa.tv/2087319349-pta-starts-blocking-sims-linked-to-cancelled-fake-id-cards">Samaa</a>, and an update with the number of SIMs blocked is expected to be released soon. Mobile network operators have been receiving data from NADRA, which they have been instructed to use as the basis for disconnections.

		Facial recognition is increasingly being adopted at events and large venues to improve security and streamline access. Technology suppliers like Denso Wave and sports leagues like MLB are implementing advanced systems to address challenges like ticket scalping and long lines for entry.

<a href="https://www.denso-wave.eu/en/denso-products/qr-code-based-face-recognition">Denso Wave</a>, known for its QR code technology, recently integrated facial recognition with QR codes to improve security at events and festivals. This system links an attendee's facial features with a unique QR code for verification at concert and festival entry points.

		New legislation in Pennsylvania puts new emphasis on age verification technology as a means of preventing alcohol sales to underage customers. A similar policy could be coming to the UK, paving the way for alcohol sales with biometric age estimation at grocery stores. Sports venues in the U.S. are deploying the technology for a growing number of self-serve concessions, and the shifting market is benefitting those self-service suppliers embracing the technology, like Yoti partner Diebold Nixdorf.

When Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) introduced a legislative amendment to halt the expansion of the Transportation Security Administration’s use of facial recognition, many people experienced a sense of déjà vu.

		New Zealand police have published a <a href="https://www.police.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/police-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-160824.pdf">policy on facial recognition technology</a> (FRT), which lays out how and when authorities can use the biometric tool in investigations.

“This policy ensures that appropriate safeguards are in place for Police’s use of FRT and the storage of personal information, and that use of FRT is lawful, proportionate and appropriate in a New Zealand policing context,” the document says. It follows with a list of what can be considered “lawful policing functions” that warrant the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202407/nz-government-asks-for-help-understanding-facial-recognition">use of facial recognition</a>,

		Malawi is in full pursuit of its digital transformation drive which includes the construction of a National Data Center with the collaboration of Chinese firm Huawei, the implementation of a biometric national ID scheme and a biometric SIM card identification exercise. As such, it is prudent for the country’s government to put in place mechanisms that provide sufficient and comprehensive data protection guarantees.

This is the caution from the Association for Progressive Communications (APCA) in a <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/node/40295">report</a> which is part of a series of recently updated articles on digital rights in Southern Africa. The APC is a network of dozens of civil society organizations from at least 70 countries advocating the responsible use of the int

		The government of Türkiye says there is a plan in the pipeline to issues ID cards embedded with biometric chips to people with international protected status in the country.

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya dropped the hint recently in an interview with Turkish newspaper <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/turkiye-tightens-measures-on-missing-refugees-migration/news">Daily Sabah</a>.

Türkiye is host to four million persons identified as refugees and aliens, three-quarters of who are Syrians fleeing persecution and insecurity in their country. At least one million of them have been issued residence permits while about 224,000 others enjoy the international temporary protection status.

In the interview, the government official addressed several
