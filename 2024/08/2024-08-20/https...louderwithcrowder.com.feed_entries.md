Given that Tim Walz clearly has some sort of mental condition going on, this could be why he was caught in another bizarre lie. </p>
<p>Walz previously said on multiple occasions that his wife underwent IVF to conceive, and he went as far as to claim that Vance would criminalize this if given the chance. However, none of that actually happened, as his wife actually <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/intrauterine-insemination/about/pac-20384722#:~:text=Intrauterine%20insemination%20(IUI)%20is%20a,the%20procedure%20is%20artificial%20insemination." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>underwent </u></a>“intrauterine insemination,” which is “a fertility treatment that involves placing sper

Subsequently, “rare” is no longer what they want, as they demand abortions take place all day, every day. Despite this, it’s still not every day that a leftist goes on TV to wish rape upon the kids of their political opponents, as that is even something reprehensible for the left. But Andy Beshear sees no issue with that, which is why he disgustingly called for JD Vance’s daughter to be raped. </p><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">What the hell is this?<br /><br />Why is <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyBeshearKY?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AndyBeshearKY</a> wishing that a member of my family would get raped?!?<br /><br />What a disgusting person. <a h

<p>Firstly, of course, he had to start by screaming that Trump called Nazis “very fine people,” even though he “totally condemned” them. It’s unclear how often this has to be debunked but these people don’t tend to let facts get in the way of their claims. </p>
<blockquote>"I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists — because they should be condemned totally,” Trump <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/trump-campaign-press-release-fact-check-after-charlottesville-president-trump-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said </a>about Charlottesville. </blockquote>

	It was weird when Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz as his running mate. The Democrats believe that the only reason someone outside of New York City and San Francisco wouldn't vote for Kamala is her race and gender. If they took an old white guy, put him in a camo hat and a flannel shirt, and just plopped him in the Rust Belt, it would give those pesky whites "permission" to vote for the Black and/or Indian lady. So they chose Weird Walz, a candidate who's such a left-wing lunatic that he makes Kamala seem sober.
