It’s an impassioned, humane and urgently performed drama, a vivid look at what it’s like to be reduced to screaming anguish by the system – as well as what it’s like to

It’s a joy to revisit</p><p>Can it really have been 30 years since Angela Chase developed a life-consuming crush on Jordan Catalano just because of the way he leaned? My So-Called Life, created by Winnie Holzman, made its TV debut on 25 August 1994, and over the past three decades, it has stood firm as a cultural touchstone, in part due to making bona fide movie stars of Claire Danes and Jared Leto, who both got their break on the show.

And now, I can very much believe that it’s been 30 years. It looks old, but more curiously, it <em>feels</em> it.

Clostebol is an anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) derived from testosterone and the concentrations of 121 picograms per millilitre (pg/ml) and 122pg/ml in Sinner’s two positive tests amount to less than a billionth of a gram. With over-the-counter drugs in Italy containing clostebol, numerous Italian athletes have tested positive for the substance in recent years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/20/jannik-sinner-cleared-of-wrongd

Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian</a></li></ul><p><strong><br /></strong>One of halloumi’s greatest assets is that no matter what you do to it – grill it, bake it, fry it – this Cypriot cheese maintains its structure. Sure, slicing and grilling halloumi to top salads or nestle inside a breakfast sandwich is always going to be a good idea, but there’s so much more you can do with your slab.</p><p>“I like to criss-cross one side of the halloumi, rub it with olive oil and seasoning, put it in a snug dish and pop it under a medium grill for eight minutes,” says Georgina Hayden, author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/greekish-9781526630667">Greekish</a>.

<p><strong>Trafalgar theatre, London</strong> <br />With four actors playing 130 parts, this revival of Patrick Barlow’s take on the spy film is fitfully funny but ultimately frustrating</p><p>‘Think of the strain involved!” marvels the compere introducing music-hall act Mr Memory at the start of Alfred Hitchcock’s 1935 film of John Buchan’s novel. Mr Memory logs away 50 new facts each day but the industrious cast of four for Patrick Barlow’s adaptation have managed to learn 130 parts between them.</p><p>What I remember most about the hit comedy’s original West End transfer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/sep/23/theatre1">in 2006</a> is a whirl of ingenious stagecraft continually upping the ante.

But the decision can be weighty. Is it the best option? Is a permanent solution really what they want? And which person should undergo the surgery?</p><p>A vasectomy takes just about 20 minutes to do in a clinic, requires only local anesthesia, and is minimally invasive and quicker to heal. It typically costs about $1,000 in the US without insurance. By contrast, the procedures available to those with a uterus are more complicated. Tubal ligation and bilateral salpingectomy, the removal of both fallopian tubes – which is now more commonly recommended – require general anesthesia, involve multiple incisions and often laparoscopy, and have lengthier healing times.

The man responsible, youth coach Viðar Gylfason, is one of a small group of contributors who appear on screen to flesh out a narrative that at first glance appears too slight to fill even the film’s modest 79 minute runtime.</p><p>Gylfason recounts how his aim was to christen the pitch in 1996 with a cup game for local team Reynir FC, a plan that didn’t quite play out as hoped. This leaves room for a present-day narrative in which the film-makers follow a plucky band of local characters as they attempt to put together a ragtag team of players to f

Everything that had shaped our cultural history was thought away, spoken away and written away. West Germans took sovereignty over the narrative, and their verdict was clear: the former East German state was wrong in every aspect and worth nothing. This also meant books, plays, paintings, sculptures, films and music were buried and left behind, because they too were considered

I didn’t realise it was criminal because I thought he loved me,” she says. “I felt like I was to blame because I hadn’t kicked and screamed. He’d told me that it was normal. He said he had lots of friends who lived as man and wife with their daughters.”</p><p>There was no shortage of corroborative evidence.
