After the leak in Linus' home rack watercooling setup, most of the hardware fortunately survived, except for the ~$5000 UPS battery backup unit that powers most of his hardware! Fortunately, we found a shipping damaged unit on ebay that can be frankensteined together to hopefully have one functioning UPS. Do not try this at home.
