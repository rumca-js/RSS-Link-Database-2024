On April 26, 2024, Iron & Wine, aka Sam Beam, released his seventh full-length studio album, "Light Verse." In a bit of a departure from his previous works, Beam recorded this album in Los Angeles with producer Dave Way.

The album itself presents Iron & Wine in a creative, playful space. While on tour in support of the record, Beam visited The Current studio to perform solo versions of three songs from "Light Verse." Watch Iron & Wine perform "All in Good Time" above.
