Tactical Breach Wizards proves there’s no substitute for the dopamine hit you get from simultaneously ejecting three dudes out of a window. Defenestrations aside, Tactical Breach Wizards is a surprisingly deep turn-based strategy game that delivers some of the best writing I’ve seen in a game this year. The world of Tactical Breach Wizards is [&#8230;]

As a tabletop game master who loves superhero media, I run into a pretty specific problem with most superhero role-playing games: I want my supers games to run fast and loose, with just enough emphasis on mechanics to make players’ specific powers and specialties count. Superhero (and supervillain) stories tend to include a lot of [&#8230;]

“Cannot absorb Spirits without guidance” is a cryptic message you might run into early on in Black Myth: Wukong. You won’t find much guidance from the game, though. Our Black Myth: Wukong guide to absorbing Spirits will explain how the mechanic works, what it has to do with the Blessed Gourd, and how Spirit Skill [&#8230;]

## The War for Rohirrim trailer brings Lord of the Rings into the anime age

So much has happened to Warner Bros. Pictures since The Lord of the Rings: The War for Rohirrim was fast-tracked into development in June 2021. Three years later, the studio is now a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery, a company that has rewired itself a dozen times, often at the cost of its animation business.&#160; [&#8230;]

## Gamescom was too expensive for these devs — but don’t miss their games

Gamescom might be the largest gaming expo in the world, but that doesn’t mean everyone gets to go or show their game. With the event hosted in Cologne, Germany, the price to travel to and book space at the event, and to advertise a game during its big announcements stream, can be steep. According to [&#8230;]

## The Crow director makes his case for the character redesign

Adapting The Crow again is a daunting task. Director Alex Proyas famously adapted James O’Barr’s comic book series in 1994. His movie became a cult classic due to its moody, gothic tone and the unforgettable performance of star Brandon Lee, who died during filming due to a mishap involving a prop gun. Three sequels followed [&#8230;]

World of Warcraft has always dabbled in the space beyond Azeroth. The Orcs came through the Dark Portal to serve as the antagonists of the original Warcraft real-time strategy games, a spaceship crashes into the islands north of Kalimdor in The Burning Crusade, and Warlords of Draenor introduced a whole other alternate timeline. But The [&#8230;]

Rival chess grandmasters Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann will compete against each other across the chess board for the first time since September 2022 — when Carlsen accused Niemann of cheating after losing to him at an event. At that time, Carlsen basically said he doesn’t want to play Niemann again: “We must do something [&#8230;]

After 2023’s Gen Con — the biggest tabletop gaming convention in America —&#160;the biggest news was the real-life heist: Two men were caught on camera casually wheeling a cart containing $300,000 worth of Magic: The Gathering cards out of the convention.

Steven Soderbergh never misses, but the Ocean’s Eleven director has rarely been as dead-on accurate as he is in his underappreciated 2017 comedy Logan Lucky, which is now streaming on Netflix. Sure, Logan Lucky is a highly entertaining heist movie, but its best feature is the comedy, which has aged like fine wine. Just about [&#8230;]

Say what you will about Games Workshop’s particular style of corporate communication, which seemingly vacillates between obtuse and obstinate depending on the day. But when the company behind Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer: Age of Sigmar makes a definitive statement on an issue it seldom minces words, and fans pay attention. That was true again this [&#8230;]

Another live-service game bites the dust. Nintendo has announced that it will end service for its free-to-play mobile game Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp on Nov. 28, after which the app, which has been running since 2017, will no longer function.
