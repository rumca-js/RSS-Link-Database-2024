## AMD talks Ryzen 9000 controversy: ‘We were as puzzled’ as reviewers

<p>AMD’s hotly anticipated <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2422628/dont-buy-amds-new-ryzen-9000-cpus-before-knowing-these-7-key-details.html">Ryzen 9000 desktop processors</a> launched earlier this month, and well, the gaming performance improvements seen by independent reviewers weren’t as hot as expected – or as hot as AMD attested to in early marketing statements. So what happened?</p>



<p>It’s been a long, winding road as reviewers and AMD alike hunted down answers. Last night, AMD released a community post <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2432580/amd-ryzen-9000-patch-boosts-performance-on-windows-11.html">pointing the finger at a confluence of various issues</a>: A difference in the Windows mode used for testing, VBS security settings, how rival Intel systems were configured, and – as ever – the specific games benchmarked.</p>

<p>Gigabyte is starting to look like the go-to brand when it comes to affordable gaming monitors. The company’s 34-inch ultrawide is already a smash hit for gamers on a budget, and today you can get a 27-inch variant with an even better IPS panel <a href="https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-g27q-27-qhd-144-hz-ips-black/p/N82E16824012015">for just $176 at Newegg</a> — if you’re willing to jump through one or two hoops.</p>



<p>Newegg is plainly offering the G27Q monitor for $200 (which is $50 off retail price), and that’s a darn good deal for a regular 27-inch monitor with an upgraded 2560×1440 resolution plus an IPS panel (which is sought after for its superior color accuracy versus cheaper VA panels).</p>



<p>But throw in a 144Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time and you have the makings of a great gaming monitor — the perfect pick if you’re working from home on a

<p>Samsung is showing some impressive gaming monitors at this year’s Gamescom trade show in Germany. There are new OLEDs in 34-inch and 49-inch models, and the big one is coming in a flavor that doesn’t have all the smart TV features that PC users really don’t need.</p>



<p>But the show-stealer is definitely the Odyssey 3D, which attempts to provide 3D video and gaming without needing 3D glasses.</p>



<p>This is hardly the first time we’ve seen this. After the glut of glasses-based 3D televisions more than a decade ago, the Nintendo 3DS handheld gave us the best-known implementation of lenticular screen technology, which uses slightly offset images to simulate depth.</p>

<p>The Control Panel is a trusty, rusty old friend for a lot of us Windows users, going all the way back to the operating system’s original release in the 1980s. But Microsoft has been trying to get rid of it for almost a decade, replacing its functions with the friendlier Settings app.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-configuration-tools-in-windows-f8a49657-b038-43b8-82d3-28bea0c5666b">a new Microsoft support page</a> that covers several different aspects of PC management in both Windows 10 and 11, Control Panel’s end is nigh. We still don’t know an exact date, though:</p>

<p>If you need a quick little flash drive for moving files between devices, you can’t go wrong with the Samsung Fit Plus — especially when the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-MUF-128AB-AM-Plus-128GB/dp/B07D7PDLXC">Samsung Fit Plus (128GB) is on sale for just $15 on Amazon</a>.</p>



<p>This is an incredible price for a nifty little accessory, representing a 67% discount off its normal price of $45. (The 64GB version is also on sale, but that one’s priced at $14. You might as well spend the extra buck and get twice as much storage capacity!)</p>



<p>The Samsung Fit Plus is so tiny you’ll run the risk of losing it. Thankfully, it has a smart design that lets you hook it to a lanyard or keychain. Or, even better, since it has such a compact and unobtrusive design, you can just leave it plugged in 24/7 and barely know it’s there.</p>

<p>Your webcam turns on for no reason. Why? The idea that some unknown eyeball might be watching you might make you nervous. It did me — which is why I’m telling you how to solve that problem.</p>



<p>I’ve reviewed <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-4k-webcam-buying-guide.html">PCWorld’s best webcams</a> for a few years now, so even though I have laptops with excellent webcams (generally Microsoft Surface devices, but there are others), I always have a webcam or two perched on the top of my monitor.

<p>Nearly two years ago, ChatGPT’s AI writing powers set off a firestorm in classrooms. How would teachers be able to determine which assignments were actually authored by the student? A host of AI-powered services answered the call.</p>



<p>Today, there are even more services promising to catch AI cheaters. But teachers aren’t necessarily jumping on board. Instead, they’re returning to a more traditional solution: pen and paper. No phones, no laptops, no Chromebooks. Just a student and their (biological, not silicon) memory.</p>



<p>My own kids — one in a California middle school, the other in high school — aren’t happy about it. “My hand cramped up so much,” my eldest son complained about his AP World History course he took last year, and the requirement to handwrite all papers and tests because of AI concerns.</p>

But other helpful products aren’t always as obvious. They can seem purely optional—stuff to buy when you have money to burn.</p>



<p>But don’t discount tech gadgets and accessories, especially if you’re often zigzagging across a college campus. Add in part-time work and the demands of a social life, and the right gear can help you keep your sanity.</p>
