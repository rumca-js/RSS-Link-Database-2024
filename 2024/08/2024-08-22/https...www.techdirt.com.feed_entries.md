Oh, Fifth Circuit, you crazy, crazy kid. I take back almost all the bad things I&#8217;ve said about you. The cop-friendliest circuit in the nation has done the unimaginable: set up a circuit-on-circuit showdown that can only be resolved by a Supreme Court decision. Until that happens (don&#8217;t hold your breath), you and your Google [&#8230;]

As we head into another Presidential election, one thing has been consistent from the last two such elections as well: the tech policies of both major parties are terrible. The Donald Trump Republican platform for 2025 is beyond crazy with all sorts of nonsense. The “tech” part of it is barely worth a mention, but [&#8230;]
