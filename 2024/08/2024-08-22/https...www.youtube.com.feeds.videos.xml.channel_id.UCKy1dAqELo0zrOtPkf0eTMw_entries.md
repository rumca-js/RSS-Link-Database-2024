One of the most intriguing projects featured at gamescom 2024 isn’t a game at all, but an animated series. Prime Video’s Secret Level is an anthology series by the creators of Love, Death + Robots. Each episode is basically a short film inspired by the characters and worlds of iconic video games like God of War, Mega Man, Unreal Tournament, and Pac-Man.

The first trailer for the series gives us a brief glimpse of these gorgeously animated shorts and the often surprising ways in which they reinvent familiar gaming icons. But which games are featured in the series, and is that really Keanu Reeves piloting a mecha suit? Let’s break down exactly what we see in the trailer.
