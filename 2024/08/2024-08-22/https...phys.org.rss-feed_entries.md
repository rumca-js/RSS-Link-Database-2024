Communication and coordination among different cells are fundamental aspects that regulate many functions in our body. This process, known as paracrine signaling, involves the release of signaling molecules by a cell into its extracellular matrix (ECM) or surroundings to communicate changes in its cellular processes or the local environment. These signaling molecules are then detected by neighboring cells, leading to various cellular responses.

The living world is profoundly affected by human activities. One eighth of species are currently threatened with extinction in the near future, largely due to climate change. Faced with the degradation of their habitat, the species that will survive will be those that are able to adapt. Our team of researchers is trying to gain a better understanding of how seasonal migration patterns are changing in the face of climate change by studying crested cormorants (Gulosus aristotelis). Long-term migration monitoring of this species, classified as endangered in the UK, began around fifteen years ago along the Scottish coast.
