<p><strong>Lyceum, Edinburgh</strong> <br />In David Ireland’s complex two-hander, co-starring Sean Gilder, a troubled youth is persuaded to join the 12-step programme by a former addict</p><p>There are few certainties in David Ireland’s latest drama. It is slippery yet sincere, funny but serious, with an ending that might leave you none the wiser. A young out-of-work alcoholic is unsure about joining the <a href="https://www.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk/about-aa/what-is-aa/12-steps/">12-step programme</a> until a former addict sweeps in as his sponsor to save him, or so it seems. Luka (Jack Lowden) meets the older James (Sean Gilder) through Alcoholics Anonymous. The play’s focus (or maybe it is James’s) is the fifth step towards recovery, which requires writing down all the things that bring guilt and shame – to share with a trusted friend.</p><p>James seems fatherly at first, but becomes angrily judgmental; Luka is uncertain of himself but then confrontational and fatherly.

## How can Labour avoid the ‘union paymasters’ jibes? By banning all large donations | Polly Toynbee

<p>There is no comparison between Labour’s transparent union funding and murky donations to the Tories – but stopping it all would be the best way to clean up politics</p><p>The Labour party is “<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13755613/Labour-accused-thumb-trade-union-paymasters-half-Keir-Starmers-MPs-took-donations.html">under the thumb</a>” of its trade union paymasters and its strike settlements are payback for the union millions that funded its election campaign. So say some Tory leadership contenders and their press loud hailers, a constant reminder that despite the Tories’ extreme unpopularity causing their worst ever election result, and despite Labour’s colossal majority, the media keep blasting out the messages that voters so resoundingly rejected. Labour governments swimming against this perpetual tide of hostility, which is often mindlessly mimicked by broadcasters, need to keep their nerve: this boombox is not the voice of England, let alone Britain.</p><

A track called Joy opens in a manner characteristic of Nick Cave’s recent songs: the kind of drifting, serpentine style, beatless and uncoupled from standard verse-chorus structure, that he and chief collaborator Warren Ellis began experimenting with on 2013’s Push the Sky Away.

<p>As a half Kiwi, the only cultural exports I had growing up were the bloke from Crowded House and Shortland Street. How times have changed</p><p>When I was growing up, the sum total of New Zealand’s contribution to global culture was, essentially, the singer from Crowded House and Shortland Street – that’s to say, middle-of-the-road music for a middle-of-the-day soap opera crowd. I probably only noticed because my father is from New Zealand – he still uses the Edmonds cookbook and memorably described the birth of my son as “far out” – and since the age of about nine I have held a Kiwi passport.</p><p>So it has been a particular thrill this year to look across the listings for the Edinburgh festival fringe and see that it is packed with young, exciting New Zealand talent genuinely rivalling that from Europe and America.

<p>Leverkusen have held on to Xabi Alonso and their star names, so Bayern, Dortmund and co are playing catch-up</p><p>Patrik Schick, again. The DFL Super Cup rarely provides any pointers for the forthcoming Bundesliga season, but what this year’s curtain raiser seemed to indicate is that maybe last season is still happening. The match-up between Bayer Leverkusen and Stuttgart – last season’s top two, with the former having won both league and DfB Pokal – was a reminder of an extraordinary 23-24 campaign, as was the bristling intensity of Saturday night’s fixture, uncommon for such a nominal showpiece.</p><p>And the manner was everything. Even it took a penalty shootout for Leverkusen to lift the fifth major trophy of the club’s 120-year history (and the third in the last four months under Xabi Alonso), the way in which <em>Die Werkself</em> got there suggested that we are probably not looking at a one-hit wonder.

<p>Chicken feet sculptures, seven-metre murals and a radical reworking of a forgotten hymn: the Peruvian artist’s new show finds inventive ways into her Quechuan heritage</p><p>In 2022, while doing research in&nbsp;a Latin American archive in&nbsp;Texas, the Peruvian artist Claudia Martínez Garay came across a curious musical score.&nbsp;Titled Hanaqpachap kusikuynin, it was a Catholic hymn, thought to be the oldest polyphonic work in Quechua (the group of indigenous languages spoken across the Andes). It was first published in 1631 in a monumental ecclesiastical tome compiled by a Franciscan clergyman. Martínez Garay set about learning to play it on the synthesiser.<br /><br />
 The anonymous priests who wrote it had opted for Quechua so, as Martínez Garay puts it, “they could speak to the people”. She noted the way the lyrics adapt Catholicism into&nbsp;Andean cosmovision, a foundational body of myths, rituals,&nbsp;cultural expressions and perspectives on life that differs fundamen

<p>I’ve relearned the meaning of seasonality – and how fragile the natural systems that sustain us really are</p><p>A few months ago, when I received an email about an available allotment in my area, I struggled to remember when I had signed up for one. It turns out I had done so two years ago, fuelled by my envy for those with gardens during lockdown. Back then, all I wanted was a small bit of outdoor space that felt like my own, to plant flowers, herbs and, at a push, some chillies. A place where I could read and write in the sun, safe from distractions.</p><p>Now I was being presented a half plot of available land (125 square metres!) with an established apple tree in the middle – which I mistook for a cherry because of its pink blossom. “You’ll have to have a trial period, to see how you get on,” the woman showing me around said. She meant business. The plot, which was bigger than I could dream of, was beautiful but overgrown – getting it started would require proper graft. I wasn

Many on the Marxist left of Scanlon’s era would have agreed with his words, the miners’ leader Arthur Scargill among them.

<p>Our twins spent two years at primary school in Chengdu. Their lessons featured alarming cautionary tales and stories of Chinese superiority, but there was fun and irreverence, too</p><p>Near the end of third grade, my twin daughters, Ariel and Natasha, officially joined the Young Pioneers of China. This organisation is under the auspices of the Chinese Communist party, and members are between the ages of six and 14. In order to become a Young Pioneer at Chengdu Experimental primary school, the public institution my daughters attended in the south-western Chinese city, there was no application, no interview and no ceremony. Parents were not consulted or informed. The twins simply came home one afternoon wearing Young Pioneer pins on their right breasts. The pins featured a gold star, a red torch and the name of the organisation – <em>Zhongguo Shaoxiandui</em> – in gold Chinese characters. Ariel and Natasha told me and my wife, Leslie, that from now on they would be required to wear

<p>This fascinating documentary – which shows apes making leafy beds, clinging to their mothers and swinging through the treetops – is an immense privilege to watch</p><p>It’s not easy being a homo sapien. We have to go to work every day, sitting in front of a bright, glaring screen for eight hours, or else doing something that’ll make our feet hurt. When we get hungry, we can’t just eat: we have to buy the food from a shop, which costs money that we’ve earned from working. The food is wrapped in plastic and shipped in from miles away. We get two days a week to relax, which is often spent doing admin or washing our clothes. It goes on like this until we die, which also costs money when you factor in funerals and debt.</p><p>Not so much for the orangutan, who – according to Netflix’s new David Attenborough-narrated documentary, Secret Lives of Orangutans – is one of our closest living relatives, sharing “nearly 30 physical characteristics with us”. Unlike us though, their days are larg

<p>If you think nights under canvas aren’t for you, think again. The experts reveal how you can turn camping from a daunting ordeal into a brilliant adventure<strong><br /></strong></p><p>In my experience, the world is divided into people who love camping and people who hate it. In the second group are those scarred by miserable memories of childhood camping trips, and those who have never slept in a field and don’t intend to start now when they have a perfectly good bed at home, thank you very much. But at its best, camping can be cheap, healthy, environmentally friendly and, above all, fun. I asked camping enthusiasts how to combat first-timers’ fears and convince even the most reluctant campers to give it a go.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/article/2024/aug/22/the-reluctant-camper-15-easy-tips-to-make-you-love-life-beneath-the-stars">Continue reading...</a>
