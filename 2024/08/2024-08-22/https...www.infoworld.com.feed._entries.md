<p>When Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman told his developers in June that they may no longer be in the coding business in as little as two years, it was a heads up to change-resistant coders that they had better embrace the new AI-centric reality.</p>



<p>But it also forced serious conversations among executives about what generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding environments would realistically look like. </p>



<p>Garman’s recorded comments, which have since been confirmed by Amazon, were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/aws-ceo-developers-stop-coding-ai-takes-over-2024-8">first reported by <em>Business Insider</em></a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3310941/why-you-should-use-docker-and-containers.html">Containers</a> are a key component of the modern application platform, providing isolation between applications and, at the same time, turning userland into a portable runtime environment. Containers give us a place to both package and run all the necessary dependencies for our code while managing resources and scaling applications and services up and down.</p>



<p>Outside of tools like GitHub’s Codespaces, there has been very little focus on using containers as a development tool. That’s odd, because containers are an ideal way to package an entire development environment, with all the services nee
