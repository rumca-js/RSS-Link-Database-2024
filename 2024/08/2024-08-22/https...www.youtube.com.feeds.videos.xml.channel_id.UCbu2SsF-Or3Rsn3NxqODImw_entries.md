At Gamescom 2024 we saw a hands-off preview of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle which is combining classic Indiana Jones style with a fresh blend of exploration, puzzle solving, first person brawling, as well as stealth. It's a drastic difference from developer MachineGames' previous work on the over-the-top action of the Wolfenstein series, but is shaping up to be a refreshing take on the first person genre.

Black Iron, a state-of-the-art penitentiary located on Jupiter’s icy moon Callisto, is overrun with hordes of infected inmates. As a modest prison guard your job is simple – get to the last escape pod and get out alive. 

But you aren’t the only survivor looking to escape. Your rivals – a deranged custodian, a violent gangster, a maniacal lunch lady, and more – can’t wait to step over your corpse and save themselves.

Only one of you can make it off the moon – make sure it’s you!

In [REDACTED], a fast-action isometric roguelike, a shadowy agent watches Black Iron Prison spiral into chaos. As one of the last guards, fight through monsters, rivals, and reanimated corpses of your fellow guards to escape the penitentiary alive.
