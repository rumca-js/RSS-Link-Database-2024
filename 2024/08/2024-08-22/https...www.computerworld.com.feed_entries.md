<p>Market research firm Gartner yesterday published its 2024 <a href="https://www.gartner.com/document/5652523">Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies</a>, and the study revealed that generative AI (genAI) has passed the “peak of inflated expectations” and is now sliding down into the “trough of disillusionment.”</p>



<p>Along with genAI, AI-augmented software engineering is also heading down the slope, after passing its inflated expectations in markets, according to Gartner, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">whose Hype Cycle</a> describes the hot ascent and eventual cooling off of technology adoption.</p>

<p>OpenAI has expressed opposition to California’s proposed bill regulating AI development and deployment as lawmakers prepare for an upcoming vote.</p>



<p>In a letter addressed to California State Senator Scott Wiener, the AI startup argued that the bill would stifle innovation in the sector and suggested that such regulation should be handled at the federal rather than state level, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-21/openai-says-california-s-controversial-ai-bill-will-hurt-innovation?srnd=phx-technology">Bloomberg report</a>.</p>

<p>Apple’s iPhone and App Store turned the mobile phone industry upside down, created the smartphone generation, and set the scene for developer success that did not exist before, all while working to protect privacy and security.</p>



<p>No wonder Apple’s enemies want to break all that the company has achieved. No wonder they hope to feast on the crumbs left behind. The regulators <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3489734/uk-ends-apple-and-google-app-store-scrutiny-but-not-for-long.html">seem to want to let them do just that</a>, but what choice will consumers be given as they endure the tyranny of choice? </p>
