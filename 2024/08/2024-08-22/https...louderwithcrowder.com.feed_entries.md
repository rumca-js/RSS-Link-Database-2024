This is why JD Vance is calling her out for her policies that “lost thousands of innocent children to sex trafficking, to drug trafficking, to human trafficking.”</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">.<a href="https://twitter.com/JDVance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JDVance</a>:

Kamala has that problem because what she has done and plans to do is deeply unpopular with Americans. Subsequently, she is mocking the people she pretends to represent by failing to mention her stance on the issues, while not defending her record because it’s that abysmal. Fortunately, Trump has released her policy initiatives for her.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<p>Night TWO of our two night DNC Live Fact-Checking Extravaganza. The featured attraction? KAH-Muh-La Harris. <strong><a href="https://rumble.com/c/StevenCrowder" target="_blank">The fun continues TONIGHT at 9:00 PM Eastern on Rumble</a>.</strong></p>
<p>KamaLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLa Harris hasn’t put forward any policies. She hasn’t given any interviews. The few times she’s spoken without a teleprompter, let’s just say she sounded like she needed to cut back on the Zinfandel. What can she possibly have to say? And how much of it will be bullplop? We’re guessing most of it.</p>
<p>And of course, we’ll have the notorious LwC Drinking Game rules. After all, Kamala Harris won’t be sober while giving her speech. There’s no reason for us to be sober watching it.</
