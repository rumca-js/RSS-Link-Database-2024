<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm trying to learn DinoGenics by playing on BGA. I have the Manipulation Card &quot;Bargain Contractors&quot; which states &quot;Pay 1 credit then place 2 face up facility tiles from the City Center into play damaged.&quot; </p> <p>I'm not sure what this means, and can't find a compendium for card clarifications.</p> <p>My best guess is that you pay a credit and then you can take 2 facilities from the City Center (ignoring their costs) and you place them on your board, face down. You'll be able to utilize them once you've repaired them. </p> <p>But when I tried to use the Uplink action space and play that card, I couldn't get it to work.
