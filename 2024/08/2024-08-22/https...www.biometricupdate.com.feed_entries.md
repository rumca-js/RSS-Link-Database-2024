		An audited financial statement released recently by the World Bank has revealed that Nigeria’s Digital Identification for Development (ID4D) project made a foreign exchange benefit of 8.6 billion Naira (around US$5.4 million) following a drop in the value of the Naira last year.

The funding boost could help the country’s digital identity authority pay for a series of expected upgrades to the national ID system.

The Nigeria ID4D project, whose accounts are largely in foreign currencies, notably the U.S. dollar and euro, saw a surplus on withdrawals in the home currency as the amount received in dollars and euros had higher exchange rates.

		Over 2.5 million Scottish people are now using MyAccount and reusable digital ID from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/yoti">Yoti</a> in a bid to streamline everyday administrative tasks. The Improvement Service, the organization responsible for enhancing local government operations in Scotland, launched MyAccount in 2014 as a single sign-on portal.

Half of Scotland’s eligible population (those aged 12 and over) now use the MyAccount service, and all 32 local authorities in Scotland have integrated MyAccount.

The platform allows citizens to access a range of public sector services with one username and password, for tasks such as paying council tax, applying for parking permits, updating personal details, and managing school meal payments.
