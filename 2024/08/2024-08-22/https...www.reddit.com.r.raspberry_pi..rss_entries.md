<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I bought a Pimoroni Duo for my pi5. There are a few how-tos to make Raid, but fewer to tell how I configure it so I can boot on Raspian in the RAID. I want everything on the RAID. I have used<br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQRmBGEBkbg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQRmBGEBkbg</a> and<br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwrdwbYI_7M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwrdwbYI_7M</a> to try it to work.<br /> I am stuck on how I mount the RAID when it is created and have copied the files.<br /> Somewhere I need to tell there is a /dev/device that should be started on even if that is a RAID? I am missing something. How do I tell Raspian that I boot from a RAID?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tbg_electro"> /u/tbg_electro </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1eytnt0/boot_raspian_from_raid_1_with_rasp_5_pimoroni_duo/">[link]</a></span> &#32

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Title basically explains my issue. I bought a PI4 to mess around with and decided I would first try my hand at setting up a Minecraft server on it. Everything works good with it and the server runs, however in order for people outside of my LAN to use it, I am required to port forward the IP for the PI4 so others outside my network can use it. My ISP supports this, but the problem I am having is the PI does not appear as one of the devices connected to my network, when it is infact working.</p> <p>Whenever the device was originally set up it was done using the basic RaspPi OS 32bit that can included with my CanaKit guide. Doing this and connecting to it via wifi, the device appeared on my routers devices and I was able to view the assigned IP and the MAC for the device.</p> <p>After further troubleshooting trying to get the server to work, I ended up opting for an ethernet based connection and using a different distro (Ubuntu 20.04.2 Server).
