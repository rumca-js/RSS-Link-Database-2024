								<p>Wizards of the Coast’s digital Dungeons and Dragons platform <strong>DnD Beyond</strong> is deleting the 5e versions of spells and magic items, as part of the process of updating the site to contain new, DnD 2024 content. These changes are set to begin when the Player’s Handbook goes into early access on September 3. Some fans are disappointed. Since the 5.5e or 2024 rules are marketed as fully compatible with old content, many believed that everything would stay up on the platform.</p>

Forget mundane boxes, cases, and backpacks: this custom storage case for <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong>, DnD miniatures, and sundry other nerd things, is an unfolding octagonal cylinder that looks like a Bond villain with a thing for the Transformers needed to make a doomsday device on the cheap.</p>
