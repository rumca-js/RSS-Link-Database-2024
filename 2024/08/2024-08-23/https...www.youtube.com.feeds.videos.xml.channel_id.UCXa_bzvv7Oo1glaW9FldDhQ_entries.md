As enjoyable and successful as Black Myth: Wukong has been, there's no denying it has some issues. Game Science admitted before launch that the PC version would have some performance issues, and that's proven correct (with AMD users experiencing problems with the opening segment). The PS5 version also needs work to address the input lag on Performance Mode.

However, there are also issues fundamental to the core experience. Enemy density in certain areas from chapters 1 and 2 feels sparse. Invisible walls crop up everywhere, making exploration feel awkward and annoying. The lip-syncing for the English voice acting is also completely off.

Then there's the lack of an in-game map or any proper tools for navigation, making back-tracking and general navigation a pain. While Black Myth: Wukong still deserves extensive praise, here are ten things we'd like to see Game Science address quickly.
