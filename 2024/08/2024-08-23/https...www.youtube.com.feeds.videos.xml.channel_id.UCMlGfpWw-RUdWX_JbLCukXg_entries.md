Interview With Mateusz Pusz (Structured Concurrency in C++) - CppCon 2024

Kevin Carpenter from @cppevents interviews Patrice Roy ahead of his two-day onsite training course "Optimizing with Modern C++"

Course Description
Today, C++ software is increasingly asynchronous and parallel, a trend that is likely only to continue going forward. While the C++ Standard Library has a rich set of concurrency primitives and lower-level building blocks, we lack a standard framework for asynchrony and parallelism that C++ programmers desperately need.

Asynchrony and parallelism appear everywhere, from processor hardware interfaces to networking, to file I/O, to GUIs, to accelerators. Every C++ domain and every platform needs to deal with asynchrony and parallelism, from scientific
