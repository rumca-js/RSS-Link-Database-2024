As I grew up, I found playthroughs of games on YouTube and I wished I'd get the opportunity to play some. I moved to Canada a couple years ago and recently bought Mysterium, which I love playing. I've also played Survive: Escape from Atlantis (I would've bought it in a heartbeat if it still existed and i cant find the new edition nearby) and Bandido. Only problem I'm faced with is lack of friends who are interested in board games so I've played it only a few times. I've somehow convinced my friends for a game night soon and now I'm trying to find more board games (one to be precise). I've been very attracted by Betrayal at House on the Hill.
