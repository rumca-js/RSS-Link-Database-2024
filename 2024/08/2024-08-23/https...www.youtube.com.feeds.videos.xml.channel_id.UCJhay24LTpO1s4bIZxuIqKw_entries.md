Enhancing Safety in C++ Code With Modern C++ Quantities and Units Library - Mateusz Pusz - ACCU 2024
---

Safety has been a huge buzzword in the C++ Community in recent years. There are many concerns about the safety of our C++ language, and projects developed using it. Many improvements are being discussed, starting from handling of the low-level fundamental types, through updating the language rules (e.g., initialization), up to providing safer high-level abstractions in the library.

This lecture presents how the usage of a Modern C++ quantities and units library can improve the safety of the code we write every day. During the talk, Mateusz will describe all issues and possible solutions discussed in [P2981: Improving our safety with a physical quantities and units library](https://wg21.link/p2981). Based on the examples developed with the mp-units project, the attendees will not only learn the obvious benefits of using such a lib
