<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So pretty much the title of this is it all I’m growing more and more frustrated with Google all the search engines out there because of the censorship. we know that Google is heavily in the Democrats pockets and they’re doing what the Democratic Party does well there censorship. And I’ve had it and I’m not gonna use it anymore. I’ve tried researching but I can’t seem to come up with alternative so I wanna get peoples real honest, professional opinion, and most importantly, the people that are done with the censorship and the media of the left and all that bullshit.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ProduceFantastic8943"> /u/ProduceFantastic8943 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1ezjpa9/done_with_google_search/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1ezjpa9/done_with_google_search/">[comments]</a></span>
