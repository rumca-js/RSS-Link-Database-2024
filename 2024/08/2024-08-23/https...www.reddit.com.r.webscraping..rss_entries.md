<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>New to scraping and I want to scrape all the packages from available on npmjs.com. </p> <p>I’m struggling because you navigate through search and pages do not link to each other. Can someone point me in the right direction as far as a strategy goes?</p> <p>Currently I’m thinking of passing in search queries and then scarping the results that are returned but that wouldn’t guarantee I am getting all the repos.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maziwa"> /u/maziwa </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ez3q1n/how_would_you_scrape_a_site_that_doesnt_selflink/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ez3q1n/how_would_you_scrape_a_site_that_doesnt_selflink/">[comments]</a></span>
