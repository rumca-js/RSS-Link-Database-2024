<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys! Im a noob in this and although Im aware that using port forwarding on your router only is a big vulnerability risk, I was just wondering - how big of a risk is it exactly?</p> <p>Im setting up a server for my own personal (and family) use and there would be no particularly vulnerable info on it (aside from photos, downloaded movies and some personal storage files that I have no issues with being exposed). As Im running the services from Docker, will not a successful breach just gain access to the containerized service only?</p> <p>Also is not using a direct 'ip address: port' forwarded access from my router by the 2-3 users that will access it more secure against such attacks instead of actually registering a domain and submitting it into a DNS list? what are the chances that someone will find my open ip and port if I dont submit them anywhere?</p> <p>Im asking as I can see that setting up a reverse proxy requires a domain and in my mind (im

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Cloudflare has a lot of uses, but a main one that people go after is the ability to hide your server's true IP.</p> <p>This is fine for web traffic based services, but you cannot do this with your mail server. The same is also true if you host apps such as Gitea and wish to have SSH authentication work through TCP, instead of using HTTP clone. You can't proxy the subdomain through Cloudflare otherwise you cannot connect.</p> <p>So the question is; what do people do in that instance? Doesn't it defeat the point of wanting to hide your server's IP and make it run through Cloudflare, when they can just query your mail server DNS and get the IP of your server in a few seconds?</p> <p>Would it be better to buy a second IP from your hosting company and run the mail server through that? How do people work around this.</p> <p>In terms of self-hosted email, are there any other records to worry about besides DKIM, SPF, DMARC, and an MX record? Knock on wood, I'

I just want to thank you all and share that <strong><a href="https://github.com/caronc/apprise">Apprise</a></strong> <a href="https://www.pepy.tech/projects/Apprise">is up to 3.1 million downloads a month</a>! :)</p> <p>It's facinating to see how many upstream systems have adopted it (Apache, and other large open source outlets and applications)!</p> <p>Anyway, I don't post very often, but I just wanted to give a huge shoutout to all of the community for your support. Whenever I lurk here on threads reguarding new tools/software, it's always humbling to see someone suggest to the developer that they adopt Apprise into their infrastructure!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lead2gold"> /u/lead2gold </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ez10tv/apprise_reached_31_million_download

## How to use Wireguard to limit access to my Cloudflare tunnels?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have several services running that I would like to be able to monitor when I'm away from the house, and I've got them all setup through Cloudflare tunnels. E.g. I've got <a href="http://pve.fubar.com">pve.fubar.com</a> for my Proxmox GUI, <a href="http://pihole.fubar.com">pihole.fubar.com</a> for PiHole interface, etc. However, I also want to set it up so I can only access these domains if I'm A) connected to my home network or B) connected to my Wireguard server. Wireguard assigns my devices IPs in the range <a href="http://10.67.66.0">10.67.66.0</a>, and my home network is 10.10.0.0. I added an Access Policy to Cloudflare that only allowed connections from those two ranges of IPs. It worked on my PC and I was able to access the site, however, on my phone it didn't work and I was denied access. I believe it is because my phone is using an IPv6 address, and I don't really understand how to assign a range of IPv6 addresses to my Cloudflare policy.</p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey!</p> <p>I've been running an unRAID server a bit with dockers using its community app templates. I'm moving in November and have been on a long journey to expand my lab for the new house (started with networking equipment that then enabled a HA cluster). I am starting to gain momentum in hosting things on Kubernetes. I'm no stranger to k8s as I interact with it daily at work, but a lot of things are taken care of by &quot;devops&quot; contractors so I'm really digging seeing it end to end.</p> <p>I'm ready to roll out a few larger stacks that don't have official helm charts. So far I have come across <a href="https://truecharts.org/">truecharts </a>and <a href="https://k8s-at-home.com/">k8s-at-home</a>. I decided to deploy Vikunja using truecharts because it was the only one out of the two that was maintained. The ads on their website were so aggressive I had enable an adblocker and it took some working out to understand I needed dependencies not

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I apologize if this is a common or misdirected question, but I have found a problem that I don't really know where to start fixing. </p> <p>I just upgraded my home server and decided to completely remake my Unraid instance, as I wanted to properly document everything I did to set it up and I needed to clean it up anyway. The first things I set up were nextcloud, immich, and nginx proxy manager, which is behind a domain i bought from Cloudflare. There were, as always, plenty of little things that I had to solve, mainly to do with large file uploads and downloads cancelling, but for the most part everything was working, except for the fact that some things were REALLY slow. </p> <p>When downloading a 1GB file from nextcloud throught my subdomain, it took almost 5 minutes to download. On immich, pretty much every video took a super long time to load. This drove me insane because when connecting to both of them on my local network, it was as fast as you'd
