It’s such a good sharing dessert, and this oaty, nutty one comes together pretty quickly, too. You can make the dough in advance, then just pop it in the oven while you’re having dinner, so it’s warm and a little gooey in time for pudding. I know there’ll be lots of you itching to throw in chocolate chips, but I honestly don’t think it needs them.

There was rejoicing in the energy and confidence that has been unleashed by the unexpected metamorphosis from Joe Biden to the “joyful warrior”, Kamala Harris.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/23/kamala-harris-democrats-election">Continue reading...</a>
