<p>Ilkay Gündogan is not the first to go back somewhere they were a great success and enjoyed great acclaim</p><p>Ilkay Gündogan is back at Manchester City and could make his ‘second debut’ for the club against Ipswich on Saturday. Prior to the 33-year-old doing so, we revisit five other Premier League players who returned to clubs where they were stars and reflect on what happened the first time they played for them again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/23/from-fowler-to-bale-five-players-who-returned-to-clubs-where-they-starred">Continue reading...</a>

## Talking Horses: Hollie Doyle and Bradsell savour Nunthorpe success

<p>Jockey ends wait for Group One victory on horse whose racing career looked over due to injury six months ago</p><p>When Bradsell fractured a fetlock six months ago while Archie Watson was preparing him for Dubai’s spring carnival, the trainer feared his racing career was over. “I thought we’d be saving him for a stallion job next year,” Watson said here on Friday. “If you’d told me then that we’d be winning a Nunthorpe, I’d have said that the chance was about 0.5%.”</p><p>Watson’s pessimism was misplaced. Bradsell may well be a stallion this time next year, but if or when he retires to stud, he will do so with a convincing success in the Nunthorpe Stakes on his record, after a 57-second dash down the straight five furlongs here that unfolded almost exactly as Hollie Doyle, his jockey, had hoped and expected.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/23/talking-horses-hollie-doyle-bradsell-nunthorpe-racing-tips">Continue reading...</a>

Video evidence accompanies their testimonies; it feels like a people’s court, allowing the outraged and grief-stricken a hearing.</p><p>A triptych of back screens feature interviews and footage from their wider community in the rural mountainous region of Bahia, and the actors (Juliana França, Gal Pereira and Caju Bezerra, all phenomenal) chip in with their personal stories, as well as explaining or responding to the events on screen.

<p>While I do understand the logic of this proposal, it would have a devastating effect on hundreds of thousands of poorer pensioners</p><p>The Labour government has made an impressive start. Few prime ministers can claim to have faced down a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/19/rightwing-outrage-labour-pay-deals-out-of-step-public-mood">public service pay crisis</a> and a spate of rightwing rioting within a month of taking office. In both cases Keir Starmer has met the challenge head-on, restoring a relationship with our public service workers and cracking down on the thugs who attempted to spread fear and disorder in our communities. With these successes under his belt, it would be a great pity if a single piece of policy were allowed to distract from the legacy that Starmer and the frontbench team are already building.</p><p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has also proved herself to be extremely competent.

Half right, anyway.

For me, Live and Intimidating showcases an act whose considerable strengths are musical and polemical rather than strictly comic.

Her sister Cecilia and Robbie, son of the Tallis’s charlady, are in heated conversation by the fountain in the garden, after which Cecilia strips to her underwear and submerges herself underwater for several seconds. Later that day, Robbie asks Bryony to pass on a letter to Cecilia in which he confesses his desire for her in explicit terms. Briony reads it and decides Robbie must be a wicked person, leadi

<p>Is the follow-up to The Satsuma Complex a celebrity cash-grab, or a sweet, silly meta-commentary on thrillers?</p><p>If all you wish is to be gently charmed for a few hours, The Hotel Avocado will pull you along with it. As a comedian, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/bob-mortimer">Bob Mortimer</a> spins a shaggy-dog story like nobody else, and this is a rollicking old-school yarn. It is full of splendid phrases (“dingy limpets”, “corned beefer”, “pudding drink”) and cheerful narrative cul-de-sacs. Does the plot hang together? Not strictly speaking! Are the characters in any way real? Not really! Does either of these things matter to the general sense of romp? Well, if they did, it would be churlish to say so when Mortimer is having such a good time.

<p>Swim briefs are trending this summer. Here’s why it’s time to get over British queasiness around them</p><p>Last week, I was advocating for men to wear shorts whatever the occasion. This week, I&nbsp;intend to argue that budgie smugglers are back. If you’re wondering whether this column has devolved into an excuse for me to encourage men to wear as little as possible, the answer is: probably. But hear me out.</p><p>First, a disclaimer. The cardinal rule of dressing is not to wear anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, which perhaps rules out Speedos for 70% of British men. It’s a very different story in France, where swimming briefs are deemed a civic requirement, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/aug/12/speedos-fashion">swimming shorts banned in public pools</a>. (Because they can be worn outside the pool, they are seen as unhygienic, with the potential to carry sand, dust and whatever unthinkable germs lurk on bus seats into the water.)</p> <a href=

After all, I had by then had about 11 years of school, and a lot of it had involved teachers talking at us, and if we didn’t “get” it, that was our fault.</p><p>Michael Rosen is a writer and broadcaster</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/23

<p>This fluff comes out only after dark</p><p>The path from Everton to Liverpool is not one well travelled. Nick Barmby was the last. If the other route is more travelled – think Kevin Sheedy, Peter Beardsley, Abel Xavier – it’s still not the done thing. So, <strong>Jarrad Branthwaite</strong> to Anfield, a deal that’s been bubbling under. Will it happen? The offer is £63m plus £7m in add-ons to prise the centre-back across Stanley Park. If Everton fans are used to seeing their stars sold too early – Wayne Rooney, Franny Jeffers, John Stones spring easily to mind – then perhaps a new ownership under John Textor may prevent a deal.</p><p>Branthwaite’s links with Manchester United were closed out by their purchase of Matthijs de Ligt.

This is the question that has provoked enough impassioned discussion to make it on to the Today programme (although we must remember it is August). The TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp, who is no stranger to provoking a reaction with her forthright views, allowed her son to do just that. Against all odds, the boy has returned alive and well in time to get his GSCE results, although this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/21/kirstie-allsopp-defends-letting-son-go-travelling-around-europe-aged-15">hasn’t prevented vocal criticism</a> online and off.</p><p>I’ve disagreed vehemently with Allsopp about various things, but in this case I find her stance rather admirable.

<p>A psychologist on the deleterious effects of cynicism and how faith in others is the key to building a better future</p><p>If you were under the impression that the opposite of a cynic is an easily hoodwinked person of low mental horsepower, then Jamil Zaki, a&nbsp;professor of psychology and director of Stanford’s Social Neuroscience Lab, has news for you. The idea that cynics are somehow more astute is the first of&nbsp;many notions demolished in this succinct, uplifting book.</p><p>Cynics perform less well in cognitive tests and “have a harder time spotting liars than non-cynics”. They are wrong more often than optimists, and the damage to their wellbeing, and to society, is higher than that incurred by their hopeful counterparts. Like an autoimmune disease, what starts out as a misguided defensive reaction ends up causing self-harm. (Zaki is careful early on to distinguish between “big-c” Cynics of&nbsp;the ancient philosophical tradition, and the cynicism “most of us know toda

The landscapes are quiet and vast, the pace of existence slow. It is the ideal environment in which to reflect and, for Sven-Göran Eriksson, now 76, it is where he was born and where he will die. Sven, a feature-length documentary about the football coach, meets him before and after he receives a terminal cancer diagnosis. This knowledge, set against the crisp beauty of Eriksson’s home country, lends Sven a profundity that most sports biographies can’t reach for – but there is plenty to laugh and scream at in a beguiling, multi-faceted film.</p><p>First, we chart Eriksson’s unlikely journey from rural Scandinavia to the higher levels of world football. After an average playing career, he cut a tremen
