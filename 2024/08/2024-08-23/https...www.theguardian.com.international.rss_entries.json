It\u2019s such a good sharing dessert, and this oaty, nutty one comes together pretty quickly, too. You can make the dough in advance, then just pop it in the oven while you\u2019re having dinner, so it\u2019s warm and a little gooey in time for pudding. I know there\u2019ll be lots of you itching to throw in chocolate chips, but I honestly don\u2019t think it needs them. You get to appreciate all the caramelly, buttery, almost flapjack-like flavour without any distractions.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/aug/23/giant-oat-and-almond-cookie-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi\">Continue reading...</a>", "id": 1048297, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/aug/23/giant-oat-and-almond-cookie-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "source_obj__id": 341, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccbee44ebd345f05d9fee0fc0a1396f02e1f80ee/0_2072_5792_3472/master/5792.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c8b68dec416475ba306f5625dcedadd0", "title": "Benjamina Ebuehi\u2019s recipe for a giant oat and almond cookie | The sweet spot", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-23T13:57:53+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Real Madrid midfielder has suffered leg injury, say club</li><li>England star would miss Ireland and Finland games</li></ul><p>Jude Bellingham faces a spell on the sidelines through injury and could miss the start of England\u2019s Nations League campaign.</p><p>The Real Madrid midfielder has suffered a leg injury and reports in Spain suggest the 21-year-old will not be available until after the international break.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/23/injured-bellingham-set-to-miss-englands-nations-league-double-header\">Continue reading...</a>", "id": 1048296, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/23/injured-bellingham-set-to-miss-englands-nations-league-double-header", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "source_obj__id": 341, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18dd8ab17ffdc9defba9557072f07b6e4b59fbf/0_175_2888_1732/master/2888.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5f2bd14893ce35a23fe894196d43583d", "title": "Injured Bellingham set to miss England\u2019s Nations League double header", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-23T13:37:03+00:00", "description": "<p>Fate of Starliner crew to be revealed as early as Saturday;
