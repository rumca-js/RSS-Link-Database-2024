<p>David Holz, CEO of Midjourney, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/952771221915840552">recently announced on Discord</a> that the AI image generation tool will soon be free to everyone.</p>



<p>Originally conceived in 2022 as a Discord bot, Midjourney evolved into a website in 2023 where users can type in descriptive prompts that are turned into AI-generated images. At first, the web tool was only open to those who had generated 10,000+ images on Discord.</p>



<p>With this change, anyone can now start using Midjourney via the site simply by logging in with a Discord or Google account. As a free user, you’ll be able to generate up to 25 images; once that cap is reached, you’ll have to upgrade to a paid subscription.</p>



<p>Midjourney offers four different subscription plans:</p>

<p>If you’ve ever struggled with replacing your PC’s graphics card, an upcoming Asus motherboard offers some really welcome news: a new retention mechanism that unlocks the card without the need for an awkwardly placed lever or switch.</p>



<p>The new mechanism is integrated into the Asus ROG Crosshair X870E HERO motherboard, shown off at Asus at the Gamescom show this week in Germany. <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/new-gpu-retention-mechanism">HotHardware spotted</a> the demonstration, recorded in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCBant78nKQ">der8auer video</a>.

<p>What’s great about this new mechanism is just the convenience of it all. Whether you’ve bought a prebuilt PC or built your own, you’re probably aware that the interior of a PC can

<p>I’m an avid reader and one of my favorite recent finds was a handy Kindle Paperwhite case that doesn’t just feature the usual magnetic closure but also a hand strap on the inside of the cover.</p>

<p>Even better is, when you’re tired and just want to prop your Kindle up on a desk or side table for comfortable reading, you can slip your hand out of the strap and pull out the kickstand.</p>



<p>And for an added bonus, this Kindle case has

<p>Markets of all kinds are being hit with a practice known as “shrinkflation,” where the price of an item remains the same but you get less product (or a lesser-quality product) for what you pay.</p>



<p>Shrinkflation is what comes to mind with the news that Nvidia’s latest version of the RTX 4070 graphics card will downgrade its 12GB of memory from GDDR6X to GDDR6.</p>

<p>That switch is a little less dramatic than it might sound. Despite the older and slower memory standard, the new RTX 4070 model will only lose about 5 percent of its memory bandwidth. That brings the memory speed down from 21Gbps to 20Gbps, <a href="https:/

<p>If you’re constantly stressed about whether your phone will make it through the day, you can toss all that stress away by simply carrying a power bank with you. (A power bank is basically just a portable charger that acts like a backup battery.)</p>



<p>And now’s a great time to get one because <a href="https://www.amazon.com/INIU-High-Speed-Flashlight-Powerbank-Compatible/dp/B07CZDXDG8">this Iniu power bank is on sale for just $18 on Amazon</a>, down from its usual $30.</p>



<p>First things first, this power bank is travel-friendly. It’s super thin with a thickness of just 0.5 inches, making it easy to slip into your pocket or pack away in your purse. It isn’t chunky like older power banks used to be.</p>



<p>And it has a 10,000mAh charging capacity, which is enough to fully recharge most phones twice. Equipped with three ports (one USB-C and two USB-A), y

<p>When Windows 10 launched, its new Settings app was slated to eventually take over for the Windows Control Panel—and yet that conglomeration of settings is still well alive and kicking. Talk of its impending demise has never gone away though, with new chatter <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2435474/microsoft-says-its-finally-getting-rid-of-control-panel-in-windows.html">surfacing just this week</a>.</p>



<p>Most Windows users probably are fine with that move. I am not.</p>



<p>Sure, the Windows Control Panel looks like a relic. It gets less use than its successor. And its layout isn’t always the fastest to navigate. But the Settings app is an imperfect replacement. </p>

<p>Two years ago I weighed 330 pounds. That’s just shy of 150 kilograms, if you’re not using Freedom Units. On August 7 my scale showed 229.4 pounds (104 kilos). While that’s by no means slim for a 5-foot-10 man, and I intend to lose more, I think it’s fair to say I’m now closer to “chunky” than obese. And a small but meaningful part of that weight loss is thanks to a VR game. </p>

<p>Instead of developing a program from scratch, programmers sometimes use command line tools<strong> </strong>(CLI, Command Line Interface) or program libraries of the system in the background. The set options are transferred to the GUI tool, the return values are read out, and displayed in the window. </p>
