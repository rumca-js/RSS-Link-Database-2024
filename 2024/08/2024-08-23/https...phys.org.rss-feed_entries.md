The income and education levels of a child's environment determine their relationship to nature, not whether they live in a city or the countryside. This is the finding of a new study published in People and Nature and conducted by researchers at Lund University, Sweden. The results run counter to the assumption that growing up in the countryside automatically increases our connection to nature, and yet the study also shows that nature close to home increases children's well-being.

There's a lot going on between Earth's atmosphere and the sun. Accurately forecasting conditions in this area of space is challenging but critical to the safety of astronauts, satellites, and even ground-based systems such as power grids. Doing so requires using a combination of monitoring techniques to track specific aspects of the sun, solar wind, the ionosphere, and more.

To produce light, lasers typically rely on optical cavities, pairs of mirrors facing each other that amplify light by bouncing it back and forth. Recently, some physicists have been investigating the generation of "laser light" in open air without the use of optical cavities, a phenomenon known as cavity-free lasing in atmospheric air.

## Researchers demonstrate metasurfaces that control thermal radiation in unprecedented ways
