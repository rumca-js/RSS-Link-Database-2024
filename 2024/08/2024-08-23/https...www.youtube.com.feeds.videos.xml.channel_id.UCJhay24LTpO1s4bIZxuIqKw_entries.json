There are many concerns about the safety of our C++ language, and projects developed using it. Many improvements are being discussed, starting from handling of the low-level fundamental types, through updating the language rules (e.g., initialization), up to providing safer high-level abstractions in the library.\n\nThis lecture presents how the usage of a Modern C++ quantities and units library can improve the safety of the code we write every day. During the talk, Mateusz will describe all issues and possible solutions discussed in [P2981: Improving our safety with a physical quantities and units library](https://wg21.link/p2981). Based on the examples developed with the mp-units project, the attendees will not only learn the obvious benefits of using such a lib", "id": 1048168, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tV_cXtIpWE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "source_obj__id": 421, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/_tV_cXtIpWE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Enhancing Safety in C++ Code With Modern C++ Quantities and Units Library - Mateusz Pusz - ACCU 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
