<p>The <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2683784/what-is-cloud-computing.html">cloud computing</a> boom brought innovation and showed us the need for strategic planning to avoid costly mistakes such as “shadow IT” (IT activities or purchases made without the knowledge of the IT department), which led to unexpected expenses and security issues. With <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a> rising, IT leaders can apply these lessons to avoid similar pitfalls with “shadow AI,” the unchecked use of AI without precise planning.</p>
