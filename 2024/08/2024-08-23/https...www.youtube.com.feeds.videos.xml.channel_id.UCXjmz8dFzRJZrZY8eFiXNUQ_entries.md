While currently in production of the 11th installment in the Fast and Furious Franchise, it's hard to imagine any other actors portraying a member of the Fast Family.  It's even harder to imagine another actor in the place of Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto.  When Gone in 60 Seconds actor Timothy Olyphant turned down the roll, Vin Diesel was instantly realized as the guy to carry the Fast and Furious franchise.  11 movies, a tv show, and theme park ride later, it seems replacing Timothy Olyphant with Vin Diesel as Dom Toretto was best for all involved.
