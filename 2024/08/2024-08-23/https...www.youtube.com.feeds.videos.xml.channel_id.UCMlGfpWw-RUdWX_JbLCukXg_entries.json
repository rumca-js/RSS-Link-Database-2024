While the C++ Standard Library has a rich set of concurrency primitives and lower-level building blocks, we lack a standard framework for asynchrony and parallelism that C++ programmers desperately need.\n\nAsynchrony and parallelism appear everywhere, from processor hardware interfaces to networking, to file I/O, to GUIs, to accelerators. Every C++ domain and every platform needs to deal with asynchrony and parallelism, from scientific ", "id": 1046860, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzaXRdkY26M", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "source_obj__id": 420, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/BzaXRdkY26M/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Interview With Mateusz Pusz (Structured Concurrency in C++) - CppCon 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
