So good it's still used all over the world to this day.\n\n\n\"The BIC Cristal (stylised as BiC Cristal and also known as the Bic Biro) is an inexpensive, disposable ballpoint pen mass-produced and sold by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Bic of Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine, France. It was introduced in 1950 and is the best-selling pen in the world, with the 100 billionth sold in September 2006. It has become the archetypal ballpoint pen and is considered ubiquitous, to the extent that the Museum of Modern Art has made it a permanent part of its collection. Its hexagonal form and design mimics a standard pencil and it is sold in six types of point and 18 colours around the world.\"\n\nMore on Wikipedia: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bic_Cristal\n\nJoin membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg/join\nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt93hxFmjppL5nLRAX94UrA\nMerch: https://qxir.creator-spring.com/\nPatreon: https://www.patre", "id": 1050244, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKTglEMyWB0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg", "source_obj__id": 447, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/yKTglEMyWB0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Simple but Brilliant: Is This the Greatest Modern Invention? | Tales From the Bottle", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
