		Since 2023, ten individuals working for U.S. intelligence and other federal agencies who held either a Top Secret or Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information security clearance were arrested or convicted of espionage. It’s unclear whether “continuous vetting” (CV) flagged these individuals for scrutiny, or whether it didn’t.

Continuous vetting is supposed to be the federal government’s process whereby there are regular reviews of a cleared individuals’ background to ensure that they continue to meet stringent security clearance requirements and should continue to hold positions of trust.

Automated record checks pull data from criminal, terrorism, and financial databases, as well as public records, at any time during an individual’s period of eligibility. When the U.S. Defense

		Biometric face verification can be an effective tool for remote identity verification, but many systems still have some issues to work out, according to research from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

A webinar from DHS’ Science &amp; Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) shared results from the second stage of the Remote Identity Validation Technology Demonstration (<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/remote-identity-validation-technology-demonstration">RIVTD</a>). RIVTD Track 2 evaluated the capability to match a selfie to the image included on the document.

The testing, carried out at the Maryland Test Facility (MdTF), shows that many systems have trouble extracting biometric templates from ID documents, commonly struggling with rotated fa
