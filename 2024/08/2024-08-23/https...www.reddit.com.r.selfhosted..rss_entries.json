Authelia runs in docker with traefik. The problem is Authelia wants a domain which it protects for the session cookies, but the domain I'm using is .home. So Authelia runs under auth.home, traefik under traefik.home. But Authelia does not accept home as a valid cookie domain. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PrestigiousLynx3229\"> /u/PrestigiousLynx3229 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ezd3jy/authelia_with_private_tld/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ezd3jy/authelia_with_private_tld/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1048434, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ezd3jy/authelia_with_private_tld", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Authelia with private TLD", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-23T13:28:52+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>After seeing the post yesterday about an exposed proxmox share, I just want to make sure I'm clear on this. </p> <p>I don't have any other ports forwarded, but I do have several docker containers running various services.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kalidibus\"> /u/kalidibus </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ezcrwa/if_my_only_external_access_is_wireguard_and_thats/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ezcrwa/if_my_only_external_access_is_wireguard_and_thats/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1048435, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ezcrwa/if_my_only_external_access_is_wireguard_and_thats", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "If my only external access is Wireguard and that's the only port forwarded, do I need to be monitoring / fixing anything else for security?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-23T13:27:38+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>HI , i am trying to expose a web app running on a docker container through cloudlare tunnel from my private network.</p> <ol> <li>Added the domain and created the tunnel on cloudflare zero trust dashboard</li> <li>created a docker-compose file with &quot;mynetwork&quot; for cloudflare , the other container is also in the same network</li> <li>docker network inspect mynetwork shows both cloudflare container and the webapp container</li> <li>this is the local network ip from docker inspect</li> </ol> <p><code>&quot;Subnet&quot;: &quot;172.18.0.0/16&quot;,</code></p> <p><code>&quot;Gateway&quot;: &quot;172.18.0.1&quot;</code></p> <p>5) I can see the tunnel is healthy from cloudflare zero trust dashboard</p> <p>6) now configured the public hostname on the dashboard using the container name of the flask app and port</p> <p><code>myapp:3232</code></p> <p>7) selected http for the container</p> <p>8) In the private network tab i used <a href=\"http://172.18.0.", "id": 1048436, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ezcqxz/help_with_cloudflare_tunnel_to_expose_my_webapp", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Help with cloudflare tunnel to expose my webapp outside", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-23T12:52:14+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello there,<br /> since my internet access is quite restricted at work, I would love to have something like <a href=\"https://meetfranz.com\">Franz - (https://meetfranz.com) </a>or Ferdi. </p> <p>My problem with those services is, that they don't have a webUI to access.
