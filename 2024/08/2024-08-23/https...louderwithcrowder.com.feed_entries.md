No matter how often companies die on the DEI hill, that never seems to steer people back to sanity. However, it didn’t take much warning from the unwoke mob for Jack Daniels to get a reality check. </p>
<p>Jack Daniels has axed its DEI initiatives after backlash warnings from “anti-woke” activist Robby Starbuck. </p><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Big news: The next company we were set to expose was <a href="https://twitter.com/JackDaniels_US?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JackDaniels_US</a>.<br /><br />They must have been tipped off by us going through employee LinkedIn pages.<br /><br />They just preemptively announced that they’ll be making these changes:<br /><br />• Ending participation in the <a href="https:

<p>We now live in a time where many people despise the American flag, even though we are in America. And because that is an incredibly dumb take, no one should treat these people seriously, given how objectively retarded they are. This is why students at Edmond North High School defied school officials after being told they were not allowed to fly the flag. </p><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquot

	As we've seen over the past few weeks, our corporate journalisming overlords are more than happy to shill, carry water, and/or straight-up lie on behalf of Kamala Harris. Or if not on behalf of KamaLOLOLOLOLOLa, on behalf of the fact she's not Donald Trump.

I'm not angry or outraged. Just meh. It was everything I expected it to be: lies, lack of policies, and acknowledgment that she had anything to do with the past four years. You might argue she understood the assignment since the assignment is to pretend she didn't exist prior to meangirling Joe Biden out of the election.</p><p>Since the media is going to be working overtime to pretend she's never said or done anything ever, it's that much more important that we do.
