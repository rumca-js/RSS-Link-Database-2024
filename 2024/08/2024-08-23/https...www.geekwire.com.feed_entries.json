But its business has changed significantly since the days of those crazy Super Bowl ads and the cartoon character with the wild hair. The company&#8217;s logo, for one, now consists of the letters &#8220;GO&#8221; intertwined in the shape of a heart. And its wholesome ads focus on empowering the small business owners that make up the vast majority of its customer base. But there&#8217;s a more fundamental change behind the scenes. In addition to its core domain business, GoDaddy has been rolling out&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/godaddy-goes-ai-domain-giants-evolution-is-a-litmus-test-for-small-business-adoption/\">Read More</a>", "id": 1049707, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/godaddy-goes-ai-domain-giants-evolution-is-a-litmus-test-for-small-business-adoption", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "GoDaddy goes AI: Domain giant\u2019s evolution is a litmus test for small business adoption", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-23T03:34:26+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"Aerial view of Amazon&#039;s satellite processing facility in Florida\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"944\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/240822-kuiper-1260x944.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Amazon plans to build a secondary support facility for its Project Kuiper satellite processing center at Kennedy Space Center in Florida &#8212; a $19.5 million expansion plan that brings total investment in the site to nearly $140 million. The 42,000-square-foot building will be placed next to the existing 100,000-square-foot structure at the satellite processing facility, Amazon said today in a blog posting. It&#8217;s meant to provide additional space for processing and storing flight hardware ahead of launch, allowing for a regular cadence of missions to deploy Project Kuiper&#8217;s 3,232-satellite constellation.

Today magniX and its partners unveiled the De Havilland Dash 7 plane at Seattle&#8217;s Boeing Field in preparation for its conversion for NASA&#8217;s Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration project, or EPFD. The aircraft now bears the logos of magniX, NASA and Air Tindi, the Canadian regional carrier from which the Dash 7 was acquired. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of work left to be&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/magnix-test-airplane-nasa-hybrid-electric-flight/\">Read More</a>", "id": 1046212, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/magnix-test-airplane-nasa-hybrid-electric-flight", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "MagniX shows off test airplane for NASA\u2019s hybrid electric flight demonstration project", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-23T00:47:42+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"865\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Azoff-talk-1260x865.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Silicon Valley is recognized globally as *the* tech hub and is so iconic that the region itself essentially co-starred in an eponymously named, self-mocking comedy. Now a venture capitalist wants the Seattle area to plant its flag as the &#8220;Silicon Valley&#8221; of climate technology. \u00a0 Speaking at an event at the University of Washington on Thursday, Seattle venture capitalist Jonathan Azoff introduced &#8220;Carbon Sound&#8221; \u2014 a riff on the region&#8217;s climate-driven focus to decarbonize the economy and its physical location on the shores of Puget Sound. The moniker might need a little workshopping.
