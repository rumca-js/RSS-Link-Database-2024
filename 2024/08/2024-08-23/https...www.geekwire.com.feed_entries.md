But its business has changed significantly since the days of those crazy Super Bowl ads and the cartoon character with the wild hair. The company&#8217;s logo, for one, now consists of the letters &#8220;GO&#8221; intertwined in the shape of a heart. And its wholesome ads focus on empowering the small business owners that make up the vast majority of its customer base. But there&#8217;s a more fundamental change behind the scenes. In addition to its core domain business, GoDaddy has been rolling out&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/godaddy-goes-ai-domain-giants-evolution-is-a-litmus-test-for-small-business-adoption/">Read More</a>

The 42,000-square-foot building will be placed next to the existing 100,000-square-foot structure at the satellite processing facility, Amazon said today in a blog posting. It&#8217;s meant to provide additional space for processing and storing flight hardware ahead of launch, allowing for a regular cadence of missions to deploy Project Kuiper&#8217;s 3,232-satellite constellation. Project Kuiper is Amazon&#8217;s multibillion-dollar effort to provide broadband internet&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.c

Today magniX and its partners unveiled the De Havilland Dash 7 plane at Seattle&#8217;s Boeing Field in preparation for its conversion for NASA&#8217;s Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration project, or EPFD. The aircraft now bears the logos of magniX, NASA and Air Tindi, the Canadian regional carrier from which the Dash 7 was acquired. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of work left to be&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/magnix-test-airplane-nasa-hybrid-electric-flight/">Read More</a>

Now a venture capitalist wants the Seattle area to plant its flag as the &#8220;Silicon Valley&#8221; of climate technology.   Speaking at an event at the University of Washington on Thursday, Seattle venture capitalist Jonathan Azoff introduced &#8220;Carbon Sound&#8221; — a riff on the region&#8217;s climate-driven focus to decarbonize the economy and its physical location on the shores of Puget Sound. The moniker might need a little workshopping.
