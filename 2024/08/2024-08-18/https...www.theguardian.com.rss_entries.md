The British producer Mark Burnett endowed him with a new persona as a charismatic leader, a “godlike character” worshipped by teams of ruthless young entrepreneurs who fought for the chance to serve as apprentices in his property company.

But who really knows what to say at the end? He was seemingly insensate, his vacant face unfamiliar and chilling. For the first time in my life he didn’t quicken to my attention, didn’t rise to the occasion of being Dad. I told him that I loved him and that I wouldn’t leave him. I kissed him. I wept. And then I told him about a small tortoiseshell I had seen in his garage just two hours earlier.</p><p>I didn’t tell him it was the separated wing of a dead butterfly, a memento mori buried behind a pile of logs I was shifting for my mum. The significant thing was that I had <em>named</em> a butterfly. Just a few weeks earlier, Dad would have considered this a small miracle. He was probably hoping for a more useful miracle in that particular moment, but I am sure I felt his hand flex in mine

## André 3000 review – live spiritual jazz leaves hip-hop visionary with nowhere to hide

<p><strong>The Jazz Cafe, London<br /></strong>The former rapper starts promisingly with earthy improvisation but the band drifts disappointingly with no solos and few flashes of emotion</p><p>When rapper André 3000 decided to put his mic down in 2023 and release his first album in almost two decades as a flautist leading a spiritual jazz ensemble, it was met with mixed responses. American jazz magazine <a href="https://archive.maherpublications.com/view/884657324/38/#zoom=true">Downbeat called</a> New Blue Sun a record where “the music rarely rises above atmospheric noodling”, while Pitchfork awarded it <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/andre-3000-new-blue-sun/">Best New Album</a>.</p><p>Whether you see the record as a brave step into the unknown from a hip-hop visionary or 90 minutes of wistful tooting on woodwinds seems to be a matter of subjectivity. Yet, when it comes to jazz, a genre premised on the instinctive self-expression of improvisation, the proof is in the li

<p>Make the most of summer’s stone fruit season with these simple ideas for lunch and pudding</p><p>Halfway down the garden, in the middle of the thick yew hedge, a wild plum tree is heavy with fruit, each one hanging like a bauble on a Christmas tree. The tree was never intentionally planted and is probably the result of my habit of throwing plum stones into the garden. The first I knew of it was an arching branch of snow-white blossom that appeared from the hedge one spring. Late each summer, its branches are bent low with chartreuse gages, the size of a thrush’s egg. Tiny and sweet as honey, the fruits are almost translucent in the late summer sunshine.</p><p>Plums have been trickling into the market, too – the rare Reine Claude, the purple-red Opal and the ubiquitous but welcome Victoria among them. Ripe and jelly-fleshed, there is rarely a plum I don’t like, but I appreciate them most in the kitchen, where they will be bubbled down into sauces for pork or duck, tucked under pastr

<p>The country faces grave and deep-seated problems that only bold – and expensive – policies can address</p><p>When Keir Starmer was just the lowly leader of the opposition, he made one of his themes “sticking-plaster politics”. It was a critique of the way that Westminster tends to focus intensely on something for a short while, before flitting off to another crisis and solving nothing along the way. It made a lot of sense for Starmer to complain about short-termism in politics: the Tories were bouncing from one problem to another, and, besides, every leader of the opposition likes to opine worthily about broken politics from the convenient distance of not being in power and having to fix it. Well, now he is in power, and is faced with all the temptations to leave the Band-Aids firmly in place.</p><p>There is no department that is a better example of what happens when you have a sticking-plaster approach than Work and Pensions.

<p><strong>Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</strong><br />The standup weaves real-world experiences of racism with whimsy about angler fish and joining the yakuza</p><p>There are few things more tedious, they say, than listening to the contents of someone else’s dreams. Jin Hao Li seems to have taken that as a challenge. His rookie fringe set is structured around a trio of nightmares he had, and some happier reveries too. And even when dreams aren’t the subject of Swimming in a Submarine, there’s a certain dream logic at play – or at least, we’re lulled into thinking so by the China-born Li’s gentle cadences and fuzzy, offbeat humour.</p><p>This is an arresting debut then, staking out space where soft surrealism meets the autobiographical standup of a man who went from the Singaporean army to an English degree at St Andrews uni. He traces that trajectory here, but in the telling, it routes him via a romance between an insect and an arachnid, a rap from the perspective of an apple, and t

<p>Everyone wants to go to a house party, as Stormzy says, but no one wants to host one. But it is time to make the effort…</p><p>I’ve been half-planning a party. It takes a while to commit, for me – I need a bit of a run-up, four or five conversations just before sleep, two or three reasons to celebrate, the casual dangling of the possibility to a handful of friends, before I set a date and make a playlist and finally, with great ceremony, put out the nice crisps. It was midway through this process, a tickle of anxiety at my throat, that I learned about the rise of fake house parties.</p><p>These are club nights designed to look and feel like guests are drinking in someone’s dim front room, with wallpapered dancefloors and spaces done up like suburban bathrooms, lit for selfies. Stormzy is behind one of these clubs – in a press release he explained the concept: “We all know everyone wants to go to a house party, nobody really wants to host one – and this is exactly what this house is

I wondered about each boy, about what happened after that photo was taken.”</p

Dogs are natural philosophers, and I am convinced they can answer some important questions for us – about life, what is important in it, and how to live it.

<p>The best highlighters for a sun-kissed look, plus a serum to brighten skin and clever ways to self-tan</p><p>There is an expectation that the sun automatically gives you glowy skin. That’s a fallacy of sorts. The sun might hide your dull skin (and without SPF will damage it), but it doesn’t get rid of it. So whether it is raining or blazing, if not tackled, the dull skin will remain. Ongoing exfoliation helps. In the short term, however, get a highlighter. Add to serums, foundations or to your cheekbones. It’s the quickest route to a deliciously subtle – but not glittery or iridescent – glow.</p><p><strong>1.

<p><strong>Summerhall, Edinburgh</strong> <br />Exploring coercive relationships, Laura Horton’s play features three middle-aged women in ‘snazzy cardigans’ performing a real-time maiden gig</p><p>‘This next song is called Kiss My Tits.” In Laura Horton’s play, we meet a punk band formed by frontwoman Leah as a tribute to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/23/this-time-with-alan-partridge-from-aha-to-zombies-the-a-z-of-alan-partridge">Alan Partridge</a>’s PA Lynn Benfield – but also as a snook cocked at Leah’s 40th birthday and encroaching maturity. Two best friends have been pressganged into taking part, and here we all are at their maiden gig. It unfolds in real-time in front of us, and – even by punk standards – it is not carried off with much aplomb.</p><p>There is comedy to be found in three middle-aged women in “snazzy cardigans” delivering an in-yer-face gig without any perceptible musical ability.

As his memoir comes out, he talks about love, loss and finding his way back</p><p>“The fuck up”, as Jordan Stephens refers to it – both in-person and on page – wasn’t his first experience of infidelity. “Yes, I had been unfaithful to girlfriends in the past,” he accepts, “I’d also been cheated on.” It’s just, what happened in that hotel bedroom five years ago, the night of a friend’s seaside wedding, played out differently. It triggered a breakup, a breakdown, a path to sobriety. “I’d had three, four other relationships before, but I’d never stopped afterwards. Oh, we’ve broken up? I’ll go on tour, sleep with whoever, do a bunch of cocaine, or drink loads. I’d numb myself to get through it, then make the same mistakes.” Not this time. “This one, however, was a pivotal point for me. I was in a relationship, I fucked it up, then everything crumbled.
