But I am not sure if rpi5 is powerful enough to handle all these tasks. So I decided to ask you about recommendations? currentl rpi5 8gb is 100$ in my country (tax included) So It would be perfect if you advice something similar in price range.

Obviously portainer would be in a container as well. I want to use Pi Hole's DNS server to forward certain domains (i.e. proxy.myserver, pihole.myserver portainer.myserver, etc) to the correct container, but I can't figure out how to do this without exporting each containers ports to the real network, and then I may as well just access them as &lt;my-server-ip&gt;:80, :81, :82 etc.</p> <p>I have tried putting them all on a network with the bridge driver that is not the &quot;bridge&quot; network, as that's what I think the docs said to do, but it still wouldn't work

For that I used a ssh addon and connect to the system via filezilla: so far so good, I can navigate the system and also start the transfer of files.</p> <p>Here the problem starts: The speed of the file transfer is extremely slow: Just moving a .png with 16KB takes *multiple* attempts and to me it looks like the transfer loses the connection again and again, since filezilla asks me after a while &quot;the file already exists, overwrite?&quot; -&gt; The file did not exist before I started the transfer.</p> <p>My guess is that the problem somehow lies in the connection from my PC to the ssh server on home assistant, but I don't know how I can identify the problem.

This causes lot of issues between apple and android users, especially in group chats. </p> <p>RCS is suppose to fix that, but from what I heard, it's still controlled by a company, it's just that now it's controlled by Google. They are blocking custom roms from being able to use it, so then that still screws over anyone that doesn't want to run the stock android, which is full of privacy issues. </p> <p>Is there a way one can run their own RCS server to get around that?
