  <p id="Z93XUQ">San Francisco neighbors who live in a building next to a Waymo parking lot are still being haunted by overnight honking. That’s despite a fix from the ride hail company that seems to have fixed the original problem — the cars beeping their horns in the parking lot — but has also revealed that the issue is a little stickier than it may have first seemed.</p>
<p id="CYneqa">Waymo said last week that the honking was the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219916/waymo-released-a-software-update-to-solve-its-san-francisco-honkfest">result of a safety feature</a> triggered when a Waymo car detects anothe
