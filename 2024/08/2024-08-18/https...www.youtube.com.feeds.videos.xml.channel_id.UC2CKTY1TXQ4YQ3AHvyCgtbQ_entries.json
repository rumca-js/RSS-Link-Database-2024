It sounds like some things have changed, some things are staying the same, and some things we just don't know about yet. We'll talk about all that and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com\n\nI'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly).
