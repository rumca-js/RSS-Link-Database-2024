<p>Signing the striker is a statement of intent and reshaped attack could make impact at Leicester in season opener</p><p>Ange Postecoglou could not hide his smirk when the question came about whether his record of second‑season success is about to continue in north London. “Dunno,” the Tottenham manager said. “I expect what I expect all the time, mate. To do my job and see what that brings. But I would suggest that it’s not by accident. We’ll improve and see where that takes us.”</p><p>After a summer of relative calm in comparison with his arrival before the start of last season, there was a clear sense of optimism as the straight‑talking Australian, who was one of the more insightful pundits employed by ITV at Euro&nbsp;2024, laid out his expectations&nbsp;for the new campaign in the buildup to their opening match, against&nbsp;Leicester on Monday night.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/18/ange-postecoglou-dominic-solanke-tottenham-premier-league-fo

<p>This misty-eyed homage to Bonnie and Clyde star Faye Dunaway (with her involvement) papers over her reputation for being difficult – but is still a troubling portrait</p><p>She was one of the worst people in Hollywood, according to Bette Davis. To Jack Nicholson, she was “the Dreaded Dunaway”. Steve McQueen unflatteringly nicknamed her Done Fadeaway on the set of The Thomas Crown Affair, either due to her extreme weight loss or because he thought she was a no-mark. She wasn’t. Faye Dunaway remains an icon of Hollywood’s second golden age, a fantastically talented actor and a central figure in the celebrity gossip sphere. But behind the delicious anecdotes was a woman struggling with undiagnosed bipolar disorder, a darkness that is hinted at but never fully explored in this documentary from the director Laurent Bouzereau.</p><p>Our first encounter with Dunaway, now 83, provides a presumably tongue-in-cheek demonstration of her trademark belligerence (or is she genuinely this rude?),

<p>Alan Gouk, who has died from cancer aged 84, was an ambitious abstract painter and an eloquent and passionate writer, committed to the continuing power of modernism. For many years he taught sculpture at St Martin’s School of Art (now Central Saint Martins, part of the University of the Arts London). He was primarily influenced by American abstract expressionism, although became conscious of the European basis of his art – his personal lodestars were the painters Henri Matisse, Hans Hofmann and Patrick Heron.</p><p>A job as exhibition officer to the British Council in the early 1960s provided Alan with a crucial introduction to the London art world.

<p>The daughter of civil rights activists has an unbroken history of working to change ‘anything that wasn’t right’, friends say</p><p>It was the first week of July. News of the presidential election had been mired, for eight days, in alarming assessments of Joe Biden and that shambolic debate. The president had started but not finished sentences, slurred words and at points stood with his mouth slightly agape while his opponent, Donald Trump, ignored questions and lied without fact-check.</p><p>Now, on 6 July, inside New Orleans’s convention center, the 30th annual Essence Festival of Culture was under way. Kamala Harris was set to speak, one of the vice-president’s biggest in-person events since Biden’s performance had seemingly upended the race. The attendees – mostly Black women, drawn to this long-running music-festival-meets-women’s-expo – were waiting to see Harris. Some were chattering about the possibilities: did her future lie at the top of the Democratic party’s ticket? Wha

<p>The presidential election is three months away. What if the billionaire contests the result? What if he decides democracy is over-rated?</p><p>Just over four years ago, an insurrectionist mob found each other online, descended on Washington, stormed the Capitol and threatened the vice-president with a noose. But that was the good old days. We’re living in a different reality now. One in which the billionaires have been unchained.</p><p>Because back in the golden days of 2020, tech platforms, still reeling from a public backlash, had at least to look as if they gave a shit. Twitter employed 4,000-plus people in “trust and safety”, tasked with getting dangerous content off its platform and sniffing out foreign influence operations. Facebook tried to ignore public pressure but eventually banned political ads that sought to “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54369303">delegitimise voting</a>” and scores of academics and researchers in “election integrity” units worked to i

<p>Trade union rights, the welfare state, austerity… these are the issues that really affect lives</p><p>‘Immigration harms British workers. We must restrict immigration to improve working-class lives.” That is the subtext – and often the explicit text – of the argument from those who are hostile to immigration or wish drastically to reduce numbers. It is an argument that has been given sharper focus by the riots in which much anger was vented towards immigrants and asylum seekers, and the majority of which took place&nbsp;in <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c8317b53-ce27-42fc-bd67-59f9ac9267c9">the most deprived regions</a> of England.</p><p>I want to set aside the issue of whether immigration harms British workers, or, more pertinently, in what context such a claim may be true, and ask instead a different question. What other policies might we – or should we – expect critics of immigration to endorse if they are genuine in their belief that their aim is to defend working-class in
