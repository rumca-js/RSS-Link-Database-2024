Oh, nice, that one's even better than my usual approach, I'd better tuck that idea away for next time.\"\n\nThis perfect alignment is precious... and particularly elusive in C++. Most of us are living in codebases that are profitable, complex, and updated in ways with which we have legitimate beef. How can we keep a sense of curiosity, progress, and satisfaction amidst patterns we would never have chosen?\n\nThis presentation explores the often-overlooked social aspects of C++ development, offering both practical tools and light-hearted commiseration. We'll draw from the field of behavior science to build strategies that address conf", "id": 1021015, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiXXX64PGA0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "source_obj__id": 421, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/WiXXX64PGA0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Keynote: Strategies to Cope With Conflicting Design Patterns in C++ Development Teams - Laura Savino", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
