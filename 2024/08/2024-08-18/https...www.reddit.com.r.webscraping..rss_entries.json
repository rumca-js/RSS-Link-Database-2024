I've gotten to the point where I can scrape simple things but I'm looking to scrape specific criteria and thats a bit over my head. Please forgive me if I sound a bit misinformed, as I'm a newb, but its basically a job title as an h2 element and the jobs location as a li element, and they're both inside of a div. I'm trying to scrape all of the jobs that are in a certain location.
