<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I'm working on a project that involves identifying highly active individuals in a particular field. Is there a way to run an algorithm to scrape data from all relevant posts, determine who has been the most active, and then share that account information with us? If so, are there any laws governing this? Totally new here and would love to know your thoughts on it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kartikeya40"> /u/kartikeya40 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1evh7lj/scraping_social_media_data/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1evh7lj/scraping_social_media_data/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I'm new to webscraping and python in general. I've gotten to the point where I can scrape simple things but I'm looking to scrape specific criteria and thats a bit over my head. Please forgive me if I sound a bit misinformed, as I'm a newb, but its basically a job title as an h2 element and the jobs location as a li element, and they're both inside of a div. I'm trying to scrape all of the jobs that are in a certain location. If anyone knows of any good resources, I'd greatly appreciate it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Oyyeee"> /u/Oyyeee </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1eve13f/any_recommendations_for_good_beautifulsoup/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1eve13f/any_recommendations_for_good_beautifulsoup/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good day ! I am currently working on a webapp aimed to be a photographic supplies search engine. It is extracting and sorting publicly available datas from multiple retailers online store, mainly prices and couple others specs and make it searchable for the user. I’d like to expose the collected and cleaned data through its own public API as well.</p> <p>Are there major legal issues doing so ? Any specific subtleties that I should be aware of ? I’m located in the EU.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any insights !</p> <p>(Documented references appreciated)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Goggom"> /u/Goggom </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ev4sux/online_store_legal_advice/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ev4sux/online_store_legal_advice/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I have an api that I host on render which accesses an api endpoint for another site. They recently closed the api access to everyone by protecting it with cloudfare. I'm able to use puppeteer extra stealth to access the site in a standalone script, but when hosted on my api server, it is then blocked. Wondering if theres anything I can do to fix, or if its a dead end.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Illustrious-Escape-4"> /u/Illustrious-Escape-4 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1euxzhq/fighting_cloudfare_when_script_is_hosted_on_server/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1euxzhq/fighting_cloudfare_when_script_is_hosted_on_server/">[comments]</a></span>
