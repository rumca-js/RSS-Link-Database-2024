We here at Theorist feel bad for Chikn Nuggit, friends. He's all alone in a world without his friends. He's lost them all and has spiraled out of control. And the worst part of it all is that he's been being manipulated for a long time. We know you've asked for more Chikn Nuggit LORE, loyal Theorists, so we're here to deliver.
