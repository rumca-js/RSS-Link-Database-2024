Some people think this is a waste of time. I don't. It's common sense and costs $10. The 1/2 inch rubber protects exposed edges of foam boards, cement board and drywall from water and vaport - the latter is frequently overlooked. In addition, the gasket has a concave shape that promotes water to drain downward and outside the stud cavity. If you're building a shower, this extra step is easy, affordable, and reduces the likelihood of water problems at the valve.
