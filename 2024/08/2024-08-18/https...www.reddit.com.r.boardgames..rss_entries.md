<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When it comes to modern board games there are a bunch of improvements compared to the classics. Most of those improvements are purely gameplay. It's a good time to be into board games because of it but one thing I find odd is: What's with all the cardboard? It's a niche hobby, you have the popular games but most games here are for hobbyists and they usually play quite often. But with these cardboard boards, tokens and components it doesn't take long for wear to form </p> <p>People buy sleeves to avoid wear on cards but you can't really sleeve a board or other components! I recently got Everdell and after a couple of plays the tree is already damaged and the board at the crease is also getting loose.</p> <p>Why didn't manufacturers switch over to plastic boards and plastic components to avoid wear? I think often times board games could have better quality boards and tokens but the moment they do they make it look really fancy, call it a special edition

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Was having trouble getting a copy of Barrage from a FLGS as it was between printings and saw it in stock online through Cranio’s website. Figured I would get the add ons to justify shipping and I got an invoice for everything but the original game wasn’t with the box. </p> <p>The package shipped pretty quickly from Europe to US. But when it arrived I thought the box was a bit small. I’ve seen barrage and it’s not that small of a game. I opened the package to find invoices for my order along with a game organizer, wrapped very nicely in packaging paper, some expansion/promo stuff all unboxed but nicely wrapped up in plastic. Ultimately there is no base game or game box which seems a bit crazy considering the cost of the game and accessories is &gt;150€. Reached out a few times by email and haven’t got any response.</p> <p>Wondering if anyone else had any luck reaching them or getting resolution on shipment errors. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>i’ve been thinking about this collection of board games i played in middle school, on and off throughout the years. this teacher had a bunch of these made by the same company and i believe they leaned toward a more educational vibe. i remember the colors being just white and the actual board having navy blue line art illustrations. it was a very plain color palate and design, especially the box being i think just white with the title of the game in navy blue letters. if i remember correctly, one game took place in a mall and had a top down view of the entire mall. the mall had different stores like department, pet store, clothing etc, and had different exits in the four corners i think. the stores were all around the border of the board and there may have been more stores in the center. another game involved hiking on some kind of mountain? there were cards involved with both but i can’t remember exactly what kinds of questions or prompts they would h

## Clank! is one of the best games to introduce people to board games

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have only played Clank! In Space, but out of my collection it is easily the best board game to play with people who don’t play board games. Fuck building settlements in Catan or some other boring shit like that, Clank is a game about competing to see who can sneak around and steal an artifact from a spaceship or a dungeon. The game is relatively easy to explain, let’s people get creative with strategies, and by the end everyone has their eyes peeled and is really buying into the intensity that the clank mechanism provides. Since the chance of you getting caught and killed goes up over time, the earlygame let’s new players have a bit of time to understand the cards and form strategies, but as the rage meter goes up, boss attacks become deadlier and deadlier and everyone stats realizing “oh shit I gotta go” and everyone goes wild when there’s a boss attack near the end of the game, hoping and praying they don’t die. I would definitely recommend having
