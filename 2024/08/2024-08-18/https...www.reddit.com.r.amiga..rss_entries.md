## Can anyone with a Chinon disk drive tell me where the tiny ball-bearing between my fingers is meant to go? It just rolled out when I opened the drive. Anyone got a drive that is opened up and they can see where exactly it goes? Thanks!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a Rev 5 Amiga 500. Years ago I went down the rabbit trail of building a terrible fire accelerator card. (I got hooked with the pimp my Amiga videos) I could never get it to work and I got frustrated and packed the computer away. Recently I got an Amiga kick again and want to put the computer back together. I figured I would just start by bringing it back up to stock. When I built the accelerator card I removed the 68k socket and put regular headers in. </p> <p>Do you guys have any recommendations on a high quality 68k sockets? Digikey and mouser would be ideal buying source.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/0x0000NOP"> /u/0x0000NOP </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ev4zog/68k_socket_recommendations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ev4zog/68k_socket_recommendations/">[comments]</a></span>

It uses the same pin-like characters as Sensible Soccer and Cannon Fodder. The theme tune was written by the lead game designer, Jon Hare, and a promotional video was directed by Carl Smyth from the group Madness and filmed in Regent's Park, London. The game received lackluster reviews and sold poorly.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GreekRetroMan"> /u/Gre
