This is a replay of video 425 (During my summer break)
Today, working with GitHub is a fundamental skill. Most libraries and projects reside on GitHub, and we must know how to use them. GitHub can also enhance our work procedure, and a lot of employers will ask you for your GitHub account or will check it out before they invite you for an interview. So, GitHub seems at least as crucial as LinkedIn for a professional developerâ€™s career.
This video will teach you the basics of using GitHub for your Arduino projects. And I promise: We will avoid the command line!
