Take a look at the reveal trailer for The Next World, an open-world cyberpunk action RPG developed by Winteryear Studios Los Angeles. Players will explore a dystopian world where the lines between man and machine blur as Dresden, an unwitting software engineer, attempts to make sense of the city soaked in neon, corruption, and blood. Save Dresden's mother from the clutches of a ruthless megacorporation and discover the power of "The Nothing," a virtual singularity that lets you control the minds of anyone on Earth. The Next World is coming soon to PlayStation 5 (PS5), Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.
