Anycubic Photon S (SLa) including Wash and Cure for around 300€. 2k resolution, 0.03mm at best layers. Still great. It took like 2 weeks before I succesfull printed my first model. Paid for itself a week later. </p> <p>I used around 20L resin since then, so not a lot in my mind. After getting an FDM I modded my old SLA machine to print all year round in a heated chamber instead of warming the printer and resin before starting in winter. </p> <p>And now I bought the 'back to school' cheap printer. Another Anycubic since I am familiar with the Photon workshop. But man, the quality is astonishing
