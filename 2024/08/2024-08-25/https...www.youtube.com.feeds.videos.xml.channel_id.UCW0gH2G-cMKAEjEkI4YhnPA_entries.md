Season 2 of The Rings of Power is upon us!  That means the return of our Watch Parties!  Join me LIVE as the episode drops as we watch and react together, followed by some deeper conversation as I take questions/comments from the live chat!

HOW IT WORKS:
1) Pull up Rings of Power on your Prime Video account on your tv, computer screen, or whatever device you want to watch on.
2) Use a second screen, phone, tablet, or whatever to pull up this stream.
3) We all start playing the film at the same time, watching together, then discussing afterwards
