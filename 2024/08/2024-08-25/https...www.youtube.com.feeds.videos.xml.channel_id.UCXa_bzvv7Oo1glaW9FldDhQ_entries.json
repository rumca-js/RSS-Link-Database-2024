That is exactly what we\u2019ll be talking about here, as we discuss some of the biggest strengths that contribute to making Black Myth\u2019s combat as memorable as it is- from boss fights to the progression mechanics and more.", "id": 1056153, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiHr4INnXto", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/SiHr4INnXto/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Black Myth: Wukong Is DESTROYING Its Competition With Its Stunning Combat", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-25T06:30:12+00:00", "description": "If it had launched before Overwatch 2, Firewalk Studios' Concord may have served as a decent alternative in the hero shooter genre. Unfortunately, it's available in 2024 and demands $40, while other competitive multiplayer options are free-to-play.\n\nIt wouldn't be that big of a deal if Concord's gameplay offered something unique and compelling, be it in the Freegunners and their kits, the modes, or the progression. Instead, it opts to play things relatively safe, leaning into mostly generic hero abilities while introducing Crew Bonuses for character-switching (though you don't have to).\n\nThis is on top of lore revealed through the Galactic Guide and weekly vignettes meant to endear its characters to players, but it just doesn't resonate enough with what Concord is going for.
