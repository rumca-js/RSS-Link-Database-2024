<p>It’s immaculately acted, brutally convincing and full of James Graham’s love, care and talent. We need this state-of-the nation drama now more than ever</p><p>The coal’s the thing. The first series of Sherwood by James Graham was based on his experiences growing up in a Nottinghamshire pit village. There, the people and culture were shaped first by the shared experience of mining, and then in the 1980s by striking against – or not – the closure of the pits and the end of an industry. The original series was a state-of-the-nation piece played out through two murder mysteries. This return to the village is derived from the period about 10 years later when – as archive news footage and headlines that open the new six-parter remind us – gang-related violence reached such a pitch that the city was nicknamed “Shottingham”.</p><p>The divisions of old are still there in Sherwood’s second outing, but the more pressing issue is how you deal with a disaffected generation who lack their parent

It is an aphorism that is only slightly hyperbolic. So many of the game’s true greats – Bobby Jones, Sam Snead, Jack Nicklaus, Peter Thomson, Nick Faldo, Seve ­Ballesteros and Lorena Ochoa come to mind – have tasted victory at the home of golf. It is a place where the very best have always tended to do well. And to that distinguished list we can add the name of Lydia Ko.</p><p>With a final round of 69, the former world No 1 and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/10/lydia-ko-holds-nerve-to-win-gold-and-complete-full-set-of-olympic-medals">current Olympic gold medallist</a> held off a cluster of challengers over the closing holes to claim her third major title.

In it, he asks “Do we actually want to reform criminals, or just lock them away so we don’t have to confront the causes of their offending?” Unfortunately the answer has historically been, and is very much still, the latter. Society has a habit of shying away from looking too deeply into the reasons behind criminality. Attitudes to people in prison are usually shaped by the mainstream media’s narrative.

Traditionally, the genre tends to garland hard data with lashings of anecdote and well-turned, elegant metaphor.

<p>An 1900s flat in Oldenburg makes a feature of the designer’s love of green</p><p>There was one thing design consultant Andreas Bloy was certain about when he started the renovation of his one-bedroom flat four years ago: there would be no white walls. Or white ceilings, come to that. “I couldn’t live with those,” he says, with a slight grimace. “I am a colourful person. Using colour in different ways is what brings me joy.”</p><p>True to his word, Andreas’s home, located in Oldenburg, in northwest Germany, where he lives with his two dogs, Paula and Emma, is devoid of any offending neutral surfaces. Instead, he has gone for an altogether more moody affair, largely with deep greens mixed with accents of tangerine and rust. “I have loved the combination of green and orange since I was a child and also dark colours, because they feel cosy and have more impact.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/25/open-plan-home-in-germany-green">Continue reading..

To no one’s great surprise, he and Rachel Reeves will clearly be sticking to their promised parsimony. In the departments where Labour ministers are finding their feet, the only “reform” projects that have any chance of success will be those driven by savings. But as winter bites, they will face ever-louder calls for the opposite: money to fill deep gaps and repair 14 long years of damage.</p><p>One huge story embodies all this. At its

That wasn’t part of our empty nest plan, but sometimes fate decides and you’re dragged along for the ride.

OK, it’s a baby tortoise.</p><p>Our new arrival came as a complete shock. Our two female tortoises sometimes lay eggs, but none have ever been fertile. One male is a foul sex pest who molests them tirelessly, but we assumed that the fact he’s a quarter of the ladies’ size created insuperable, er, logistical problems (we often we find him flailing on his back, because they’ve tired of his squeaking, humping antics and flipped him).

She was 14 and in an English lesson when she found herself irresistibly drawn to this ostensibly rather British book about a group of schoolboys marooned on a remote Pacific island after a plane crash. “Fourteen is an interesting age,” she says. “I was still a kid, but I thought of myself as an adult. What I liked was their independence. They were free. They had no parents to tell them what to do.” She found that she could easily picture the world William Golding had created, for all that she’d “never been anywhere hotter than Italy”. It was a matter then, as now, of contrasts. “It’s set on a brightly coloured tropical island, like [the 1980 film] <em>The Blue Lago

<p>From tales of ‘toothed vaginas’ to gods with breasts, men have spent millennia vilifying and controlling representations of women. Here, Mineke Schipper reveals why she set out to reclaim the female body as a source of power</p><p>In the beginning was woman. The oldest representation of a human we have – the 40,000-year-old “Venus” of Hohle Fels – is an exaggeratedly fertile woman, the first in a series of Paleolithic statues emphasising breasts, broad hips and the vulva. In the earliest stories, the Earth was female and humanity was created by women, from the Chinese creator goddess Nüwa to the Colombian Kagaba “Mother Creator”. But soon, male creators muscled in. Nüwa became the sister or wife of male creator Fuxi, while in North American stories, an Old Man creator appeared, sitting on the female Earth. “He’s trying to pluck little bits from her, and then he decides to make them alive,” explains Mineke Schipper, gesturing excitedly over Zoom.

When she was 15, she became pregnant and had an abortion. She said when the abuse took place in the 1980s, because of her age she did not realise that it was wrong and her parents were concerned about the effect that reporting it would have on their family.</p><p>Now aged 51, she still struggles to come to terms with what happened and has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression. It was only when she began therapy that she began to come to terms with the abuse and made the decision, last year, to contact the police. She was also persuaded to act by the death of her parents, which meant that she no longer had to worry that speaking out would distress them. And she was being harassed by

<p>How our mutual love of music – and interest in each other’s tastes – brought my daughter Laila and me closer together</p><p>It is a cloudy Saturday evening in Edinburgh in early June and I am in a rugby stadium surrounded by young women who are wearing glitter and homemade friendship bracelets. Pink stetsons and shiny bodysuits abound, middle-aged men in TK Maxx less so. This is not my tribe – I am here with my 12-year-old daughter, Laila, to see Taylor Swift in concert.

<p>Call it uncool to have a word, but you can’t let young people just get hammered in a field</p><p>There are many parenting styles for teenagers, but sometimes it feels like there are just two: cool and uncool. Often, cool, liberal parents are lovely: just trying to let their kids breathe. Then you get the other kind, doing the “cool parent” thing. The ones who are smug and tiring. Who make you feel fogeyish and hysterical about raising concerns (their attitude: “What’s the weather like in <em>Daily Mail</em> land?”). The ones who often seem misinformed and out of date.

For many, their results last Thursday were cause for celebration and a credit to their resilience during and after what was the most tumultuous time for the English education system in over 70 years.
