<ul><li>Coach had been on an extended absence from the team</li><li>D’Alessandris spent 40 years in professional and college football </li></ul><p>Joe D’Alessandris, whose nearly half-century of coaching offensive linemen eventually brought him to four different NFL teams, has died. He was 70.<br /><br />
 The Ravens, who Alessandris coached for since 2017, announced that he died on Sunday. He was taken to hospital earlier this month with an unspecified, acute illness, and that caused him to step away from his duties as the team’s offensive line coach. The Ravens hired George Warhop as their offensive line coach on 14 August, when they announced D’Alessandris’ extended absence.</p><p>Head coach John Harbaugh said at the time that D’Alessandris had surgery earlier this summer and experienced complications.<br /><br />
 “Our hearts ache with grief and sadness upon learning of coach Joe D’Alessandris’ passing early this morning,” the team said in a statement. “‘Joe D.’ lived a life of bo

<p><strong>Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh<br /></strong>The fringe veteran unpacks his idiosyncratic childhood in a vividly realised show about class, family and neurodiversity</p><p>Colin Hoult has been performing at the fringe for 20 years, but never with what most comics give us at the start: a solo show, about himself. Now, the sketch act turned alter ego of ageing thespian Anna Mann steps out from behind the masks, with a standup set about his own eccentric family background. It’s an hour that quietly casts its spell, as detail upon detail is added to a telling portrait, with a strong sense of place, of an unexceptionally difficult working-class childhood. Back in 80s Nottingham, “Little Col” (named after his dad) grows up in a family with neither language nor understanding of their considerable idiosyncrasy – or as we now comprehend it, neurodiversity.</p><p>First up, it’s fun for Hoult-watchers to see how his own standup persona overlaps with that of theatrical grande dame Mann

There, he says, he refined his ideas about well-made homes for all, in work that feels newly relevant</p><p>Richard Gibson and I turn up unannounced at a primary school in Hamnavoe, Shetland – a light, airy, steel-framed structure of repeating shallow-pitched roofs designed by him more than 40 years ago. We are enthusiastically welcomed by the headteacher, Helen Robertson, who is delighted by the generous, sociable area he formed between the classrooms. Each also opens on to a semicircular external enclosure which, along with a series of little porches, provides shelter from the north Atlantic weather.

Many of you – more, in fact, than I could possibly have anticipated – were good enough to contact me with all manner of remedies, suggesting everything from anti-nausea bracelets to antihistamine solutions and precise calibrations of air-conditioning and window tilt. These were, truly, gratefully received, but in the end the best advice, offered on innumerable occasions, was to reduce all visual stimulus.

Dave and his mother, Avril, a dressmaker, live in a small Berkshire market town, and in previous summers they have always gone for a miserable week in Clevedon with his aunt and uncle; but this year they have been taken up by Avril’s new customer, the forceful Mrs Esme Croft, who has swept them off for 10 days in the north Devon resort of Friscombe.</p><p>Dave has never met his father, a Burmese official with whom his mother had a brief affair when she worked as a secretary to the British governor in Rangoon in 1947. The onset of puberty has coincided with his winning a scholarship to a small local public school, where for the first time he is violently bullied for his appearance. A new self
