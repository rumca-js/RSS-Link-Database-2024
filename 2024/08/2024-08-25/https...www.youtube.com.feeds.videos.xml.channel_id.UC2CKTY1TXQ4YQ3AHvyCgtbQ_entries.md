We're doing another Every Other Sunday show right after doing one LAST Sunday, because next week I'm heading to Washington DC for the NOVA Open wargaming convention. We'll talk about that, maybe some Kill Team, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
