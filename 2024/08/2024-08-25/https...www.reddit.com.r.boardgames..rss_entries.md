However, when I‚Äôm in an itch for a political game, these games fall short on some aspects (not that I don‚Äôt like these mechanics at other times, just that when I‚Äôm itching for politics they don‚Äôt deliver all my wants). I‚Äôm looking for a game that satisfies a lot of these wants:</p> <p>I like Diplomacy due to obvious reasons, but I dislike how most if not all discussions are private‚Äîthat there is no ‚ÄúUnited Nations‚Äù and betrayals generally have no social consequence as it‚Äôs the expectation of the game. I also don‚Äôt like how once you start losing you‚Äôre basically done for, and players are incentivized to join in on destroying you rather than backing you; and the fact that you can be completely eliminated.</p> <p>I like the promissory notes of TI4 and the idea of the agenda phase, but dislike how some factions do

I've been trying to find the game &quot;cztery punkty&quot; so I could log in on BGG but nothing! Can anyone help me out finding the actual or English name? The rules are the following: For the setup 4 cards are dealt into the middle and everyone gets 6(?) cards into their hand, once every player is out of hand cards, 6 more get dealt out etc. On your turn you use one of your cards that adds up to eleven with one of the cards in the middle and put them on your stash. Kings take only Kings, Queens only Queens and the Jack can take either the Jack or all numbered cards laying in the middle. If you don't have any card that adds up to eleven with another card in the middle, you put one of your hand cards into the middle instead. You can also add two cards in the middle (eg 2+5) and then add your hand card so it adds up to eleven (eg 4). There are four winning points: One

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I've been racking my brain trying to figure out the names of two board games. 1) the first game i remember seeing on YouTube and i want to say that it started out about someone fixing some old vintage game with either lights or lasers. I believe in the game you start in one place and try to retrieve some items or escape, then you press a button that reveals a lighted path and if you are on it, you have to reset or go back to the starting spot. I can't remember much else, but maybe 4/6 players max? And i believe that each time you press the button, the light or laser path is always random. </p> <p>2) for game2, i want to say you and your friends or crew are trying to break out of an idioms island or prison and maybe taking off with some loot or treasure, and you have to get on a boat that may have a hole or leak to get to another island to win. So it's like a race to the end kind of thing. I believe this one is more recent and maybe more of a child
