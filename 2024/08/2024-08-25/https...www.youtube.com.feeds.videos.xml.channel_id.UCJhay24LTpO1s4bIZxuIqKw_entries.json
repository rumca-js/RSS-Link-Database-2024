A talk about data abstraction.\n\nTo what degree should you keep your data private? No, I'm not talking about the societal and security concerns of your personal data, but about your code: to what extent are the incidental decisions of data representation in one piece of code visible to another piece of code?\n\nIn theory, the widespread adoption of languages with support for object orientation, modularity and other partitioning constructs should have made developers aware of the practice and benefits of information hiding. In practice, most code makes incidental choices highly visible across codebases, with getters and setters for every field \u2014 and public properties that might as well be public fields \u2014 and changeable technical details leaked through interfaces.\n\nThis talk takes a lot of what data abstraction is, its history, its application, its appearanc", "id": 1054696, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-X7JhU3hI0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "source_obj__id": 421, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/h-X7JhU3hI0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Data Abstraction Talk - Kevlin Henney - ACCU 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
