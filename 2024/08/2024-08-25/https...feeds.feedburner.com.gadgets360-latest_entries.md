A new study published in AGU Advances has unveiled intriguing findings about ultra-low velocity zones (ULVZs) in Earth's mantle, suggesting these mysterious features might be more widespread than previously thought.ULVZs, which are known to dramatically slow seismic waves by up to 50%, have long been associated with volcanic hotspots such as Hawaii. However, recent research led by geologist Michael Thorne reveals that these enigmatic zones could be present across extensive areas of the mantle, not just near known hotspots. The study utilized data from powerful deep earthquakes, examining how seismic waves travel through different layers of the Earth, including the core and mantle. This approach allowed researchers to identify patterns indicative of ULVZs beyond previously known locations. The findings suggest that these slow-down zones could be found in regions including North America, North Africa, and Papua New Guinea. This broad distribution challenges previous assumptions about th

Recent research has cast doubt on the certainty of the Milky Way-Andromeda galaxy collision, suggesting the event may not be as inevitable as once thought. Traditionally, astronomers have predicted that our galaxy would merge with Andromeda within the next 5 billion years, creating a new elliptical galaxy often referred to as "Milkomeda." However, a groundbreaking new simulation led by Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki has re-evaluated this scenario. The study integrates recent observational data from the Gaia and Hubble space telescopes, highlighting how gravitational effects from smaller neighboring galaxies can drastically influence the outcome. These smaller galaxies, including the Triangulum Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud, can alter the Milky Way-Andromeda orbit, potentially diverting the two galaxies away from a collision path. As a result, the probability of a galactic merger now stands at approximately 50%, making the outcome less certain.The study indicates tha

On August 24, skywatchers will be treated to an impressive planetary parade featuring six planets: Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury. This alignment, occurring in the early morning hours, will provide a unique viewing opportunity. In the US, the best time to catch the spectacle is between 5:45 a.m. ET and sunrise at 6:15 a.m. ET. Saturn will make its appearance first, followed by Neptune, and then Uranus, Jupiter, and Mars. Mercury will appear last, just before sunrise. Globally, the alignment will be visible on different dates. In Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong, the parade will occur on August 23. Athens and Tokyo will have their chance on August 24. Berlin, London, and Reykjavík will see it on August 26, while Mexico will experience it on August 28. São Paulo and Sydney will view the parade on August 30. This widespread visibility means that stargazers around the world will have a chance to witness this celestial event. For the best viewing experience, find a location wit
