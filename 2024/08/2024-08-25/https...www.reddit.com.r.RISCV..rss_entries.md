<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm currently working on a Computer Architecture assignment for college and need help finding reliable sources that detail the number of cycles required for each instruction in the RISC-V architecture, instructions like beq, add, addi la and all the rest.</p> <p>I've been searching through the RISC-V documentation and other resources, but I haven't found a clear reference that lists the cycle counts for each instruction.</p> <p>If anyone can point me to a book, website or any other resource that covers this information in detail, I'd be very grateful! Any tips or advice from anyone who has done similar work would also be very helpful.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PalpitationNo4710"> /u/PalpitationNo4710 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1f18q7a/help_needed_resources_for_riscv_instruction_cycle/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="ht

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I have been watching some Youtube channels and found that a new RISC-V laptop (<a href="https://store.deepcomputing.io/products/dc-roma-riscv-laptop-ii-with-octa-core-cpu?variant=45917154476196">DC-ROMA Laptop II with 8-core RISC-V CPU â€“ DeepComputing</a>) is on sale and some reviews are quite good on it.</p> <p>Some people point out that the average person might wait a bit for the next generation before going into RISC-V, however.</p> <p>I am a non-technical user and do not understand much of what I have read about RISC-V other than some very basic concepts. I am wondering if a RISC-V laptop would be suitable for basic tasks such as productivity, web surfing, media playback, and perhaps some gaming/emulation. </p> <p>For the average non-technical user, what are the pros of buying a RISC-V laptop (other than the obvious price difference)? Are there any major disadvantages to note? Are there any instances where you have to be more tech-savvy to use

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I'm currently working on adding custom instructions to an existing RiscV Vector core. The problems I'm facing is there is no straight forward content available on internet/Yt, will need to edit compiler and assembler as well. I have previously worked on RiscV in-order core design but didn't touch the software part. I'm new to the compiler editing part so any resources regarding riscV compiler editing or similar content you can suggest/provide? Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AhmadRazaS"> /u/AhmadRazaS </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1f0zen8/adding_custom_instructions_to_existing_riscv_core/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1f0zen8/adding_custom_instructions_to_existing_riscv_core/">[comments]</a></span>

## Probably a dumb question but what are riscv-none-elf-gcc and gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf to each other?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The reason I'm asking this is riscv-none-elf-gcc is only available via a dependency hell I'd have to wade through and gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf isn't. The latter seems to support both 32 and 64 bit RISC-V too.</p> <p>I don't know what the situation is for the various architectures is for both of them.</p> <p>Bear with me okay. It's been a few years since I've been able to really do much of any of this because things have happened in my life and I've forgotten a lot. Right now I think the main one I want to target is the CH32V203C8T6 because I have an untouched RISC-V BluePill Plus waiting for me. It'd also be nice to target the soft core for the Gowin FPGAs, and the K210s I have around the place.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CreepyValuable"> /u/CreepyValuable </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1f0luzh/probably_a_dumb_question_but_what_are/">[link]</a></span> &#32;
