Then I use four 3-1/8\" screws to secure it. One big mistake is not factoring in the thickness of the backer board on the main wall. So I actually center the valve at 15-1/2\" since the footprint of the shower with backer boards will be 30\" x 49\" - it's not a big shower. If the valve is the correct depth, the finished tile wall will be almost flush with the black plaster guard", "id": 1054902, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ6DY3WLtIA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCP2vaEZS8MvZrFklwBtW1GA", "source_obj__id": 144, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/oZ6DY3WLtIA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "How to Set Delta Shower Valve to Correct Depth - #shorts #homerepairtutor", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
