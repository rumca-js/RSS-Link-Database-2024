It releases in a few weeks' time and as a Star Wars fan, I\u2019m pretty excited to experience what it has to offer. \n\nThere\u2019s no denying that Star Wars Outlaws retains the age old open- world formula that gamers have gotten fatigued by over the years, but several things keep it fresh. \n\nThere\u2019s an organic liveliness to environments that differentiates itself from typical open world titles, as shown by the fights and lore-relevant banter happening in the background. Speaking of environments, I\u2019m very much looking forward to visiting various location and exploring Jabba\u2019s Palace. \n\nThere\u2019s clearly great respect for the original trilogy shown through Star Wars Outlaws, and it\u2019s this dedication to capturing the classic source material that really gets me excited for the game, among other reasons.", "id": 1023549, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRObmE4uLZM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/dRObmE4uLZM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why I'm Excited About Star Wars Outlaws...", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
