I decided I'm going to get into this one, but I'm getting a mixed signal from the Amazon listing, here. </p> <p>There's a Standard edition, an Expansion....and another standard edition? I guess I'm confused what the differences between the three of these are, the Expansion one is obvious. I don't really want to buy the same game twice, so can anyone tell me what the difference between these is? Or do I need all three to get the complete experience?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There seems to be a dead zone in game design that hovers in the highly-thematic, somewhat random, high complexity zone which is just instant retail death. That is, gamers tend to accept a dry, complicated, no variance game. Or a &quot;wacky&quot; fun &quot;random stuff happens&quot; type of game. But the cross section of gamers who want both theme, variance, and complexity just doesn't seem to be there. A few cases in point from my collection: What are yours?</p> <p><strong>Space Alert</strong> - Vladaa Chvatil at his best. A programmable movement game that solves quarterbacking in cooperative games with a hilarious theme and short play time. It is, unfortunately, a bit complicated and the stress of real time play is directly opposed to the &quot;chill random&quot; vibes most gamers are looking for in a goofy space adventure. Paired with the the direct accountability of loss to one or two players, people just avoid engaging altogether.</p> <p><strong>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For me I think it has to be Pirate's Dice. It's literally just Perudo (or Liar's Dice, as some call it) except it's Pirate's of the Caribbean themed and each of the dice have their &quot;1&quot; side replaced with a wild. I have thoroughly enjoyed this game ever since I was a kid-- it never fails to get laughs out of people and rarely causes frustration due to how random it is. The PotC theming is really satisfying too. The cups all have barnacles and rusty nails molded onto the sides and the dice have cuts and dents in them (it doesn't affect rolling in a material way). Just a really light, easy game that's great as a warmup or cooldown game during game night. I've never encountered anyone else who has played Perudo, let alone a Pirate-themed Perudo.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Studio_Unknown"> /u/Studio_Unknown </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ew6dtf/w
