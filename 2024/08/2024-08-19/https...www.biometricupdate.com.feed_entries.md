		A newly discovered vulnerability in <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/microsoft-entra">Microsoft's Entra ID</a> (formerly Azure Active Directory) has exposed a critical threat to hybrid cloud environments. This flaw, identified by <a href="https://cymulate.com/blog/exploiting-pta-credential-validation-in-azure-ad/">researchers from Cymulate</a>, allows attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms in Pass-Through Authentication (PTA) systems used by organizations with hybrid identity infrastructures.

The vulnerability exploits the way PTA agents handle authentication requests across multiple on-premises Entra ID domains, <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/unfixed-microsoft-entra-id-authentication-bypass-threatens-hybrid-cloud

		The long-awaited national ID card renewal and enrollment program in Uganda is now expected to begin in mid-October, according to the Interior Ministry and the National Identification and Registration Authority of the country (NIRA).

The exercise had previously been scheduled to begin on June 1, but the process has since been delayed due to shortfalls in preparations. In recognition of the delayed process, the government is also <a href="https://www.parliament.go.ug/news/7358/nira-extends-validity-national-ids-2025" rel="noopener" target="_blank">extending the validity</a> of national ID cards set to expire in 2024 by a year.

		The White House is about to throw its support behind state issuance of mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs), in part to fill the role of digital identity in securing government benefits issuance against fraud.

A draft executive order yet to be signed by U.S. President Joe Biden will “strongly encourage the use of digital identity documents,” <a href="https://www.notus.org/technology/digital-drivers-licenses-biden-supercharge-transition">Notus</a> reports.

		More than 70 percent of consumers in Brazil, France, Germany, the UK and the U.S. are using a digital wallet – and many of those consumers could be drawn to digital IDs within the next three years, according to research from <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study/digital-wallets-beyond-financial-transactions/">Pymnts Intelligence</a>.

Over 29 percent of global users say they would likely use their digital wallet for verifying identity or age in the next three years. Another 26 percent said they would use wallets for storing and accessing identity documents, according to the digital payments research firm.

The most tempting aspects of using digital IDs within wallets are security and low cost while familiarity is the key to engaging new users.

Last week’s webinar by <a href="https://www.publicpolicyexchange.co.uk/">Public Policy Exchange</a> considered the future of CCTV and related policy issues for the new Labour government. In truth, CCTV as we know it does not have a future and even its past is now of questionable relevance.

Looking first at its history, more than 25 years of study into the impact of CCTV on crime generated an extensive body of evidence but the jury has yet to reach unanimity on a verdict. However, all of the research was undertaken when cameras just filmed things. Most modern s

		Government officials and representatives from partner organizations in Somalia recently shared views on how to lay a solid legal and governance foundation for the country’s digital identification system.

The discussions took place for three days in the capital Mogadishu, and included officials from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and civil society organizations, as <a href="https://nation.africa/africa/news/somalia-takes-steps-towards-a-modern-digital-identity-system-4728876#google_vignette">reported</a> by Nation.
