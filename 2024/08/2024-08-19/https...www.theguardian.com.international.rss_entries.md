<p>Based on a three-year investigation, this rage-inducing documentary explores allegations of human trafficking by a Scottish fishing fleet – and its claims are truly grotesque</p><p>I remember when I first read a news story about human trafficking, about 30 years ago. It was a report in the Observer and I honestly thought the paper had gone bananas. It simply couldn’t be true, could it? An actual modern-day trade in people, where they’re effectively kidnapped, brought to other countries, their papers taken from them, forced to work at dangerous jobs in terrible conditions. I really thought a conspiracy theory had the reporters in its grip.</p><p>I miss the days when it was possible to be so ignorant. So unaware of the depths of depravity to which humankind will sink if there’s a buck in it for them. From the vantage point of 2024, when there are an estimated 40 million adult and child victims of such exploitation (for labour, for sex, for both), they count as halcyon days.</p> <a hr

<p>After Jamie Vardy stunned Tottenham by scoring an unlikely equaliser approaching the hour, he saluted the Leicester supporters, puffed out his chest and blew kisses to the crowd. But his animated exchange with the Spurs fans in a pocket of the stadium upon leaving the field with 11 minutes of normal time to play upstaged his&nbsp;celebration.</p><p>As Vardy was roundly jeered he pointed to the Premier League badge on the forearm of his blue Leicester shirt. Guglielmo Vicario went berserk as he forced a late corner after Lucas Bergvall cheaply surrendered possession. Ange Postecoglou, hands in pockets, must have wondered how things unravelled for his side after Pedro Porro’s opener and his mind will also have been occupied with Rodrigo Bentancur, who was carried off on a stretcher after five minutes of on-field treatment. For Steve Cooper, this was a deeply heartening first competitive match in charge of Leicester.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/1

<p>Barclays was first to formally lift the cap imposed by the EU but the balance between fixed and variable pay has to be addressed</p><p>The EU cap on bankers’ bonuses – now ditched in the UK – was misnamed because it didn’t actually limit the size of anybody’s bonus. Rather, it capped bonuses as a ratio of an individual’s fixed pay – at 1:1, or 2:1 with the approval of shareholders. The response of banks back in 2014 was entirely predictable: they simply whacked up relevant salaries to “compensate” recipients for their loss of their bonus-earning potential.</p><p>It was why the policy always smacked of headline-seeking posturing by Brussels, rather than being a serious attempt to tackle the short-term risk-taking that was deemed to have contributed to the 2007-09 financial crisis.

<p>Last Week Tonight host looks into the US’s for-profit hospice care industry, rife with fraud and mismanagement</p><p>On the latest Last Week Tonight, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/john-oliver-recap">John Oliver</a> delved into the many issues with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/hospices">hospice care</a> in the US. Doing so is “an almost offensive parody of this show”, he acknowledged. “If somebody else did that, it would genuinely be hurtful. But I promise this is worth talking about.”</p><p>There are “lots of dedicated people work with hospices, providing huge relief for dying patients and their families, particularly those who want to remain at home”, such as the 1.8 million Americans who received end-of-life care at home last year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/19/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-hospice-episode">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The height of solar efficiency, a clam manipulates light to make its shell and redirects the sun’s rays to its tiny algal tenants</p><p>A giant clam has hundreds, if not thousands, of eyes, which lie on the exposed flesh that lines the shell, and work like pinhole cameras. “They respond by withdrawing the mantle to movements of dark objects, even if these cast no shadow on the animal as a whole,” reads one description. They also tell the clam to close when the light dims or changes direction. I read this and imagine the dark shape of a scuba diver scanning her torch across the curves of the clam’s mouth. Depending on how deep or shallow these curves are, the clam looks happier or angrier.</p><p>There are many species of giant clam. The Latin name of one kind, commonly found in the waters around Indonesia, Palau and Vanuatu, is <em>Hippopus hippopus</em>. Giant clams are about as wide as a short woman is tall. Their muscle, or flesh (the part of them that is alive), is only a fracti

<p>We are told to accept that sports broadcasting is changing but I still experience subconscious bias and outright sexism at work</p><p>I keep being told the sports media industry is getting better, that there are lots more opportunities for women who want to work in it. I’m not sure. It was great to see the BBC’s Olympics-presenting team being led by women this summer and there were more female faces pitchside at the men’s Euros too. But there is still an awful long way to go. The micro-aggressions that have peppered my 16-year career and those of my female friends and contemporaries still very much exist, with the constant need to prove yourself more than an equally or less-qualified man. I don’t even see a change in how people treat me now that I am “talent” rather than the runner/dogsbody I was when I began working in broadcasting.</p><p>I work across a range of sports and always do my homework, not least because I still have to prove I deserve my spot in front of the mic.

<p>The colour and aroma of deepest summer, tomatoes are versatile whatever the weather. Perfect for crisp gnocchi, refreshing gazpacho and baked sausages</p><p>This summer has not been the best for tomatoes, but I take what I can get. My plan for growing them on the kitchen roof was thwarted by a long, wet spring&nbsp;and an even wetter summer. So, it is off to the shops I go, returning with a mixed bag of fruit in every colour from acid green to almost black, tiny orange tomatoes like children’s sweets and some still on the vine, that at least come with the heady scent of the freshly picked.</p><p>The answer to a tomato whose flavour disappoints is to cook it. The heat of an oven or hob will enrich the fruit’s soul, and the natural seasonings of garlic, onion and basil will work their magic. This month, I baked plum tomatoes with sausages and lentils, and made a fresh tasting soup with smaller fruits, summer carrots and feta. I particularly enjoyed the tomatoes sliced and coated in b

 Hamby, who went public with her accusations last year, sued the WNBA and her former team in federal court last Monday.<br /><br />

<p>Almost four decades after Stephen overdosed, I was finally able to grieve the astonishing waste of my brother’s young life</p><p>My older brother Stephen’s descent into drug addiction began in south-east London in 1969. It started with cannabis at school and escalated to LSD and amphetamines. By 1973, my 18-year-old, Jimi Hendrix-loving, Afghan-coat-wearing brother was taking heroin regularly and committing crimes to fund his habit.</p><p>I was 14 when the hell of Stephen’s heroin addiction began. Like my parents, I was enveloped by feelings of shame on the chocolate-box pretty but stifling housing estate where we lived in Eltham. Stephen’s antics regularly made the local papers, most notoriously when he stripped naked, covered himself in yellow paint and jumped over the hedge in front of our cute little house. He was on a bad acid trip, believing himself to be in a prisoner-of-war camp, the hedges transformed into barbed wire. My parents were unable to endure the gossip and we mov

Reuben started his life in a Glasgow flat, his owners apparently unaware that he was likely to grow into a 70kg bundle of uncontrollable energy.

It’s Me, Margaret, depicts a group of 12-year-old girls eagerly willing their first periods to arrive, impatient to be in on the unfathomable mystery of monthly bleeds. Little do they know that the mysteries surrounding their ovaries and wombs will only ever deepen, in ways unique to each of them. The mood swings, the cramps, the headaches, the pimples, the energy dips, the secretions, the libidinous peaks and troughs – right up to the perimenopause. Doctors won’t be much help, because there is scant precise science on much of this.</p><p>And then, at about 50, when the ovaries have run out of eggs, it all goes quiet. I have heard middle-aged women express profound relief at reaching this moment. But what if the ovaries didn’t go quiet for another decade, or ever? Making

Melania walked on to the sound of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.
