It\u2019s that sort of dynamism, paired with Kirby\u2019s clear voice and distinctive lyrical imagery, that really shine in her Tiny Desk performance.\n\nKirby begins with \u201cJuniper,\u201d a swinging hit from her debut album Cool Dry Place, followed by \u201cFences,\u201d off her latest album Blue Raspberry. On \u201cCubic Zirconia,\u201d after an instrumental break led by Logan Chung\u2019s electric guitar riffs, the band fades as Kirby sings to \u201cthe prettiest mermaid in the souvenir shop,\u201d describing a \u201cface framed by hoodie like an oyster in a shell.\u201d Kirby then plays a stripped back version of the usually roaring \u201cTable\u201d before ending with the arresting \u201cPortals,\u201d a song Kirby told us tends to make her girlfriend tear up. \n\nAlso, you may notice that", "id": 1024115, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZVhR3N1Rs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "source_obj__id": 225, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/2-ZVhR3N1Rs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Katy Kirby: Tiny Desk Concert", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
