<p>What would it be like to hire your best friend to help you wash, move and go out, asks this joyous disabled-led show that’s also a veritable who’s who of modern British comedy</p><p>Sitting on a toilet, frowning, Freya (Kyla Harris), a thirtysomething artist and wheelchair user, is having trouble with her bowels. Donning a blue glove and lubricating her finger, Jo (Elena Saurel), Freya’s estranged best friend and new personal assistant, offers to lend a hand. Within seconds, she is bent over, attempting to stifle a bile reflux. “Are you gagging?” asks Freya, mortified. “This is so humiliating!” Bending over in apology, Jo gamely pulls down her pants. “Put your finger in my ass!” she cries. “For equality’s sake!”</p><p>I don’t know if this is the first time anal stimulation for constipation has been broadcast on British television, but then I don’t suppose anyone has been keeping a record.

<p>Actors sell an unusual, compelling friendship as a widower reconnects with an old teacher in this thoughtful film</p><p>In a sleepy town in upstate New York, Ben Gottlieb (Jason Schwartzman), the subject of writer-director Nathan Silver’s off-kilter Jewish comedy Between the Temples, isn’t doing very well. His wife, an alcoholic novelist, died a year earlier after slipping on an icy sidewalk. He’s a cantor at the local temple, bust lost his singing voice. Schlubby, unshaven, eyes downcast, Ben shuffles through life in a daze, disillusioned with his faith and disinterested in the overt romantic set-ups by his overbearing Jewish moms (Caroline Aaron and Dolly De Leon). “Even my name is in the past tense,” he laments, an incisive complaint-joke in a film full of them. At one point early in the film, co-written by C Mason Wells, Ben lays in front of a truck and asks it to keep going.</p><p>Not that Between the Temples is a slog, or even particularly dark.

<p>Ignore the trad wife influencers – wanting or needing space from your child is not just normal, but healthy for both of you</p><p>Collecting my son from nursery is my favourite part of the day. He’s usually in the garden, and there’s a moment just before I say his name when I like to watch him, unnoticed. Then he’ll hear my voice and will turn and run into my arms, smiling. Motherhood has taught me to appreciate the privilege of being loved this much, and of loving so much.</p><p>Most of us know from experience that relationships – whomever they are with – benefit from some air being let into them. Kahlil Gibran’s poem On Marriage includes a line my mother often quotes: “Let there be spaces in your togetherness.” Yet wanting, or needing, space from your child – to work, to rest, to create, to exercise, to recharge, to see people, to vacuum up all the cat hair in your flat – is being increasingly condemned in online discourse.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist</p>

<p>Richard Brake is well cast as the host for this portmanteau of grisly yarns, where the girls’ tales are made of stronger stuff than the boys’</p><p>Anthology films are notoriously hard to pull off but, though it starts shakily, this low-budget British portmanteau has an ace in the hole: horror stalwart Richard Brake, whose grimy leer is normally a kitemark of something at least halfway chilling. (Hopefully his dental hygiene is better in real life.) In Lore, he is a Cryptkeeper-style host for four hikers out for an “immersive” experience in the wilds; informing them that they have pitched their tents above the site of some ancient evil, this campfire compere bids them bring forth their most blood-chilling yarns.</p><p>The boys, Mark (Dean Bone) and Dan (Miles Mitchell), think basic: the former trots out a warehouse runaround with gang fugitive Daniel (Andrew-Lee Potts) encountering a saw-toothed monster and a last-gasp psychological twist.

<p>The Games are an enjoyable distraction that make me wonder how healthy my relationship with football really is</p><p>The summer months offer a pause in the rhythm of my life. The school year ends, home life shifts and at least in principle the weather changes. For those of us who find solace in the football pages, summer becomes a rare moment to catch our breath between seasons, a time when the sport that so&nbsp;often defines our days takes a backdseat. Yet even in this lull I find myself drawn to the Olympics, captivated by sports I barely recognise and quickly forget for the four years between Games.</p><p>Like many, I become a fan of BMX, women’s rugby sevens, synchronised diving or any gymnastics event for two weeks every four years. This brief, intense passion hibernates until the next Olympics. It’s an enjoyable distraction, a temporary escape, but in truth it’s also a way to fill the void left by football’s absence, a&nbsp;sport that for better or worse shapes much of my li

<p>Good first impressions at Manchester United, David Raya’s magic moment and more utter chaos at Chelsea</p><p>It was very much a case of job done for Manchester United on Friday night as they edged past Fulham. United did not secure the convincing win that many desired but three points is a good base from which to start the campaign. Erik ten Hag will be further boosted by the performances of his three debutants. Noussair Mazraoui was the only one to start, playing at right-back where he provided energy and looked composed on the ball. Matthijs de Ligt came on with Jonny Evans as the defence was reshuffled late on to help preserve United’s clean sheet, with Fulham stretching their tired hosts. De Ligt worked diligently but was upstaged by his compatriot, Joshua Zirkzee, who provided the 87th-minute winner with a cunning finish as United finally got the better of Bernd Leno. Each recruit offered an indication of what they will bring to United and, like the team, the new arrivals have

Initially, she brushed off the flattering advances, but after deliberating for several months, she changed her mind.</p><p>“No one had commented on my appearance until I reached 67, when people suddenly started to notice me,” she says. “It was very strange, but being spotted made me realise I could still achieve something for myself at this stage of my life.

Told through voiceover, Tengarrinha’s extraordinary experiences describe an engaging relationship between crafts and activism. Along with her fellow members of the then-banned Communist party, she was forced into a clandestine existence for much of the 1950s. Out of a humble flat in Lisbon, Tengarrinha and her partner José Dias Coelho operated a secret forgery studio. Having studied art, both used their finely tuned skills to produce fake passports for their persecuted comrades on the run.</p><p>As the past is resurrected on a sonic level, Mire brings an intriguingly anachronistic a

Here’s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>10pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br /></strong>This cracking, sexy comedy drama upends the usual telly tropes about disabled women’s lives. It was created by Lee Getty and Kyla Harris, with Harris starring as the sardonic thirtysomething Canadian artist Freya, who is tetraplegic and was “disabled way before it was cool”. Freya is living in London with her new lover, Abe (Darren Boyd) – who has left his wife and is “having a midlife crisis, albeit a very inclusive one” – and she asks her chaotic friend Jo (Elena Saurel) to be her personal assistant. But a rift between Abe and Jo suggests big problems ahead. It’s inspired by the time Getty was Harris’s PA in real life, which explains the great writing. It will have you laughing loads. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/arti

The wheat seedlings that normally reached 80cm stopped at 5cm.

<p>From locking playwrights up until a drama emerged to dreaming up Sarah Kane’s Crave in a pub; the talent behind half a century of innovation reveal their secrets</p><p>It began over a pint in a Bedford pub. Fifty years later, Paines Plough is a theatrical trailblazer. Dedicated to new plays, the company has presented the work of pivotal dramatists such as David Pownall, Sarah Kane, James Graham, Kae Tempest, Mike Bartlett – and more than 300 others. Actors who have gone on the road with the company include Harriet Walter, Peter Capaldi, Claire Foy, Ben Whishaw and Andrew Scott. To mark its half-century, the key players remember the company’s fights, firsts and furious creativity.</p><p><strong>John Adams (founding artistic director</strong><strong>): </strong>We all met in Bedford, where I was living, and went for a drink to a pub called the Plough, where the beer was brewed by a St Neots company called Paines, in 1974.

You think, that person is <em>annoying</em>. But the word’s reputation has plummeted further in recent years. Anti-tourism movements are springing up across the world: that might look like a protest march, as in Barcelona, where one placard bluntly pleaded “Tourists go home; you are not welcome here”.
