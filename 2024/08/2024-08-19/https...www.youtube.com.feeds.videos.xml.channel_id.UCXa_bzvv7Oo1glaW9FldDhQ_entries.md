Like an NFL team’s high new draft pick, Madden NFL 25 provides the franchise hope for the future with its great on-field gameplay, phenomenal presentation improvements, and streamlined gameplay modes, as long as it irons out the predatory microtransactions in the meantime.

Star Wars Outlaws is the first open-world Star Wars game, being developed by Massive Entertainment. It releases in a few weeks' time and as a Star Wars fan, I’m pretty excited to experience what it has to offer. 

There’s no denying that Star Wars Outlaws retains the age old open- world formula that gamers have gotten fatigued by over the years, but several things keep it fresh. 

There’s an organic liveliness to environments that differentiates itself from typical open world titles, as shown by the fights and lore-relevant banter happening in the background. Speaking of environments, I’m very much looking forward to visiting various location and exploring Jabba’s Palace. 

There’s clearly great respect for the original trilogy shown through Star Wars Outlaws, and it’s this dedication to capturing the classic source material that really gets me excited for the game, among other reasons.
