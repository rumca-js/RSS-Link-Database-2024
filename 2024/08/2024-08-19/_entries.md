Dimethyl ether (DME) carbonylation to methyl acetate (MA) is one of the crucial steps in an indirect synthesis route of ethanol from syngas. SSZ-13 zeolite, with a typical topology of CHA, characterized by its 8-membered ring (8-MR) channels, has shown potential in catalyzing DME carbonylation. However, current studies lack a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic mechanism. Meanwhile, the influence of spatial confinement in SSZ-13 on the reaction has also not been considered.

It is widely recognized that achieving high energy storage density and efficiency in ferroelectric ceramics relies on their ability to exhibit high saturation polarization and low residual polarization, which are essential for excellent energy storage performance. Moreover, the enhancement of energy storage density in relaxor ferroelectric ceramics also requires a higher breakdown field strength, an important factor that should not be overlooked.
