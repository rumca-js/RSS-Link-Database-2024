Apparently, Judge Reed O&#8217;Connor doesn&#8217;t think that owning a massive amount of Tesla stock constitutes a conflict of interest when it comes to judging Elon Musk&#8217;s legal battles. Last week, we were briefly surprised when infamously partisan Judge Reed O’Connor recused himself from Elon’s nonsense SLAPP suit against GARM and some advertisers. As we had [&#8230;]

There’s a new lawsuit in Northern California federal court that seeks to improve child safety online but could end up backfiring badly if it gets the remedy it seeks. While the plaintiff’s attorneys surely mean well, they don’t seem to understand that they’re playing with fire. The complaint in the putative class action asserts that [&#8230;]

We do know the DHS definitely wants as much facial recognition tech involved as possible when it comes to border crossings and international airports. That it might think now would be the time to add children to the mix is unwelcome, but not unsurprising. But maybe the DHS should make sure all of its officials [&#8230;]

Friday morning gave us a nice victory for free speech in the 9th Circuit, where the appeals court panel affirmed most of the district court’s ruling finding California&#8217;s “Age Appropriate Design Code” unconstitutional as it regulated speech. There’s a fair bit of background here that’s worth going over, so bear with me. California’s Age Appropriate [&#8230;]
