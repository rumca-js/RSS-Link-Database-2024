Replenium sued Albertsons in U.S. District Court in Seattle on Monday, alleging misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract and other claims, seeking financial damages for losses incurred due to Albertsons&#8217; alleged actions. &#8220;Over three years, Albertsons repeatedly encouraged Replenium to continue its work on the Replenium Platform \u2014 despite Albertsons\u2019 missed deadlines, countless delays, and millions in expenses incurred by Replenium \u2014 precisely because Replenium would earn back the amount&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-startup-replenium-accuses-albertsons-of-stealing-tra", "id": 1028518, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-startup-replenium-accuses-albertsons-of-stealing-trade-secrets-under-guise-of-partnership", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Seattle startup Replenium accuses Albertsons of stealing trade secrets under guise of partnership", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-19T14:36:21+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_1063-1260x945.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />I parked my dirty old Honda at the grocery store around 2 p.m. last Thursday and drove away in a shiny electric Chevy Volt just 30 minutes later.
