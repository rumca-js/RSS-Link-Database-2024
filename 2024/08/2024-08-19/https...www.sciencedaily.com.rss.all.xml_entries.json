Now researchers have evidence that an orb-weaving spider (Araneus ventricosus) manipulates the flashing signals of male fireflies ensnared in its web such that they mimic the typical flashes of a female firefly, thereby luring other males to serve as their next meal.", "id": 1027206, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/08/240819130522.htm", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "source_obj__id": 188, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Spider exploits firefly's flashing signals to lure more prey", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-19T13:05:20+00:00", "description": "Two new studies are pointing the way toward round-the-clock personalized care for people with Parkinson's disease through an implanted device that can treat movement problems during the day and insomnia at night.", "id": 1027207, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/08/240819130520.htm", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "source_obj__id": 188, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Taming Parkinson's disease with intelligent brain pacemakers", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-19T13:05:18+00:00", "description": "A small feasibility study found that an implanted device regulated by the body's brain activity could provide continual and improved treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) in certain people with the disorder.
