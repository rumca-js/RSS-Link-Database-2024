<p>It’s no secret that organizations are deploying more and more <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/cloud-computing">cloud services</a> as they look for ways to increase business agility and scalability while reducing costs. But in an interesting twist, increased cloud adoption can lead to runaway spending. As a result, enterprises need to look for ways to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2517787/learning-cloud-cost-management-the-hard-way.html">control their cloud costs</a>.</p>



<p>A May 2024 report by research firm Gartner said worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services was forecast to grow 20 percent and total $675.4 billion in 2024, up from $561 billion in 2023. The market

<p>Straight out of the webscale playbook, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3691820/what-is-platform-engineering-evolving-devops.html">platform engineering</a> was considered a futuristic discipline until just a few years ago. Would platform engineering really trickle down to mainstream enterprise teams? Did companies really want to operate their infrastructure like the major cloud providers? Now it’s a practice that 80% of enterprises will have adopted by 2026, <a href="https://streaklinks.com/CB7TDr_5uU89r7tEbwgzNjwA/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gartner.com%2Fen%2Farticles%2Fwhat-is-platform-engineering">according to Gartner</a>.</p>

<p>Information security has always been important, but never as sexy as legacy modernization, AI, or pretty much anything else IT spends money on. In general, security is the sort of thing CIOs wish they’d invested more money on—after they’ve had a breach. But things have changed. As Merritt Baer, CISO at Reco AI, said to me, “You can’t do any other form of ‘business’ if you can’t be secure.” You can argue that this has always been true, but I’m hearing much more emphasis on security in my discussions with enterprises.</p>



<p>To paraphrase Baer, if security isn’t your priority, do any of your other priorities matter?</p>
