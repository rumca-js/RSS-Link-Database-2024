Young voters have supported democratic candidates for over 20 years. However, recent WSJ polling shows that Republicans are closer than ever to winning the group, especially among young men. While 2020 exit polls show that young men backed President Joe Biden by 15 percentage points, the February 2024 WSJ poll found they favored former president Donald Trump by 14 percentage points. 

WSJ’s Aaron Zitner explains what’s driving young men to support Republicans, and what it could mean for the 2024 presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.
