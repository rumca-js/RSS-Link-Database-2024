Here we are at last! The infamous third episode of Disney's The Acolyte. And it's quite clear that Leslie Headland is securely in the driver's seat. If there was ever any doubt that the Acolyte was woke or politically charged rather than "just bad" there's no denying the cringe after this episode - and it's no less hilarious. Activist writers never fail to effortlessly create the cream of absolute cringe. So let's get into it, shall we? I aim to point out every major point of cringe - so let's get started shall we?
