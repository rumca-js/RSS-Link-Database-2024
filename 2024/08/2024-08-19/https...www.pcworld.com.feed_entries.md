<p>Beige box on its side. Massive matching monitor. CD-ROM drive and a floppy disk drive underneath. This itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, off-white, boxy PC is a dead ringer for the first leftover computer my dad set up for me back in the early 90s. There’s but one difference: it’s six inches tall.</p>

<p>We love seeing gaming laptops with RTX 4050 GPUs becoming more affordable, and this <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/acer-nitro-v-anv15-41-r2y3-gaming-laptop-15-6-full-hd-144hz-amd-ryzen-5-7535hs-geforce-rtx-4050-16gb-ddr5-512gb-ssd-obsidian-black/6576633.p?skuId=6576633" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Acer Nitro V is the perfect example as its price drops to just $700 at Best Buy</a>, down from its usual $950.</p>



<p>The Acer Nitro V features a 15.6-inch 1080p display with a 144Hz refresh rate, ensuring a smooth and immersive gaming experience as well as adequate screen real estate for work productivity.</p>



<p>Powered by an AMD Ryzen 5 processor, this laptop is the ideal choice if you want a balance between power and versatility. The 16GB of DDR5 RAM ensures plenty of speed for running and multitasking apps, games, and Chrome browser tabs.

<p>Four gigs of RAM might not seem like a lot for a PC or even a smartphone these days. But for a tiny all-in-one board like the Raspberry Pi, it can actually be overkill.</p>



<p>That’s why the company is releasing a new version of the Raspberry Pi 5 that chops the former base model’s RAM in half from 4GB to 2GB. The newer variant is a flat $50 — that’s $10 cheaper than the 4GB version and $30 less than the 8GB version.</p>

<p>One of the most annoying things ever is when I’m in a certain spot in my home or yard where the Wi-Fi connection is spotty. I could go two hours without issues, then suddenly it disconnects and flounders.</p>



<p>Well, this TP-Link Wi-Fi Extender is a solid solution for such a problem, and it’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-AC750-WiFi-Range-Extender/dp/B07N1WW638" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">only $13.30 at Amazon right now</a>, down from its $35 MSRP. That’s a whopping 62% discount.</p>



<p>This is a tiny device that’s super easy to set up. You just plug it into an outlet that’s toward the outer range of your main router. Then, it basically boosts wireless coverage and provides a stronger signal to devices within the range of the extender.</p>



<p>Not only can you expand Wi-Fi coverage up to 1,200 square feet, but you can add up to 3

<p>How many Steam Deck-style PC gaming handhelds is too many? We still don’t know because there are plenty still to come, apparently.</p>



<p>The Zotac Zone looks mighty familiar from the outside, but it’s bringing a few features that might turn heads in this highly competitive market segment — like an AMOLED screen, no upgrade required.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.zotac.com/us/node/1317456#overview">The Zone’s display</a> isn’t any bigger than the competition at 7 inches, but it is a bit sharper than usual with its 1080p resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. The OLED panel is the highlight, though, offering more vivid colors and perfect contrast alongside 800 nits of brightness. (The Steam Deck <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2133255/valve-upgrades-steam-deck-with-oled-screen-bigger-battery-more-storage.html">comes in an OLED model</a>, but only at the m

<p>If a ransom note suddenly appears on your PC screen, your PC has been hacked. But computer attacks are not always so drastic and clear-cut. </p>



<p>For the less obvious cases, you’ll need a finer sense and the right know-how. A quick solution is running a quick scan with your antivirus program of choice. If the tool detects a pest, then the matter is taken care of. </p>



<p>But sometimes the antivirus program doesn’t always locate the malicious code… and yet Windows behaves strangely. This is where you need to take a closer look at the symptoms. </p>

<p>I’m sure the fact that Google is the world’s biggest advertising company has nothing to do with it. </p>



<p>Personally <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2384494/i-finally-got-sick-of-chromes-bs-and-switched-to-vivaldi.html">I’d recommend changing browsers</a>.
