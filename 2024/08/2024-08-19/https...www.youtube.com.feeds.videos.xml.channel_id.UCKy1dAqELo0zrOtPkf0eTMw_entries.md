In today's Daily Fix:

Gamescom 2024 is happening this week, and Geoff Keighley could be teasing an upcoming announcement. He tweeted "the beast is coming," and coincidentally (or not) Dying Light developers Techland filed for a copyright on Dying Light: The Beast. Hmmm...could this be Dying Light 3? Or is Keighley's tweet and Techland's copyright totally unrelated? Guess we'll have to wait until gamescom Opening Night Live to find out. And there's a trailer for a new Kong game, this one a 2.5D action platformer based on the Monsterverse King Kong (you know, the one that fought Godzilla a few times).

Tactical Breach Wizards reviewed by Jarrett Green on PC.

Tactical Breach Wizards doesn’t demand knowledge from lost magical tomes to conquer its character-focused missions, each of which is filled with lots of doodads to fiddle with and not a lot of space to do it in. Being easy doesn’t mean it isn’t fun though – in fact, the very opposite is true here, thanks to the creative kits on every unit and how dynamic the combinations between them can be. Wrap that up in a vibrant and weird world with some truly incredible writing and it’s hard not to get entranced in its spell.

Check out our Silent Hill 2 preview to find out what we think of Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake so far. We played the opening three hours of Silent Hill 2 and it was immediately apparent that the remake gracefully captures all the important elements; an oppressive tone and straightforward game mechanics, even when the task itself is being obtuse. As with any Silent Hill game, atmosphere is king, and Silent Hill 2 immediately and consistently puts you into a state of unease. 

The Silent Hill 2 release date is October 8, 2024 for PS5 (PlayStation 5) and PC.
