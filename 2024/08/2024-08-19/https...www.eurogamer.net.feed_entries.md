Developer Game Science has been surprisingly open in comparison to other AAA studios and the game's apparent ambitions have been reinforced with each and every press release: a hero-focused action game retelling the story of Journey to the West, and a graphical tour de force using the latest Unreal Engine features. In fact, on PC Wukong uses the Nvidia branch of UE5 to enable full ray tracing, promising an even more impressive presentation. With the full game in hand, it's time to see if Game Science has fulfilled the graphical promise of that first trailer, how the RT features work on PC, and what optimised settings can be used to deliver a

Battlefield is licking its wounds after stepping on the landmine that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, while Call of Duty is running around like the dog that caught the car, the massive success of Warzone leaving the mainline series at a loss with what to do with itself.</p><p>It's a chaotic, uncertain time in one of multiplayer gaming's biggest spheres, and the various shenanigans of EA and Activision have left room for something new to make its mark in the genre. Enter Delta Force: Hawk Ops, which you'll be shocked to hear is <em>not </em>a Trauma Team-style game about performing surgery on birds of prey.  Instead, it's a free-to-play military shooter in the Battlefield/CoD mould, based on the series that predates

missed the brief. Since then, later gameplay showings have put the remake's intentions in much 
better light. And thankfully, in playing its opening three hours at a recent K
