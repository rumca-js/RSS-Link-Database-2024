A worker leaves the financially beleaguered BlueScope Steel refinery in Port Kembla near Sydney on November 22, 2011. The company embarked on November 22 on a deeply discounted 600 million USD capital raising to tackle debt and try and turn around its fortunes. Australia's largest steelmaker will use the issue of 1.5 billion new shares to reduce almost 1.6 billion USD in net debt and strengthen its financial position, according to local reports.

This photo taken on June 20, 2023 shows a view of a complex of unfinished apartment buildings in Xinzheng City in Zhengzhou, China's central Henan province.

But with growth slowing and debts swelling, authorities cut off access to easy loans in 2020, pummelling the sector and causing a record-breaking slump last year. 
A wave of mortgage boycotts spread nationwide last summer, as cash-strapped developers struggled to raise enough to complete homes they had already sold in advance -- a common practice in China. (PEDRO PARDO/AFP via Getty Images)
