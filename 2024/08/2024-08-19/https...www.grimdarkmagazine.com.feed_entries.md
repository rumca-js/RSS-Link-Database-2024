Not knowing where reality ends and the author’s imagination begins is something I love to explore. Having seen so many times in history an author’s ability to imagine or extrapolate fictitious science and then—sometimes decades after a book is released—seeing their imagination become reality, is something that gets my own scientific, SF-loving mind churning with excitement. As a materials scientist, I want to know what the starships of the 41st century are made of. I want to know how the Starship Enterprise makes its hull go transparent. I want to know what materials will enable space exploration near the speed of light. “Materials science? What’s that?” This is often the first response I get from people upon learning of my professional field of study, which is less commonly known than many other scientific disciplines. Materials science sits at the intersection of phy
