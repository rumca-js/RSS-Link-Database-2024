Watch this gameplay clip of tactical wizards fighting up a two-lane map supporting each other with overlapping fire on their way to rescue a prisoner.  

Tactical Breach Wizards is a focused, story-driven, turn-based strategy game that takes about 16 hours to beat. You could compare it to a more bite-sized XCOM: Chimera Squad with its Breach Mode. The premise is a hardboiled cop drama with magic users. In this gameplay clip a special operations wizard, Zan, joins forces with a force bolt-throwing witch to track down and rescue a prisoner. The level includes two separate lanes that the player must switch between. Tactical Breach Wizards releases Thursday, August 22nd on Steam.
