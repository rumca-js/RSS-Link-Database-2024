So I'm part of the organizing committee for the Boardgames and TTRPG club at my university. We hold game nights once a week, but we also want to think of other types of events we could hold for the boardgames side of things (with TTRPG this is easier). </p> <p>If anybody has ideas or suggestions, please comment! It would be a huge help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/puddinghoax\"> /u/puddinghoax </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eouttf/what_events_other_than_open_play_game_night_can/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eouttf/what_events_other_than_open_play_game_night_can/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1004384, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eouttf/what_events_other_than_open_play_game_night_can", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "what events (other than open play game night) can my uni boardgames club host?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-10T10:18:01+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, I tried <a href=\"https://kallax.io/game/BUVWF-Moonrakers\">Moonrakers</a> at a friend's house and instantly feel in love with it.</p> <p>Is it worth getting the Titan Big Box?

I have vague memories of a card/board game that I used to play as a child (20+ years ago). Trying to see if the game is still around but can\u2019t figure out what it was called. I can\u2019t remember much but think it was a card game. The main detail I remember is that each player got some lives which was a little plastic rectangle with some little men that were standing up. Then when you lost the round, you had to push one of the men over. Very vague I know! But if anyone has any ideas on what this game was called I\u2019d love to know! </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kiwi_Adventurer\"> /u/Kiwi_Adventurer </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eon2hm/childhood_cardboard_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eon2hm/childhood_cardboard_game/\">[comments]</a></span", "id": 1004392, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eon2hm/childhood_cardboard_game", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Childhood card/board game?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-10T07:05:58+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>As the title says.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SandCheezy\"> /u/SandCheezy </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eomwqg/what_is_your_favorite_theme/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eomwqg/what_is_your_favorite_theme/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1004388, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1eomwqg/what_is_your_favorite_theme", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "What is your favorite theme?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-10T05:01:08+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Welcome to <a href=\"/r/boardgames\">/r/boardgames</a>'s Daily Game Recommendations</strong></p> <p>This is a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world including but not limited to<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meeple#/media/File:Carcassonne_Miples.jpg\">:</a></p> <ul> <li>general or specific game recommendations</li> <li>help identifying a game or game piece</li> <li>advice regarding situation limited to you (e.g, questions about a specific FLGS)</li> <li>rule clarifications</li> <li>and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post</li> </ul> <h2>Asking for Recommendations</h2> <p>You're much more likely to get good and personalized recommendations if you take the time to format a well-written ask.
