They could give us the whole company.\u201d That quote from Apple executive Eddy Cue was one of the zingers about Microsoft, and its unsuccessful negotiations with Apple over the iPhone&#8217;s default search position, recounted in the antitrust ruling against Google this week. This week on the GeekWire Podcast, we look at the implications of that ruling for Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine, and explain why things probably aren&#8217;t as rosy for the Redmond company as they might have appeared&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/what-the-google-ruling-means-for-microsoft-bing-amazon-delivery-dilemma-seattles-return-to-office/\">Read More</a>", "id": 1002509, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/what-the-google-ruling-means-for-microsoft-bing-amazon-delivery-dilemma-seattles-return-to-office", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "What the Google ruling means for Microsoft Bing; Amazon delivery dilemma; Seattle\u2019s return to office", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-10T14:00:00+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/A-Waymo-passes-a-cable-car-in-San-Franciscos-Union-Square.-GeekWire-photo-JiaYing-Grygiel.jpg\" width=\"1080\" /><br />You\u2019ve probably ridden your share of weird taxis and ride-hails, with overpowering air freshener and sticky plastic-covered seats.
