<ul><li>Tokyo winner fights back from bad start to finish ninth</li><li>Choong upset his brother and girlfriend weren’t picked</li></ul><p>Joe Choong was not ranting. That does not appear to be his style. The modern pentathlete was, instead, calmly articulating a series of grievances after finishing ninth in the grounds of the Château de Versailles. Choong’s sentiments were only intensified by a medal ceremony taking place on a screen within view of where he spoke.</p><p>In no particular order: Choong was upset his brother, Henry, could not compete for Slovakia at the Olympics despite switching national allegiance. He was angry about Team GB not selecting his girlfriend, Olivia Green, for the Games. And Choong is one of umpteen athletes angry about the upcoming removal of showjumping from this event, a process accelerated after a German coach punched a horse at the last Games. “A happy athlete is a good athlete,” said Choong.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024

We are what is called a Single Parent Family. It is 1978, and being a Single Parent Family is not good; we are the only children like this in our classes at school. We’re leaving behind our climbing frame and our garden, and our guinea pigs, Victoria and Albert, and we’re going to live in a mansion. We slide on the sweaty back seat of the car for hours. At the bottom of the drive, Mum pulls open the car doors and we fly outside, landing on a gravelled courtyard.

Their mother said no. But she cushioned the blow by&nbsp;offering to get her a leopard print swimsuit instead. “There’s a picture of&nbsp;her wearing it reading Elinor Glyn,” Mirandi continues. “I mean, there you go,” she chuckles. “That’s what she gravitated to.”</p><p>British novelist Glyn, though largely forgotten today, scandalised the public in the early 20th century with her erotic fiction.
