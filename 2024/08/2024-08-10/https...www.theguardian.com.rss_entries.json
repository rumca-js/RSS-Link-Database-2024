If I want to roast two </strong><strong>birds in the same oven, does this </strong><strong>affect the cooking </strong><strong>time</strong><strong>?<br /></strong><em><strong>Mary, United Kingdom<br /></strong></em>If your oven is large enough to hold two chickens in a big roasting tray, you can absolutely roast them at the same time. But I wouldn\u2019t recommend roasting them in different pans on different shelves, because there won\u2019t be enough air to circulate.</p><p>To ensure complete control, however, invest in a meat thermometer, and buy birds of a similar size, so they cook in the same time.
