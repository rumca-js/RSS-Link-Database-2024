<p>This absolute treat of a documentary uses a treasure trove of newly discovered audio interviews to paint an intimate, captivating picture of the actor</p><p>Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes could have been called Elizabeth Taylor: A Lost Era. The tapes were found recently in the archive of the late journalist Richard Meryman. They include 40 hours of audio interviews Meryman did with Taylor as part of his research for a book. They start in 1964 when she was 32 and at the peak of her fame. Her voice is breathy and seductive until she needs to make a point, but it is always expressive and captivating – even without the accompaniment of her extraordinarily beautiful face.</p><p>Nanette Burstein’s film layers the Taylor-Meryman audio with archive film and television footage: we see 1940s and 50s Beverly Hills and Hollywood, Taylor at publicity events, her films, family snapshots, and newspaper and magazine clippings showing the post-juvenile lead with various beaux.

She shouts at people. Trinity Rodman jogs past her on her way up the left ­touchline and she gives her a pat on the back. She is basically trying to convince herself that there are still jobs to do when, in fact, her work is done. We are deep into injury time, and Emma Hayes can no more ­influence this Olympic final than the fan in the Uncle Sam hat sitting 50 yards above her.</p><p>Finally, the whistle. The ­explosion. Hayes raises her arms, looks ­skywards, lets out a roar. It is, ­perhaps, the only moment of personal indulgence she will allow herself. While her victorious players are dancing in a huddle, Hayes has no interest in thrusting herself into the middle, a move known these days as the “Jorge Vilda”.

Since golf was restored to the Games in 2016, only three players have beaten Ko. Silver in Rio, bronze in Tokyo and now the top step of the podium in Paris for the 27-year-old. Within minutes of her triumph at Le Golf National, it was confirmed she will become the youngest inductee into the LPGA hall of fame.</p><p>For a spell on day four, this threatened to be a procession. Ko raced five clear of the field after 11 holes. Drama then beckoned; she double bogeyed the 13th as her closest challenger, Esther Henseleit, finished with a flourish. The German managed birdies on her last two holes to post an eight under par target. Ko stood on the 18th tee at minus nine and with no margin for error. In emphasising the New Zealander’s Olympic specialism, she produced a birdie to win by two.</p

<p>From Bangladesh to Venzuela, one calamity rapidly overtakes another, but common denominators include poverty, corruption and lack of hope</p><p>August is the quietest month – to mangle TS Eliot’s verse – or so news editors used to think. Politicians go on holiday, governments shut down, people head for the hills or the beach. Not much happens. Not so this August. The world this month is experiencing an extraordinary peaking of volatility, instability and insecurity, unprecedented in recent times. It’s scary, it’s shocking, it’s a wild ride.</p><p>Sudden revolutions, wars current and imminent, terrible crimes, high-stakes feuding, famines, cost of living crunches, violent riots and unfathomable market panics come not as single spies but in battalions.

<p><strong>The Lyceum, Edinburgh</strong><br />Aakash Odedra circles and swoops to Rushil Ranjan’s powerful music in this buoyant and joyful show</p><p>If you see much contemporary dance, you’ll be familiar with the often all-pervasive air of gloom. Rumbling and droning soundtracks, dark, shadowy stages; an all-round apocalyptic mood. And sometimes you think, could we get a little joy around here, some hope? What would that look like?<br /><br />
 Aakash Odedra’s Songs of the Bulbul is one answer to that. Odedra’s solo dance sails on composer Rushil Ranjan’s sumptuous, cinematic score. Ranjan has written film music for Netflix and others, and this has the grand sweep of an Indian epic, unashamedly dramatic, its recurring themes hummable by the end of the evening. Is it too much? Some might think so, might find its unbridled emotion too bombastic, too deliberately button-pushing. But why not harness all of music’s power? There may only be a single performer, but the stage is full to bu

<p>In the age of streaming, we may not think too deeply about the impact of film posters, but for decades these designs played a vital part in guiding cinemagoers on what to see. In a new book edited by Tony Nourmand, a vast selection of posters spanning the past century offers insight into contemporaneous tastes and styles, showcasing the medium’s eye-catching artistic innovations: glamorous paintings for 1922’s <em>Salomé</em>, scratchy, left-field illustration for 1987’s <em>Withnail and I</em>, and <em>that</em> terrifying, looming shark for 1975’s <em>Jaws</em>. “These images and artworks that covered our streets and consciousness over the last 100 years did not just appear by accident,” says Nourmand. “They were and are the work of some of the most talented artists of our time.”</p><p>• <em><a href="https://www.reelartpress.com/catalog/edition/239/1001-movie-posters">1001 Movie Posters: Designs of the Times</a></em><a href="https://www.reelartpress.com/catalog/edition/239/1001-m

<p>The Championship attracted the ­second-highest aggregate crowds of any division in Europe last season and, on this compelling evidence, it is easy to understand why. If this “blink and you’ll miss it” game of oscillating emotions and full-on entertainment served up by Leeds and Portsmouth here is anything to go by, England’s second tier will surely remain ahead of the Bundesliga, La Liga and Serie A, and behind only the Premier League, in this term’s attendance charts, too.</p><p>As with all the best dramas, it kicked off with a thoroughly ­deceptive red herring of an opening 20 ­minutes. By the time an elegant swipe of Pascal Struijk’s left foot had sent Will Norris the wrong way from the penalty spot, Leeds were not so much on top as utterly omnipotent. With nine minutes on the clock when the penalty was given after Connor Ogilvie felled Dan James, Portsmouth were well and truly on the ropes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/10/leeds-portsmouth-c

<p>A mirrored image shows how the photographer uses self-portraiture to explore feminism, motherhood and identity</p><p>Heather McAlister was staying in a remote California farming community when she took this self-portrait. “We&nbsp;were staying in Tomales, near the Point Reyes national seashore. The landscape is known for its simple farmhouse architecture and green hills lined with windswept cypress trees,” she says. “It’s&nbsp;very serene.”</p><p>She uses self-portraiture “to interpret emotion”, speaking to themes of femininity, feminism, motherhood, identity, “all while confronting society’s definitions of beauty while ageing. The women in the photo are both me,” she explains. “The images are mirrored, with one faded and ghost-like. Both women cover their faces with an allium bloom, making their age hard to determine.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/10/heather-mcalister-best-phone-picture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Give the birds space to breathe, turn the oven higher than you might expect, and perhaps invest in a meat thermometer</p><p><strong>We </strong><strong>struggle to find a chicken big enough to feed all the family</strong><strong>, and we’re not keen on turkey</strong><strong>. If I want to roast two </strong><strong>birds in the same oven, does this </strong><strong>affect the cooking </strong><strong>time</strong><strong>?<br /></strong><em><strong>Mary, United Kingdom<br /></strong></em>If your oven is large enough to hold two chickens in a big roasting tray, you can absolutely roast them at the same time. But I wouldn’t recommend roasting them in different pans on different shelves, because there won’t be enough air to circulate.</p><p>To ensure complete control, however, invest in a meat thermometer, and buy birds of a similar size, so they cook in the same time. Put the birds side by side in the tray, then roast in a really hot oven – 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9 – for 20-30 min

<p>The England men’s team’s first foreign manager was blamed for their failure and had his private life splashed across the tabloids. Now, with months to live, he’s got some scores to settle</p><p>Sven-Göran Eriksson is saying his farewells to the world. The former England men’s football manager has pancreatic cancer, and is approaching the end of his life. In January, he announced he had at most a year to live. He is keen to talk. But he wants to do it in Sven style – calm, measured, drama-free. He tells me he wants to set the record straight. “I had a lot to do with the press in a lot of countries, but especially in England. So why not tell my truth? What <em>I</em> think is the truth.”</p><p>Eriksson was England’s first foreign manager. He seemed to belong more to the contemplative world of an Ingmar Bergman film than the cut and thrust of football – professorial, urbane, with a distinctive high forehead, spectacles and a kindly face. He wore immaculately pressed suits on the touch
