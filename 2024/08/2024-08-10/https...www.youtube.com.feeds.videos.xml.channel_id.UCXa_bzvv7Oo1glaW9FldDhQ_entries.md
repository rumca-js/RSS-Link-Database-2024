2K’s ongoing NBA franchise is back for another round in 2024, and with incremental changes commonplace in annual sports games it's expected NBA 2K25 will be no different. Big changes aren’t coming, but more of a refinement of what already works with the series alongside a partial nullifying of what doesn’t. 

The City, for example, has potential to be a more streamlined experience. Most headline grabbing though is that for the first time since the franchise went next-gen, the newer generation version of the game will be available to PC players. That means that formerly PS5 and Xbox Series X|S exclusive game modes such as MyNBA and The W can be enjoyed by those on PCs, plus the aforementioned The City. 

This video highlights 15 things you need to know before hitting to the courts once again.
