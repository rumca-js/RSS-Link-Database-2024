In this episode of the Sunday Special, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch joins us to discuss his latest book, "Over Ruled: The Human Toll of Too Much Law." With his signature judicial clarity, Justice Gorsuch explores the effects of our government‚Äôs expanding federal criminal code and the real-world consequences when seemingly innocuous activities entangle citizens with federal law. Justice Gorsuch shares the stories of Americans whose livelihoods have been negatively impacted by overregulation, and why he remains an ‚Äúincorrigible optimist‚Äù about the future of our nation. This conversation is essential listening from one of our country‚Äôs sharpest legal minds!
