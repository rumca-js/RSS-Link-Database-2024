For this year\u2019s Raspberry Pi badges, DEF CON hired Entropic Engineering to do the hardware development and firmware. After going overbudget by more than 60%, several bad-faith charges, and with a product still in preproduction, DEF CON issued a stop work order. Any claims that DEF CON did not pay Entropic Engineering for its hardware or firmware development are false. Unfortunately, we heard that these issues with Entropic Engineering were not unique to DEF CON. We decided at that point to finish the badge on our own. We paid to send engineers to Vietnam to work onsite to finalize and test the badges in order to ensure they would be done on time for the conference.

However, Entropic was not involved i", "id": 1001519, "language": "en", "link": "https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-news.html#badge-dev-statement", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://defcon.org/defconrss.xml", "source_obj__id": 82, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "DEF CON Response to Badge Controversy", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
