Jason Koebler continues to provide the most insightful coverage of Facebook's weird ongoing problem with AI slop (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/15/facebook-is-the-zombie-internet/">previously</a>).</p>
<p>Who's creating this stuff? It looks to primarily come from individuals in countries like India and the Philippines, inspired by get-rich-quick YouTube influencers, who are gaming Facebook's <a href="https://creators.facebook.com/programs/bonuses/">Creator Bonus Program</a> and flooding the platform with AI-generated images.</p>
