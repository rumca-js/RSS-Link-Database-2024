Yes and no. There really are very few genuinely novel ideas and methods, and I don\u2019t expect LLMs to produce them. Most creative acts, though, entail novel recombinations of known ideas and methods. Because LLMs radically boost our ability to do that, they are amplifiers of \u2014 not threats to \u2014 human creativity.</p></blockquote><p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-llms-guide-us-to-a-happy-path-for-configuration-and-coding/\">Jon Udell</a></p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/jon-udell\">jon-udell</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">gen", "id": 1002761, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/10/jon-udell/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Quoting Jon Udell", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-08-10T00:26:22+00:00", "description": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/\">Where Facebook&#x27;s AI Slop Comes From</a></strong></p>\nJason Koebler continues to provide the most insightful coverage of Facebook's weird ongoing problem with AI slop (<a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/15/facebook-is-the-zombie-internet/\">previously</a>).</p>\n<p>Who's creating this stuff?
