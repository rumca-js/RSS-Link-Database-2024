I have an old gaming PC that I put in 2x 10tb drives and am currently using to experiment with TrueNAS Scale and Plex. I do not think my current system is a good long-term solution though. I plan to get 2 more 10tb drives and have put together a parts list on Newegg from my research on what may make a good build. I would appreciate input on what to build so I can avoid any mistakes. Thank you in advance!</p> <p>New parts list from research: <a href=\"https://newegg.io/53cb4f1\">https://newegg.io/5", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c8ikjj/need_help_selecting_parts_for_my_first_home", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Need help selecting parts for my first home server build", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-20T05:49:59+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all.</p> <p>I setup <a href=\"http://healthcheck.io\">healthcheck.io</a> on a docker on my Synology.</p> <p>It generally went through without issue.

Unfortunately some of the other kids only have a console to play Minecraft which only runs Bedrock Edition. The problem about console Bedrock is that by default, there isnt a way to connect to a private server other than their Microsoft own few set of public servers. This BedrockConnect allow the kids to connect to my private server. Only catch about this setup is that I'll need to open port 53 on my side as I need to host a DNS server. I'm trying to make it as simple as possible for the other parents with the setup. Wonder what can go wrong by doing this, like if a bot scan my port 53 as open or some random person use my DNS server.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ziggie216\"", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c8icjp/whats_the_risk_on_my_server_for_opening_port_53", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "What's the risk on my server for opening port 53 to the public?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-20T05:11:10+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all I've been working on a small side project for the past couple weeks here and there and have been using it daily pretty much the whole time and wanted to share it here in case anyone might find it useful!</p> <p>Basically it's an interface for you to be able to configure groupings of Ntfy topics. When I migrated away from a Discord server to Ntfy as my notification platform I was frustrated that I was unable to have more granular control over the topics I was looking at - it was either all the topics or just one. With my Discord server I was able to have single channels that multiple things sent notifications to.</p> <p>So I built what I'm calling Ntfy Workbench to basically let me do that - let me configure my topics with a tag so I could group them and view several topics at once. I've quite enjoyed using it over the past few weeks and have some plans to update it some more as I have time to do so.</p> <p>Check it out here: <a href=\"https://g", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c8hx3y/ntfy_topic_organizer_website", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Ntfy Topic Organizer Website", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-20T05:08:53+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>What are some guides, articles, videos, lectures, or some of your personal tips/tricks on self-hosting for someone who has no experience? </p> <p>I want to leave subscriptions like Gmaill, Google Drive, Mega, iCloud, Netflix, Spotify, and all the others while having control of my media. </p> <p>Also having a network-wide adblock would be great! </p> <p>Any other must-haves/QOL things to look into that you daily use would be appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/xVIad\"> /u/xVIad </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c8hvpi/i_want_to_try_and_get_into_selfhosting/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c8hvpi/i_want_to_try_and_get_into_selfhosting/\">[comments]</a></span>", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c8hvpi/i_want_to_try_and_get_into_selfhosting", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "I want to try and get into self-hosting", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-20T04:20:45+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I've running mailserver docker for a few months with smtp2go relay smtp, and now I'm interested in testing Stalwart mail server docker.
