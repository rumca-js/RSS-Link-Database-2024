<p>BBC nature presenter delivers eulogy at protest aimed at ‘scaring people a bit’ about the loss of biodiversity in the UK</p><p>The BBC nature presenter Chris Packham has joined hundreds of environmental activists in a mock funeral procession for nature to spotlight biodiversity loss in the UK.</p><p>The procession aimed to sound “code red for nature” and highlight the UK’s position as “one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world”, organisers said.

<p>Former Home and Away star <strong>Lukas Radovich </strong>was struggling to navigate a family crisis. Then Liam’s voice came loud and clear down the phone</p><p>Liam and I met in October 2019 and by the time we were “official” there was only a few months until the first Covid lockdown. He was living on the New South Wales Central Coast and I was in Sydney – many local government areas apart. We had the chat of “Oh God, what do we do? I hardly know you!” Surely there was no way we could do long distance – this was our honeymoon period!</p><p>Once I had received word that Home and Away had paused production “until further notice”, I packed up my 2003 Golf and drove from Sydney to the Central Coast where I spent eight weeks living with Liam, his parents and siblings during a period of complete unknown. Within this large family of big personalities, Liam had a remarkable ability to defuse a tense situation in a way that made everyone feel instantly better.</p> <a href="https://www.theg

<p>It’s absurd that nobody has a clue how many points might be needed to stay up as the two clubs docked points collide</p><p>It’s about the points deductions. It couldn’t not be about the points deductions. In another world, in another season, Everton v Nottingham Forest would just be 16th v 17th (at the start of the weekend). Except that in another world, the points deductions wouldn’t have happened and so it would be 14th v 17th but with 17th starting the weekend five points clear of the Premier League relegation zone and so a lot less anxious than Forest actually are. This is the points deduction derby.</p><p>At Goodison on Sunday, there will be protests and coloured cards, chants about corruption, perhaps even a sense of fraternity, two clubs united in a brotherhood of outrage. There will be a great sense of the injustice of it all, which is not entirely unreasonable: when you look at what’s happened in football over the past couple of decades – the wage inflation, the absurd sum

<p>The more monarchies across Europe were intertwined, the fewer wars there were</p><p>An interesting history lesson this week. We’re all used to stories about the inbreeding of monarchies across early modern Europe. Austria’s Hapsburgs led the way, marrying family members off left, right and centre as a diplomatic strategy. Then Queen Victoria took things to new levels – her descendants ruled not just the UK, but Germany and Russia, as the 20th century dawned.</p><p>It’s easy to scoff at the inbreeding involved, but hold off. Royal families hooking up with each other might not have been good for their gene pool, but it had a beneficial side effect: fewer wars. So argues a <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20180521">new study</a> examining the monarchies of Europe between 1495 to 1918, mapping the dynastic links, and conflicts, between them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/20/when-royals-marry-among-themselves-it-brings-an-unexpect

That Northampton could call on Fin Smith and Tommy Freeman for impressive cameos - all the while leaving Courtney Lawes and Ollie Sleightholme out of the squad all together - demonstrates the gulf in class between these two sides at present.</p> <a href="https://www.th

It felt like an overdue achievement for the British star, who at that point already had a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors’ Guild award to her name, not to mention four Bafta nominations. At 41, she carries an established aura of prestige that sometimes stands separately from the films she makes. If they handed out Oscars not for individual performances but for thespian comportment, she would doubtless have several by&nbsp;now.</p><p>The wait gets less surprising, however, when you take a closer look at Blunt’s blockbuster film­ogr

Worse, they could be lining the pockets of multinational businesses and City financiers.</p><p>In the UK, 14 years of austerity has left the public sector struggling to make coherent, strategic decisions. When a decision is finally made, it is a panic measure that quickly unravels. The fallout could be that voters become disenchanted with green tech, especially if the dash for net zero leads to higher taxes and higher borrowing while early adopters unwittingly pay for costly mistakes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/busines

Either I will be standing in the garden, straining to see the first swifts wheeling in the sky above our house, or I’ll be swinging by the greengrocer yet again, in the hope of English asparagus. Officially, the asparagus season begins on St George’s Day, which falls on 23 April. But recent winters have been so warm, it has sometimes arrived as early as February. As I write, though, I’m still waiting: yesterday, the bunch I picked up and promptly put back down again came with a label that read “Peru”.</p><p>I don’t know if English asparagus is the best, but it is very, very delicious, and it has a long and delightful history.

You pick your hero. Hamza Choudhury, whose timely defensive interventions meant Leicester saw this through or the goalscorers – Wilfred Ndidi, whose lung-busting runs saw the game out for the the home side, and Jamie Vardy, who looked to have made the game safe until Jed Wallace set up a nervy finish. <br /><br />At the turn of the year, Leicester looked certain to bounce straight back up to the Premier League, topping the table with a 13-point gap over the third-placed side at the time, Southampton. Two losses on the bounce against Milwall and Plymouth as well as a lack of clinical edge exhibited in those games and across the season has slowed optimism.

<p>Recent controversies, including Civil War posters and altered photos in a Netflix documentary, have led to concern over the growing use of artificial intelligence on screen</p><p>Though last year’s writers’ and actors’ strikes in Hollywood were about myriad factors, fair compensation and residual payments among them, one concern rose far above the others: the encroachment of generative AI – the type that can produce text, images and video – on people’s livelihoods. The use of generative AI in the content we watch, from film to television to large swaths of internet garbage, was a foregone conclusion; Pandora’s box has been opened. But the rallying cry, at the time, was that any protection secured against companies using AI to cut corners was a win, even if only for a three-year contract, as the development, deployment and adoption of this technology will be so swift.</p><p>That was no bluster. In the mere months since the writers’ and actors’ guilds made historic deals with the All

But life doesn’t always work out as you want, does it? I was 25 and I thought I might be a taxi driver for a long time.”</p><p>There were times when Wilson was reduced to tears and, as he says, “generally, I’m not very emotional but that’s one area in my life where I’m very passionate.

The shock, the communal widening of&nbsp;the eyes, was in part because, with the shelf life of managers shorter than ever, rarely does anyone go on their own terms.</p><p>Since Klopp informed the Liverpool hierarchy last November of his intention to step down, 27 managers in the top four divisions – almost one third of those employed&nbsp;– have been dismissed.
