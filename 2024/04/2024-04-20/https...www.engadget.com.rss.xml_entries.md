<p>The US House of Representatives passed a bill on Saturday that could either see TikTok banned in the country or force its sale. A revised version of the bill, which previously passed the House in March but later stalled in Senate, was roped in with a foreign aid package this time around, likely meaning it will now <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok-is-barreling-ahead-230518984.html">be treated as a higher priority</a> item. The bill originally gave TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, six months to sell the app if it’s passed into law or TikTok would be banned from US app stores. Under the revised version, ByteDance would have up to a year to divest.</p>
<p>The bill passed with a vote of 360-58 in the House, according to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-us-ban-sale-china-congress-de12b4d22aa8095e62cb0982a6e62235"><em>AP</em></a>. It’ll now move on to the Senate, which could vote on it

<p>Another round of price cuts has shaved $2,000 off the starting prices of Tesla’s Model Y, Model X and Model S for buyers in the US. The company’s North America branch posted on <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/tesla_na/status/1781518596990231026">X</a> about the change Friday night, at the same time announcing that Tesla is ditching its referral program benefits in all markets. According to Tesla, the “current referral program benefits will end after April 30.”</p>
<p>Tesla’s Model Y now starts at $42,990 for the rear-wheel drive base model, $47,990 for the Model Y Long Range or $51,490 for the Model Y Performance.

<p>April 19 should have been declared a global holiday. It was, after all, the release day of Taylor Swift’s highly anticipated album, <em>The Tortured Poets Department </em>(<em>TTPD</em>). How could we be expected to work on this most hyped of Fridays, when there were lyrics to overanalyze and melodies to emo-walk to?</p>

<p>Apple's calculator for Mac computers serves its purpose just fine, but it's reportedly getting massive updates with macOS 15 that turn it into a note-taking, currency-converting hybrid app. To start with, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/04/19/apples-macos-15-to-get-rare-cognitive-boost-via-project-greyparrot"><em>AppleInsider</em></a> said the calculator will receive a design overhaul that swaps its number boxes with round buttons. You'll even reportedly be able to resize the calculator. If you make it bigger, the round buttons get stretched and turn pill-shaped, though they go back to their original form if you make the calculator smaller again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new history tape that you can access with the click of a button will show you previous calculations, so you no longer have to note them down if you're working with a lot of data and need to see a trend or keep track of what information you've processed so far. You'll be able to see the bar whatever mode the cal
