<p>Around 1900, several photographers, including Missouri-born Beverly Bennett Dobbs and two European emigrants to the US, HG Kaiser and Albert F Johnson, followed a gold rush to Nome, Alaska. Among the clients they ushered into their portrait studios were a number of Indigenous Alaskans, whose striking pictures were later collected by the British film producer Michael G Wilson. “The portraits are remarkable for their intimacy,” says Richard Ovenden, head of the <a href="https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/home">Bodleian Library in Oxford</a>, which has <a href="https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/about/media/wilson-collection">recently acquired Wilson’s collection of photographs</a>.

<p>Research that aims to explain why some people experience intense visual imagery could lead to a better understanding of creativity and some mental disorders</p><p>William Blake’s imagination is thought to have burned with such intensity that, when creating his great artworks, he needed little reference to the physical world. While drawing historical or mythical figures, for instance, he would wait until the “spirit” appeared in his mind’s eye. The visions were apparently so detailed that Blake could sketch as if a real person were sitting before him.</p><p>Like human models, these imaginary figures could sometimes act temperamentally. According to Blake biographer <a href="https://johnhiggs.com/books/william-blake-vs-the-world/">John Higgs</a>, the artist could become frustrated when the object of his inner gaze casually changed posture or left the scene entirely. “I can’t go on, it is gone!

De Rosnay is in an immaculately pressed denim jacket with a delicate neck scarf, while Augé, with his huge head of curls, dark glasses and thick moustache, recalls prime-era Giorgio Moroder. If it wasn’t for the fact they have vapes rather than cigarettes between their lips, this could be a scene plucked right out of the 1970s. Which isn’t unusual terrain for the French duo Justice, happy as they are to pilfer retro influences to make futuristic and genre-twisting electronic music.</p><p>However, for their latest album, Hyperdrama, they wanted to approach things with a bit of a “reset”: seeking to offset expectations and challenge themselves. “Bei

<p>He performed at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding and was offered an MBE before he turned 30 – but the writer is ready to head in a more radical direction</p><p>Who is George the Poet? A few years ago, the answer to that question would have been straightforward – he’s a beloved Cambridge-educated Ugandan-British spoken word artist, whose lyrical social commentary about British life had reached such a wide audience that he was invited to read a love poem at the 2018 royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. He’s a writer and musician, born George Mpanga in 1991, whose poetry has been commissioned by the likes of Sky Sports F1, and who was offered an MBE. Today, defining Mpanga by those achievements feels problematic, largely because of how critical the 33-year-old poet is of his own rise to fame. “I got all sorts of privileges, awards, little nods, passes and pats on the back from the establishment,” he says now. “Going to Cambridge – these things are signifiers.

Ingrid Persaud’s new novel, The Lost Love Songs of Boysie Singh, follows in the wake of her debut, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/08/love-after-love-by-ingrid-persaud-review-flashes-of-pure-truth">Love After Love</a>, which won the Costa first novel award in 2020. This time she fictionalises a true story, capturing the&nbsp;particularities of the period and the place, while imagining Singh through the voices of four women, each differently affected by his actions. In doing so, the novel manages to acknowledge Singh’s remarkable personal magnetism while also committing to the women’s point of&nbsp;view.

<p>From films about Play-Doh and Barbie to the Shrek ‘experience’, consumer capitalism has run out of ideas</p><p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/10/margot-robbie-monopoly-movie">it was announced</a> last week that Margot Robbie will follow up the success of Barbie with a film based on Monopoly, my heart sank, did not pass go, and did not collect £200. Robbie’s production company will partner with Hasbro, just as the Barbie film was an initiative from rival toy company Mattel. Barbie was criticised for being little more than a 114-minute toy ad, but it did so well at the box office – buoyed, significantly, by a $150m marketing budget, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/barbie-had-150-million-marketing-budget-2023-7#:~:text=Per%20the%20publication%2C%20rival%20studios,Warner%20Bros.">which was larger</a> than that spent on <em>making the film </em>– that a glut of similar titles are planned: a Barney film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/

<p>Wake up tired tortillas and leftover chicken by adding your favourite Mexican-inspired toppings to create the classic Mexican ‘toastie’</p><p>Leftover roast meat makes a glorious tostada topping. Combined with your favourite Mexican-inspired ingredients, just 150g is enough meat for about six tostadas, to serve as a snack for six or a huge feast for two. Tostadas are also a great way to give old tortillas new life.</p><p>Chicken <em>tinga</em> is a classic Mexican dish usually made from shredded chicken spiced with smoky chipotle chillies in a rich, tomato sauce. I always keep a stash of chipotle chillies in the larder, but if you don’t have any, hot smoked paprika is a good substitute, especially for getting that smokiness, though any chilli will do, really.</p><p>Discover this recipe and over 1,000 more from your favourite cooks on <a href="https://app.adjust.com/1bgiux9n?creative=Endnotes&amp;fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Finsideguardian%2F2024%2Fapr%2F17%2F
