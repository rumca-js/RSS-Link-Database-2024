The Fallout franchise has a long and complex history and timeline that has been expanding its post-apocalyptic future ever since the original game’s release back in 1997. With 4 mainline games, a handful of spin-offs, and now a TV show that’s set within the same universe, the series has a big, meaty timeline to wrap your head around. And with the Amazon Prime TV show expanding on the franchise’s lore, and extending the timeline further into the future, there is no better time to dive back into the lore of Fallout than now.

This is the Fallout timeline fully explained.

From the Pre-War origins of RobCo. and Vault-Tec all the way through to Lucy MacLean’s journey to find her father via the stories set in the Capital Wasteland and the Commonwealth, this video breaks down the long and complex timeline of the Fallout franchise.
