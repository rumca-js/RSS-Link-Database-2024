<p>Meta’s Threads app is often described as the company’s competitor to X. But Threads users, especially those once active on Twitter, are often quick to point out that Meta’s app is not yet a great source for real-time information. The app’s “for you” algorithm often surfaces days-old posts alongside fresh ones, and its recently introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-finally-rolling-out-trending-topics-on-threads-184311138.html"><ins>trending topics</ins></a> feature only shows five topics at a time. But for those holding out hope that the app may eventually become more useful for real-time information, Meta’s latest test may be good news.</p>
<p>The app is testing a new search feature that will allow users to filter results by recency, according to <a href="https://www.threads.net/@danrodriguez312/post/C5xEdNrrZFB"><ins>a screenshot</ins></a> shared by Threads user Daniel Rodriguez. Threads’ top exec, Adam Mosseri, confirmed the change. “We’re starting to test this wit

<p>Modern iPhone cameras are extremely capable video recorders, but typically require accessories like lights and microphones to ensure professional results. Audio gear manufacturer Rode just announced a pair of gadgets intended to simplify this process, so streamers won’t have to build a cumbersome rig in the computer room or haul one to an outdoor space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rode Magnetic Mount <a href="https://rode.com/en-us/accessories/mounts-grips/magnetic-mount">is exactly what it sounds like</a>. It’s a MagSafe mount with a pair of connection points for accessories like the aforementioned lights and microphones. There are two adjustable cold shoe arms that allow people to use the phone in portrait or landscape mode. For the uninitiated, “cold shoe” refers to metal connection brackets that lack power, whereas “hot shoe” would refer to metal connection brackets that feature electronic contacts.</p>

<p>Traditional hard drives typically contain useful components. But dismantling them manually would be too labor-intensive. As things stand, old hard drives tend to go through a shredder and it's often down to luck whether there's anything usable left after that process. A company called Garner Products claims to have a better solution with its DiskMantler.</p>

The TCA ruled that linking Threads and Instagram without user opt-in “will lead to irreparable harms” and that Meta “abused its dominant position” in the industry with the practice. The TCA also suggested that the linking exists primarily to increase the company’s “market power.”</p>
<p>Rather than make any changes to how Instagram and Threads integrate in the region, Meta’s pulling the nascent social media app. The company says this is merely a temporary measure as it works to appeal the injunction, but there’s no timetable for that.

In an early sneak, it demonstrated a few key features arriving later this year, including Object Addition &amp; Removal, Generative Extend and Text to Video.</p>
<p>The new features will likely be popular, as video cleanup is one a common (and painful) task. The first feature, Generative Extend, addresses a problem editors face on nearly every edit: clips that are too short. &quot;Seamlessly add frames to make clips longer, so it's easier to perfectly time edits and add smooth transitions,&quot; Adobe states. It does that by using the AI to create extra media, helping cover an edit or transition.</p>

Meta warned that Meta AI was coming and has spent the last few months adding the chatbot to products like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. We all knew Instagram would be next.</p>
<p>“Our generative AI-powered experiences are under development in various phases, and we’re testing a range of them publicly in a limited capacity,” a Meta spokesperson told Engadget. For some of us at Engadget, the feature appeared in Instagram’s Direct Messaging inbox.</p>
<p>We could tap it to start a conversation with Meta AI, where it could give definitions of words, suggest headlines and…  generate images of dogs on skateboards.</p>
