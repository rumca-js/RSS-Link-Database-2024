The suspect used a translator app, which presumably translated the aforementioned phrase to “put the money in the bag.” But the bank tellers did not acquiesce to his pathetic demands. Subsequently, the 20-year-old foreign national was arrested.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

	The "joke" (that is less and less funny these days) is that every time Israel is attacked, what's really important right now is for Israel to show restraint. The country's attacking Israel? Not so much. Biden took the joke to a new level after Iran's latest attack, allegedly telling it to Netanyahu in so many words, then leaking the call to the press. Marco Rubio, rumored to be on Donald Trump's VP short list, think there's a reason why. To appeal to Joe Biden's anti-israel base.
