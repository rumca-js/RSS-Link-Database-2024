The trailer for season 3 dropped last month, finally giving us a glimpse at what we can expect from the long-awaited return of the anime. We got J.C.

Thanks to their chemistry, they land almost every blood-soaked punchline. At the center of the chaos, Melissa Barrera commands our attention as a level-headed antiheroine with the clear goal of owning up to her past mistakes.
