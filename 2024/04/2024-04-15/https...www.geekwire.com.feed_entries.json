Radious previously ran its Airbnb-style listings only in Portland, San Francisco and Milwaukee and the new service brings Radious to Seattle and other cities nationwide. Started during the pandemic in June 2021, Radious has sought to give remote workers a way to get out of the house but still stay in their&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/portland-startup-goes-national-with-service-that-finds-residential-properties-for-team-meetings/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/portland-startup-goes-national-with-service-that-finds-residential-properties-for-team-meetings", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Portland startup goes national with service that finds residential properties for team meetings", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-15T15:43:24+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1524195946953.jpeg\" width=\"500\" /><br />Tadao Nagasaki, a longtime tech exec who led Japan-related operations for Amazon Web Services and F5, is joining OpenAI to head up the company&#8217;s new hub in Tokyo, its first office in Asia.

But with the recent rush of generative AI and other AI-related technologies, the conversation around data \u2014&#160;and the importance of good data to fuel AI apps and services \u2014&#160;has changed. &#8220;Now the struggle is the opposite,&#8221; said Grover. &#8220;How do we set ourselves apart from all the other funds?&#8221; Data Tech Fund, which launched in 2021, is&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/former-facebook-engineers-lead-seattle-based-investment-firm-backing-data-focused-startups/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/former-facebook-engineers-lead-seattle-based-investment-firm-backing-data-focused-startups", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Former Facebook engineers lead Seattle-based investment firm backing data-focused startups", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-15T14:00:00+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Galvanick-Founders-1260x945.jpeg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Josh Steinman spent four years working as a senior director inside the National Security Council at the White House. One of his biggest takeaways from that experience was the vulnerability of industrial operations that were becoming more digitized \u2014\u00a0and more susceptible to cyberattacks. Steinman is now the CEO of Galvanick, a startup that describes itself as an industrial cybersecurity company. Manufacturers in the aerospace and telecom sector are using Galvanick to help monitor their work environments for any potential breaches. Steinman, a former U.S. Navy officer, founded the company in 2021 with Brandon Park, a former security engineer for industrial&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/cybersecurity-startup-that-helps-companies-secure-industrial-systems-opens-seattle-office/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/cybersecurity-startup-that-helps-companies-secure-industrial-systems-opens-seattle-office", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Cybersecurity startup that helps companies secure industrial systems opens Seattle office", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
