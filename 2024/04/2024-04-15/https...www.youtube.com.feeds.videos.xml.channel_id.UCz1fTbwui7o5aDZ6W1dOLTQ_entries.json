And not only did it give us a very soft, sanitized, and \"current year\" version of of the original masterpiece - but it gave us the most atrocious, stilted dialogue you will ever hear. This goes beyond bad. The dialogue here makes Rian Johnson look almost competent.\n\nIf you liked this check out my main channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz1fTbwui7o5aDZ6W1dOLTQ\n\n#netflixseries #netflix #avatarnetflix #avatarthelastairbender #avatarthelastairbendernetflix #avatarthelastairbenderreaction", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kklLqXXDtXM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCz1fTbwui7o5aDZ6W1dOLTQ", "source_obj__id": 198, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/kklLqXXDtXM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Netflix Avatar is Garbage Part 3: Horrific Dialogue!", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
