## Help fixing STL files

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am pretty new to 3D printing, only been doing it a few months. One thing that I just haven't figured out how to do well is how to fix STL files that seem to have gaps in the structure of the print. I have figured out basic repairs of STLs, but not when there are structural issues. There are two specifically that I would love to be able to print, but they just don't slice well. Looking for education and maybe someone who can help me fix these two files. Let me know and I can send you the files if you are willing to help. Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/etnelson1"> /u/etnelson1 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1c48utu/help_fixing_stl_files/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1c48utu/help_fixing_stl_files/">[comments]</a></span>
