<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! My wife and I are looking at new apartments and found one we like a lot. However, they have something called “Bulk Internet” with Spectrum (Middle TN). The idea (from my limited understanding) is that everyone in the complex shares the same WiFi, which makes it cheaper and more accessible throughout the campus. </p> <p>I run a small proxmox server in our current apartment and it has been working great for the past two years. </p> <p>My worry is that there will not be access to a router and I will not be able to adequately expose my services. I am also concerned about security. If everyone in the apartment complex is on the same WiFi, how different is this from an open WiFi (but with a password)?</p> <p>Does anyone have any experience with Bulk Internet in an apartment complex? The reps for the apartment assure me there is a router in the ceiling, but I’m not confident in their ability to tell me if I’m able to setup port forwarding through it.

There won't be a lot of services running, mainly Home Assistant, some docker containers and the main reason for this small setup will be as a Nas for backing up pictures from our smartphones and lecture notes. My main question is, which Nas container/ VM is the most suitable for this setup? The drives I will be running are a 500gb m.2 for system and VM's and a 2tb ssd for the Nas part. Is truenas a good option for this? I like the Idee of zfs. and the Nas will be backed up to back late.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm looking for a file indexer that is lightweight and doesn't require user authentication and doesn't allow file downloading. Ideally it will be something similar to <a href="https://larsjung.de/h5ai/">https://larsjung.de/h5ai/</a> or <a href="https://github.com/sigoden/dufs">https://github.com/sigoden/dufs</a> but without download capabilities. I simply want to be able to search my files. I don't need to be able to view them on the web. Hopefully there is also docker-compose/docker support. Any recommendations?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bananadite"> /u/Bananadite </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c488ud/simple_lightweight_file_indexer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c488ud/simple_lightweight_file_indexer/">[comments]</a></span>
