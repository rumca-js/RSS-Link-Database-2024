This is an issue that I am massively excited about as we try to push your boundaries as a reader through focussing on South Asian SFF. In Mihir Wanchoo&#8217;s introduction, he sums up the appeal of stories from South Asia when he says that the stories are &#8220;laced with magic, gods, rakshasas, mythical creatures, non-human races, prophecies, and more.&#8221; I think he nails the feel of what Beth has put together, perfectly. Note from Editor Beth Tabler This issue developed over lengthy conversations with my good friend Mihir Wanchoo; Mihir is one of the lead voices from the famous review blog, Fantasy Book Critic. In the last few years, I have developed an insatiable love for the vibrancy of South Asian literature. This love is coupled with an interview with Gourav Mohanty, author of Sons of Darkness, where he talked about it being the first Indian grimdark novel.

While not quite as long from the Nineteen Eighties to the Twenty-Twenties, it&#8217;s pretty close and interesting to note that the same wistful nostalgia filter we have regarding cyberpunk as envisioned by Gibson and his contemporaries is the same that he was undoubtedly feeling when he wrote this story. The premise is pretty simple, a photographer is sent to take photos of art deco architecture of a futuristic kind. Said photographer starts hallucinating an alternate 1980s with flying cars, massive highways, and people dressed like they&#8217;re from the planet Krypton. Anyone who has played Fallout has an idea of what this looks like as there&#8217;s the Red Rocket stations and Robbie the Robot-esque machines.
