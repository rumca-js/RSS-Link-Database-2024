<p>ECMAScript 2024, a planned update to ECMA’s standard for <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3441178/what-is-javascript-the-full-stack-programming-language.html">JavaScript</a>, is set to include seven new features ranging from array grouping to Unicode strings. The 2024 specification, from ECMA’s Technical Committee 39, is expected to be approved in June.</p><p>Among the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/HEAD/finished-proposals.md" rel="nofollow">list of finished features</a> cited for publication this year is a proposal for <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-grouping" rel="nofollow">array grouping</a>. Motivating this proposal is the notion that array grouping is a common operation best exemplified by SQL’s <code>GROUP BY</code> clause and mapreduce programming. The ability to combine like data into groups lets developers compute higher order data sets.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715341/ecmascript-2

<p>Tools that manage changes to source code, programs, documents, or other collections of information are known by a variety of names: version control, revision control, source control, or source code management are all common descriptors. Regardless of what we call them, these systems have become increasingly vital in a world where software and data are essential commodities.</p><h2 class="toc">Demand for version control systems</h2>
<p>Version control systems (VCS) are used to track every change to source code. They help development teams and others manage these changes over time. As market pressures accelerate development efforts to bring products to market faster, version control has become more important than ever.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715125/version-control-catches-up-how-vcs-platforms-are-evolving.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

In open source software, however, it seems to be doing just fine.</p><p>I’m not really talking about economic policies, of course, but rather about elite software engineering teams releasing code that ends up powering the not-so-elite mainstream. Take Lyft, for example, which <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3586728/are-you-sure-you-want-to-open-source-that-project.html">released the popular Envoy</a> project.
