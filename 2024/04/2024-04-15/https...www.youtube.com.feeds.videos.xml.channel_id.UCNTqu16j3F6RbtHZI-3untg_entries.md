Entering the final year of my 20s has given a pause for reflection on what the last decade has taught me about finding purpose, building relationships, and making the most of the time we have. I've compiled some of the wisdom I've gathered in a short monologue here for anyone seeking out advice or direction who may be entering their 20s or if they are finding themselves in a  similar position to me, people still seeking to expand and improve at this stage of life.
