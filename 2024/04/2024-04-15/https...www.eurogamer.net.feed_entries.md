As if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/idris-elba-cast-as-knuckles-in-sonic-movie-sequel">casting Idris Elba</a> in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 wasn't enough of a scoop, this year's third Sonic movie will reportedly see the eternally youthful Keanu Reeves take on the role of Shadow.
</p><p>
That's <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/keanu-reeves-joins-sonic-3-shadow-1235874487/">according to The Hollywood Reporter</a>, which has little to say about the news beyond the fact Reeves' appearance in the Sonic 3 has been corroborated by "multiple sources".
</p><p>
Shadow the Hedgehog made a brief post-credits appearance in 2022's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie, and reportedly resurfaced again last week in new Sonic 3 footage shown during Paramount's behind-closed-doors CinemaCon 2024 presentation - but, with the cha

Fallout, you might have noticed, is having a bit of moment thanks to Amazon's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">acclaimed new live-action TV series</a>; and one of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-best-fallout-tv-easter-eggs-from-episodes-one-and-two">many easter eggs</a> - an on-screen phone number that also happens to work if you dial it in the real world - has fans a-chatter as they ponder the significance of a curious message and a specific timeframe relayed within.
</p><p>
The phone number in question - 213-25-VAULT - makes an appearance during a Vault-themed infomercial, hosted by Walter Goggins' Cooper Howard, during the Fallout TV show's sixth episode. As Goggins does his thing, an on-screen message encourages viewers to "Call now!", and attentive fans have, as you might imagine, now done precisel

A pair of scientists working in the Antarctic have managed to get their remote research station added as a location in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pok&eacute;mon Go</a>. 
</p><p>
The duo discovered they both played the game after each had individually attempted to get the continent's most isolated research base added as an in-game Pok&eacute;Stop.
</p><p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/pokemon-go-antarctica-pokestop-reddit-b2527047.html">The Independent</a>, Australian scientists Raimon Hennessy, 29, and Pete Rizzo, 60, explained how they had then managed to gain the attention of Pok&eacute;mon Go maker Niantic via reddit, which then aided in getting the Davis Research Station added in-game.

## Harold Halibut review - sub-aquatic sci-fi adventure is a little too prog-rock

This feels like the premise with Harold Halibut, and at first it's kind of brilliant. You take on the role of the eponymous janitor here, a kind of lab-assistant-slash-gofer and general multipurpose dogsbody aboard the Fedora. A crashed colony spaceship that set off from Earth some time in the late 70s or early 80s, the Fedora has now been stuck, for about 60 years, deep beneath the ocean on a predominantly liquid planet, becoming a kind of self-contained commune that only partially longs for home.</p><p>It's a wonderful setup, enabling debut developer Slow Bros to do some of its best work. The Fedora is an extraordinarily realised piece of human craft, with the game built of hand-made, intricately worn and weathered models and sets that have been digitised for animation. Combi

## Final Fantasy 16 to receive customisable controls in next patch

Square Enix has released <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/documents/update-final-fantasy-xvi?preview=true">patch notes for update 1.31</a> of Final Fantasy 16, which will arrive alongside The Rising Tide DLC on 18th April.

</p><p>
There's a long list of changes, mostly related to balance tweaks of Clive's various Eikon abilities - as well as a boost to their accompanying accessories. 
</p><p>
More interesting are the changes to the controls, though. With this update, players will be able to save five skill sets meaning Eikon abilities won't need to be swapped in and out individually. Further, a new "Custom" controller type will be added allowing free assignment of all buttons - an essential accessibility option.

## PSA: Don't spend £115 on Star Wars Outlaws' Ultimate Edition

Perhaps this should go without saying, but there's no need to drop &pound;115 on Star Wars: Outlaws' expensive Ultimate Edition, which includes an "exclusive" mission with Jabba the Hutt.
</p><p>
However you feel about the fact this eye-wateringly priced option exists in the first place, it's worth noting that not only can you buy Star Wars: Outlaws' Standard Edition for &pound;60 - almost half the price - but that Ubisoft's usual method of handling "day one" exclusive missions is typically to release them for free down the line. 
</p><p>
As a reminder, Star Wars Outlaws comes in three flavours. The Standard Edition is the vanilla game, the Gold Edition (&pound;95) includes its Season Pass, while the Ultimate Edition (again, &pound;115) includes the Season Pass and some extra cosmetics.

Final Fantasy 16 successfully expanded the audience of the series, though future games won't necessarily take a similar direction.
</p><p>
Ahead of the release of The Rising Tide DLC, its director Takeo Kujiraoka spoke to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/04/final-fantasy-16-successfully-expanded-the-series-to-new-younger-players-says-square-enix">Push Square</a> about the audience growth of Final Fantasy 16.
</p><p>
"In recent years, players of the Final Fantasy series have tended to skew towards a higher age range," he said. "However, this time there are survey results showing that more people in their teens and 20s played Final Fantasy 16.

Here is something to warm the soul on a rather chilly April afternoon (at least, where I am). One creative game developer has used Playdate - the palm-sized, crank-operated console - to propose to his girlfriend. 
</p><p>
The developer in question is game designer Aaron Nielsen, who has previously worked on the likes of Sea of Thieves and Warcraft 3: Reforged. 
</p><p>
Sharing his story on X, Nielsen said he wanted to do something special for the "love of his life", so set about making his girlfriend <a href="https://devforum.play.date/t/love-letter-a-game-to-propose-to-my-partner-in-development/13584/4">her own game on Playdate called Love Letter</a>.

Ratchet and Clank has received a new update, eight years after its debut in 2016 on PS4.
</p><p>
The update adds fan-favourite weapon the Bouncer, which fires a bouncing grenade-like bomb that splits into smaller bouncing clusters upon explosion.
</p><p>
The weapon was previously seen in PS2 games Going Commando and Up Your Arsenal, as well as PS5 game Rift Apart.

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth players have been perplexed since release over its confusing retry screen, but Square Enix has quietly tweaked it in the latest patch.
</p><p>
Last week a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirths-trophy-bug-now-fixed">new patch was released</a> and its main headline was fixing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digital-owners-of-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-cannot-platinum-the-game">bug that prevented players from receiving the platinum trophy</a> thanks to a bugged side quest.


</p><p>
Yet there was another tweak not included in the patch notes, but fans spotted a change to the retry screen, as shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1c2eibo/the_game_over_options_retry_verbiage_was_fixed_in/">reddit</a>.

A Japanese Pok&eacute;mon fan faces fines and a potential prison sentence after his arrest for selling hacked versions of the game's creatures. 
</p><p>
36-year-old Yoshihiro Yamakawa from Uji City works as an interior decorator by day. But out of hours he's accused of hacking Nintendo Switch games Pok&eacute;mon Scarlet and Violet to turn a profit off of modified Pok&eacute;mon (thanks, <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/lnews/kochi/20240410/8010020207.html">NHK</a>).
</p><p>
Yamakawa hacked creatures to order, it's alleged, altering and improving their stats before trading them on for up to 13,000 yen (around &pound;68) each.
