## One-Punch Man Movie to Be Re-Written With Rick and Morty's Dan Harmon - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon is working on the One-Punch Man live-action movie script, with him and fellow writer on the animated series Heather Anne Campbell currently working on rewrites of the script. The duo were chosen due to their strong comedy writing background, which will likely lend itself quite well to matching the humor found in the manga. If this news sounds new to you, that’s because it is! You might remember hearing murmurings of a live-action One-Punch Man movie back in 2020, with Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner originally attached to write the screenplay. As for the anime, this update on the live-action film follows news of a season 3 announcement of the series. The trailer for season 3 dropped last month, finally giving us a glimpse at what we can expect from the long-awaited return of the anime. We got J.C. Staff working on the animation, but no release date just yet for it.

In today's Daily Fix:
More details about the still unofficial PlayStation 5 Pro have leaked online. Via The Verge, hardware specs for the PS5 Pro, codenamed 'Trinity,' suggest an emphasis on better ray tracing and displaying games at better frame rates with higher resolution (finally true 4K/60fps maybe?). Sony has not confirmed anything publicly about a potential PS5 Pro, but all evidence points to a Holiday 2024 launch. In other news, Ubisoft is facing more backlash regarding Star Wars Outlaws, this time around Jabba the Hutt missions that appear to be behind a paywall. Yep, you'll need to buy the game's Season Pass in order to access these extra missions. And finally, a piece of early 2000's gaming history is on sale for a cool $70K. You can own a PSP-branded trailer and really take your gaming on the go.

Abigail opens in theaters April 19. This review is based on a screening at the Overlook Film Festival. Reviewed by Carlos Aguilar, narration by Erik Adams.

While the overall concept of Abigail comes across as if cobbled together from disparate sources, the actors (for the most part) occupy a consistent, darkly humorous wavelength that helps the elements congeal. Thanks to their chemistry, they land almost every blood-soaked punchline. At the center of the chaos, Melissa Barrera commands our attention as a level-headed antiheroine with the clear goal of owning up to her past mistakes. Her solemn performance grounds the movie and its gnarly gags  in real emotion.

## Harold Halibut Review

Harold Halibut reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

"It may take place at the bottom of the ocean on a distant alien planet, but Harold Halibut’s story is an entirely human one, both in terms of its carefully handmade environments and its strong emphasis on empathy towards its eccentric cast of characters. While I wish that there was a little more interactivity to be found throughout its subaquatic setting, and Harold’s shuffling run could have been boosted to a sprint to reduce the time spent repeatedly schlepping from one end of its levels to the other, I nonetheless remained captivated by his whimsical quest to unite his community and explore the spectacular surroundings of his sunken home. Consistently funny and full of surprises, Harold Halibut is a wholesome, handcrafted adventure with plenty of heart."
