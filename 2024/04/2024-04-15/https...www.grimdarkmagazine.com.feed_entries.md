<p>Last Updated on April 18, 2024 Salinee Goldenberg has countless merits to her name: author, artist, video producer, editor and mother of two fabulously judgmental cats (scroll down to see!). In this interview, we got to discuss her debut dark fantasy The Last Phi Hunter, Thai and South East Asian folklore, and how her multiple professions bleed into one another to create her engrossing grimdark debut. For the full review of The Last Phi Hunter, click here. [GdM] Please tell us about your book in a sentence or two.

<p>Last Updated on April 15, 2024 Grimdark Magazine Issue #38 is finally here! This is an issue that I am massively excited about as we try to push your boundaries as a reader through focussing on South Asian SFF. In Mihir Wanchoo&#8217;s introduction, he sums up the appeal of stories from South Asia when he says that the stories are &#8220;laced with magic, gods, rakshasas, mythical creatures, non-human races, prophecies, and more.&#8221; I think he nails the feel of what Beth has put together, perfectly. Note from Editor Beth Tabler This issue developed over lengthy conversations with my good friend Mihir Wanchoo; Mihir is one of the lead voices from the famous review blog, Fantasy Book Critic. In the last few years, I have developed an insatiable love for the vibrancy of South Asian literature. This love is coupled with an interview with Gourav Mohanty, author of Sons of Darkness, where he talked about it being the first Indian grimdark novel. I knew that I could bring dark stories

<p>&#8220;The Gernsback Continuum&#8221; is William Gibson of 1981, looking back forty years to the the Golden Age of Science Fiction from the 1920s to the 1930s. While not quite as long from the Nineteen Eighties to the Twenty-Twenties, it&#8217;s pretty close and interesting to note that the same wistful nostalgia filter we have regarding cyberpunk as envisioned by Gibson and his contemporaries is the same that he was undoubtedly feeling when he wrote this story. The premise is pretty simple, a photographer is sent to take photos of art deco architecture of a futuristic kind. Said photographer starts hallucinating an alternate 1980s with flying cars, massive highways, and people dressed like they&#8217;re from the planet Krypton. Anyone who has played Fallout has an idea of what this looks like as there&#8217;s the Red Rocket stations and Robbie the Robot-esque machines. His agent is surprisingly sympathetic to his losing his mind and says to basically &#8220;cool down&#8221; by wat
