<p>Band of Brothers first aired in 2001 and remains one of the best shows HBO has ever produced. The Emmy Award-winning series holds up remarkably well, and if you've yet to watch it (or are a long-time fan), you can pick it up in a Blu-ray box set that includes its sibling series, The Pacific, for just $29 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Band-Brothers-Pacific-BD-Blu-ray/dp/B087SFLJ7D?tag=gamespot-promos-20">at Amazon</a> (down from $60).</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Band-Brothers-Pacific-BD-Blu-ray/dp/B087SFLJ7D?tag=gamespot-promos-20">See deal at Amazon</a> </div><p>That's one of the best prices we've ever seen for the bundle, with its lowest-ever price just a few bucks cheaper at $25.

<p>Moon Studios has released the launch trailer for No Rest for the Wicked, showcasing its art style, gameplay, and story.</p><p>What's immediately apparent is how different the art direction for No Rest for the Wicked is compared to the Ori series. The new game has a more gothic inspiration as opposed to Ori's more cartoonish art style. Instead of being a 2D platformer and cute creatures like Ori, No Rest for the Wicked is a 3D action RPG from a top down perspective.</p><p>Looking at the gameplay, players will be able to fight against monsters, big and small, with a variety of weapons such as bows and swords. No Rest for the Wicked is set in the year 841 and follows a member of a group called Cerim, a group of mystical holy warriors with magical powers. With these powers, players must fight against the Pestilence, an unholy plague, and Madrigal Seline, a ruthless church figure who aims to weaponize the plague to prove herself to her god.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">With Amazon Prime's Fallout show becoming the talk of the town, people are brainstorming about what other classic gaming franchises they'd love to see transition to a TV series. Dragon Age creator David Gaider has a couple of ideas, but they don't include his own RPG fantasy series.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, Gaider stated <a href="https://twitter.com/davidgaider/status/1779700173624742190">on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter) that a Dragon Age TV series is a "terrible idea." Instead, the writer behind the Dragon Age trilogy would like "to see a David Lynch-style (on acid) Disco Elysium" show adapation "or maybe Banishers." For those unaware about the latter suggestion, the action-RPG comes from Life Is Strange developer Don't Nod.

<p>A third Deadpool movie is coming this July, but it's called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/deadpool-and-wolverine-release-date-trailers-news/2900-5180/">Deadpool and Wolverine</a> and not Deadpool 3. Why is that? Director Shawn Levy told <a href="https://screenrant.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-not-deadpool-3-shawn-levy-explained/">ScreenRant</a> that Deadpool and Wolverine is different enough from the first two films to stand apart as its own thing. Instead of being just another Deadpool movie, it's a "two-hander" that features two main characters.</p><p>"As far as crafting the Deadpool and Wolverine story, I just felt privileged every day because you're talking about two massive movie stars in their most iconic roles," Levy said. "It also gave me an opportunity. It's the third Deadpool movie, but it's not Deadpool 3. It's a different thing that's very much Deadpool and Wolverine.
