My Expression Template Type Names Are Too Long! - Braden Ganetsky - CppCon 2023\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023\n\nEven the name of this talk is too long! If we're ever working with expression templates, we can easily make type names long enough to slow down compilation time. Suddenly our \"zero-overhead\" expression templates start giving a large compile time overhead. I'll show off a C++20 trick to fix this problem.\n---\n\nBraden Ganetsky\n\nBraden Ganetsky graduated from the University of Manitoba with a degree in mechanical engineering, but soon pivoted to C++. Now he spends his days working on supply chain simulation software, and spends his nights working on parser combinators and getting involved in the C++ community.\n---\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com\nYouTube Channel Managed by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\n---\n\nRegistration for CppCon: https://cppcon.org/registration/\n\n#cppc", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKWBNzjmBvg", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "source_obj__id": 420, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/YKWBNzjmBvg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lightning Talk: Help!
