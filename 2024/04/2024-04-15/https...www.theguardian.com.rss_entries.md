<p>The cop show set in post-Troubles Northern Ireland will leave you holding your breath constantly, not knowing what perils await our beloved ‘peelers’</p><p>Is it a stretch to call Blue Lights, which is back for season two, the United Kingdom’s answer to The Wire? Well, yes. In all honesty that would be a bit much – it’s more like a cross between The Wire and Holby City. But the police drama was one of the breakout hits of 2023 because, beneath the soapy surface of its interactions between rookie cops, it has a clear-eyed, humane view of policing as an impossible job. Whatever we might think of the force generally, a combination of societal breakdown on the streets and corruption/mismanagement in the corridors of power makes any attempt to carry a badge and maintain order a futile gesture, like standing on a beach trying to mop away the tide. As it was in Baltimore, so it is in Belfast.</p><p>Blue Lights comes at this recipe for bracingly pessimistic drama from a particular angle, s

<p>Jamie Oliver jumps on the culinary bandwagon in this bewilderingly cringey two-parter. Hasn’t even he tired of his own shtick by now?</p><p>I don’t really know what to tell you about Jamie Oliver’s new series Jamie’s Air Fryer Meals. It’s presented by Jamie Oliver, who first bounded on to our screens as The Naked Chef (no, he wasn’t) in 1999. He cooks meals in an air fryer. An air fryer is a little convection-type oven with a perforated basket that you put food in and the hot air circulates round it and makes things crispy without you having to dunk it in a panful of boiling oil. So, in essence, Jamie makes meals and puts them in a small oven to cook. Oh, and the programme is made in association with Tefal, who sell a line of pans endorsed by Jamie. The air fryer shown in the programme is a Tefal one. Jamie is very impressed with what air fryers can do. Maybe you will be prompted to buy one after watching his show.</p><p>There are only two episodes in Jamie’s latest venture and thi

<p>‘Deadly’ was the antithesis of the international superstar sportsman – until he set off on his run-up</p><p>Derek Underwood once described himself as a “low-mentality bowler”. It was a typically self-effacing remark from England’s most prolific spinner in Test cricket (with 297 victims). Underwood was a hero from another age but you would never have guessed so when wandering into the bar after playing against Kent. He would be there with a beer in one hand and a fag in the other and that self-deprecating smile on his lips. He would happily talk cricket – and spin bowling – often seeking the opinion of others as if they knew better than him (which was ridiculous). Here was the antithesis of the international superstar sportsman until, with his feet splayed at 1o to two, he set off on his run-up.</p><p>That reference to his “low mentality” partially explains his success. Underwood was, in fact, a free thinker. It was natural for him to bowl quicker than his peers but crucially he had

The more that people see of him these days, the further he drops in the polls. So loitering in Downing Street, online shopping for Adidas trainers or taking the dog for a walk, is about as good as it gets for the prime minister these days. At least that ensures the level of public contempt rises at a more or less manageable rate.</p><p>But if recess did have to end then the first day back in parliament was pretty much ideal for Rish!. OK, so the escalation of hostilities in the Middle East and the prospect of world war III might be a major concern for the rest of us, but for Sunak it is a blessed relief.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/15/rishi-sunak-tries-for-gravitas-middle-east-commons">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former prime minister is teaching us a lot about narcissism in her new memoir, and it’s hard to tear your eyes away</p><p>Liz Truss’s memoir, Ten Years to Save the West, first penetrated the nation’s consciousness with her reflections on the death of Queen Elizabeth II. “Why me?” the former prime minister wrote. “Why now?” It was actually pretty funny, the depth and shamelessness of her narcissism; so funny, in fact, that I felt that, somewhere along the line, she had been stitched up by an editor. Fair play; I too would stitch her up in that job. It’s hard to be your best, most generous self towards a person you hold personally responsible for the fact that your mortgage is now 100% higher than it used to be.</p><p>But a kinder, more mature person would have at least scribbled in the margin: “Are you absolutely sure you want to connect yourself, who served for 49 days, with the death of death of a monarch who served the nation for 70 years?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardia

<p>A book its author ‘would much rather not have needed to write’ ranges far beyond his attempted murder and recovery</p><p>A couple of nights before he was almost killed by a stranger with a knife, Salman Rushdie dreamed about being attacked by a Roman gladiator with a spear. He’d had similar dreams ever since Ayatollah Khomeini’s fatwa following publication of The Satanic Verses, back in 1989, imagining “my assassin rising up in some public forum or other and coming for me”. When on the morning of 12 August 2022, in Chautauqua in upstate New York, on stage to talk about (of all things) the importance of keeping writers safe from harm, he saw a figure in black rushing towards him, his first thought was “<em>So it’s you. Here you are”,</em> and his second, more bemused, was “<em>Really? It’s been so long. Why now, after all these years</em>?”</p><p>In his 2012 memoir Joseph Anton, Rushdie expressed his post-fatwa disorientation by writing of his experiences in the third person, as if

<p>Bludy Beershop, Bill Stickers, Red Biddy: with their unlikely pseudonyms, the members of ‘Ferguson’s Gang’ raised a fortune for the National Trust – and rescued many landmarks from oblivion. But who were they?</p><p>Hanging from a drawing pin in Shalford Mill, in a tiny room just a couple of metres above its mighty water wheel and the tumbling River Tillingbourne, is a brown paper bandit’s mask. It is almost invisible in the shadows of the hefty 18th-century beams, and its aura of intrigue seems at odds with this chocolate box National Trust site, tucked at the end of a quaint, daffodil-dotted lane in deepest Surrey. Yet the mask is part of the reason this beautiful building stands today.</p><p>It is a relic from a theatrical arsenal worn by Ferguson’s Gang: a clandestine society active from the late 1920s to the postwar years. Far from their criminal-sounding name, they were actually a bunch of well-to-do guerrilla conservationists, who conspired to save England’s history for post

<p>A string of seven awards for Sunset Boulevard was hardly radical, and many more daring theatrical successes went unrewarded</p><p>The triumph of Jamie Lloyd’s reinvented Sunset Boulevard at this year’s Olivier awards seemed to send a positive signal to those who seek to show some daring in the West End. After scooping seven awards, the musical can certainly rest assured that it will make its transfer to Broadway on a high. Yet even with its technical dazzle and powerful performances, I’m not entirely convinced. Arising from the hugely commercial (and slightly cheesy?) Andrew Lloyd Webber stable with A-list casting in Nicole Scherzinger, who was named best actress in a musical, I was left wondering: how radical or risky is that, exactly?</p><p>Brian Cox, while presenting the best play award to James Graham for Dear England, said he had never seen British theatre doing better.

Meanwhile, today’s particle colliders are exploring a microcosmic world billions of times smaller than the smallest atom.</p><p>These two extremes, the biggest and smallest distances probed by science, are separated by 47 orders of magnitude. That’s one with 47 zeros after it, a number so ludicrously huge that it isn’t worth trying to get your head around. And yet, despite exploring such radically different distances and phenomena, cosmology and particle physics are deeply connected. Observing the motions of stars and galaxies can reveal the influence of as-yet-undiscovered particles, while studying fundamental particles in the lab can tell us about the birth and evolution of the cosmos.</p> <a href="http

When he made his surprise comeback to cabinet in November last year, there were suggestions that he might be doing quite a lot of this, as a general spokesperson for the government, because he is such a good communicator. But perhaps he’s a bit too good for No 10’s taste. Sunak’s team won’t have been happy about George Osborne, Cameron’s friend and former chancellor, describing him <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/04/12/david-cameron-acting-like-british-pm-says-george-osborne/">on his podcast recently</a> as “acting like the British prime minister” on the world stage.

<p>Ane Freed-Kernis used her pension to build a workshop where she could create the tactile, surprising sculptures of her dreams</p><p>In 2019, after retiring from her career as a social worker, Ane Freed-Kernis decided to build a home workshop and devote all of her free time to stone carving. “It’s really therapeutic and completely absorbing,” she says. “I might be covered head to toe in dust but I’m happy – it was something I needed more of in my life when I hit 60.”</p><p>This fascination has its roots in Freed-Kernis’ childhood.<strong> </strong>Growing up on her father’s farm in Denmark, she used to wander through the fields with her gaze fixed on the ground, looking for stones to add to her collection. “I’ve always been drawn to the shapes and textures of stones,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/15/a-new-start-after-60-there-was-no-time-to-waste-so-i-gave-up-my-job-and-started-stone-carving">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It is enabling her to make money while she is refusing to pay rent</p><p><strong>I am banging my head against the wall with Airbnb, which is allowing a tenant to sublet my house illegally. She began to fall short on the monthly rent payments in early 2022. I had a good relationship with her, and showed patience and understanding. Last November, when the rent arrears had increased to £18,600, I discovered that my house was listed on Airbnb, with reviews going back to April 2022. When I confronted the tenant, she ordered me to get out of her house, and has since stopped paying any rent. I asked Airbnb to remove the listing and had to provide proof of ownership before it would discuss the matter. It then told me it did not get involved in third-party disputes and referred me to the host. Relations with the tenant have completely broken down, so that is not an option. My house has continued to be listed on Airbnb, which is enabling the tenant to make money from my house, while refusing
