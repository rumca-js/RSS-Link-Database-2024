Dropout&rsquo;s popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons actual play series says it now knows to explicitly avoid dynamic pricing models, which led to some fans paying upwards of $1,500 for a ticket on the same day the show opened its sale.</p><p>The statement and action plan went out via <a href="https://twitter.com/dimension20show/status/1779608092000608433">Dimension 20&rsquo;s social media</a> on April 14th, a week after the news broke that dungeon master Brennan Lee Mulligan and his crew of intrepid heroes would perform a one-shot adv

It&rsquo;s a faithful and spirited treatment of an inspired video game series, and seeing its iconoclastic visual design realised in this way is extremely impressive.</p><p>So impressive, in fact, that many viewers may have been struck - as I was - with the desire to bring things full-circle and start exploring the wasteland for themselves again. Yet, for my money, Fallout&rsquo;s TV adaptation tells a different kind of story - one that may be more well-suited to the tabletop than to any of its video games. Fallout tells, among others, the stories of Lucy, Maximus and The Ghoul, who become tangled up in a madcap quest to decide the fate of the wasteland by acquiring a decapitated head.
