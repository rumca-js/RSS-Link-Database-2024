Rebirth players have been perplexed since release over its confusing retry screen, but Square Enix has quietly tweaked it in the latest patch.\n</p><p>\nLast week a <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirths-trophy-bug-now-fixed\">new patch was released</a> and its main headline was fixing a <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digital-owners-of-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-cannot-platinum-the-game\">bug that prevented players from receiving the platinum trophy</a> thanks to a bugged side quest.\n\n\n</p><p>\nYet there was another tweak not included in the patch notes, but fans spotted a change to the retry screen, as shared on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1c2eibo/the_game_over_options_retry_verbiage_was_fixed_in/\">reddit</a>.\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogame", "language": "en-gb", "link":

When I'd sit down to work each morning, I'd already be drowning in unread text from the day before - 85 open browser tabs, a dozen PDFs, and stacks of half-read books spread across the floor, coffee table, and sofa arms. Some days, all the open tabs and files would crash my laptop as soon as I opened the lid. Other days, my brain would crash before I could even make it through a paragraph, short-circuited by my own greedy desire to learn about anything other than what I was already reading - the history of Roman coins, the speculative links between Moebius Syndrome and schizophrenia, the geologic history of Antarctica, a neuroscientist who tried to teach animals to play musical instruments.</p><p>Michael Townsend, who developed Penrose through his Toronto-", "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/penrose-is-a-haunted-interactive-novella-thats-happy-for-you-to-mess-with-causality?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Penrose-1.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Penrose is a haunted interactive novella that's happy for you to mess with causality", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
