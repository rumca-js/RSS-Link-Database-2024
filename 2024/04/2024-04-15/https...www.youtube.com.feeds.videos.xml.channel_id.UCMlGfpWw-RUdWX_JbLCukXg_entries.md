Lightning Talk: Help! My Expression Template Type Names Are Too Long! - Braden Ganetsky - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

Even the name of this talk is too long! If we're ever working with expression templates, we can easily make type names long enough to slow down compilation time. Suddenly our "zero-overhead" expression templates start giving a large compile time overhead. I'll show off a C++20 trick to fix this problem.
