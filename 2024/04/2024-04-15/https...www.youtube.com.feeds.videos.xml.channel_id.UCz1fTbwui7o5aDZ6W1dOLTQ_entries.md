Netflix continues its destruction of Avatar the Last Airbender by giving us a horrific live action adaptation. And not only did it give us a very soft, sanitized, and "current year" version of of the original masterpiece - but it gave us the most atrocious, stilted dialogue you will ever hear. This goes beyond bad. The dialogue here makes Rian Johnson look almost competent.
