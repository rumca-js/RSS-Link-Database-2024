The graphic novel titled Watchmen might be one of the greatest graphic novels ever written.  Creators Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons created a true masterpiece that many have tried to adapt over the years.  When Zack Snyder brought Watchmen to the big screen, at first it was seen as the most accurate adaptation of it's source material.  Though upon further inspection, Zack Snyder's Watchmen may suffer from almost being too faithful.   Coming off the back of his hit adaptation of 300, it seemed Zack Snyder was truly the one that could bring Watchmen to the big screen faithfully, but did his commitment to the direct translation end up hurting the film overall?
