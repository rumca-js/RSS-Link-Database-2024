Though the touch controls put you at a clear disadvantage to anybody using a Bluetooth controller and your phone may struggle to keep the frame rate and textures smooth if it isn\u2019t the latest and greatest, Warzone Mobile excellently uses maps and gameplay elements to provide a fast and fun battle royale experience. If you\u2019re already into Warzone, cross-progression makes it feel like an extension of the game you already like, with more opportunities to play it more often. It\u2019s fair to say that the best thing about Warzone Mobile is that it makes it easier to play more Warzone.\n\n#IGN #COD", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTXqn4BsntE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/yTXqn4BsntE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-01T21:27:37+00:00", "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nAnother April 1st, another excuse to question everything you see and read on the internet.
