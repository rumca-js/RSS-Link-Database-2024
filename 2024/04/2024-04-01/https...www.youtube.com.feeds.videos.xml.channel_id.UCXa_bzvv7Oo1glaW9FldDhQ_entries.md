Not many would have predicted before it came out that Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor would go on to amass the sort of dedicated and sizeable fan following it did, not least because it came out at a time where licensed games had no guarantees of being good. 

In the here and now, however, nearly a decade on from its release, Monolith Productions’ open world action-adventure game boasts a strong legacy. Structurally and narratively, it might be cut from the same cloth that so many other open world titles are, but with its usage of the Nemesis system and the incredible, dynamic, emergent storytelling it enabled, it stands to this day as an unforgettable experience- the kind that still hasn’t been replicated or rivalled in the years since its release.

The first quarter of 2024 has some heavy hitters, from long-awaited sequels to surprising hits. Things are quieting down a bit in April, but there are still several titles to look forward to.

Chief among these is Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes, TopSpin 2K25, the first entry in the series since 2011's Top Spin 4; Sea of Thieves, debuting on non-Microsoft platforms for the first time; and Final Fantasy 16: The Rising Tide, the second paid DLC for the action RPG.

Of course, that doesn't factor in releases like Braid Anniversary Edition, with enough content for a brand new game, or Underspace. Here are 15 big games of April 2024 to keep an eye on.
