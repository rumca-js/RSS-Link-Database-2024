But the script I read was nothing like the magical movie it would become after rewrites and production, and I had no interest in teenage vampire films.

During the Tokyo Olympics the British press spent a lot of time trying, and failing, to get a word with him as he peeled off nine races in eight days.

By the end of the week, Scott had won more medals than any British athlete at a single Games, one gold and three silver, but had barely said a word in public because he was so busy racing, sleeping, losing, winning.</p><p>It was the same at the Commonwealth Games.

We&nbsp;buy more stuff than ever, now that we can do so without leaving the sofa.

Instead, we can spend our hard-earned cash with the frictionless brush of an index finger, and collect our spoils from the doormat a few days later.</p><p>This, surely, is the worst of both worlds.

<p>It made TV culinary showdowns fun – and it shows no signs of stopping. From the spinoffs to new rounds, there’s no danger of this televisual institution going off the boil</p><p>Recently, at a friend’s house, I was given the remote control and told to “put something on”. This is a big responsibility and the sweaty-palmed pressure might explain how I ended up on a channel they didn’t know they had, with no idea of what combination of buttons I pressed to get there. More importantly, it’s how we all ended up watching several episodes of a series of MasterChef from at least five years ago. Note “several episodes”: we might have arrived there by accident, but we stayed by choice.</p><p>MasterChef is about to enter its 20th season, and the BBC is, rightly, in a celebratory mood.

<p>A diced potato binds this cheesy leek and pasta dish into a delightful gluey mess</p><p><br />Watching any pasta shape being extruded, be that through a small domestic machine or a vast industrial one, is hypnotic. Short shapes are particularly mesmerising, because the dough – made from durum wheat flour and water – emerges at speed from the bronze or Teflon-coated die, and is then chopped to size by a rotating blade. And then there are fusilli, whose helix form is created by an ingenious die that was invented and perfected in the early 1900s. Fusilli twist their way into being, the Syd Barrett of pasta shapes, emerging from the die in a psychedelic spiral.</p><p>The fusilli shape is an old one. In her <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Encyclopedia_of_Pasta.html">Encyclopaedia of Pasta</a>, Oretta Zanini De Vita traces the shape back to the fruitful Arab domination of Sicily and Sardinia, and the forming of the pasta by twisting dough around a thin reed known as a<em>

<p>Fantasies about British exceptionalism have brought the UK to the brink of collapse. We need a new, realistic vision</p><p>Britain’s economic and social challenges are now so monumental that they require a response on a transformational scale. Addressing a failing capitalism and a society grossly disfigured by inequality and collapsing public services rests, above all, on a repudiation of the laissez-faire economics of the past 45 years. But the most serious failure of Conservatism is the despair it has created about Britain’s future. Without a feasible, inspiring vision of our future, we cannot reach first base – a revival of sustained growth.</p><p>The prerequisite for growth is investment that drives productivity.

<p>Bashful cats and lonely ponies stalk the pages of this month’s choices</p><p>Whether slinky and serious or delightfully daft, cats tend to make great picture book stars. They may often excel as witches’ sidekicks, but sometimes simple is best, as with Eva Eland’s <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/where-is-the-cat-9781839131837">Where Is the Cat?</a></strong> (Andersen Press), in which little Suzy goes to visit her Auntie and wants to play with the very reluctant Cat.</p><p>An eye-popping palette of neon-pink, green and yellow matches the high energy of Suzy, who greets Auntie on her doorstep, arms flung open, hollering “Where is the cat?”. So begins a familiar yet funny game of hide and seek between the pair – with little readers able to join in too – as Cat tries everything to avoid her: squishing himself pancake-like under chairs, teetering on top of wardrobes and peeking through plants, each page a spotting opportunity.

<p>A biologist, a postal worker and a farmer are a charismatic trio at the heart of a documentary that builds an emotional connection between film-maker and subject</p><p>Bordering Poland and Slovakia, Stuzhytsya is a remote, sleepy village situated near the Carpathian mountains in Ukraine; it literally means “cold place”. Within the already tiny local population, there exists a gender imbalance: most of the men have left for better job opportunities in the EU and elsewhere. Centring on the women who have stayed behind, Maksym Melnyk’s documentary is an intimate exploration of the hopes, dreams and loneliness that swell in a place seemingly forgotten by the outside world.</p><p>Initially observational in style, the film introduces us to a charismatic trio of women. Nelya, a biologist, sweetly lights up whenever she comes across a pile of animal excrement, rich with valuable samples for her sadly underfunded research into the ecosystem of insects.

<p>After a decade in Germany, I was still anxious talking to native speakers – then I realised my language skills weren’t the problem</p><p>I have prefaced every conversation with, “<em>Entschuldigung, mein Deutsch ist noch nicht so gut</em>” (“I’m sorry, my German is still not very good”) since I moved to Hermsdorf, a little village in east Germany in 2015. Its purpose was to act as a disclaimer upfront so that the German person I was talking to wouldn’t expect me to articulate complicated ideas or respond promptly and accurately to everything that was said. But mostly, my opening line was a plea for mercy, a signal that I was still learning the language and would greatly appreciate it if they spoke more slowly and clearly. They would always graciously reply: “<em>Ja, Deutsch ist eine schwere Sprache.</em>” German is a difficult language, they all agreed. And for the longest time, that was true.</p><p>Growing up in Kuala Lumpur as Malaysian Chinese, I speak English almost natively, g

<p>An Etihad stalemate, Kalvin Phillips suffers at St James’ and Palace look to have a new star in Adam Wharton</p><p>In their last two league games Manchester City have played their two title rivals and achieved the same result in wildly different styles. Unless Arsenal and City meet in the semi-finals of the Champions League – a rather less enticing prospect now – the next time any two of the current top three will face each other will be in Philadelphia on 31 July, when Liverpool and Arsenal are due to play a friendly. So the title will now be decided by results against the rest of the division and the good news for fans of fair fights is that the fixtures are remarkably balanced – taking the results of their opponents and adding any points deducted back on. The average current position of teams still to be faced by City is precisely 10, by Arsenal also 10, and by Liverpool 10.33. All have reasons to feel this is their year: Arsenal have the benefit of playing one more game at home

He came up with all sorts of theories.</p><p>When we got there, crowds of people were arriving by bike and on foot, or slowing down as they passed in their cars – people of all ages and backgrounds. Like us, they were marvelling at the new green splattered wall that, from some angles, looks like a tree in full bloom. People were conversing, asking each other their thoughts, spotting the stencilled outline of a person holding a pressure hose next to the tree, or imagining how the artist was able to construct it so secretly.</p> <a href="https://ww

<p>Three writers’ pastoral years are beautifully observed in this group biography but seem little more than tangential to their work</p><p>On Easter Monday 1930, the writer Sylvia Townsend Warner was walking along a lane in East Chaldon, Dorset, when she arrived at an unappetising-looking cottage, its muddy stucco powerfully redolent – to most people, at least – of damp and disheartenment. She knew already it was for sale, and having borrowed a set of keys from a nearby pub, she went inside for a closer look. For her, if for no one else, its shabby severity was an essential part of its attraction. So what if it had no electricity or running water? If the surveyor would later describe it as undesirable? Such cons were her get-out clause; her exoneration from naughty “bourgeois cravings”. Unlike other down-from-London types, she wouldn’t pinch the best house from the locals. She would jump on the very worst house, and hope not to crash through any rotten floorboards as she did. Reader,

In March 2021, the retired sports and leisure manager was one of 12 crew members who set out on the 3,000-mile journey from Tenerife to battle sun, salt and fierce currents. “We would row in three-hour shifts and only sleep for an hour or so every six hours,” she says. “For the first 15 days I was seasick, so I didn’t eat a thing – I was just rowing and collapsing. I went through some pretty dark times.”</p><p>But she didn’t give up, and after 42 days on the water, she reached Antigua to become one of only six women in the world over the age of 60 to have rowed across an ocean. “I was exhausted and I was also so proud of myself,” she says. “It was empowering to push the limits at my age and find out just how much I could do.”</p> <a href="https://www.thegu

That’s also the opaque MO with which he operates in this similarly continent-hopping odyssey; a bleary trail of hopeful and restless peregrinations and chat from three groups of twentysomethings in Sri Lanka, Peru and Taiwan, who often stray without warning into each other’s segments while declaring things like: “I want to see maps of nearby regions and listen to the dreams of my crazy friends.”</p><p>Filmed with a 360-degree VR camera that orbits around these pilgrims, a full-blown digital-age existentia

<p>The Honduran Indigenous and environmental leader was shot in 2016 for her opposition to an internationally financed dam, but despite violence and threats, the net is closing on the murder’s alleged mastermind</p><ul><li>Photographs by Fritz Pinnow</li></ul><p>Almost exactly 11 years ago Berta Cáceres led a group of local activists to block a road, halting trucks carrying building materials for the Agua Zarca hydroelectric dam in Río Blanco. It marked the start of a fierce fightback by the Indigenous Lenca people against the energy company Desarrollos Energéticos (Desa) in Honduras.</p><p>More than a decade later, only rusty razor wire and rotting fences remain on the former construction site.

<p>The royals are perennial clickbait, but the wild online bunkum over the Princess of Wales hints at new and darker forces</p><p>On TikTok, there is a short clip of what an AI voiceover claims is a supposed “ring glitch” in the video in which Princess of Wales reveals her cancer diagnosis. It has 1.3 million views. Others, in which users “break down” aspects of the video and analyse the saga with spurious evidence, also rack up millions of views and shares. I have then seen them surface on X, formerly known as Twitter, and even shared on WhatsApp by friends and family, who see in these videos, presented as factual and delivered in reporter-style, nothing that indicates that this is wild internet bunkum.</p><p>Something has changed about the way social media content is presented to us. It is both a huge and subtle shift. Until recently, types of content were segregated by platform. Instagram was for pictures and short reels, TikTok for longer videos, X for short written posts.

<p>This is the perfect time to make lasting changes – whether embracing exercise, learning a new language, planting seeds or painting your house</p><p>Take it from a hopeless dopamine addict, spring is inarguably the best season to get into outdoor exercise. The trick to building the habit – as with any habit, really – is to start small, and reduce friction. Decide what you’re wearing and charge your phone before you go to bed. For your first few sorties, don’t worry about distance, speed or doing a whole workout: just get yourself used to getting up and out of the door. Counterintuitively, it can help to <em>not</em> dress like an athlete: if you go out covered in Lycra, it can feel mortifying to slow to a walk, but if you’re less formally dressed you can stop for a coffee. Keep it playful, and enjoy what your body can do: if that’s some step-ups on a bench or pull-ups on a tree branch, great, but even if it’s just going a little bit faster when a good song kicks in, the endorphin ru
