On December 16, 2023, Philippine President Marcos Jr. said in an interview with the Japanese media that China has ignored traditional diplomatic efforts and that the Philippines needs a "paradigm shift" in dealing with the issue of the South China Sea because Manila's diplomatic efforts with Beijing were "going in the wrong direction". A "paradigm shift" is to break an existing assumption or law, forcing a fundamental change in the perceived underlying theory of an issue. 
For the CCP, the Philippines has gone from being a gentle friend to a troublesome neighbor. And the Philippines' new strategy will cause unprecedented problems for the Xi Jinping regime.
