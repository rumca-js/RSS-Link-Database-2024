One key aspect of a programming language\u2019s usability and safety is how the code written can be shipped to end-users and how the software supply chain security can be guaranteed.\n\nHappily the C++ community has been unifying in the last decade from various build systems on CMake. Despite it\u2019s massive adoption it is still criticized for reasons ranging from it\u2019s turing-completeness to the fragmentation of the different CMake styles across codebases.
