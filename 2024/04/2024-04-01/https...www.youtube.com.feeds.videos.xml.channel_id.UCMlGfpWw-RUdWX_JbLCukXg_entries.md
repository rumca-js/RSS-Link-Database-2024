Recently the C++ community is all about safety and new “successors” programming languages are popping up like Cpp2, Carbon, Val and others to complement C++ towards software security and memory safety.

While it’s very beneficial to design new languages features to support safety, it is equally important to have proper tooling. One key aspect of a programming language’s usability and safety is how the code written can be shipped to end-users and how the software supply chain security can be guaranteed.

Happily the C++ community has been unifying in the last decade from various build systems on CMake. Despite it’s massive adoption it is still criticized for reasons ranging from it’s turing-completeness to the fragmentation of the different CMake styles across codebases. It also lacks important features than ne
