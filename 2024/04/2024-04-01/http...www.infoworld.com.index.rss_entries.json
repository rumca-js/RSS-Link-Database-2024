The company says it is already looking for ways that Angular could benefit from Wiz's superior performance, while Wiz could benefit from Angular's focus on developer experience.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://blog.angular.io/angular-and-wiz-are-better-together-91e633d8cd5a\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a>\u00a0posted by the Angular team on March 30, proponents said that Angular and Wiz were \u201cbetter together.\u201d The merge will happen \"gradually and responsibly\" over the coming years, according to the post. Google\u2019s strategy is to steadily open-source Wiz features via Angular and follow an open model of development. A public RFC (request for comment) process will ensure community feedback is gathered on relevant proposed features. The primary goal of the merge is to improve the Angular framework.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3714628/google-to-merge-angular-and-wiz-framew", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3714628/google-to-merge-angular-and-wiz-frameworks.html#tk.rss_all", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "http://www.infoworld.com/index.rss", "source_obj__id": 151, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2024/04/shutterstock_118780819-100963004-small.jpg", "title": "Google to merge Angular and Wiz frameworks", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-01T17:50:00+00:00", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>The latest version of the web rendering engine Babylon.js has arrived with performance and rendering enhancements to support 3D capabilities and more.</p><p>Version 7.0 of the rendering and game engine <a href=\"https://babylonjs.medium.com/introducing-babylon-js-7-0-a141cd7ede0d\" rel=\"nofollow\">was announced</a> on March 28.
