I'm \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/prototyping-pluck-sensors\">happy with\nthe signals</a> the piezos put out, but now I need some electrical\nengineering to get the signals into a computer where I'll be more at\nhome.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nSince I made a design with 13 piezos, I wanted something with at least\nthat many analog to digital converters, and decided on the <a href=\"https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html\">Teensy 4.0</a> with\n14.  It turns out that this only has ten easily accessible ADCs,\nthough, and in retrospect the <a href=\"https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html\">4.1</a> would have\nbeen a better choice.
