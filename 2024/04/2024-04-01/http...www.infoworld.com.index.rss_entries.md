<p>Google has announced plans to eventually merge its Angular and Wiz web frameworks. The company says it is already looking for ways that Angular could benefit from Wiz's superior performance, while Wiz could benefit from Angular's focus on developer experience.</p><p>In a <a href="https://blog.angular.io/angular-and-wiz-are-better-together-91e633d8cd5a" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> posted by the Angular team on March 30, proponents said that Angular and Wiz were “better together.” The merge will happen "gradually and responsibly" over the coming years, according to the post. Google’s strategy is to steadily open-source Wiz features via Angular and follow an open model of development. A public RFC (request for comment) process will ensure community feedback is gathered on relevant proposed features. The primary goal of the merge is to improve the Angular framework.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3714628/google-to-merge-angular-and-wiz-framew

<p>Even with all of the advances in IT, whether it’s modular hardware, massive cloud computing resources, or small-form-factor edge devices, IT still has a scale problem. Not physically—it’s easy to add more boxes, more storage, and more “stuff” in that respect. The challenge with scale is getting your operations to work as intended at that level, and it starts with making sure you can build, deploy, and maintain applications effectively and efficiently as you grow. This means that the basic building block of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3215275/what-is-devops-transforming-software-development.html">devops</a>, the operating system, needs to scale—quickly, smoothly, and seamlessly.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3714923/project-bluefin-and-the-future-of-operating-systems.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>One of the hardest parts of building software is choosing your technology stack. You have to pick a tool or framework to get started, but you can’t know its real capabilities until you’ve worked with it for a while. It’s a Catch-22, and prototyping only helps so much. There is a tendency to stick to the same familiar technologies you’ve used in the past, but this has obvious drawbacks, including missing out on important innovations.</p><p>This article is an overview and comparison of the leading front-end <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3441178/what-is-javascript-the-full-stack-programming-language.html">JavaScript</a> frameworks at the time of this writing. We’ll start with a look at the field, discuss the reasons you might need a new framework, and then look at each of the 10 frameworks in this list in detail, including a feature-by-feature comparison that you can download for future reference.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3

<p>Recently <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3714743/redis-moves-to-source-available-licenses.html">Redis changed its license</a>, and mountains of misinformation have followed, not to mention a <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-launches-open-source-valkey-community" rel="nofollow">fork driven by trillion-dollar cloud company AWS</a>. Among that misinformation is Steven J. Vaughn-Nicols’ earnest but <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3714821/software-vendors-dump-open-source-go-for-the-cash-grab.html">incorrect declaration</a> that the Redis change “means developers can no longer use Redis’ code.”</p><p>This is simply not true. For 99.9999999999999% of developers, their rights under the license remain exactly the same as they would under the most permissive of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3429076/what-is-open-source-software-open-source-and-foss-explained.html">open source</a> licenses.
