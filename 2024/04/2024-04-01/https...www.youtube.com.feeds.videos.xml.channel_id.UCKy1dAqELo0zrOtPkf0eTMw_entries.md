## Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile Review

Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile reviewed by Phil Hornshaw on Google Pixel 6a, also available on iOS.

It's tough to think of a mobile game that comes as close to giving the full-scale multiplayer experience as Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile does. There's nothing here that reinvents Warzone, but that isn’t the point. Though the touch controls put you at a clear disadvantage to anybody using a Bluetooth controller and your phone may struggle to keep the frame rate and textures smooth if it isn’t the latest and greatest, Warzone Mobile excellently uses maps and gameplay elements to provide a fast and fun battle royale experience. If you’re already into Warzone, cross-progression makes it feel like an extension of the game you already like, with more opportunities to play it more often. It’s fair to say that the best thing about Warzone Mobile is that it makes it easier to play more Warzone.
