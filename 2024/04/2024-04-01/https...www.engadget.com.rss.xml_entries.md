<p>On Monday, OpenAI began <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/blog/start-using-chatgpt-instantly">opening up</a> ChatGPT to users without an account. It described the move as part of its mission to “make tools like ChatGPT broadly available so that people can experience the benefits of AI.” It also gives the company more training data (for those who don’t opt out) and perhaps nudges more users into creating accounts and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-chatgpt-plus-subscription-205027758.html">subscribing for superior GPT-4 access</a> instead of the older GPT-3.5 model free users get.</p>
<p>I tested the instant access, which — as advertised —&nbsp;allowed me to start a new GPT-3.5 thread without any login info. The chatbot’s standard “How can I help you today?” screen appears, with optional buttons to sign up or log in. Although I saw it today, OpenAI says it’s gradually rolling out access, so check back later if you don’t see the option yet.</p>

<p>The first details emerged Monday from Google’s settlement of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-lawsuit-tracking-users-incognito-mode-134515384.html">class-action lawsuit over Chrome’s tracking of Incognito users</a>. Filed in 2020, the suit could have required the company to pay $5 billion in damages. Instead, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/google-pledges-to-destroy-browsing-data-to-settle-incognito-lawsuit-1febfde5">reports</a> that Google will destroy “billions of data points” it improperly collected, update its data collection disclosures and maintain a setting that blocks Chrome’s third-party cookies by default for the next five years.</p>
<p>The lawsuit accused Google of misleading Chrome users about how private Incognito browsing truly is. It claimed the company told customers their info was private — even as it monitored their activity. Google defended its practices by claiming it warned Chrome users that

<p>The great North American <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/">solar eclipse</a> will darken the US, Canada and Mexico on April 8th, as you‚Äôve no doubt heard. It‚Äôs a significant astronomical event, the first since August 21, 2017 and the last one that will be visible on the continent until 2044.</p>
<p>Parts of all three countries will experience ‚Äútotality‚Äù or a full blocking of the sun by the moon. Those lucky folks may even see the sun‚Äôs corona and a ‚Äúdiamond ring‚Äù ‚Äî both rare and dramatic sights. Other regions will experience partial eclipses, with the level depending on how close you are to totality. Watching the moon eat into the sun, even a bit, is still a spectacular sight.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So, which cities and regions will experience totality? When will it happen? What‚Äôs the weather forecast in those areas? And if you do have a clear view, how can you safely watch and record the event? Read on

## Open Roads review: Take it slow and savor the drama

<p><em>Open Roads</em> is an easy game to get lost in. It tells a twisting tale about generational trauma ‚Äî the tension, lies and love between mother and daughter ‚Äî with all the comfort and warmth of an early 2000s network drama like <em>Gilmore Girls</em> or <em>Charmed</em>. As a former suburban teen myself, this game left me feeling equally exposed and understood.</p>
<p><em>Open Roads </em>is set in 2003, and through environment and character design alone, it captures an authentic slice of life in this post-9/11, pre-Razr era. In the early aughts, I spent my teen years bouncing between Dad‚Äôs apartment on the outskirts of the city and Mom‚Äôs house in a dusty development site surrounded by grocery stores and Blockbuster Videos, and I had big dreams of escaping both. All this is to say, I relate to <em>Open Roads</em>' main character, Tess, who‚Äôs finishing up high school and planning a future in the hot new market of webpage design. Her parents are newly divorced and she‚Äôs

Yes, it‚Äôs easy to go straight to Apple for all your accessory needs, but you‚Äôll probably spend more money than you have to if you do that. Companies like Anker, Speck, Peak Design and others make tons of chargers, cases, stands and more for iPhones that are just as good, if not better, than first-party offerings ‚Äî and they typically cost less, too. We tested out a number of popular iPhone accessories to find the ones that are actually worth your money.</p>
