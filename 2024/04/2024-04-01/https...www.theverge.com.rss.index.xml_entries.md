  <p id="2ZvGa5">Bixby’s not dead yet, apparently. A Samsung executive <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/01/samsung-says-it-could-upgrade-bixby-with-generative-ai-.html">tells CNBC</a> that the company is “working so hard” to equip its voice assistant with AI features, suggesting that the company sees <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24066399/google-gemini-voice-assistant-app-android">the likes of Gemini</a> as competition — not a replacement.</p>
