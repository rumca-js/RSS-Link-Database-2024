<p dir="ltr">It's April Fools' Day, so of course a new store listing has appeared for the long-awaited but still ephemeral <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. The timing of the listing further solidifies the feeling that the game is never coming out and is actually just a cruel hoax perpetrated against all those who loved <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/">Hollow Knight</a>, which is basically everyone.</p><p dir="ltr">The Silksong listing popped up today on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Xbox.com</a>, and although it looks normal enough, this is April 1--a day infamous for video game companies playing ridiculous pranks on their audiences. While those jokes are usually fun, it can sometimes be hard to tell the difference between joke and reality, and as Silksong was first revealed in 2019 and still has no firm release date, one can't help but feel as though they're being p

<p>The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live wrapped up its first season over the weekend, but the next chapter in the franchise is just a few months away. AMC has debuted a preview for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon Season 2, which reveals that the show now has an unwieldy new subtitle: The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon The Book of Carol. As seen in the first season finale of the show, Melissa McBride is reprising her role as Carol Peletier, whom she has played since The Walking Dead premiered on AMC in 2010. And in the clip below, Carol demonstrates yet again why she remains a force to be reckoned with.</p><div>          </div><p>Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) was abducted in the first season of his show and transported to Europe.

CEO Swen Vincke told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-larian-interview-swen-vincke-on-industry-woes-optimism-and-life-after-baldurs-gate-3">Eurogamer</a> that Larian had "multiple fallback positions" in case things went south as it relates to the company's hiring spree in recent years. For context, Larian had under 50 people on staff in 2014 and that figure has grown to 470 right now, an increase of more than 800% in a decade.</p><p>Vincke was asked if hiring so many people so quickly was sustainable, and if Larian would be able to keep these people on the payroll if it took longer than expected to release a game. Vincke said he felt OK about taking risks with Baldur's Gate 3 because he had multiple backup plans, including his own personal financial investment.</p><p>"We built multiple fallback positions in

So far, studios have begun teasing wild new takes on their games, venturing into familiar dating sim territory, revealing strange new product lines, and looking to the past for inspiration. While dating sim spin-offs are a popular joke at this time of the year, the genre itself is still definitely worth exploring for some fantastic storytelling. Some of the examples below we'd genuinely play if they committed to the dating sim pivot. </p><p>There have also been a few mean-spirited jokes doing the rounds, and if you're a Hollow Knight: Silksong fan, you might want to log off for the day before you're caught out. We've rounded up some of the funniest examples below, and for a hi

<p>A group of modders are reportedly trying to get Grand Theft Auto 5 running on Switch, Linux, and Android using the source code leaked late last year.</p><p>Fansite GTA Focal reported on the modders' efforts and posted a loading screen clip on <a href="https://twitter.com/GTAFocal/status/1773384083126542805">Twitter/X</a> on March 28. The video shows a regular GTA 5 loading screen that is occasionally interrupted by Switch UI messages reporting errors. Alongside the video is a screenshot of a loading screen showing an Android error message. Since GTA 5 was originally built to run on the Xbox 360/PS3, the Switch is presumably more than powerful enough to run a build of it, but getting the game compatible with new hardware is still plenty of work.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">A group of modders are trying to port GTA 5 to the Nintendo Switch, Linux, and Android thanks to the source code leak from December <a href="https://t.co/6Ij2c1ENcp">pic.t
