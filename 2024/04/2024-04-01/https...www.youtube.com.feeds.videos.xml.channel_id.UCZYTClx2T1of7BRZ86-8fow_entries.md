This month, our SciShow Rocks Box subscribers are getting a really special treat -- a real, living, pet rock! These critters have been beloved companions for decades, and we're bringing you pet rocks from the original wild vein, meaning they are some of the rarest house pets you could have.

Obviously, this is an April Fool's bit. But what's not a bit is our pet rock sticker set, which you can really buy and build yourself a little sticker friend! Click here to check it out: https://store.dftba.com/collections/all-stickers-decals/products/scishow-rocks-box-april-fools-sticker-set
