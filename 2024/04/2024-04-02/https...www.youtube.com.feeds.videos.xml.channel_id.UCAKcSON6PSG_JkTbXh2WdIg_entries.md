Laamar has been a buzzed-about artist in the scene since performing at First Avenue this past January as part of the Best New Bands of 2023 showcase. And this Saturday, he will return with his band to their biggest stage yet, Palace Theater, to open for one of Minnesota’s most recognizable names in pop-rock music: Semisonic.

Just after recording an in-studio performance and interview at MPR, his soul-Americana, racial-justice song “Say My Name” hit no. 2 on The Current’s Chart Show.

Laamar (born Geoffrey Lamar Wilson) chatted with The Current about being raised by a musician father in North Minneapolis, to now taking on a similar role as a dad of two. Laamar also talked about finding confidence in singing, connecting with the local music scene and more.
