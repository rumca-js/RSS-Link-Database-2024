## Kurt Zouma’s unusual finishing touch helps West Ham peg back Spurs

<p>The fact that Tottenham saw most of the ball came as little surprise. West Ham are built to absorb pressure and the longer this game remained locked at 1-1, the less likely it seemed that David Moyes would tell his side to gamble on chasing the goal that would have tightened their grip on seventh place.</p><p>Perhaps Moyes, drawing on that pragmatic streak, wanted to see some proper defending after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/30/newcastle-west-ham-premier-league-match-report">West Ham’s collapse at Newcastle</a>. It was over to Spurs to provide the incision during a tepid second half and the frustration for Ange Postecoglou was seeing his attack fall short. Pegged back by Kurt Zouma’s equaliser, Spurs did not create enough after Brennan Johnson’s early goal and were unable to draw level with fourth-placed Aston Villa. Manchester United will still see a chance to steal a Champions League spot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/02/w

## ‘Average is awesome’: California pleased with result of critical snowpack survey

<p>After years of swinging extremes, state snowpack is at rare average of 110%, setting up good water savings account for year ahead</p><p>On Tuesday morning California officials trekked into the mountains to share some exciting and unusual news: the state’s snowpack measurement is just about average. Across the state, the snowpack came in at roughly 110% – a measurement that is exceedingly rare in a changing climate.</p><p>The fourth survey of the year, conducted at the beginning of April, is considered one of the most crucial. It serves as an indicator for how the state’s water supply will fare through the drier, warmer seasons ahead. The snowpack acts as a water savings account for the state, supplying roughly 30% of California’s water and slowly refilling reservoirs, pumping rivers and streams, and wetting soils during the dry, warm seasons as it melts. April typically marks the shift out of the precipitation season, which is why this snowpack measurement carries so much weight.</

<p>After years of hard gigging, the comedian of the year finalist and pun champion is finally breaking through, thanks to his intoxicating mix of surreal standup and social justice</p><p>In comedian Kev Mud’s home in Cornwall, a caravan overlooking Porthcothan Bay, he has a mountain of DVDs stashed in a corner. There’s Hitchcock, skateboarding films, Rugrats and Fraggle Rock. “It might be a bit weird for some guy living in a caravan on top of the cliffs to have a load of kids’ DVDs,” he says. “But there’s nothing alarming going on. It’s just sometimes you don’t want to watch a Swedish noir about suicides from a bridge. Sometimes, you just want a talking bear.”</p><p>Mud started collecting them during lockdown, after he moved here from Leicester. “The DVDs were me catastrophising – there’s always catastrophe going on inside my head,” the 37-year-old continues, pausing to take a sip of his favourite concoction – Horlicks, milk powder and chai. “I’ll go through these periods, ‘What happe

<p>Steve Collins and Chris Eubank recall their 1995 super-middleweight world title clash, and its odd details, with intelligence and honesty</p><p>Here is a boxing documentary that is a cut above the usual back-slapping nostalgia – largely down to the canny, vivid presences of its two central figures, Steve Collins and Chris Eubank. Collins, of course, was the Irish fighter who psyched out a hitherto-dominant Eubank in their super-middleweight world title fight in 1995 to pull off a major shock – though possibly less of a shock than it might have been made out, as Collins was already a world title holder at middleweight.</p><p>Both Collins and Eubank come across well: intelligent, honest and able to comment with the benefit of perspective on what they brought to the encounter. Eubank, particularly, has retained his dignity in defeat – even if the archive shots of him preparing for the ring walk astride an idling motorbike as Tina Turner’s The Best blares over the PA look genuinely abs

<p>If you are looking for a sport where results are anyone’s guess then rugby union is currently hard to beat</p><p>A few of us were chatting the other day with Rob Baxter, Exeter Chief’s director of rugby, about the toughest challenge in rugby. We all probably have a personal opinion on the subject: physically trying to stop a massive onrushing forward two metres from your own line, say, or having to kick a last-minute winning penalty into the teeth of a Galway gale from 50 metres.</p><p>Baxter, though, was talking more generally and coming at the question from a seasoned coach’s perspective. In his opinion the most difficult obstacles to overcome are often mental. Not least the art of preparing to face opponents whom you steamrollered last time you played them. “Doubling up on games you’ve had a good result in is the hardest thing to do in rugby,” insisted Baxter. “The amount of times I’ve been involved, either playing or coaching, when you’ve won by 30 points one week and the next

<p>Dupieux’s melancholic comedy sees a disillusioned audience member pull a gun before demanding a word processor to write the actors a better play</p><p>Quentin Dupieux is one of the vanishingly small number of film-makers on the non-Anglo-American distribution circuit who really is interested in – and allowed to make – straight-up comedy, albeit flavoured with melancholy or violent absurdity. For me, only Benoît Delépine and Gustave Kervern are comparable. Aki Kaurismäki, for example, is different; although gently and wonderfully comic, his films don’t try to hit the laugh lines in the same way.</p><p>The prolific Dupieux has now created a 67-minute sketch, a one-act cine-play about a mediocre Paris stage company performing a dinner-theatre comedy called The Cuckold to a bored, half-empty house. Just as they are grinding through their tired old routines, a guy called Yannick (Raphaël Quenard) stands up in the auditorium and announces that this so-called comedy is making him sad and
