<p>England’s National Health Service (NHS) <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2024/04/nhs-rolls-out-artificial-pancreas-in-world-first-move/">said</a> on Tuesday that “tens of thousands of children and adults” with type 1 diabetes will receive an “artificial pancreas” to help manage their insulin levels. The hybrid closed loop system — a sensor under the skin that sends wireless readings to an externally worn pump, which delivers insulin as needed — can help patients avoid the risks of type 1 diabetes without worrying about finger sticks or injections.</p>

<p>The idea behind convertible, or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-2-in-1-laptops-173038508.html">2-in-1 PCs</a>, has remained the same over the last decade: Why buy a tablet when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html">your laptop</a> can fold a full 360 degrees, allowing you to use it as a large slate, or a screen propped up without a keyboard in the way?

<p>You know those folks who say they’d donate a major organ to own a fancy car? Ask them if they’d feel as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-4-first-look-when-no-rear-window-makes-for-a-better-car-150052884.html"><ins>comfortable sacrificing a rear window instead</ins></a>. Polestar’s newest ride has made its North American debut at the NY Auto Show and notably lacks a rear windshield. The rationale is rear passengers get better headroom and a more comfortable ride than in other cars. Drivers, meanwhile, get a high-res display where the rear-view mirror used to be, linked to a live feed from a rear-mounted camera. Given how often people’s heads or luggage obscure the backward view, it’s a trade I’m readily prepared to accept.</p>

<p>Jon Stewart <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaDTiWaYfcM">hosted</a> FTC (Federal Trade Commission) chair Lina Khan on his weekly Daily Show segment yesterday, but Stewart's own revelations were just as interesting as Khan's. During the sit-down, Stewart admitted that Apple asked him not to host Khan on a podcast, which was an extension of his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-221022043.html"><em>The Problem with Jon Stewart</em></a> Apple TV+ show at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to have you on a podcast and Apple asked us not to do it,&quot; Stewart told Khan. &quot;They literally said, 'Please don’t talk to her.'&quot;</p>

<p>Unless you plan on slipping your new AirTag into the inside pocket of a bag, you’ll likely need a case or holder with which to use it. Apple’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html">Bluetooth trackers</a> pair with iPhones and handily use the Find My network to keep track of your belongings, but in very Apple fashion, the company did not design them with a built-in keyring hole. That means you’ll need something to help you attach them to things like keys, straps, pet collars and the like. Thankfully, there’s a plethora of AirTag keychains, holders, cases and more out there and many of the best ones you can pick up for less than the cost of one tracker itself. After testing dozens of them, these are the best AirTag holders you can buy right now.</p>
