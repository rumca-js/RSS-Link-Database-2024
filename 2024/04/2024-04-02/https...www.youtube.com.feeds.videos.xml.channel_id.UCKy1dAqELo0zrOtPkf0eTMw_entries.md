We stopped by the Limited Run Games booth at PAX East 2024 in Boston to check out some of their upcoming games, including an all-new Rugrats game originally created for the Nintendo Entertainment System. This isn't a port of an old game, either: it's an all-new platformer coming to consoles and PC with modern graphics… that you can switch to the old 8-bit style when you're feeling nostalgic. We also checked out Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore, Renaine, and Rose and Camellia Collection, which is described as "anime Downton Abby with slapping." And of course, we picked up a thing or two at the booth for ourselves. I mean, we were there anyway.

Welcome to the world of Fallout. The cast and executive producers provide an extended sneak peek at Prime Video's hotly anticipated TV series adaptation of the video game franchise.

Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there’s almost nothing left to have. Two-hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind—and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them. 

The series comes from Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes. Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner serve as executive producers, writers, and co-showrunners. 

Fallout stars Ella Purnell (Yellowjackets), Aaron Moten (Emancipation) and Walton Goggins (The Hateful Eight). Athena Wickham of Kilter Films also executive produces, along with Todd Howard for Bethesda

Here's the Boy Kills World - Official Red Band Trailer. Boy Kills World is an action thriller distributed by Roadside Attractions. 

"Boy" vows revenge after his family is murdered by Hilda Van Der Koy, the deranged matriarch of a corrupt post-apocalyptic dynasty that left the boy orphaned, deaf, and voiceless. Driven by his inner voice, one which he co-opted from his favorite childhood video game, Boy trains with a mysterious shaman to become an instrument of death and is set loose on the eve of the annual culling of dissidents. Bedlam ensues as Boy commits bloody martial arts mayhem, inciting a wrath of carnage and blood-letting. As he tries to get his bearings in this delirious realm, Boy soon falls in with a desperate resistance group, all the while bickering with the apparent ghost of his rebellious little sister. Boy Kills World stars Bill Skarsgård, Jessica Rothe, Michelle Dockery, Brett Gelman, Isaiah Mustafa, Yayan Ruhian, with Andrew Koji, Sharlto Copley and Famke Janssen. T
