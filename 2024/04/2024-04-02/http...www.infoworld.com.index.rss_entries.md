## There's more to cloud architecture than GPUs

<p>Talk to anybody about generative AI in the cloud, and the conversation goes quickly to GPUs (graphics processing units). But that could be a false objective. GPUs do not matter as much as people think they do, and in a few years, the conversation will likely shift to what is much more critical to the development and deployment of generative AI systems in the cloud.</p><p>The current assumption is that GPUs are indispensable for facilitating the complex computations required by generative AI models. While GPUs have been pivotal in advancing AI, overemphasizing them might detract from exploring and leveraging equally effective and potentially more sustainable alternatives. Indeed, GPUs could quickly become commodities like other resources that AI systems need, such as storage and processing space. The focus should be on designing and deploying these systems, not just the hardware they run on. Call me crazy.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/371

<p class="toc">It’s hard to believe that the agile software development methodology officially turned 20 years old last year. What once was an outlying practice for startups collaborating in colocated spaces with stickies and whiteboards is now a sophisticated, scalable, and widely used set of agile software development processes and tools.</p><h2 class="toc">What is agile software development methodology</h2>
