Understanding AI from Scratch ‚Äì Neuaral Networks Without Libraries Course

Learn the fundamentals of Neural Networks by building one from scatch without libraries. You'll manually tweak network parameters to teach a car how to drive within a specially crafted playground. Dr. Radu has over a decade of experience with machine learning and AI, and he emphasizes the importance of revisiting basics in an era of easy-to-use complex models.

You will have homework assignments which you can discuss with Radu on his Discord: discord.gg/gJFcF5XVn9
