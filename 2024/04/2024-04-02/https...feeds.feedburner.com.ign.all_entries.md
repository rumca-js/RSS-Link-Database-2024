The headline you clicked on to get into this article is not hyperbole: by Keepsake’s own definition – and one that I’d co-sign after playing the game for myself – Jump Ship is a clear mix of Sea of Thieves, Left 4 Dead, and FTL.

One of you flies it, while the others can wander around inside of it or even on the outside of it if you pass through an airlock and then use your magnetized boots to stomp around the hull, manning, fixing, or upgrading the ship’s cannons. That in and of itself is fun.
