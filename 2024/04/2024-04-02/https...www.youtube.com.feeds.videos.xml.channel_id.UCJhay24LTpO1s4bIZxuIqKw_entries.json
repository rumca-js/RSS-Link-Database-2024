DLang has a rich history since its inception in 2001, and continues to be an actively evolving memory-safe language used in industry. In this talk, I will discuss how learning and using the D language has directly benefited my use and learning of C++ and vice versa. We'll look at the evolution of both C++ and Dlang, and see how each language has borrowed from eac", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDycyFa0dGI", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "source_obj__id": 421, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/VDycyFa0dGI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "ACCU 2024 Session Preview - Interview With Mike Shah by @cppevents", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-02T15:06:25+00:00", "description": "https://www.accuconference.org/\nhttps://accu.org\nACCU 2024 Keynote Preview: Keynote: Safety, Security, Safety[sic] and C/C++[sic] by Herb Sutter\n\nKevin Carpenter from  @cppevents  sits down with Herb Sutter to discuss his upcoming Keynote talk for the ACCU conference, titled Keynote: Safety, Security, Safety [sic] and C/C++ [sic]\n\nJoin Kevin and Herb for a sneak preview of the opening Keynote for ACCU 2024!\n\nKeynote: Safety, Security, Safety[sic] and C/C++[sic]\nScheduled for Wednesday 17th April during ACCU conference 2024!\n\nAs the world\u2019s threats and dangers evolve, so too must our tools.
