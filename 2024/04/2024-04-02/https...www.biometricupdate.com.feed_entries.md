		A federal judge has sided with plaintiffs who want to amend their lawsuit against Amazon over alleged violations of Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act. The ruling will allow plaintiffs to add more representatives to their class action.

The case hinges on whether Amazon Web Services failed to gather the required informed consent when collecting voice biometrics from callers to financial institution John Hancock, for which it was providing call center services. The bank and Pindrop, which supplied its biometric software, have been removed from the case for <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/pindrop-exempted-from-biometric-data-privacy-lawsuit">lack of jurisdiction</a>.

		<em>By Anthony Eaton, Chief Technology Officer, <a href="https://www.idexbiometrics.com">IDEX Biometrics</a></em>

In today’s digital age, citizens across the world are concerned about the ownership of identity. Nowadays, <a href="https://www.telefonica.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/Report-Privacy-matters-survey.pdf">almost 90%</a> of individuals think that one of the biggest threats to society is the infringement of someone’s right to privacy. And, as the world becomes more and more digital, this is having a significant impact on how we handle data. Regardless of the organization or how they intend to utilize the personal data, anything that increases that risk is going to be seen unfavorably.

One area where we are seeing particular transformation surrounding data

		<em>April 2, 2024 - </em>Revenues from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/bio-key">BIO-key</a>’s sales of digital identity and access management software and hardware rose by $2 million in the company’s fiscal 2023 to reach $9.1 million.

CEO Mike DePasquale says in the announcement of BIO-key’s fourth quarter and full-year 2023 results that the company is “in a strong position to reach profitability over the next several quarters.”

BIO-key’s selling, general and administration expenses were reduced by $2.1 million during 2023. The company’s operating costs fell by 22 percent to $7.3 million for the year.

Bottom-line results over the past quarter were adversely affected by a holdup in delivering $2.8 million worth of hardware for a project in Nigeria.
