Most of the discussion is hardware-agnostic, talking about video encode, decode, and compression. At GN, none of us are experts in these topics (and they exit our usual coverage spectrum), so graphics engineer Tom Petersen will be joining to help provide the foundational knowledge as a part of our educational series of engineering discussions. Towards the end, he talks about the hardware-level choices that affect media processing. This is the last of our series of 3 videos with Tom Petersen. Check the others below, and check back for videos with other engineers later!\n\nWatch our educational video on graphics/video drivers and game optimization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp3BGu3vixk\nWatch the video on Simulation Time Error & Presentmon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_RO8bJop8o\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://st", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swoIPD7EvEw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "source_obj__id": 428, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/swoIPD7EvEw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "YouTube's Existence is Insane: How Video Compression, Encode, & Decode Work (Basics)", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
