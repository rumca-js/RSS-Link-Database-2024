This video goes through the very top-level basics of how videos work. Most of the discussion is hardware-agnostic, talking about video encode, decode, and compression. At GN, none of us are experts in these topics (and they exit our usual coverage spectrum), so graphics engineer Tom Petersen will be joining to help provide the foundational knowledge as a part of our educational series of engineering discussions. Towards the end, he talks about the hardware-level choices that affect media processing. This is the last of our series of 3 videos with Tom Petersen. Check the others below, and check back for videos with other engineers later!
