We then think and rethink and overthink how to avoid copies and if a `std::move` would be more efficient in a certain case.\n\nBut if we understand what it means for a type to be trivial most of these questions now become meaningless. We can get all of the efficiency we could hope for, and probably more.\n\nWe will look at the trivial type traits, what they mean, and how they affect our code. Will will then examine the benefits of using trivial types and the impact on performance.\n---\n\nJason Turner\n\nJason is host of the YouTube channel C++Weekly, co-host emeritus of the podcast CppCast, author of C++ Best Practices, and author of the first casual puzzle books designed to teach C++ fundamentals while having fun!\n---", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpF1LKQBgBQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "source_obj__id": 420, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/bpF1LKQBgBQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Great C++ is_trivial: trivial type traits - Jason Turner - CppCon 2023", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
