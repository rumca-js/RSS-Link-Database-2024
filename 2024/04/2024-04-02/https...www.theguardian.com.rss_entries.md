<p>A majority of people imagine they’re far fresher-faced than they actually are. So should we be battling our internalised ageism and embracing the ravages of time?</p><p>Sit your old bones down, because I’ve got bad news: you probably look older than you think you do. Don’t shoot the messenger – blame science. A recent study published in the journal <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2024-58254-001.html">Psychology and Aging</a> found that 59% of US adults aged 50 to 80 believe they look younger than other people their age. Women and people with higher incomes were slightly more likely to say they thought they looked fresher than their peers; and only 6% of adults in the bracket thought (or realised) they looked older than others their age. In short, most of us are delusional.</p><p>While the survey only included people over 50, I reckon they would have got the same results if they polled anyone over 30. Our brains have inbuilt denial mechanisms that stop us confronting our o

<p>The coastal setting is beautiful, the couple are messily believable and it’s an eerily accurate homage to small-town life. Hopefully sewage won’t get in the way of all the tender, water-based bonding</p><p>The first series of Float picked up several awards and a dedicated audience for its youth-leaning small-town love story between two female lifeguards. Over six 10-minute-ish episodes, this “microdrama”, written by the acclaimed playwright Stef Smith, revealed itself to be both a romance – as Jade (Hannah Jarrett-Scott) falls for her seemingly straight colleague Collette (Jessica Hardwick) – and a bigger mystery: why is Jade so depressed and withdrawn? And what had caused her to suddenly drop out of university in Glasgow and return home? It ended on a note of impressive ambiguity, daring not to resolve everything neatly, leaving the loose ends hanging with a nod to realism rather than wish fulfilment.</p><p>We rejoin them for a second series 18 months later.

## My husband has suggested we both go on Tinder for fun – but will this open a can of worms?

<p>I’ve never dated online before and am open to the idea. But I’m worried that what starts with light flirting could lead to big problems</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>My husband and I have a very happy relationship but lately he has been suggesting that we go on Tinder to speak to other men “just for fun”. He doesn’t mind if I go on alone or we go as a couple (though I’m sure he would like that), but he says it would be fun to flirt online with other </strong><strong>gay men. I can see how it would be fun and I’m open to the idea, but worried that it will open a can of worms. My main concern is that a friend would see me on there and wonder what’s going on. We are a little older and have never dated online before, which is part of the appeal for him. I’m very secure in our marriage and I don’t think he is looking around or doesn’t think I’m enough for him, and we are very honest with each other. Do you think this could be something fun or will it lead to too many problems?</strong></p>

<p>It has made it practically impossible to make a claim</p><p><strong>Halfords’s price-match policy promises to refund the difference within seven days if you find the same item cheaper from elsewhere. Unfortunately, it makes it practically impossible to actually make a claim. I ordered a Xiaomi Mi Smart electric folding bike online at Halfords for £899.10. I then found it on scan.co.uk for £599.99. Halfords first told me I had to claim in store, and when I pointed out that this was not in the terms and conditions, it promised a callback that never came. I called again and this time was told that scan.co.uk did not count in the offer, as it was online only. That’s untrue, it has a branch. Moreover, the T&amp;Cs don’t state that exclusively online retailers are excluded from the price match. When I mentioned this, I was put on hold for an hour until I gave up. Most laughably of all, Halfords then removed the item from its website and claimed that it couldn’t refund me the price differ

<p>New research into the dying brain suggests the line between life and death may be less distinct than previously thought</p><p>Patient One was 24 years old and pregnant with her third child when she was taken off life support. It was 2014. A couple of years earlier, she had been diagnosed with a disorder that caused an irregular heartbeat, and during her two previous pregnancies she had suffered seizures and faintings. Four weeks into her third pregnancy, she collapsed on the floor of her home. Her mother, who was with her, called 911. By the time an ambulance arrived, Patient One had been unconscious for more than 10 minutes. Paramedics found that her heart had stopped.</p><p>After being driven to a hospital where she couldn’t be treated, Patient One was taken to the emergency department at the University of Michigan.
