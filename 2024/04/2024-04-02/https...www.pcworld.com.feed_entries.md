<p>When Qualcomm showed off its benchmarks of its new Snapdragon X Elite chips last October, there was one flaw in its argument: Qualcomm was comparing the new Snapdragon platform to Intel&rsquo;s older 13th-gen Core chips. That&rsquo;s been fixed. Now Qualcomm says that the Snapdragon X Elite is faster than Intel&rsquo;s 14th-gen Core Ultra (Meteor Lake) too.</p>



<p>Last October, Qualcomm said that its Snapdragon X Elite could match the performance of the Intel Core i9-13980HX at 70 percent less power. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2117798/qualcomms-next-snapdragon-looks-like-the-fastest-pc-processor.html">Subsequent hands-off benchmarks of the Snapdragon X Elite</a> appeared to bear that out. But Intel hadn&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2169875/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-ai-pc-era.html">launched its Meteor Lake architecture</a> y

<p>&ldquo;The best charger is the one that shipped with your laptop&rdquo; is old advice that needs updating because there are often superior options available either as your principal laptop charger, as a spare, or as a flexible travel charger.</p>



<p>You know that the charger that came with your laptop will work, but it won&rsquo;t do much else and there are third-party USB-C chargers available that do much more.</p>



<p>Some laptops still ship with their own cumbersome AC power brick and barrel-shaped DC connector, but most premium laptops today also or solely charge via USB-C&mdash;including all the models in our roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">the best laptops</a>.</p>

<p>As someone who regularly games on a desktop PC, I can testify that a gaming monitor is an absolute must. Sure, you <em>can</em> game on an office monitor, but everything feels so much <em>smoother</em> when you can really crank up frame rates. Today, you can snag one without breaking the bank: Amazon is selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Q7P8VHN&amp;xcust=2-1-2285058-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Samsung Odyssey G32A for $129.99</a>, which is 35 percent off of the original $199.99 price. This monitor has a refresh rate of 165Hz, which means gameplay should be lusciously smooth. You don&rsquo;t want your game stuttering on you in the middle of an important match.</p>

<p>Until about 15 years ago, the term &ldquo;laptop&rdquo; meant one thing: a portable PC that unfolds to reveal a screen on one half and a keyboard on the other.</p>



<p>But with the launch of Apple&rsquo;s iPad in 2010, PC vendors&rsquo; subsequent push into touchscreen designs, and the continued maturation of the PC market, the definition of &ldquo;laptop&rdquo; has broadened. Choosing a laptop isn&rsquo;t just about tech specs and build quality. It&rsquo;s now about the fundamental shape of the thing.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s try to break it all down with a taxonomy for every kind of laptop you can buy today.</p>
