Just when you thought it was confined to oblivion, Gigantic has somehow returned, bringing its brand of MOBA-meets-third-person-shooter to a new generation. Ultimately, however, the already-established fan base will love it the most.

The gameplay loop of gathering Power Orbs and assailing Guardians remains, while the cast is as quirky as ever. Gigantic: Rampage Edition adds new maps. Rush mode is also new, providing fast-paced action while streamlining the upgrade and summoning process.

It would be all well and good, but Gigantic suffers from various issues, whether it's balance, excessive crowd-control, lackluster combat feel or the lack of quality-of-life features. With a minimal player base, it may be worth diving in for newcomers looking for something different, but the Rampage Edition is more of a gift for the hardcore.
