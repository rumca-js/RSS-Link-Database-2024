## Sulphate-free shampoos: 10 of the best

<p>Sulphates may give a deep lather, but you can have too much of a good thing</p><p>You know the deep lather you get when washing your hair that leaves you feeling as fresh as a Herbal Essence advert? Well, that’s down to sulphates. So why are we looking for sulphate-free shampoos, you ask? Because too much of a good thing can lead to dry, brittle and frizzy hair. <br /><br />Sulphates, aka sodium lauryl sulphate and sodium laureth sulphate, are chemical cleansing agents. When combined with the ingredients in your shampoo, they work extra hard to remove grime, product buildup and excess sebum. However, they also strip hair of natural oils, colour and chemical processes, ie, your expensive keratin blowdry. This is not to demonise sulphates. It’s all about understanding your hair texture and deciding what suits you.<br /><br />Kinky, coily, Afro hair can suffer from drying, which isn’t helped by sulphates. Those of us with sensitive scalps can’t handle the heavy chemicals without irrit

<p>A city of welly-wearers, Birmingham has more allotments than any other UK local authority – some of its keen plotholders tell us why</p><p>On Dads Lane, where several Birmingham suburbs meet, there is a gap in the houses, no wider than a driveway. If you didn’t know what was hiding in there, you would walk straight past. It is a brisk, bright Sunday in late March, and behind the gate, a narrow road stretches out into a busy haven of growth and greenery. The city centre is less than four miles away, but it might as well be on the moon. After a long, wet winter, the sun is out, people are digging, mowing and cutting, and everyone has something to say about the badgers.</p><p>“Men’s piss!” I’m having coffee in the pavilion with John Beynon, a warm, 71-year-old Welshman, who has been chair of the allotments since last summer (“I’m not a president! That makes me think I’m a Trumpian!”), and secretary Bryan Foster, 60, who opens his jacket to reveal a COR-BYN T-shirt, in the Run-DMC font
