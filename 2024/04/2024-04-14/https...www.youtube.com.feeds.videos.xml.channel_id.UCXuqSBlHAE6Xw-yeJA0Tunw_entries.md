North Korea made a Wii clone console. North Korea has video games. I have so many questions. What are these consoles? Who made them? What games do they have? When compared to games from the rest of the world, are DPRK gamers getting titles that are Kim Jong Unique or are these games just same same but different? Do they have a game where you play as a plastic bag floating through the wind? So many questions!
