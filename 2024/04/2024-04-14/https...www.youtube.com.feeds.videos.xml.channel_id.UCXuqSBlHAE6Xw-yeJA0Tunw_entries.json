North Korea has video games. I have so many questions. What are these consoles? Who made them? What games do they have? When compared to games from the rest of the world, are DPRK gamers getting titles that are Kim Jong Unique or are these games just same same but different? Do they have a game where you play as a plastic bag floating through the wind? So many questions!\n\nDiscuss on the forum: https://linustechtips.com/topic/1566690-the-north-korean-gaming-console/\n\nConsole:\n- G80 game console: https://lmg.gg/0OwYx\nBooks:\n- A Kim Jong-Il Production: The Extraordinary True Story of a Kidnapped Filmmaker, His Star Actress, and a Young Dictator's Rise to Power: https://geni.us/RXc5xpS\n- On the Art of the Cinema: April 11,1973: https://geni.us/ozAV\n\nPurchases made t", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEbaKDkzomI", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXuqSBlHAE6Xw-yeJA0Tunw", "source_obj__id": 194, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/HEbaKDkzomI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The North Korean Gaming Console", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
