<p>This thoroughly sweet look at the grime artist and TV chef making a pilgrimage is that rarest of things – an intimate profile of being male and Muslim</p><p>There’s no one way to be a religious person. For some, it’s all about a deeply personal connection between you and God. For others, its value comes from how it places you within a larger community of like-minded believers. Either can bring comfort and meaning to a person’s life, and in the case of the grime musician and award-winning TV chef Big Zuu, he is fortified by both as he makes a pilgrimage to Mecca.</p><p>Big Zuu is a thoughtful and charming host who is able to find the heart and humour in even the most typically solemn moments. This hour-long BBC documentary follows him through Ramadan, where he is giving up his “sinful” ways – even as a committed Muslim, he loves the ladies, a bit of hash and the odd tipple. Despite being “westernised” and not the most pious of believers, he decides to go on the umrah pilgrimage to M

<p>The Green party politician offers ways in which we might express an English identity that would lead to a more inclusive and progressive land</p><p>After a 14-year stretch as a one-woman parliamentary party, Green MP Caroline Lucas will stand down from the House of Commons at the next general election. This book, as parting shot, may be a surprise to some: it’s an appeal to her fellow progressives to speak up for England. An England, she worries, that too many of them fear and see in terms of a rising English consciousness, belonging to the right, something they don’t feel part of – “as if the flag of St George is little better than the hammer and sickle or the swastika” – and so seek to keep it tamed and suppressed within a broader Britishness.</p><p>Lucas feels that this is wrong: a view that was the result of a journey that began with losing the Brexit referendum and leaving her liberal, cosmopolitan Brighton constituency to talk to those on the other side.

But such sentiments come to die in England, where decision-making is concentrated in Whitehall ministries.

<p>Conceding early and failing to take chances have been recurring themes and were on show in defeat to Crystal Palace </p><p>A corner, nine minutes after half-time. A clutch of players jump together. The ball drops eight yards out. Darwin Núñez pivots. All he has to do is keep it low. All he has to do is get it on target. He does keep it low, he does get it on target. But the ball hits the right knee of Dean Henderson, the Crystal Palace goalkeeper, and bounces wide for a corner. Was that the moment the title was lost?</p><p>It wasn’t, of course, in part because no season ever truly comes down to just one moment – and Liverpool anyway could yet come back. Even after that chance, in this game, there were other glorious opportunities that dribbled away. Diogo Jota hit Nathaniel Clyne with the goal otherwise open. Curtis Jones, sent through one on one, sliced wide. Harvey Elliott had a header saved. Mohamed Salah had an effort blocked by Tyrick Mitchell.</p> <a href="https://www.theguar

<p>The immediate reaction to the final whistle painted the picture of a truly damaging week for Liverpool. Jürgen Klopp hugged a victorious Crystal Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, before puffing out his cheeks and shaking his head. Andy Robertson sank to his haunches and stared into the middle distance disconsolately. Liverpool fans filed out without a sound. Their team has faltered badly in the title race.</p><p>Soundly beaten in the first leg of the Europa League quarter-finals by Atalanta on Thursday, Liverpool succumbed again on home soil as Eberechi Eze’s early goal gave Palace a deserved victory and huge lift in their bid to pull clear of relegation trouble. They may just have holed Liverpool’s Premier League title prospects in the process. Klopp’s team have lost two successive home games for the first time since the Covid season of 2020-21 and only have themselves to blame after another lacklustre display.

<p><strong>Almeida, London</strong><br />Five American friends gather to catch up in Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ new play. It’s a portrait of midlife malaise, but also a subtle meditation on post-Covid life </p><p>A group of former high-schoolers meet, 20 years on, to reminisce and reconnect – or that’s the idea, anyway. Instead they end up drinking, fighting and ruing the disappointments of their middle-aged lives. What looks like a typical American reunion drama is – finally! – a thoughtful post-pandemic play by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins.</p><p>Big politics beyond the losses of Covid – America’s part in recent wars, 9/11, the storming of the Capitol, gun crime – are embroidered into the personality contests and back-stories to explore memory, millennial malaise and modern American history under the shadow of death. A US flag hangs on one side of the porch on which this pre-reunion (before the bigger party) takes place and it looks like a subtle accusation of unquestioned nationalism rather

<p>A pregnancy leads to the unearthing of a mother and daughter’s secrets and struggles in this skilful debut novel</p><p>When Nell, a chef, agrees to try for a baby with her partner, Adrienne, a stylist for celebrity food bloggers, she anticipates failed IVF cycles and a financial and emotional toll that will soon nix the plan. Instead, Adrienne conceives after two rounds, and Nell, terrified of looming parenthood, is pitched into a reluctant reckoning with the ghosts of her teenage years in turn-of-the-millennium Ireland. A cult-like Catholic youth movement, denial of her own sexuality, teen pregnancy – all play their part, and yet even this is not the full story.</p><p>Having already caught the attention of prize juries with her short fiction, Niamh Mulvey delivers a questing first novel of significant prowess. Its title refers to the fraught changes to Ireland’s abortion legislation and its impact on women’s lives, her exploration of which is deepened by a second narrative strand:

<p>Anonymous street artist Foka Wolf uses the language of advertising to highlight political and social issues, from the PPE crisis to food banks. “I grew up in a low income, single-parent household,” he says, “so I take it very fucking personally when people in power try and demonise those who are broke and voiceless.” Known as the Birmingham Banksy (“I prefer Poundland Banksy”), Wolf has fooled countless people with his fake billboards. “There’s a lot of power in putting words on paper. One poster was offering students money to grow 23 pairs of ears on their back and quite a few people were up for it.” During tough political times, does it get harder to make satire? “Easier. More dickheads – more targets.” </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2024/apr/14/fake-billboards-politics-art-foka-wolf-birmingham-poundland-banksy-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The austerity-hit council's decision to stop funding the arts is a calamity for a city whose rich contribution to the UK – from the Rep, the Royal Ballet and Tolkien to heavy metal and the Streets – is such a vital source of civic pride</p><p>The Birmingham Rep altered the course of Britain’s cultural history. Opened in 1913 by the dramatist Billie Lester, the company’s ambition to champion formally innovative work and new writing attracted the likes of Laurence Olivier, who joined in 1926. The Rep hosted British premieres of works by Anton Chekhov and Leo Tolstoy. The current theatre building is one of Birmingham’s finest examples of mid-century architecture – designed and built in 1971 by Graham Winteringham, its glossy, futuristic front conceals an interior that still carries the excitement of an airport departure lounge in the early days of flight. But today, the fate of the building and its activity hangs in the balance. Closure is possible, with funding from local government

But freedom is not just a place, it’s a state of mind. And Iman finds it increasingly difficult to reconcile the two conflicting truths of his identity: that he is a husband and a father, and that he is a gay man. Unmoored by the uncertainties of the asylum process, Iman seeks out the one thing he knows: he starts to train with a Swedish wrestling team, bouts that Alami films with a tight, kinetic camera, giving the sequences an abstract, erotic intimacy.</p> <a href=

She cheers on command, sticking her impossibly edible little arms in the air and saying ‘Yaaaaaay!’ for no reason science can discern. She is wonderful.</p><p>She is still moody and a drama queen. She registers her discontent with the world – and this, several times each day – by theatrically hanging her head in front of her body in the manner of Charlie Brown, before slowly, sadly walking around us as if on a one-person parade of hurt feelings.

As tracer fire whiplashes across the sky and the suburbs smoulder, a secessionist rebel faction known as the Western Front is drawing ever closer to Washington DC. Meanwhile, the president (Nick Offerman), barricaded in the White House, tries out the emphasis of his words as he rehearses for his latest televised address. He promises that the defeat of the rebels is imminent, adding: “Some are already calling it the greatest victory in the history of mankind.” There’s a whiff of Trumpian rhetoric here, but this is the only hint of real-world US politics in British writer-director Alex Garland’s searing dystopian war movie.

Last August, Williams <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CwmiJ8xqobV/">posted a painting</a> of a small, saintly looking child (not him), and captioned it with an account of how he had once made the mistake of reading the comments below a Mail Online piece. “It was hellish,” he wrote. “The person (me) they were describing was the most horrendous person that ever walked the planet. I was crestfallen.” At this point, Williams thought the best plan would be to read some comments about people who “are good, salt-of-the-earth folk”. So he looked up a piece about Ant and Dec. “Surely to God no one can hate Ant and Dec,” he thought to himself. But no. “The second comment said: ‘I hate these two almost as much as I hate that fat c*** Robbie Williams.’”</p><p>Among those who replied to his post were
