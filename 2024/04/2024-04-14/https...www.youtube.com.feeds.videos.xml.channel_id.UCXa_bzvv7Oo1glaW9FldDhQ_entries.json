Ultimately, however, the already-established fan base will love it the most.\n\nThe gameplay loop of gathering Power Orbs and assailing Guardians remains, while the cast is as quirky as ever.

With a minimal player base, it may be worth diving in for newcomers looking for something different, but the Rampage Edition is more of a gift for the hardcore.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3i24JBc9h4", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/i3i24JBc9h4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Gigantic: Rampage Edition Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-14T13:30:11+00:00", "description": "Sony\u2019s PlayStation 2 was an immensely popular console that completely dominated the sixth generation with well over 100 million units sold and production lasting up until the PS4 came out. \n\nWith such a huge install base, it's only natural that the PS2 was home to some of the best games that defined a generation.
