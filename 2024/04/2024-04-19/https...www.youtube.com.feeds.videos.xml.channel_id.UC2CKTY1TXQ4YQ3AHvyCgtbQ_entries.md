I had to make this video before I left - and it didn't exactly come out how I wanted.

Vince Venturella and I made a "zine! Check out SNARL at http://www.snarlingbadger.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
