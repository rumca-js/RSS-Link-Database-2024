This website accidentally turned into a joke, and then accidentally turned into something quite dark.


"RentAHitman.com is a satirical website purporting to offer contract killers for hire. The site's domain was bought by Bob Innes in 2005 as a potential site for an information technology company to be set up with his friends (playing on the use of the word "hit" as a check on a website's security or the count of web traffic). The company was never started but Innes retained the site. Upon checking the site's email inbox in 2008, he found hundreds of messages requesting contract killing services, but he considered none to be serious. When checking again in 2010, however, he found a serious request from a woman in Canada. He passed her details to the police, and she was convicted for soliciting murder.
