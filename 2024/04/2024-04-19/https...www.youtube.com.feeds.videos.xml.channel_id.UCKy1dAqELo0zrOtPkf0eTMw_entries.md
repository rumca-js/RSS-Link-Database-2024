In today's Daily Fix:
Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was released just two months ago, but there are signs that the game is falling short of sales expectations. The game's sales are slow compared to its predecessor Final Fantasy 7 Remake, and last summer's Final Fantasy 16. It also doesn't help that the game is a PS5 exclusive (there are fewer PS5's currently sold than PS4's), and it costs $10 more than FF7 Remake did back in 2020. In other news, a new patch is coming for Dragon's Dogma 2 that will bring some much-needed fixes, like one pertaining to the dragonsplague illness. And finally, Helldivers are really good at committing genocide, completing an order to kill 2 billion Terminids in less than a week (they did it in under 24 hours).

Take another look at Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes in this TV spot for the upcoming action-adventure movie starring Freya Allan, William H. Macy, Dichen Lachman, Kevin Durand, Owen Teague, Peter Macon, and Travis Jeffery.

Director Wes Ball breathes new life into the global, epic franchise set several generations in the future following Caesar’s reign. Apes are the dominant species living harmoniously with one another and humans have been reduced to living in the shadows. As a new tyrannical ape leader builds his empire, one young ape will undertake a harrowing journey that will cause him to question all that he has known about the past and to make choices that will define a future for apes and humans alike.

The film is written by Josh Friedman (“War of the Worlds”), based on characters created by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver (“Avatar: The Way of Water”), and the producers are Wes Ball, Joe Hartwick, Jr., p.g.a. (“The Maze Runner”), Rick Jaffa, p.g.a., Amanda Silver, p.g.a., Jason

In today's Fix of entertainment news:
Captain America: Brave New World won't be out for another year, but it seems somebody forgot to tell McDonald's, who are prepping a sit of toys to promote the movie. A leaked image of the toys found its way to Reddit, and it very clearly shows the Red Hulk, aka Thunderbolt Ross. Ross will be played by Harrison Ford in the upcoming movie, but Marvel has not cofirmed the inclusion of Red Hulk. In other news, Prime Video has renewed Fallout for a second season. The show, based on the game series by Bethesda, was released just last week and has already proven a hit with fans and critics. And finally, Sony may be acquiring Paramount, as the company is reportedly in talks with a group of investors looking to buy Paramount and its subsidiaries.

## The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare Review

The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare reviewed by Matt Donato.
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is a solid Guy Ritchie take on World War II that tells an incredible, sort-of-true story as only this specific British filmmaker can. Henry Cavill leads his band of merry misbehavers to war against any Nazi in eyesight, blending spy game thrills with safeties-off action sequences. The overall pacing stumbles slightly between Gus’ antics and supporting character focus shifts, and storytelling can be reductively familiar at times, but neither torpedoes that production. It’s fine that Ministry exists almost entirely to dance on Nazi graves — more movies should. You typically know what you’re getting from a Ritchie movie, and that’s never a problem with this ungentlemanly delight. Whenever momentum dips, Alan Ritchson shows up and aggressively murders a Nazi — you’ll be just fine.

An exclusive extended trailer of director Ido Mizrahy's riveting and thought-provoking documentary on NASA’s mission to Mars and the psychological challenges that come with space exploration, Space: The Longest Goodbye, which is now available on PBS Passport and debuts Monday, May 6th on PBS's Independent Lens (check your local listings), PBS App, and accessible via PBS's flagship YouTube channel. In the next decade, NASA intends to send astronauts to Mars for the first time. To succeed, crew members must overcome unprecedented life-threatening challenges. And while many of these hazards are physical, the most elusive are psychological. 

Throughout their three-year absence, crew members won’t be able to communicate with Earth in real-time due to the immense distance. The psychological impact of this level of disconnectedness and isolation—both from mission control and loved ones—is impossible to predict, endangering the mission itself. Directed to mitigate this threat is Dr. Al Holla

Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch. This week Daemon is joined by the usual crew of Ryan McCaffrey from Podcast Unlocked, and Max Scoville from Beyond, IGN's PlayStation podcast. The topic: if the rumors are true, Sony and Microsoft have very different strategies for how to handle the mid-gen phase of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. One is likely to do a 'pro' upgrade, and the other is looking into the handheld market. How did the two sides get to where they are, and will those strategies work?

Rebel Moon Part Two: The Scargiver is now streaming on Netflix. Reviewed by Hanna Ines Flint, narration by Max Scoville.

Ed Skrein's antagonist performance stands out amid a sea of uninspired filler in Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver. Zack Snyder's unsatisfying conclusion to his bombastic space opera is filled with flimsy character studies, exposition overload, and largely half-baked action sequences that rarely live up to the sci-fi classics it emulates. This finale is the cinematic equivalent of finishing a second-hand jigsaw puzzle only to find several pieces missing.
