<p>Microsoft said Friday that it will begin to roll out a handy summary of your account settings within the Windows 11 Start menu &mdash; but that also it will be pushing an ad for the Xbox Game Pass on the Start page.</p>



<p>Microsoft released <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/04/19/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22635-3500-beta-channel/&amp;xcust=2-1-2310013-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22635.3500 (KB5036985)</a> to the Beta Channel on Friday. That&rsquo;s a signal that these features will probably arrive on your PC before long.

<p>German-born Roccat might not be among the biggest names when it comes to PC accessories, but the company is notable enough to get dedicated display space on shelves in stores like Best Buy and Walmart. Well, it was: this week its corporate parent decided that it needed to cull the brood. Roccat as a brand is no more, and its existing product lines are being incorporated into Turtle Beach.</p>



<p>Turtle Beach is an American company that bought Roccat back in 2019. Generally the parent company has been known for gaming headsets for the last decade or so, especially those focused on the console market. Going forward all Roccat gear will be branded under the Turtle Beach name, with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1997409/roccat-vulcan-ii-keyboard-review.html">existing lines like the Vulcan keyboards</a> keeping their names. </p>

<p>By now you&rsquo;re probably on high alert every time you get an actual phone call from someone you don&rsquo;t know. If it isn&rsquo;t the usual &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been trying to contact you about your car&rsquo;s extended warranty&rdquo; recording, then it&rsquo;s probably someone from &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; trying to get you to install a remote access program. If they mix it up a bit and tell you they&rsquo;re from LastPass, yeah, it&rsquo;s the same old BS.</p>

<p>Life online can differ wildly from the real world&mdash;especially when security is involved. It&rsquo;s not likely someone will break into your home if you lose your house keys. But leaked login info? That puts a target on your back. Case in point: Last week, Roku disclosed a whopping 576,000 users were victims of a credential stuffing attack, far exceeding the original 15,000 accounts first reported in mid-March.</p>



<p>Credential stuffing involves plugging in usernames and passwords taken from data leaks and breaches into various websites.

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a big, spacious monitor on the cheap, and you don&rsquo;t particularly demand lightning-fast performance for gaming, then this LG closeout is right up your alley. The company is offering a 34-inch ultrawide with a color-accurate IPS panel <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34wq60c-b-ultrawide-monitor&amp;xcust=2-1-2309505-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">for just $249.99</a>, which is half off its original $500 price. </p>



<p>The LG 34WQ60C-B ultrawide offers 3440&times;1440 resolution, a pretty huge array of pixels that&rsquo;s basically a 27-inch QHD panel stretched out to the ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio. The gently-curved IPS panel is exactly the kind that I look for to ensure color accuracy when I&rsquo;m editing in Photoshop. And with a b

Yes, it sports the traditional ThinkPad keyboard with the signature red TrackPoint in the middle, but it also weighs under three pounds and comes with enough ports that you can leave your heavy adapter at home, making this laptop a killer all-around travel companion.  </p>

<p>Consider this hypothetical scenario: You&rsquo;re upgrading your gaming rig and you&rsquo;re second-guessing the hardware you&rsquo;ve chosen.</p>



<p>In fact, you&rsquo;re so fed up with the performance of your old hardware you feel an overwhelming urge to just splurge on the most expensive hardware you can possibly find to totally max out your specs &mdash; 4K curved gaming monitor, Intel Core i9-14900KS with a whopping 6.2GHz max boost &mdash; whatever it takes.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s just one problem: The new price makes your stomach squirm &mdash; A LOT. Sound familiar?</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a scenario that every gamer faces from time to time, myself included. It&rsquo;s just that, the performance of my gaming hardware is probably the single most important factor in determining whether I shine on the leaderboards or just crash and burn on the dregs list.</
