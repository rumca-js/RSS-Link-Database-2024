You just give it the directory you want to access through your browser and it serves the contents over HTTP.</p> <p>The idea was to have something like nginx autoindex for my selfhosting needs, but with a nicer UI. It offers support for navigation, file download and is also mobile friendly. It has a couple of additional features like basic syntax highlighting and in-browser media preview (see screnshots).</p> <p>There is a Dockerfile included so it's really easy to get up and running with it.
