The prizes were handed out during an event at Amazon\u2019s Prime Air drone delivery facility in Seattle on Wednesday. The high school students were there under the guise of needing a final interview for their scholarship applications. The winners represent the Bellevue School District, Lake Washington School District, Seattle Public Schools, Sumner-Bonney Lake School District, and University Place School District, and include: Students receive up&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazon-surprises-13-seattle-area-students-with-future-engineer-college-scholarsh", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazon-surprises-13-seattle-area-students-with-future-engineer-college-scholarships", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Amazon surprises 13 Seattle-area students with \u2018Future Engineer\u2019 college scholarships", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-19T16:10:27+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"567\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-and-biotech-panel-2-1-1260x567.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />The culture of collaboration in the Pacific Northwest, the impact of AI on biopharma, and the shape of new business models driven by AI were all topics at a panel discussion Wednesday in Seattle at the 2024 Life Science Innovation Northwest meeting. \u201cThe Pacific Northwest has the compute, it has the biotech, but it also has a kind of culture of collaboration and sharing that is not present in certain other parts of the country,\u201d said Lynda Stuart, executive director of the Institute for Protein Design (IPD) at the University of Washington. \u201cA regional hub is a very natural thing&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ai-is-boosting-drug-discovery-and-development-and-sparking-questions-about-proprietary-data/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ai-is-boosting-drug-discovery-and-development-and-sparking-questions-about-proprietary-data", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "AI is boosting drug discovery and development \u2014 and sparking questions about proprietary data", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-19T15:07:16+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Burkhard-Englert-600.jpg\" width=\"600\" /><br />Seattle University named Dr. Burkhard Englert as the new Department Chair and Amazon Endowed Chair of Computer Science.

His research has focused on cybersecurity, machine learning, distributed computing, distributed algorithms, and transportation network modeling and optimization. Englert also held leadership roles at California State University Long Beach and the University of Northern Colorado. He starts at Seattle U on July 1.
