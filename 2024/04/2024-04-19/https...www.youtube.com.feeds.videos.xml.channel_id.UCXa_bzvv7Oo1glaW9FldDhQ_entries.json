While newcomers discover what makes these titles so compelling, it's interesting for long-time players to look back on some of them, specifically Fallout 4.\n\nAnnounced in June 2015 and launched just a few months later, Fallout 4 received extensive buzz as Bethesda's next big thing after The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim. It created headlines due to its settlement building, brand new setting and story, improved gunplay, revamped dialogue system and many other features. When it finally launched, it was a critical and commercial success.\n\nHowever, opinions among players would quickly become divided.
