The Prince of Egypt was supposed to be a giant leap forward in the medium of animation.  Pushing away from Disney's family friendly tone and musical numbers, The Prince of Egypt was made with an older audience in mind while also pushing the boundaries of what we thought an animated feature film could look like.  Unfortunately for Dreamworks, the movie did not do well at the box office.  But in turn it did push the animation industry, Disney included, in new directions with what the Prince of Egypt was able to achieve on screen.
