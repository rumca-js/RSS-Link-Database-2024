Previously Ruff used a parser borrowed from RustPython, generated using the LALRPOP parser generator. Victor Hugo Gomes contributed a new parser written from scratch, which provided a 2x speedup and also added error recovery, allowing parsing of invalid Python - super-useful for a linter.</p>\n\n<p>I tried Ruff 0.4.0 just now against Datasette - a reasonably large Python project - and it ran in less than 1/10th of a second.
