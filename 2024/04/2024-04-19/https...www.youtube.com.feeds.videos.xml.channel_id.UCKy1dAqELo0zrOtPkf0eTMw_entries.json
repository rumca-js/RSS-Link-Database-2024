The game's sales are slow compared to its predecessor Final Fantasy 7 Remake, and last summer's Final Fantasy 16. It also doesn't help that the game is a PS5 exclusive (there are fewer PS5's currently sold than PS4's), and it costs $10 more than FF7 Remake did back in 2020. In other news, a new patch is coming for Dragon's Dogma 2 that will bring some much-needed fixes, like one pertaining to the dragonsplague illness. And finally, Helldivers are really good at committing genocide, completing an order to kill 2 billion Terminids in less than a week (they did it in under 24 hours).\n\n#IGN #Gaming", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I58aBMdSkpE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/I58aBMdSkpE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Struggling or Not? - IGN Daily Fix", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-19T22:00:16+00:00", "description": "Take another look at Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes in this TV spot for the upcoming action-adventure movie starring Freya Allan, William H.
