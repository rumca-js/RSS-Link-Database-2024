Despite her success, Steele's perspectives on the escalating racial tensions within sports sparked significant controversy and criticism from progressive circles, leading to her eventual departure from ESPN. In our conversation, we explore how Steele's upbringing instilled in her a strong work ethic, independence, and a deep appreciation for her mixed-race heritage. She shares both the highs and lows of her career in broadcasting, and discusses the resilience she's found after her departure and her outlook for the future. Join us for an enlightening conversation that delves into the realities of public scrutiny and cancellation.\n\n- - -\u00a0\n\nToday\u2019s Sponsors:\n\nTommy John - Get 20% OFF your first order: https://tommyjohn.com/BEN\n\nBalance of Nature - Get 35% off Your Orde", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5DpSwvNrLA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCnQC_G5Xsjhp9fEJKuIcrSw", "source_obj__id": 35, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/y5DpSwvNrLA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "When Sports Go Woke | Sage Steele", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-19T21:04:41+00:00", "description": "Beam - Get 40% off for a limited time! http://www.ShopBeam.com/BEN \n\nBambee - Visit https://www.bambee.com/ and type in \u2018Ben Shapiro\u2019 when you sign up. \n\nTaylor Swift's new album entitled \"THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT\" is here, and people are really excited.
