That\u2019s what I want to find out with this review of NordVPN, so I\u2019ll focus on pros & cons \u2013 and talk about things people tend to leave out.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\ud83d\udd0e Is NordVPN safe?\n\nI found a strict no-logs policy, meaning they\u2019re legally bound to NOT monitor, collect, or share user data. Yet the actual PRO point here is the fact that NordVPN heavily enforces this promise. For one, they keep putting it through independent third-party audits, and got it confirmed 4 times already. Two \u2013 NordVPN uses RAM servers. Once such a server is restarted, all data is completely wiped. So NordVPN simply doesn\u2019t have the means to collect sensitive information. \n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBYdKjgeMRo", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCCsREoj8rSRkEvxWqxr74rQ", "source_obj__id": 433, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/vBYdKjgeMRo/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "NordVPN PROs & CONs | HONEST NordVPN REVIEW", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-19T14:50:30+00:00", "description": "In this video, we're bringing you the biggest cybersecurity news.\n\ud83e\udd77 Secure your online activities - Check out a VPN with the best discount - https://cnews.link/get-nordvpn/X7Ti7l9i3wk/\n\n\ud83e\udda0 Protect yourself from malware - Grab an EXCLUSIVE Antivirus deal - https://cnews.link/get-totalav/X7Ti7l9i3wk/\n\n\ud83d\udd11 Protect YOUR accounts - Get THE BEST password manager offer - https://cnews.link/get-nordpass/X7Ti7l9i3wk/\n\n\ud83d\udcf0  Wondering what's been happening in the world of cybersecurity?
