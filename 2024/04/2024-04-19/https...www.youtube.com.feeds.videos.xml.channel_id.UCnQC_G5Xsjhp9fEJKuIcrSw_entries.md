Sage Steele, a former ESPN broadcaster, climbed the ladder in the traditionally male-dominated field of sports broadcasting and established herself as one of the most prominent and effective voices in sports entertainment. Despite her success, Steele's perspectives on the escalating racial tensions within sports sparked significant controversy and criticism from progressive circles, leading to her eventual departure from ESPN. In our conversation, we explore how Steele's upbringing instilled in her a strong work ethic, independence, and a deep appreciation for her mixed-race heritage. She shares both the highs and lows of her career in broadcasting, and discusses the resilience she's found after her departure and her outlook for the future. Join us for an enlightening conversation that delves into the realities of public scrutiny and cancellation.
