Apparently, the TikTok ban bill is back.

The article suggested that getting rid of Section 230 “could save everything.” Yet the [&#8230;]

In the United States, we&#8217;ve seen several arrests and prosecutions of journalists and citizens for daring to record public officials performing their public duties.
