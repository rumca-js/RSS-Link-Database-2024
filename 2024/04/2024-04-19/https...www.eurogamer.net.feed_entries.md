As the calendar continues its ceaseless onward march, Epic has announced its next batch of weekly Epic Games Store freebies, which this time look very much like Cold War shooter Industria and post-apocalyptic RPG bundle Lisa: Definitive Edition.
</p><p>
Both games are free to add to your Epic Games Store library starting Thursday, 25th April, and if you need a nudge toward the 'download' button, here's what you can expect from each:
</p><p>
Industria, coming from developer Bleakmill, describes itself as an atmospheric first-person shooter set in Cold War-era East Berlin. "Unravel the secrets of a mysterious parallel dimension while searching for a missing colleague," goes the official blurb. "Explore a haunting reality where the truth awaits. Discover the dark past that lies beyond."

Telltale Games' long-in-the-works The Wolf Among Us 2 has resurfaced with new screenshots following last year's delay, with the studio saying it's "been heads down" on the project.
</p><p>
The Wolf Among Us 2 - again set in the world of Bill Willingham's Fables comics - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/telltale-announces-the-wolf-among-us-season-two-days-after-telling-fans-not-to-get-hopes-up">originally announced back in 2017</a>, but development halted when Telltale Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-walking-dead-developer-telltale-games-reportedly-lays-off-the-majority-of-its-staff">shut its doors</a> the following year.

If you've been eager to watch the animated Ark: Survival Evolved TV series, but your attempts have so far been thwarted by your failure to live in the US or Canada, there's some good news: it's now officially available in 11 other countries, including the UK, via Paramount+.
</p><p>
Ark: The Animated Series follows the adventures of 21st century palaeontologist Helena Walker after she finds herself resurrected on a mysterious island populated by prehistoric beasts. "She must learn to survive with new allies from throughout time," explains the official blurb, "while trying to uncover the true nature of their strange new world."
</p><p>
Ark's animated series has somehow managed to secure itself an impressive cast (presumably that 'somehow' is 'several extremely large buckets of money'), with the likes of Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh, Rus

## Mario Kart 8 has 703,560 customisation possibilities, but which racer is statistically best?

Everyone has their favourite Mario Kart character to play as, but is there really a best option? A choice which will actually give you an edge to beat your rivals - to go just a little bit faster, or recover that little bit quicker?
</p><p>
Well, yes - some characters are mathmatically better than others. This is even true when you factor in the many different kart pieces - bodies, wheels and gliders - which you can mix and match to tweak your overall racer stat. So how do you pick? 
</p><p>
According to a <a href="https://www.mayerowitz.io/blog/mario-meets-pareto">fasincating and beautifully put together piece of research</a> by data scientist Antoine Mayerowitz, there are 703,560 different build options to choose from when you cater to all the different characters and kart pieces. But many of these are carbon copies of each other

Kena: Bridge of Spirits, the gorgeous action-adventure from developer Ember Lab, looks to be making the leap to Xbox Series X/S, according to a newly spotted rating on the ESRB website.
</p><p>
Kena: Bridge of Spirits initially launched in 2021 amid various timed exclusivity agreements: Sony snapped it up for PS5 and PS4, while the Epic Games Store snagged exclusivity on PC. Kena released on Steam the following year, but an Xbox version is yet to be seen.
</p><p>
While no official announcement has been made by Ember Lab pointing to Kena's imminent arrival on Microsoft's platform, a newly discovered <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39774/kena-bridge-of-spirits-deluxe-edition/">Xbox Series X/S classification</a> by the US Entertainment Software Rating Board (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/kena-bridge-of-

In my humble opinion - or not so humble if you know me well enough - the Fallout series on Amazon Prime has struck an admirable balance between satire, absurdity, and ultra violence that epitomises its wasteland. Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus are the three archetypes of the characters you'll find in Fallout: the vault dweller, wasteland wanderer, and Brotherhood of Steel follower. So, if you'd rather <em>be</em> those characters rather than just meet them in your adventures, I am here. I've put together a character build for Lucy, the Ghoul, and Maximus so you can recreate the chaos of Amazon's Fallout in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-has-more-than-doubled-its-player-counts-on-steam">Fallout 4</a>. 
</p><p>
Please forgive my very poor excuses for these character's lookalikes in the character creator, as it leaves a lot to

## Helldivers 2 must balance bug fixing and new content to stay relevant, developer says

Arrowhead has a steady line it needs to walk with Helldivers 2. The developer needs to ensure it both fixes any bugs (not Terminids, the glitchy kind) while also adding new featurs and content to the game in order to "stay relevant".
</p><p>
That's coming from Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt, who replied to a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1c6bbyd/comment/l01uq2c/">reddit</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-ceo-says-arrowhead-must-fix-the-game-and-add-to-it-at-the-same-time-to-stay-relevant">IGN</a>) saying the "competitiveness of this industry" meant the team had to ensure it did both to ensure the longevity of its game.

Prison Architect 2 has been delayed once again. The upcoming jail sim sequel will now arrive this autumn, following the discovery of "unexpected issues occurring too often". 
</p><p>
Originally due to arrive in March this year, and then later pushed back to May, Prison Architect 2 will now arrive on 3rd September. 
</p><p>
The game's publisher Paradox Interactive said in a statement today it had noted issues related to memory usage were impacting the stability of the game. Despite having a version of Prison Architect 2 ready to go on all platforms, it has opted to delay the game now to ensure it arrives in the best possible state.

Capcom will release a new update for Dragon's Dogma 2 which will make some changes to Dragonsplague and adjust some Pawn behaviours, making them less prone to falling off the side of cliffs in the process.
</p><p>
First off, let's talk about Dragonsplague, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-dragonsplague-how-to-get-cure-9422">affliction that can consume Pawns, resulting in some pretty devastating consequences</a>. Capcom said its next patch will reduce the infection frequency of Dragonsplague, and also make it easier to spot. 
</p><p>
"For example, when infected, glowing eyes will be more noticeable," the developer explained.

Netflix will no longer publicly share its subscriber numbers, the streaming giant has announced, as it reaps the rewards of its recent password-sharing crackdown. 
</p><p>
In a business update, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said the move was due to the ongoing evolution of its business model to incorporate revenue from advertising and from subscribers who now have to pay extra to add-on access for friends and family outside their primary household. 
</p><p>
This meant that deriving Netflix's success purely from subscriber figures was now "historical" maths, Peters said.

No Rest For the Wicked launched in early access yesterday, but has unfortunately hit a few bumps on its debut. 
</p><p>
The Diablo-like game from Ori and the Blind Forest developer Moon Studios currently holds a mixed review average on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1371980/reviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_">Steam</a>, with the top comment stating that while there are definitely the bones of a good release here, its developer "still needs to cook". 
</p><p>
"I want to like this, but the performance is just not in a good enough place for me to recommend it right now," one player wrote, while another adds: "Wait till further development/release if you have any self control."

The upcoming Donkey Kong Country-themed expansion to Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Japan has been struck by a delay.

The huge new area, themed around Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, will now be fully bolted-on to the existing Mushroom Kingdom park in "late 2024", Universal Studios said today. 
</p><p>
That's a delay of around six months, as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-expansion-for-super-nintendo-world-opens-in-spring-2024">Donkey Kong area was previously set to open sometime this spring</a>. Readjust your holiday plans appropriately!

PlayStation maker Sony is considering a purchase of movie studio giant Paramount, according to reports. 
</p><p>
Both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/business/paramount-sony-apollo-bid.html">The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-18/sony-is-said-in-talks-with-apollo-on-a-joint-offer-for-paramount">Bloomberg</a> report that Sony is interested in an offer for Paramount, which itself owns MTV, CBS and Nickelodeon, and operates streaming service Paramount+.</p><p>Sony, of course, already has its own vast film and television empire, and has bought other movie studios before - most notably Colombia Pictures, home to Spider-Man and Ghostbusters. It's interesting to look at Paramount's franchises in that light, and imagine how PlayStation could elevate one of those in a similar way to how it

While Manor Lords may at first glance seem similar to the Total War series, its developer has said the upcoming strategy game should not be seen as a competitor.

Writing on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/5850813762792298449">Steam</a>, Manor Lords developer Greg laid out a list of things the game is not. Top of this list are the very plain to see words: Manor Lords is not a Total War competitor. 
</p><p>
Rather, developer Slavic Magic said its upcoming game is a "city builder with battles".

Bethesda has been making headlines left, right and centre for its video games recently. That's right, we simply can't stop talking about...Fallout! Yes, that series hasn't had a new release in many, many years, but thanks to Amazon's hit TV adaptation, has seen a renewed interest from fans. 
</p><p>
Starfield, however, has not had the same reception despite being a more recent release and one which Bethesda proclaimed would be its next big thing. But, don't worry. Among all the noise of us falling over Fallout, the studio has finally remembered its space-based RPG actually exists.
</p><p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-fallout-interview-todd-howard-and-jonathan-nolan-answer-our-burning-questions-about-season-1">IGN</a>, Todd Howard confirmed that Bethesda is actually "doing a lot of Starfield wor

Visions of Mana, the next entry in Square Enix's Mana series, sadly won't have co-operative multiplayer.
</p><p>
1993's Secret of Mana was celebrated for allowing players to join forces against its hordes of squidgy, colourful enemies and many games in the series since have played similarly.
</p><p>
Visions of Mana, though, will be single player only due to the impact multiplayer would have on design and pacing.

Welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we've been playing over the past few days. This week: twin-stick shooters, caving, and ink.</p><p>If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We've Been Playing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/what-weve-been-playing">here's our archive</a>.</p><p>On a whim I did the Daily Challenge in Spelunky the other day. It has been years since this was a regular feature of my life. I had lots of Spelunky nerves, a reminder I hadn't played in a while: the toothy plants made me shiver, and a door in Jungle with spike traps on either side was enough to make me doubt my abilities.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-old-twin-sticks-caves-and-ink?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed

In a surprise to no one, Amazon's Fallout TV series has been officially renewed for a second season. 
</p><p>
The news was shared earlier today, with Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - who executive produce the show via Kilter Films - saying they "can't wait to blow up the world all over again".
</p><p>
"Holy shit," added showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner. "Thank you to [Nolan], Kilter, Bethesda and Amazon for having the courage to make a show that gravely tackles all of society's most serious problems these days - cannibalism, incest, jello cake."
