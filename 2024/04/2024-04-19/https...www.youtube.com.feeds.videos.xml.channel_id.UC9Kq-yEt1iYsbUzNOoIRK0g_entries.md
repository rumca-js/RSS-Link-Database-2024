Ghostbusters was a massive success in 1984, but it took more than half a decade for the world to get a second one! Why? I donâ€™t know. That information is probably available on Google. Reasons, presumably.

Ghostbusters 2 definitely raises some questions. Like did they just redo every beat of the first movie but slightly different? Is Venkman even a Ghostbuster or are we just following his love life? And most importantly, how did everyone forget that ghosts exist?!

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Ghostbusters 2!
