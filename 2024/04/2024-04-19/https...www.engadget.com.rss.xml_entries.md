<p><em>Rebel Moon: Part 2 - The Scargiver</em> is an empty feast. It's a relentless onslaught of explosions, sci-fi tropes and meaningless exposition that amounts to nothing. And yet somehow it's still better than the first film in Zack Snyder's wannabe sci-fi epic franchise for Netflix, <em>Rebel Moon: Part 1 - A Child of Fire</em>. (What do these titles really mean? Who cares.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all of the dull table-setting complete, Snyder is able to let his true talents soar in <em>Rebel Moon: Part 2</em> by delivering endless battles filled with slow-motion action and heroic poses. It looks cool, I just wish it added up to something. <em>Anything</em>.</p>

<p>It hasn't been a great week for Paradox Interactive, and things just got a little worse for the publisher.

<p>Though builds of <em>Prison Architect 2 </em>had been certified for all platforms, the developers at Double Eleven ran into some technical problems that will take some time to resolve. Some issues concerning memory usage and minimum spec configuration failures emerged. Although the team says its work on fixing those have been successful so far, some other technic

## Tesla is recalling Cybertrucks because their accelerator pedals could get stuck

<p>Tesla has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/19/tesla-cybertruck-throttle-accelerator-pedal-stuck/">issued a recall</a> for around 3,878 Cybertruck vehicles, a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2024/TESLA/CYBERTRUCK#recalls">notice</a> has revealed. Apparently, the cover of the truck's accelerator pedal could get dislodged and trapped by the interior rim. Based on videos going around showing the problem, a faulty accelerator cover could slide up due to excessive lubricant, jamming one end into a crevice while it's still also attached to the pedal itself. That means the vehicle could get stuck accelerating in full power even after the driver lifts their foot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tesla said in the notice that it will replace and repair the pedals as needed free of charge. The automaker will send notices to owners of recalled Cybertrucks in June, but affected drivers who want their vehicles to be fixed as soon as possible can also call

<p>The latest batch of rumors make it pretty clear that a PlayStation 5 Pro is coming this year, but will anyone really care about slightly better 4K graphics? This week, Engadget Senior Editor Jessica Conditt joins Cherlynn and Devindra to chat about the PS5 Pro, as well as her piece on the PlayDate two years after its release. You could say the Playdate is pretty much the opposite of another expensive high-end console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other news, we discuss the death of Boston Dynamic's hydraulic Atlas robot, and the birth of an all-new digital model. We also chat about the abrupt closure of Possibility Space, an ambitious indie game studio.</p>

## The Morning After: The bill to ban TikTok is barreling ahead.

<p>The bill that could ban TikTok in the United States inches closer to becoming law. The legislation passed the House of Representatives last month, then had to face the Senate — and opposition from a few prominent lawmakers. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok-is-barreling-ahead-230518984.html">The House is to vote on a package of bills this weekend, which includes a slightly revised version of the TikTok bill</a>. In the latest version, ByteDance would have up to 12 months to divest TikTok, instead of the six months initially pitched.</p>
<p>That change alone was apparently key to winning support from some skeptical members of the Senate, including Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee. What will happen if the bill passes into law? TikTok (and potentially other apps “controlled by a foreign adversary”) would face a ban in US app stores if it declined to sell to a new owner.</p>

<p>Amazon's live adaptation of <em>Fallout</em> was so well-received, the fourth main game in the franchise had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-currently-europes-best-selling-game-almost-a-decade-after-release">resurgence in sales</a> almost a decade after it was released. If you were ever worried about its fate despite the success it enjoyed, you can rest easy, for now: Amazon has already <a href="https://press.amazonstudios.com/us/en/press-release/ifallouti-has-a-blast-of-a-debut-amazon-mgm-studio">renewed</a> the show for a second season, mere days after the first one debuted.

<p>Regardless of if you just got your hands on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-console-140057674.html">PS5</a> or you’ve had the console for a while, chances are you had a good idea which few games you wanted to start out with. After playing those to death, maybe you’re on the hunt for the next title that will suck you into an immersive world. We can confidently say that all of the video games on our best PS5 games list do this in their own way, be they action-adventure titles, racing sims, puzzles and everything in between. As always, in building a list like this, we looked for must-play games that offer meaningful improvements over their last-gen counterparts when played on a PlayStation 5 console, or are exclusive to the system. We'll be updating this periodically, so, if a video game's just been released and you don't see it, chances are that the reason for its absence is that we haven't played through it for the first time yet. Either that or we hate it.<br /><br
