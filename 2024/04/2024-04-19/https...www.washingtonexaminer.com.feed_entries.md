HBO’s The Sympathizer enters the television lineup with two strikes against it. In the first place, the limited series’s 2015 source novel, by Viet Thanh Nguyen, was among the worst Pulitzer Prize winners in recent memory, a geopolitical navel-gazer that “thrilled” flattering book critics’ voguish anti-Westernism.

Several animals emerge with no credit whatsoever from Animal Farm. Benjamin the donkey is a case-hardened pessimist, as stolidly indifferent to conditions under the new regime as he was to the tyranny of Farmer Jones.

Benjamin Franklin was, as the children say these days, built different. The Pennsylvanian founding father studiously maintained a chart bearing seven columns, for each day of the week, and 13 rows, one for each of 13 central virtues: temperance, silence, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity, justice, moderation, cleanliness, tranquility, chastity, and humility. Each week, Franklin [&#8230;]

FBI Director Christoper Wray suggested efforts from Chinese hackers to infiltrate U.S. infrastructure are motivated by something &#8220;even more sinister&#8221; than an economic incentive.
