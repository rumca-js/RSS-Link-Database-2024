Renegade Games Studios has officially opened preorders for a new release of the 2001 title that will begin shipping next month.</p><p>As we reported last year, this is part of Renegade Game Studios' <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/companies/renegade-game-studios/news/risk-2210-godstorm-nexus-ops-vegas-showdown-reprinted-by-renegade-game-studios">continuing licensing deal with Hasbro</a> to produce and distribute titles beloved by their loyal audiences but perhaps not suited to mass market retail.

A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KcFKj14cYo">new trailer</a> remixes the original opening, substituting the main cast with MTG characters Oko, Rakdos, Vraska and Tinybones in a genuinely incredible and hilarious reproduction.</p><p>The near one-to-one mirroring of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL-D9LrFJd4">Cowboy Bebop&rsquo;s intro</a>, still scored to Tank! by the Seatbelts, isn&rsquo;t just a fun homage but promotional material for a collaborati

## Helldivers 2 doesn’t have an official tabletop RPG, but free fan-made tribute Helldroppers may as well be it

Crammed full of Starship Troopers-esque satire, nonstop shooty-bang-bang action and - most importantly - massive explosions (usually dropped on your own head or those of your friends), the co-op third-person shooter about squads of armoured super-soldiers dropping onto players to clear them of deadly bugs and killer robots became a runaway success when it, uh, dived onto screens earlier this year.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Helldivers 2&rsquo;s comical combat and genuinely tense shootouts, punctuated by orbital strikes and the sound of your squadmates respawning after said orbital strikes, have caught the imagination of plenty of people, tabletop designers included.

Less fun are the inevitable arguments over whether your shooter really does have line-of-sight on a model squatting in cover (&ldquo;Yes, I know <em>you </em>can see them!&rdquo;) and those make-or-break debates over a millimetre of range or movement at the end of your ruler. An upcoming mobile app wants to do away with the human room for error and leave no question about whether your shot connects. Apart from, perhaps, &ldquo;Do we really have to have a phone at the table?&rdquo;</p><p>Tablescope&rsquo;s technology aims to understand where physical pieces

Black Powder and Brimstone, an upcoming tabletop RPG running on the Swedish doom metal game&rsquo;s rules, makes that relationship quite a bit more explicit.</p><p>Created by Benjamin Tobitt and published by Free League (<a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/blade-runner-the-roleplaying-game/news/blade-runner-rpg-fiery-angels-expansion">Blade Runner RPG</a>, Dragonbane and Vaesen) through its third-party Workshop label, Black Powder and Brimstone takes place in a dark fantasy setting where two sects of
