Build a free and open source NVR that's better than most commercial NVR's.

I used Frigate, a Raspberry Pi, a Coral TPU, and Axzez's Interceptor 1U chassis.

Axzez sent me the 1U chassis and the required accessories (not including hard drives or the Raspberry Pi) for this build, but they did not pay any money, nor did they have any input into the content in this video.
