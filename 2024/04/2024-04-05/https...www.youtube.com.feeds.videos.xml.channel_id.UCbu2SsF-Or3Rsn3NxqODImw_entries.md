On April 1st, the worst possible day for this to happen, Hollow Knight Silksong listing appeared on Xbox.com. The listing doesn't provide any clarity on when the game is going to be released, just that it'll be on Game Pass on day one and it's optimized for Xbox Series X|S.

This is both a good sign as it's a sign of something, but also a cruel reminder that it has been five years since the game was announced.Â This got us thinking about some of the other games that are still MIA and, at a time when releases have slowed down a bit, it's a good opportunity to check in on them.
