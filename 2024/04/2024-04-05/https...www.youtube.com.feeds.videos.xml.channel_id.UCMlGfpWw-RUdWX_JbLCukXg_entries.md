Lightning Talk: Implementing Coroutines Using C++17 - Alon Wolf - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

In this lightning talk, we will explore the journey of implementing coroutines in C++17 before they were added to the language in C++20. 
The implementation uses macros, template metaprogramming, assembly functions, and more that resulting in working coroutines despite somewhat "horrible" code. 
Discover how local variables within the coroutine body were leveraged to calculate frame sizes and ensure correct variable lifetimes during suspension, resumption, and destruction.
