Here I am now though, some 12 years later, looking at the game again for the game's 10th anniversary - a milestone that will also be celebrated in-game over the next year, spanning the time between the game's PC launch in 2014 and the release of its console port in 2015.</p><p>It's safe to say the The Elder Scrolls Online gameplay I watched at E3 2012 was radically different to what today's players see, and to be fair, it was radically different to what players saw when the game eventually released two years later, too.

And its big idea is brilliant. You're a tiny character scampering around roomy levels, the camera pulled a good way out, and you have a drill. A drill! You can use it to chug through sand and dirt and emerge with a burst of speed. You can drill enemies until they're just jaw bones and cute gristle. You can use the drill to power a machine that raises the flag that ends each level. You can use the drill to operate guns, sprinklers, skidoos - you name it. More important than all that, though, Pepper Grinder is a game where the little details matter. And I knew this as soon as I saw the vines.</p><p>The vines are introduced pretty early on.
