Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is the next big game for Microsoft, a company which has struggled with exclusives, and one of its more anticipated. As the follow-up to the acclaimed Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, it sports much more fidelity, fully motion-captured combat and some incredible facial animation.
