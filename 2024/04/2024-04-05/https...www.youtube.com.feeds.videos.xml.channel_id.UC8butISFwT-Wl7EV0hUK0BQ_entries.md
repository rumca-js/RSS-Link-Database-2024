On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Jabril. He's an indie game developer who's building a turn-based fighting game called Ultrabouters.

Jabril has developed tons of other games as well. He runs the popular Jabrils gamedev focused-YouTube. He's also published a 5-hour introduction to programming course on freeCodeCamp.

We talk about:

- Jabril's advice to gamedevs who want to make a career out of building video games
- How Jabril got into gamedev as a kid when he got a copy of GameMaker
- Jabril's career working at a comedy club and a radio station
- The anime that Jabril's been working on for years
- Why Jabril puts an "s" at the end of his name

Can you guess what bass line I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's a 2009 song that became popular in the 2010's by being associated with a meme.
