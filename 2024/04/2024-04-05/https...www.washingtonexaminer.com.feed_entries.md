Why would a multibillion-dollar healthcare company fire a white male executive for no cause, only to replace him with a black woman weeks later?  Because the company’s Diversity and Inclusion Executive Council told them to, that’s why.&#160; And while the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has held that the fired executive is entitled to [&#8230;]

A federal judge on Thursday upheld New York Attorney General Letitia James’s challenge of a so-called ban on transgender athletes in Nassau County.

TALLAHASSEE, Florida —&#160;Most defeated presidential candidates skulk away and stay silent, at least for a while as they try to regroup. Not Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL). Since exiting the 2024 Republican primary, the Florida governor has remained very much in the public eye. DeSantis announced hundreds of millions of dollars in new toll relief for [&#8230;]

There’s probably a nicer way to put this, but I’m just going to come out and say it: People in the ancient world suffered from major anxiety disorders.

The job of House leaders in both parties includes trying to get veteran lawmakers to stick around and seek reelection. For House Republican leaders in 2024, it&#8217;s a more pressing matter of ensuring they finish out their current terms. GOP House members&#8217; early departures are aggravating the party&#8217;s existing problem of a perilously slim majority. [&#8230;]

America is falling behind in its ability to carry out and defend against cyberattacks.

Last month, the Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel García Márquez published his seventh novel, Until August.
