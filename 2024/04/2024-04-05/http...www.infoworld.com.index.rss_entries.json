The fourth quarter of 2023 saw an 18.5% year-over-year increase in spending on compute and storage infrastructure for cloud deployments. It is a significant shift in the technological landscape, where AI is now front and center in the push to find cloud infrastructure to run it.</p><p>The spending surge indicates shifting budgets; a contrasting trend is the decline in the total number of units shipped. IDC says this shows a strategic move towards high-capacity, GPU-heavy servers with higher average price tags favored by hyperscalers. The idea is that these servers can do more than those driven by traditional CPU-based servers, thus, you need fewer.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715040/ai-advancements-are-fueling-cloud-infrastructure-spending.html#tk.rss_all", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "http://www.infoworld.com/index.rss", "source_obj__id": 151, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2023/06/07/06/thinkstockphotos-528443527-100610461-small-100941889-small.jpg", "title": "AI advancements are fueling cloud infrastructure spending", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-05T09:00:00+00:00", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>With the release of .NET 8, Microsoft introduced a plethora of <a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3711422/the-best-new-features-in-microsoft-net-8.html\">new features and enhancements</a> in the .NET Core and ASP.NET Core frameworks.
