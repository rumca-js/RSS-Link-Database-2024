Do I actually use this KwesForms DevTool? Yes!! And it's live at https://www.mvplanding.com

It's true, I like Google Forms but they fall short (and always have) when it comes to design control. KwesForms gives you the control back by turning your HTML Forms into backend-connected HTML forms that can be integrated to Google Sheets via no-code workflows (Zapier), your own webhooks, or your own requests to the KwesForms API.
