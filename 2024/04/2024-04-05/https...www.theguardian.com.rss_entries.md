<p>This interview format is a breath of fresh air: funny, endearing, novel – and the Welsh actor is charm personified. Expect tears, laughter and unexpected celebrity beatboxing</p><p>First question: “Was John Taylor from Duran Duran your first ever crush?” Answer: “I thought he was the most beautiful person I’d ever seen, man or woman. His hair was like a miracle.” And so begins The Assembly, in which 35 autistic, neurodivergent and learning disabled people quiz one Michael Sheen, the award-winning Welsh actor. I think we can safely assume in more than three decades of interviews that Sheen has never been asked whether he knows “anything about the long-term celebrity Tom Jones?” It’s a question that leads to an anecdote about Sheen bonding with the Welsh singer’s sister over a broken toe in hospital in LA. You won’t find this sort of thing in Sight and Sound magazine.</p><p>I love the concept of this special, which airs during Autism Acceptance Week at a time when diagnosis is increa

Is there a crowd more put through the mill? If only Quins were as trustworthy as their faithful, but life is never boring there.

Cellist Francesca Ter-Berg and violinist Flora Curzon also compose with voices and electronics, and their album’s opening track, Nudity, announces their ambitious intentions. Plucked strings whip up a hot-blooded Sirba (a Romanian/Jewish 6/8 rhythm) against a high violin drone and a skittering vocal of the Meredith Monk school. A delirious, desirous mood ensues.</p><p>It’s a strangely accessible record.

By the turn of the next decade, Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney had entered the Grammy and Billboard chart-buttressed rock mainstream. Singles such as Tighten Up and Gold on the Ceiling – which watered down their trademark guitar sleaze and paired it with earwormy choruses – gradually entered the pop cultural ether, becoming the type of songs you know even if you think you don’t.</p><p>On their 12th album, the Black Keys themselves seem like the opposite of that: a band you think you know but might actually struggle to get your head around.
