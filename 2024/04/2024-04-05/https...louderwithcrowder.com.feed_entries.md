## Kamala Harris clowns herself with shameless pander on when women were allowed NCAA "brackets." Also, she's dead wrong.

	"Mr. Wonderful" Kevin O'Leary has been on fire lately, and social media influencer Rep. AOC is always good for a few yuks. O'Leary actually praised her for the skilled way she posts things on Twitter and talking into her phone. The rub is when we get to her side hustle as a member of Congress. That's where the "Shark Tank" star thinks she sucks at life.
