<p>On April 1st, the worst possible day for this to happen, a listing for Hollow Knight Silksong appeared on Xbox.com. Though listing doesn't provide any clarity on when the game is going to be released, it does confirm it will be on Game Pass on day one and is optimized for Xbox Series X|S. This is both a good sign, as it's a sign of <em>something</em>, but also a cruel reminder that it has been five years since the game was announced.</p><p>This got us thinking about some of the other games that are still MIA and, at a time when releases have slowed down a bit, it's a good opportunity to check in on them. From Metroid Prime 4 to Good Beyond Evil 2, here are some of the games we're still waiting to play.</p><div>          </div><p>Spot On is GameSpot's weekly news show in which managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest game news.

<p>I've been pondering the modern era of Ghostbusters a lot since the faux-Marvel blandness of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghostbusters-frozen-empire-review-ghostbusters-3-in-2024-for-better-or-worse/1900-6418201/">Frozen Empire</a> failed to make much of an impression when it hit theaters in March. This little sequel duology, which includes 2021's Afterlife as well, is overly reverential of the original Ghostbusters movie--but this pair of flicks doesn't give you a movie-watching experience that's anything like what you'd get from that comedy classic. Like so many franchise revivals and reboots, Frozen Empire and Afterlife are just new things with an old name on them.</p><p dir="ltr">What's funny about that, however, is that there absolutely <em>is</em> a recent Ghostbusters movie that functions as a true modern version of Ghostbusters: Paul Feig's 2016 remake, starring Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, and Chris Hemsworth.

<p>Deck Nine, the studio behind Life is Strange, apparently had an issue with Nazi symbols and dog whistles mysteriously appearing in its work during development. In a new report by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-hidden-nazi-symbols-were-the-tip-of-a-toxic-iceberg-at-life-is-strange-developer-deck-nine">IGN</a>, insiders spoke about toxic work culture and their concerns about someone trying to hide hate speech in their games.</p><p>Symbols included the number 88 (code for "Heil Hitler"), racist memes, the number 18 (code for "Adolf Hitler"), and the Hagal rune. Developers flagged the symbols for bosses to remove, but changes were not as swift as they hoped. In one instance, developers asked to remove an image of a particular racist meme, but it reportedly remained present, albeit displayed less prominently. While developers acknowledged that adding numbers could be a simple mistake, it was difficult to believe it was coincidental next to the other symbols.</p><p>After enoug

Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income. So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money, and then sustain my life."</p><p dir="ltr">Corazza continued by explaining how exposing children to th

<p>To celebrate its 25th anniversary, The Mummy will be coming back to theaters for a limited run starting April 26. Originally released in 1999, the Stephen Sommers-directed film starred Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Arnold Vosloo.</p><div>          </div><p>Set in 1926, The Mummy follows a group of adventurers looking to claim a long-lost Egyptian treasure, but the gang accidentally awakens Imhotep, the ancient high priest of Egypt who was sentenced to a gnarly fate for several heinous crimes. Reawakened, the mummified Imhotep goes on a killing spree to regenerate his form and unleashes plagues upon Egypt as he seeks to resurrect his one true love.</p><p>The Mummy would make $416 million at the global box office and spawned multiple sequels, spin-offs, and even an animated series. <a href="https://youtu.be/3yXjs7BUKYc">The Mummy Returns</a> hit theaters in 2001 and added WWE star Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson to its cast--as well as a very weird CGI model of him--and th
