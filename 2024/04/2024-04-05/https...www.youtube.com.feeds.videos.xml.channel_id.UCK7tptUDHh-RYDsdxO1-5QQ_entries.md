Congress is considering banning TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media app that millions of Americans use daily. But the U.S. wouldn’t be the first country to ban the app - India banned TikTok in 2020. One of the main reasons for the ban in both India and the U.S. stems from TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance.
