A check of Amazon&#8217;s jobs site confirms this statement, showing about 3,770 job posts globally under the Amazon Web Services category as of Friday morning. But the site also provides a deeper sense for the geographic and functional areas where AWS is still hiring, and with that, a sense for what the company is prioritizing. This week&#8217;s AWS job cuts are the latest&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/where-amazon-web-services-is-still-hiring-after-cutting-hundreds-of-jobs-this-week/">Read More</a>

Their jobs have higher-than-average levels of trauma, stress and danger. There are also deterrents to getting help, including a stigma for first responders seeking mental health care. And some worry they could lose their job if someone assumed they were unfit for duty because they wanted therapy. &#8220;There&#8217;s still a perception that they have to be superhuman &#8212; &#8216;I&#8217;m not supposed to need help. I&#8217;m super tough, I can handle all of this,'&#8221; said Colleen Hilton, co-founder of Alli Connect, a Seattle-area startup that&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-area-mental-health-startup-focused-on-serving-first-responders-is-raising-cash/">Read Mo

So are the travel costs. Hard-core eclipse fans made their travel arrangements long ago. That was also the case back in 2017, when a similar all-American solar eclipse turned central Oregon into one of the nation&#8217;s hottest hotspots (made even hotter by that summer&#8217;s wildfires). Witnessing a total solar eclipse in person is something everyone ought to do at least once in their life, and if you want to get in on the experience&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/your-nearly-last-minute-guide-to-solar-eclipse/">Read More</a>
