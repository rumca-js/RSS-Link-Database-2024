  <p id="OutbJS">There was no question that Apple would appeal when the International Trade Commission banned Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 sales last year. Well, if you’ve got some time, you can now read all 916 pages of Apple’s appeal to the Federal Circuit. </p>

In <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">an update on Friday</a>, Apple announced that game emulators can come to the App Store globally and offer downloadable games.

Maybe a storage bump since you’re hopefully going to have this computer for a decade? Okay, well, at that price, you might as well get the 15-inch Air. It’s basically the same price.

  <p id="c42SmD">Unlike other headsets, you don’t control Apple’s Vision Pro headset with any sort of input device. Instead, the headset tracks your hand and eye movements. When you want to select something, you simply look at it and tap your fingers together. Like Nilay Patel said in his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">review</a>, it’s pretty magical — until it isn’t. And when hand or eye tracking feels off, the easiest thing to do is recalibrate it.</p>

  <p id="8GhNi7">In August 2020, during the heart of the covid-19 pandemic when many schools were closed, social media and news outlets were awash with <a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/photo-of-girls-using-taco-bell-wifi-becomes-symbol-of-digital-divide">a picture</a> of two grade school students sitting outside of a Taco Bell, attempting to do their schoolwork.
