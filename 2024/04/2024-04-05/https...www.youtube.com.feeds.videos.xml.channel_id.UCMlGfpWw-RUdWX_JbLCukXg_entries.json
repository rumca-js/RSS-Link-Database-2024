He has developed many custom simulation and rendering engines for different platforms using modern C++. He also writes a C++ technical blog and participates in game jams.\n---\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULJcnSTwg9g", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "source_obj__id": 420, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ULJcnSTwg9g/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lightning Talk: Implementing Coroutines Using C++17 - Alon Wolf - CppCon 2023", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
