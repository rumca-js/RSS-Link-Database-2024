Hear the words E. coli or salmonella and food poisoning comes to mind. Rapid detection of such bacteria is crucial in preventing outbreaks of foodborne illness. While the usual practice is to take food samples to a laboratory to see the type and quantity of bacteria that forms in a petri dish over a span of days, an Osaka Metropolitan University research team has created a handheld device for quick on-site detection.

New research could pave the way to developing cancer drugs targeting an enzyme that inhibits ferroptosis, a type of cell death. Cancer cells that are resistant to anticancer drugs are known to be vulnerable to ferroptosis. Therefore, agents that effectively induce or enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to ferroptosis are expected to become novel anticancer agents.

## Ocean floor a 'reservoir' of plastic pollution, study finds

New research from CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, and the University of Toronto in Canada, estimates up to 11 million metric tons of plastic pollution is sitting on the ocean floor. The article, "Plastics in the deep sea—A global estimate of the ocean floor reservoir," was published in Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers.

When Americans mark their presidential election ballots later this year, immigration will be top of mind—it's the nation's number one issue, according to pollster Gallup. And one of the toughest talkers on the topic is former president and presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump. He's built his political career on calls to secure the border and defend America against what he says are immigration's dangers, warning of shrinking wages and stretched benefits programs. "When you have millions of people coming in," he recently told a crowd in Michigan, "they're going to take your jobs."

Globally, computation is booming at an unprecedented rate, fueled by the boons of artificial intelligence. With this, the staggering energy demand of the world's computing infrastructure has become a major concern, and the development of computing devices that are far more energy-efficient is a leading challenge for the scientific community.
