With this video, we will be taking a look at Project: The Outcast - an upcoming action adventure game based on Hitori No Shita which is a popular Donghua. \n\nIt impresses with its fast and frenetic combat and great attention to visual detail.

As the follow-up to the acclaimed Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, it sports much more fidelity, fully motion-captured combat and some incredible facial animation.\n\nDespite how impressive it's looked over the past several years of gameplay showings, the sequel - and the Xbox Series X/S - has attracted some flak. Hellblade 2 runs at a locked 30 FPS on both Xbox Series X and S, with no options for a 60 FPS Performance Mode. If you want anything higher than 30 FPS, you have to play on PC.\n\nThough noted to have been done for \"cinematic\" purposes, this decision has once again raised the question of current-gen games running at such a frame rate.
