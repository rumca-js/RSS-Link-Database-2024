The Elder Scrolls VI was announced during the previous PS4/Xbox One era, it's very likely we won't be playing it on the PS5/Xbox Series X. We also know Naughty Dog is working on something, but it's not that cancelled The Last of Us multiplayer game, and it's possible that game will skip this gen and go to next.
