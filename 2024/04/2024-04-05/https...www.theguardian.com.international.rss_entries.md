<p>Store-cupboard heaven: a no-bake, creamy coconut and passionfruit tart with a biscuit base, and a simple and adaptable spiced pineapple tart with bay cream</p><p>I’ve always felt that dessert is the best part of a meal. And I’m typically the designated dessert person – the one who volunteers to bring along something sweet. It’s a role I take very seriously. My new book is full of the recipes I make for those cosy dinner parties with friends, for church potlucks, last-minute get-togethers, weekend lunches, big family gatherings and everything in between. These two tarts put store-cupboard staples and tropical fruits to work for an easy, refreshing end to any meal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/05/creamy-coconut-tart-spicy-pineapple-tart-recipes-benjamina-ebuehi-easy-store-cupboard-bake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Milder dishes tend to beckon cool, crisp sauvignon blancs, while spicier dishes call for more aromatic and sweeter wines</p><p>Using the words “wine” and “Thai food” in the same sentence is, I realise, a risky proposition, and one that’s almost always greeted with a chorus of “Why would you want to drink anything other than beer?!” But bear with, as they say, because there’s Thai and there’s Thai, and I’m guessing that the beer drinkers (of whom I am often one) aren’t always eating the real deal – more Thai-ish, with the emphasis on the “ish”.</p><p>Supermarket ready meals, for example, are quite mild and/or bland, depending on how pejorative you’re being.

<p>Fifty years since Abba won with Waterloo, fans are paying tribute to a pop classic. Its status is a far cry from its origins in a celebration of weedy pop and dodgy lyrics – and, whisper it, ‘nul points’ from Britain</p><p>Fifty years on, the footage of Abba performing Waterloo at the 1974 Eurovision song contest is very familiar indeed: the conductor dressed as Napoleon, Agnetha’s blue satin knickerbockers, Björn’s star-shaped guitar. It’s been endlessly repeated on TV shows and documentaries: the moment that unexpectedly launched the career of one of the biggest bands of all time, pop history in the making. But it’s rarely, if ever, shown in context. Perhaps Abba’s success is so sui generis – Sweden had never produced an internationally successful pop artist before, and it’s never produced one anything like as successful since – that context seems besides the point. But this weekend, BBC Four is screening the entire 1974 grand final in full.</p><p>Immediately, the setting plunges

But, increasingly, residents say they have had enough.</p><p>This week, after growing complaints from residents, wildlife officials announced a plan to round up 2,500 of the urban monkeys and place them in huge enclosures. It follows an incident in March where a woman was left with a dislocated knee after being kicked in the back by a monkey that wanted her food.
