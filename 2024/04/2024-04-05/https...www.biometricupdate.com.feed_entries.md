		As the European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet inches closer to reality, organizations are trying to grasp how the project and the new regulation surrounding it will impact their work.

The Centre of Excellence for Data Sharing and Cloud (CoE DSC), an international initiative for data sharing based in the Netherlands, has <a href="https://coe-dsc.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CoE-DSC-eIDAS-impact-on-data-spaces.pdf">published a guide</a> on what the European digital identity will mean for data spaces, including service providers and data sharing initiatives.

Common European data spaces are the continent’s attempt to create a single market for data, ensuring that more data becomes available for use in the economy, society and research.

“Digital Identity (DI) is a key

		<em>By Zach Capers, Senior Analyst and Manager of ResearchLab at GetApp</em>

Public perception of biometric technology looks vastly different now than it did only two years ago. Biometric data collection such as facial recognition was more widely accepted following the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic as touchless alternatives became more available to consumers. However, the security and accuracy of biometric solutions is now facing serious scrutiny from consumers.

According to <a href="https://www.getapp.com/resources/biometric-technology-challenges/">GetApp’s 2024 Biometric Technologies Survey</a> of 1,000 U.S. consumers, 42 percent say they do not trust tech companies to safeguard their biometric data—a percentage that has nearly doubled from 22 percent

		An age verification trade organization is urging the UK government to swiftly adopt regulations allowing stores to use age assurance technology when selling alcohol.

In a letter to the UK Home Office, the<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/the-age-verification-providers-association"> Age Verification Providers Association</a> (AVPA) argues that the country may lose its first-mover advantage in digital proof of age and age estimation if it does not make the right regulatory moves.

“Delaying a change to the law here which creates a level playing field for healthy competition in this country will inevitably give the competitive advantage to very large global platforms,” says AVPA. “[These] are already seeking to set alternative de facto standards

		New Zealand’s privacy watchdog wants tougher regulation covering the use of biometrics and AI technology such as facial recognition.

New legislation may also be on the table. Privacy Commissioner Michael Webster promised to publish a draft biometrics code this autumn, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/513289/a-lack-of-consequences-for-managing-personal-information-poorly-privacy-commissioner">according</a> to Radio New Zealand (RNZ).

"However, the cross-cutting issues raised by biometrics are such that legislative amendments may also be necessary to safeguard this sensitive personal information," Webster says.

The move comes amid a record surge in privacy complaints of 79 percent within the last fina
