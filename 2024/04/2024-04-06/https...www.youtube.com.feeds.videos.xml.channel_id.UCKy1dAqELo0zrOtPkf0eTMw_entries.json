And while it\u2019s as difficult to parse out the incremental improvements from one year to the next as it is to kick out of a Tombstone, here\u2019s an attempt at narrowing down the 10 best WWE games of all time.\n\nTo start with, we didn\u2019t book this list all by ourselves without consulting our roster. The IGN audience participated in a Face-off, giving us a capacity crowd's worth of data to work with.
