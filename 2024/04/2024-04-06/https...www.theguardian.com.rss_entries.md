This is the same opening bowling combination they used in the last ODI. They picked up a wicket in the ninth over then, so will hope they replicate or better that this time. Bouchier looks to have settled well into this match, she’s timing it very well and taking the opportunities when they come her way.</p><p><strong>1st over: England 5-0 (Beaumont 1, Bouchier 4) </strong>Jess Kerr takes the new ball and gets us underway at Seddon Park.

<p>It was not only the victory, although that was plainly the biggest thing for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal, one to send them to the top of the Premier League table. It was the manner of it; how they absorbed everything Brighton could throw at them before pulling clear during a second-half masterclass of strength and control.</p><p>The success or otherwise of Arsenal’s title bid will surely be determined on the road, and this was the first of four testing assignments – the others come at Wolves, Tottenham and Manchester United. Brighton were unbeaten in their previous 14 matches in all competitions at the Amex Stadium; they were on a club record run of 12 top-flight home games without defeat. And for much of the first half they showed why, looking slick on the ball, asking questions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/06/brighton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Rob Edwards’ side ended their 10-match run without a league victory in dramatic fashion, Morris arriving at the far post to turn home Cauley Woodrow’s deep cross and stun Andoni Iraola in the away dugout.</p><p>Bournemouth had been excellent in the first half against a home side that looked limited creatively, but it took until after the interval to make their breakthrough via James Tavernier’s low shot. Luton rallied and Jordan Clark levelled to snatch what at that stage looked like being a critical point in their fight against the drop. Then came Morris’s late intervention, knocking the ball past a stunned Neto in the visitors’ goal to spark joyous scenes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/06/luton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Even more impressive: she manages to hold on to that mood for the entirety of the record. This may be Palladino’s first album, but she’s already an incredibly gifted producer and songwriter, able to wring fabulous drama out of slowly churning songs and relatively minimal arrangements.<br /><br />Maybe those skills are in Palladino’s blood – she’s the daughter of famed bassist Pino Palladino – or were picked up via osmosis during her time spent working with the enigmatic London producer Jai Paul. (She’s in his band and signed to his label.) There are passing similarities – some of the tones and textures overlap wi

<p>In 2014, Sheeran became the most-streamed musician in the world. The 10 years since have seen his dominance grow, helped by relatability, a pick-and-mix approach to genre and a way with an earworm melody. But in 2024 is his influence waning?</p><p>Ed Sheeran is popular because he is a generational talent. Ed Sheeran is popular because his output is generic and bland. Ed&nbsp;Sheeran is popular because he reinvents himself in line with the&nbsp;latest musical trends.&nbsp;Ed&nbsp;Sheeran is popular because he has a&nbsp;distinctive style. Ed&nbsp;Sheeran is popular thanks to his hardcore fanbase. Ed&nbsp;Sheeran is popular because the public are forcibly subjected to his songs via relentless airplay and playlist domination. Ed Sheeran is an earnest, authentic troubadour who grafted on the open-mic circuit for years. Ed Sheeran is a cynical shapeshifting pop music machine who gamed the algorithm. Ed Sheeran is the perennial underdog of pop. Ed Sheeran is its king.</p><p>Middle Englan

<p>Can you watch two games at once? Can you watch even more?

I heard somebody use this term before: they want a ‘visual muzak’.”</p> <a href="https:/

## ‘The vet presented it as: if you care, you pay’: who really profits from poorly pets?

<p>£150 for a dog’s injection. £900 to monitor a rabbit overnight. Thousands for cat surgery. How did pet care become such big business?</p><p>One crisp Sunday afternoon in late February, Louise Taylor noticed that one of her family’s two pet rabbits, Honey, couldn’t stand up properly. “We got an appointment at the emergency vet and they gave her painkillers and drugs,” says Taylor, a 46-year-old civil servant. “But she still couldn’t stand. The vet said he thought she should stay in overnight, and it would cost £900, or we could take her home, and it would be £200. It didn’t feel like much of a choice.” She believes it was presented as: you have to, if you care about your rabbit.</p><p>Thinking back on it now, Taylor says the family, which did not have pet insurance, had been prepared to be pragmatic. “She was eight and a half years old; that’s quite old for a rabbit. They tend to live eight to 10&nbsp;years. But we did what the vet said.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lif

<p>An alignment between national team and leading domestic sides delivers thriving ecosystem, offering optimism for Europe</p><p>Six Premiership teams began this weekend’s Champions Cup last-16 round and it is hard to know what to expect based on domestic matches since the Six Nations. We’ve seen sides get thrashed, then dish out a thrashing themselves and of all the six in Champions Cup action, not a single one managed to string back-to-back Premiership wins together in the previous two weekends.</p><p>That doesn’t immediately point to optimism but I do believe there are grounds for positivity. It might not necessarily be the year that we see an English winner again but there were improved performances and results in the pool stages and that can continue over the next two weeks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/06/premiership-rugby-union-england-champions-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For every £1 earned by men working in the arts, museums and libraries, women are paid 85p, figures show</p><p>It’s been a banner year for women in film, from Margot Robbie’s turn as Barbie to Emma Stone’s Oscar-winning portrayal of Bella Baxter in Poor Things. Even Maestro, Bradley Cooper’s ode to Leonard Bernstein, centred the story on the composer’s wife, Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan), as much as it did the man himself.</p><p>But according to experts, improved representation on the big screen is not necessarily being reflected in the pay packets of women working in film and television. While Robbie was reportedly paid <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/barbie-pay-margot-robbie-salary-box-office-bonuses-1235695563/">$50m for Barbie</a> after the film’s record-breaking box office success, one harsh reality remains – female actors are generally making far less money than their male counterparts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/06/women-are-all
