For the average wrestling fan, turning to WWE’s games is a safer way to live out your sports entertainment fantasies than, say, jumping off the roof of your garage through a flaming table. Since the late 80s there’ve been well over 50 such games that have averted countless such ill-advised* attempts to be a pro wrestler at home, all wearing the WWF/E banner. And while it’s as difficult to parse out the incremental improvements from one year to the next as it is to kick out of a Tombstone, here’s an attempt at narrowing down the 10 best WWE games of all time.

To start with, we didn’t book this list all by ourselves without consulting our roster. The IGN audience participated in a Face-off, giving us a capacity crowd's worth of data to work with. There are a handful of surprises and no small dose of nostalgia for the Attitude Era that showed up in the results, but without further ado or wrestling wordplay, let’s ring the bell.

Astra: Knights of Veda Video reviewed by Jess Reyes on PC, also available on iOS and Android.

Astra: Knights of Veda has an intriguing mystery and engaging combat, but its sluggish progression and unintuitive user experience make this RPG feel like it’s fighting against you. The beginner rewards are reasonable enough that it's fairly safe to check out as a free-to-play gacha game, but be warned that the best of its story doesn’t come around until at least the halfway point of the campaign. Anyone taking on this adventure will need the patience to learn the layers of systems, grind to high enough levels to survive its hardest enemies, and come back even after your game inevitably crashes. It’s a tough ask, but one that’s worth at least looking into if you’re interested in a darker take on an anime fantasy RPG.
