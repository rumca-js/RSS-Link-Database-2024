National biometrics registration campaigns are yielding results in Ethiopia and Nigeria, a large U.S. contract has been won by Idemia Public Security and its partner, and Australia is limiting the number of companies that will be approved for its federal digital ID system, with IDverse and Mastercard among the likely beneficiaries. Yoti\u2019s age estimation has not won a key approval from the U.S. government, yet, and sooner or later, UK\u2019s borders are likely to need more biometric gear deployed.
