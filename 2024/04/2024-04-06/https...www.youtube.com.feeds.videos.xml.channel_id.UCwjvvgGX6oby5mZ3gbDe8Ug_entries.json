Because the Chinese economy continues to weaken, the stock market is depressed, the Chinese currency depreciates, and bank interest rates are too low, a gold-buying frenzy has emerged in mainland China. However, many Chinese don\u2019t realize that the economic bubble is bursting; along with it, popular gold companies are going bust. Several gold stores in Beijing and Shandong Province have closed and \"gone on the run,\" leaving customers unable to redeem their gold. The accumulated losses exceed 400 million yuan, or about $55 million.\n\nHave questions? Do you have something to share with us about China?
