The most recent progress is a ruling dismissing six of the plaintiff\u2019s seven claims. Four of the claims were dismissed outright, as was part of Hadnagy's defamation claim, and two were dismissed with leave to amend. Part of the one defamation claim survived our motion to dismiss.<br /><br />\n\n    The next move belongs to the plaintiff, as they determine how to proceed on the claims dismissed with leave to amend.<br /><br />\n\n    We\u2019ll keep you posted as the remaining claims make their way through the courts.<br /><br />\n\nIf you are interested in the full ruling, you can find it here: <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68094183/hadnagy-v-moss/\">https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68094183/hadnagy-v-moss/</a>\n<br />    </p>", "language": null, "link": "https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68094183/hadnagy-v-moss", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://defcon.org/defconrss.xml", "source_obj__id": 82, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "DEF CON Legal Update", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
