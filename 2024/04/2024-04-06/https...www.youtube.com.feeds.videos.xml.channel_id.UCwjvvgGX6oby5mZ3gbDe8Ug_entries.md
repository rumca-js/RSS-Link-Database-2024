An old Chinese saying goes, "Buy gold in troubled times and collect antiques in good times."  
For many Chinese, right now is a time to buy gold, not to collect antiques. Because the Chinese economy continues to weaken, the stock market is depressed, the Chinese currency depreciates, and bank interest rates are too low, a gold-buying frenzy has emerged in mainland China. However, many Chinese donâ€™t realize that the economic bubble is bursting; along with it, popular gold companies are going bust. Several gold stores in Beijing and Shandong Province have closed and "gone on the run," leaving customers unable to redeem their gold. The accumulated losses exceed 400 million yuan, or about $55 million.
