  <p id="4lXV2D">Google is working on a feature that is so simple and so useful that I’m shocked it hasn’t been part of our lives for a decade: a way to look up a phone number that just called you, right from your recent calls screen. X user AssembleDebug <a href="https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/05/google-pixel-phone-app-lookup-feature/">tipped off <em>PiunikaWeb</em></a> to a new “Lookup” button in the beta version of the Google Phone app that, when tapped, brings up a Google Search with the number already entered for you. </p>

  <p id="A7sl2l">The similarities between <a href="https://rooms.xyz/"><em>Rooms</em></a> — a simple, charming game for iOS and the web where you design rooms — and <em>Minecraft</em> are easy to spot. Both share a blocky visual style and a design-your-own-retreat objective. But describing <em>Rooms</em> as a scaled-down <em>Minecraft</em> for people over the age of 12 doesn’t give it enough credit. It’s good, old-fashioned building in the vein of Lego, <em>The Sims</em>, and <em>Animal Crossing</em>. <em>Rooms</em> builds on the time-honored tradition with a dose of coziness and creativity that’s limited only by your patience for arranging three-dimensional pixels.<strong> </st
