<p>Separates are officially the new power players. The dress is dead, long live the long skirt</p><p>SS24’s take on maxis is less boho and more office-friendly – even denim iterations are styled with a neatly tucked shirt and smart mid-heel slingbacks. <strong>Phoebe Philo</strong>’s edit 2 (the latest drop of her namesake brand) features a maxi-length deep-plum tailored skirt. The skirt is stern and the hemline is about as far away from the viral <strong>Miu Miu </strong>mini as possible, while at <strong>Marni</strong>, Francesco Risso showed a sky-blue leather floor-grazing style.</p><p>Treat a tailored maxi in the same way as a suit and style with a matching blazer and plain T-shirt for an out-the-door-in-10-minutes look. A black maxi pencil skirt can be a blank canvas for any look.

<p>Seydou Sarr is wonderful as a 16-year-old Senegalese migrant who maintains his empathy and selflessness through a hellish journey to Europe </p><p>Hope and fantasy coexist so closely in <em>Io Capitano</em>, Matteo Garrone’s wrenching Oscar-nominated account of the journey of two teenage Senegalese migrants towards a new life in Europe, that you start to wonder if the film is arguing that hope <em>is</em> a fantasy. Whether the better future that tempts 16-year-old Seydou (Seydou Sarr) and his cousin Moussa (Moustapha Fall) on to the perilous trip across the Sahara and the Mediterranean is no more substantial than the mirage of a floating woman that Seydou hallucinates in the desert. But in fact this is a film that, for all its brutal horrors, keeps a kernel of hope and faith in the inherent decency of humankind (or some of it at least).</p><p>Central to the spirit of the film is Seydou, a gangly string bean with a smile that warms the screen; a teenager who is still enough of a ch

<p></p><p>Just when Manchester City are creaking, they find a way. It helps, of course, to have Kevin De Bruyne around. His 99th goal for the club wrenched City back level just when it seemed Crystal Palace had the tools to take down the champions. And after a first half of frustration, having Jack Grealish back in form to supply key roles in goals for Rico Lewis, Erling Haaland and then De Bruyne again, completing his century, was more than handy.</p><p>This did not quite fit the template of winning while playing badly, since City’s second-half display was full of control, poise and deadly finishing that Palace found no way to stop. It’s now over to Liverpool and Arsenal to play their hands in the three-way game of who blinks first, while Pep Guardiola turns his attentions to the Champions League.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/06/crystal-palace-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p></p><p>Derby days do not get much sweeter for Norwich City. Their hex over Ipswich Town extended to 15 years and the consequences of this feisty, fully merited win may be greater still. For one thing, it puts a severe dent in their rivals’ hopes of automatic promotion, which had looked irresistible at the outset; for another, it tightens their own stranglehold on sixth place and infuses their playoff challenge with potentially decisive momentum. Whisper it quietly, but this may only have been an appetiser: with this result, the odds on a reunion in the playoffs next month have surely shortened dramatically.</p><p>Marcelino Núñez was the hero for David Wagner’s team, beating Vaclav Hladky with a 39th-minute free-kick during a spell of concerted Norwich pressure. It said everything for their display that they restricted the league leaders, usually so swashbuckling, to scraps and there was no scope on this occasion for Kieran McKenna to mastermind one of Ipswich’s trademark late comeb

<p>The director’s new biopic about the troubled singer tells the story of a relationship scrutinised by the tabloids – something she knows all about. She talks about facing cancer, falling for a younger man and why she’ll always be drawn to ‘intense, deep subjects’</p><p>Director Sam Taylor-Johnson’s most famous image back when she was Sam Taylor-Wood, the talented Young British Artist, was a self-portrait standing in a black suit holding a rigid upwards-pointing hare. Hares appeared in her work elsewhere and it is a cornered hare, ready to dart any second, that comes to mind as I sit opposite her now. She’s 57, and has the clean beauty of someone who spends time in California, but uses London teenager slang, like “bare” to mean “very”. She is wearing a blue Sézane shirt that the eldest of her four daughters gave to her on Mother’s Day, embroidered with <em>“Sam</em>”<em> </em>– which was going to be “<em>Mum</em>” except her daughter feared she wouldn’t wear it – and eating seed crac

She needs to preserve her voice for singing, and as she embarks on her farewell tour at the age of 75 she’s shared her methods: she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/02/speech-fasting-would-staying-silent-until-midday-make-us-happier-and-healthier">doesn’t talk at all until noon</a>.

<p>The actor puts in a huge performance as the Chancellor of a fictional European nation. The moral seems to be: ‘Kate Winslet’s being a bit weird, isn’t she?’</p><p>You know what would be genuinely good and interesting? If someone made a miniseries with a big actor or actress that really sunk its fangs into this particular fiddling-while-Rome-burns political moment. As in: we keep being fed a pablum of culture war to distract us from the cost of living crisis that is precipitating an arguably even bigger financial disaster lurking on the horizon. The fact that we’re teetering on the brink of about a dozen different crises would be slightly more bearable if it didn’t feel like the politicians in charge of it cared about nothing other than the <em>being a politician</em>-ness of it. They’ve got one eye on the after-dinner speaking gigs and the consultancy roles they’ve already been taken to lunch at The Berkeley about. They’re fine.</p><p>So, you know.

It’s a digital piano, a few keys short of the full 88, that I&nbsp;bought for myself a&nbsp;couple of years ago. It&nbsp;normally lives in my office shed, but&nbsp;I carry it into the house on band rehearsal nights so the piano player can turn up straight from work.</p><p>After rehearsals it usually takes me a couple of days to summon the will to carry it back to my office – it takes three trips: piano, stand, stool. If I haven’t moved it after four days, I start to think about how the next band rehearsal is actually closer than the previous one, so at this point it makes sense to leave the piano where it is. As a result of this reasoning, the piano has been in our kitchen for a month.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/06/tim-dowling-im-taking-requests-on-the-piano-the-only-one-i-get-is-stop">Continue reading...</a>
