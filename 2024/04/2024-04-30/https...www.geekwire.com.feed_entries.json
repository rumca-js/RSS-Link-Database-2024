That&#8217;s the word from Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky, who spoke with reporters following Amazon&#8217;s first quarter earnings report. Amazon now employs 1.52 million people as of March 31, up 4% year-over-year. The tech giant went on a hiring spree during the pandemic to help meet demand, but then laid off 27,000 corporate workers last year and\u00a0continues to cut\u00a0from its workforce. Olsavsky said the year-over-year growth in headcount is mainly driven by its warehouse-related operations. &#8220;If you look into&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazon-keeping-corporate-headcount-flat-but-hiring-in-select-areas-including-generative-ai/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazon-keeping-corporate-headcount-flat-but-hiring-in-select-areas-including-generative-ai", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Amazon keeping corporate headcount \u2018flat\u2019 but hiring in select areas including generative AI", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-30T20:11:27+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20161128_Amazon_Fulfillment_center_144-1260x840.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Amazon topped estimates for its first quarter earnings, reporting $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, and earnings per share of $0.98.

Charles Fitzgerald is wondering where everyone has been.

He has watched with amusement as the rest of the world, seemingly, has caught on to the importance of CapEx in tech over the past week.
