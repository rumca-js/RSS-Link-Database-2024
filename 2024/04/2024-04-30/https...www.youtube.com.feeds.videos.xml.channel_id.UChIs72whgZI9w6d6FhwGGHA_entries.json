The Meshless AIO mini-ITX case is a new computer case on the market with a unique thermal solution, using a cross-flow cylindrical fan rather than traditional computer fans. This can be the best fan for the job when in a cramped space, but requires the entire solution to be built ground-up around the fan. This video will go in-depth with airflow, thermals and temperature testing results, and will feature an animation to educate on how these bizarre (and relatively new, at j", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CWqCRFroZ0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "source_obj__id": 428, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/9CWqCRFroZ0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "A Better Computer Fan - Sometimes: Cross-Flow Meshless AIO Case Benchmarks & Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
