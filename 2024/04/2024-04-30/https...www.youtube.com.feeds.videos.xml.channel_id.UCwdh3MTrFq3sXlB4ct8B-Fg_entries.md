We've had quite a few comments asking for more ways to paint the hides of your Kroot hunting packs, so we've created three different skin tones that you can use over all your entire Kroot force. You can pick from a sandy ochre skin, a shadowy blue hide, or a pale mossy-green complexion. The great thing is the steps are all the same, just using different colours! 

Base Paints: 
Hobgrot Hide

Layer Paints: 
Dark Reaper
Fenrisian Grey
Krieg Khaki
Nurgling Green
Pallid Wych Flesh 
Russ Grey
Straken Green
Ushabti Bone

Shade Paints: 
Drakenhof Nightshade 
Poxwalker
Seraphim Sepia
