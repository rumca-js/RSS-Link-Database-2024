		As the UK pushes forward with digital surveillance projects, the chorus of voices weighing in on the legal, ethical and practical aspects of its approach grows louder. Having scrapped its Office for the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/uk-biometrics-and-surveillance-commissioner-submits-damning-report-as-job-extended">Biometrics</a> and Surveillance Camera Commissioner with the implementation of the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, the government now finds itself wading in a quagmire of evangelism, objection and piecemeal oversight. For now, it remains in the shallows. But it does not appear to be heading toward the shore.

		Digital ID and AI-assisted identity tools are typically designed to solve complex problems, and what problem is more complex than the wiles of the human heart? The world of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/study-claims-success-inspires-app-using-face-biometrics-to-match-dating-pairs">online dating</a> has proven to be a gold mine for fraudsters who use romance scams to manipulate and sometimes blackmail the lovelorn and vulnerable. Now, as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202404/microsoft-teases-easy-video-deepfake-tool-declines-to-release-it">deepfake technology</a> reaches new levels of efficiency and realism, many online daters are considering AI as a tool to help navigate an increasingly fervid world of scams – and even to serve as a dating coach.

		Nigeria’s push to issue universal legal and digital identity has resulted in a many more people who can prove who they are, but also overlap and duplication between credentials. Now, Senators are in talks with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) and other government bodies on the harmonization of the National Identity Number (NIN), Bank Verification Number (BVN) and other digital ID systems in the country, <a href="https://dailytrust.com/senate-why-nigeria-must-have-single-identity-system/">Daily Trust</a> reports.

		Ghana’s Electoral Commission (EC) has struggled lately with multiple controversies, and another has emerged with claims of massive spending on procurement for biometric verification devices (BVDs) and biometric voter registration kits (BVRs).

The EC in a recent statement argues that it didn’t spend $150 million on purchasing BVDs and BVRs in 2020 as Bright Simons, a social entrepreneur and vice president of think tank <a href="https://imaniafrica.org/">IMANI</a>, has been insinuating.

According to the statement, signed by the electoral agency’s Deputy Director of Research, Monitoring and Evaluation Fred Tetteh, the current leadership of the EC rather saved the country from losing huge sums of money in 2018 by cancelling a costly procurement plan by

		An initiative is underway in India to set up an index to determine the level of digital public infrastructure (DPI) adoption by all states in the country as a way of better positioning their digital transformation drive.

As <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/world-bank-meity-to-come-up-with-state-digital-public-infra-adoption-index-124042500986_1.html">reported</a> by Business Standard, the undertaking by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has the support of the World Bank and it seeks to identify gaps that need to be closed up as the country pursues its digital transformation journey.

		Finland has set up a project to implement its national digital identity wallet in line with the European Union’s eEIDAS regulation which introduces the European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet.

The project kicked off on April 26 and is should be completed by December 31, 2026. The groundwork was set up by Finland’s Ministry of Finance while the Digital and Population Data Services Agency will be in charge of the technical implementation, the government says in a press release.

The agency will have to follow rules set up by the eEIDAS 2.0 which governs electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions. According to the rulebook, each EU Member State is required to provide a digital identity wallet to its citizens by 2026 at the lates

		Bermuda's CCTV security system will not be fully operational until the end of July, over half a year later than initially anticipated, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Security said in a statement.

This follows as the Free Democratic Movement (FDM), a rising political party, said the cameras may "represent unlawful search and infringe on a person’s freedom of association," after meeting with residents from Loyal Hill of the Devonshire parish.

In a letter to Minister Michael Weeks, Omar Dill, an FDM branch chairman, noted that one camera moved from its initially proposed location and created mistrust among residents.

“I have been informed that the visibility of these cameras has notably discouraged the community’s children from playing outdoors," Dill says.

		A judge in the Northern District of Illinois has denied a motion from a plaintiff under the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act to force Union Pacific to produce communications between it and the vendor that supplied its biometric security gates.

The decision implies that the common interest doctrine protects communication between biometrics vendors and their customers in BIPA cases, whether they are named as defendants or not, the <a href="https://natlawreview.com/article/recent-nd-ill-ruling-upholds-common-interest-doctrine-over-communications-between">National Law Review</a> writes.

The article from a trio of attorneys with Hunton Andrews Kurth argues that the ruling supports efforts by BIPA defendants to coordinate
