<p>I&rsquo;ll admit it &mdash; I was turned off by the new Arc browser from the beginning.</p>



<p>For one, there&rsquo;s the maker&rsquo;s name: The Browser Company of New York. Are we meant to imagine the browser being crafted in a converted blacksmith&rsquo;s forge in Brooklyn, offering farm-to-table HTML? And it was designed for the Mac. Then there was my attempt to try out the beta several weeks ago &mdash; the browser hung while I tried to make an account, and wouldn&rsquo;t let me through. A support request went unacknowledged.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s not really fair, though. So when <em>*sigh*</em> The Browser Company of New York announced that its free Arc browser was finally ready for Windows users to try alongside Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and others, I gave it a try. And you know what? It&rsquo;s actually okay.</p>

<p><em>Baldur&rsquo;s Gate III</em> is a role-playing game with some romance elements. <em>Stardew Valley</em> is a role-playing game with some romance elements, and a lot of root vegetables. Why not stick &rsquo;em together in a peanut-butter-and-chocolate combination, for those who want to date a half-elf while they&rsquo;re watering cabbages? That&rsquo;s the idea behind a new mod for <em>Stardew</em>. </p>

<p>The year is 2021. With the COVID-19 pandemic still very much in swing and vaccine rollouts still limited to those most at risk, Razer sees an opportunity: bring its stylish RGB aesthetic to the face masks that most people are still wearing in public. It was a cool idea that, three years later, has the company in hot water with US regulators. </p>



<p>The problem stems from the fact that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/545521/heres-how-much-razers-crazy-rgb-mask-costs.html">Razer advertised its Zephyr mask</a>, which had built-in RGB lights, circulation fans, and a transparent front panel to let others see the wearer&rsquo;s mouth, as &ldquo;N95-grade.&rdquo; Turns out you can&rsquo;t just throw that N95 term around, even in the relatively loosey-goosey world of American medicine. The Federal Trade Commission investigated Razer for misrepresenting the Z

<p>A good monitor can truly improve your gaming experience. A high refresh rate is important for smooth gameplay, of course, but higher resolutions are just as key (especially if you&rsquo;re into city management games where you need to see every little detail). Good news! Today, Amazon is selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096YMQ3C8&amp;xcust=2-1-2319439-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Samsung Odyssey G50A for $199.99</a>, which is 50 percent off of the original $399.99 price.
