In today's Daily Fix:
Square Enix has issued a warning to investors that it will absorb significant losses for the fiscal year that ended in March 2024. The publisher and developer also said it is going to be "more selective and focused" in how it spends its resources. The recently released Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth is rumored to be struggling with sales, and their Splatoon-like multiplayer game, Foamstars, appears to be a dud. In other news, Microsoft has announced the lineup of games for Xbox Game Pass May 2024 Wave 1. Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition leads the way, with an updated version of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, Kona II: Brume, and more on the way. And finally, Bethesda's Todd Howard explains why their Fallout games will always be set in America, even though the nuclear apocalypse was a worldwide event.
