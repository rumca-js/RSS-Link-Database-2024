<p>BattleState Games, the developer behind Escape from Tarkov, didn't expect the backlash of only granting access to its PvE mode for those who purchased the $250 collector's edition. It has since issued an apology and made several changes.</p><p>"First of all, I would like to say that I am very sorry that fans and the game community in general are experiencing these feelings, said chief operational officer Nik Buyanov in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1cf2gnm/more_feedback/">Reddit post</a>. "Unfortunately, I somehow did not foresee the fact of such a reaction and now I have drawn conclusions for my future decisions."</p><p>BattleState Games will now make the mode free for those who purchased the Edge of Darkness edition, but will do so in waves. That's because there is not enough server capacity to accommodate every single player at the moment. Furthermore, there will be mod support for the PvE mode after the game releases out of early access.</p><a hr

<p>With three seasons under <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4's</a> belt since its launch, it's safe to say a lot has changed for Blizzard's ARPG. But it will be the game's upcoming Season 4 update on May 14, dubbed Loot Reborn, that marks the biggest shift for Diablo 4 yet, completely reworking items--how they drop, their stats, and how they are upgraded.</p><p dir="ltr">Across both the game's Eternal and Seasonal realms, items will be fewer in number, with fewer affixes. Many of the game's more confusing, niche, or circumstantial affixes will be removed, resulting in items that will generally be better and more suited towards a player's class and build. Meanwhile, Blizzard is introducing two new ways to improve items, Tempering and Masterworking, which will give players more control over their item progression than ever before. There's even a new, 200-floor endgame dungeon players can fight their way through, all in the name of upgrading their items even f

In this anime-inspired reboot, Clark Kent, Lois Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are all aspiring reporters for The Daily Planet. However, Clark wasn't able to hide his double life as Superman from either Lois or Jimmy for very long. Season 1 ended with the reveal of a Kryptonian warrior eying Earth for an invasion.

<p>While 2017's Thor: Ragnarok was hailed by many as the best Thor movie, the reception for Thor: Love and Thunder was considerably chillier when it arrived in theaters in 2022. Love and Thunder was financially successful with $760.9 million worldwide, but the reviews for its overly comedic tone were less than kind. Now, Thor star Chris Hemsworth is taking responsibility for Love and Thunder's shortcomings.</p><p>"I got caught up in the improv and the wackiness, and I became a parody of myself," said Hemsworth during a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/chris-hemsworth-cover-story">Vanity Fair</a> profile.

<p>Decades after making guest appearances on sitcoms and Star Trek, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson evolved from a key figure in the world of wrestling into becoming this generation's big action star and bonafide box-office needle-mover. After failing to helm his own corner at Warner Bros. with Black Adam, things have been rockier than rock-solid and it could be the beginning of a full-on rock slide.</p><p><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/dwayne-johnson-red-one-late-budget-problems/">TheWrap</a> is reporting that Johnson's actions on the set of his upcoming Christmas action movie, Red One, have him a nuisance at best and disgusting at worst. The movie, co-starring Chris Evans and J. K. Simmons as Santa, has Johnson as a bounty hunter out to save Santa after he gets kidnapped. Amazon had hopes of branching the movie into a formidable franchise, but in addition to a year-long delay said to be due to 2023's strikes, there may have been other issues with the production.</p><div><blockquote clas
