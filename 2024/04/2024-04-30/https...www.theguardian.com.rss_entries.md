<p>These are Real Madrid’s principles, and if you don’t like them … well, they have others. Carlo Ancelotti’s side were pummelled by Bayern Munich for long periods here, run left and right, hassled and jostled and almost toppled. And yet – of course – here they are, still standing, even marginal favourites courtesy of the magical right boot of Vinícius Júnior.</p><p>Vinícius’s late penalty salvaged a game that Thomas Tuchel and Bayern had threatened to snatch in four riotous second-half minutes. Tuchel’s half-time substitution stretched the game, changed the game, shook out two well-deserved goals by Harry Kane and the wonderful Leroy Sané to cancel Vinícius’s early strike. As the Bayern coach prepares to take his leave, this was a reminder that there are few better coaches in the world at the bespoke gameplan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/29/manchester-city-chelsea-champions-league-final-match-report-kai-havertz">for the big occasion</a>.</p> <a href="https:/

<p>Robert Muchamore’s series of novels about young undercover intelligence operatives with troubled lives shook up the sanitised world of early noughties YA literature</p><p>As a keen teenage reader in the noughties, I was a devout fan of Anthony Horowitz’s spy series Alex Rider. “What if James Bond was a teenager?” proved a compelling premise and even the truly terrible film adaptation didn’t put me off. But on a visit to my local library, I discovered a series with a completely different angle on the life of an adolescent undercover agent. That series was called Cherub, and it was first published 20 years ago today.</p><p>The young intelligence operatives of Robert Muchamore’s books were recruited from children’s homes and troubled lives by a super-secret wing of British intelligence. Cherub agents could go where grown-ups couldn’t for the simple reason that adult crooks would never suspect children of spying.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/30/cherub-cool-te

<p>Eponymous hero tackles a pooch-pinching operation by getting captured in this old-fashioned production</p><p>In some ways, the Lassie films are like the canine answer to the James Bond series. Both have literary antecedents, both have been big screen successes for MGM, and the basic formula remains essentially the same: a hero saves the day. The equivalent of Sean Connery is probably Pal, the rough collie dog who portrayed Lassie in seven feature films in the 1940s and 1950s. In Lassie: A New Adventure, Lassie is played by Bandit, who brings what is needed to the role, in a slick, handsome, functional way that suggests the Lassie franchise is perhaps in its Pierce Brosnan era, though unfortunately more Die Another Day doldrums than GoldenEye high point.</p><p>It bears mentioning at this point that the film is more properly titled Lassie – Ein Neues Abenteuer; this is a German production which has been fairly obviously dubbed into English, with the same director (Hanno Olderdissen)

<p>Creamy Spanish lentils are little marvels with wild garlic (or spinach), crumbly goat’s cheese, honey and a dash of sherry vinegar</p><p>When I was a child, Mum wouldn’t let me refuse lentils. If I left them, they’d be breakfast the next day – “They’re good for you!” – and I soon learned that being picky wasn’t wise in our house. Small, brown pardina lentils have thin skins, a creamy texture and earthy, herbal, peppery notes; they also hold their shape well, making them perfect for salads. It’s no surprise, then, that the finest examples from Tierra de Campos, the vast, semi-arid plains north of Valladolid, even have a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI).</p><p>Discover this recipe and over 1,000 more from your favourite cooks on <a href="https://app.adjust.com/1bgiux9n?creative=Endnotes&amp;fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Finsideguardian%2F2024%2Fapr%2F17%2Fintroducing-the-feast-app&amp;redirect_macos=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Finsideguardian

Our writer accompanies the founder on a ramble to Bath Spa station</p><p>A British railway station can be many things. A place of tended flowers and toytown paintwork. A concourse of shuttered ticket booths and overpriced pasties. A terminus, a meeting spot, a gateway to escape. It can be heart-lifting or drab, bathed in birdsong or heaving with commuters. It can also be the starting point for a properly good walk.</p><p>National Rail serves 2,593 stations, their locations scattered across the map like cartographic confetti. Many of them sit directly on longstanding hiking trails or within a short distance of paths worth exploring.

The planet is depopulated, or overpopulated, then riven by pandemics, droughts and disease. The seas drain away or rise, drowning everything. And even if the Earth itself survives, its inhabitants are easy pickings for the genocidal zombies, aliens, robots and artificial intelligences that artists have imagined along the way.</p><p>In less skilled hands this 10-Armageddons-a-page pace might make for a depressing read, but Lynskey’s encyclopedic knowledge (we race from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesj
