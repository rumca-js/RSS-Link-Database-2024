This video is exciting for us: We put some heavy work into new educational animations to explain abstract or challenging topics, like airflow through a cross-flow fan vs. axial vs. blower. The Meshless AIO mini-ITX case is a new computer case on the market with a unique thermal solution, using a cross-flow cylindrical fan rather than traditional computer fans. This can be the best fan for the job when in a cramped space, but requires the entire solution to be built ground-up around the fan. This video will go in-depth with airflow, thermals and temperature testing results, and will feature an animation to educate on how these bizarre (and relatively new, at j
