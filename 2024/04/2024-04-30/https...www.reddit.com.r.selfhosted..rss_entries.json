It just keeps boot looping and cycling through all the boot options before restarting. I've tried spamming F1 to get the setup manager but nothing happens. </p> <p>Notes - -No error lights on the board are flashing - No drives installed in the server, just want bios. - The raid controller and pcie devices are removed for trouble shooting. - All jumpers and switches set to default - keyboard does light up like the server is posting.</p> <p>I'm completely new to servers and just assumed they had a bios like a normal pc.
