Zynga's free-to-play 4v4 arena shooter Star Wars: Hunters finally has a release date after years of delays, with the game now set to arrive for Switch, iOS, and Android on 4th June.
</p><p>
Star Wars: Hunters was originally announced all the way back in March 2021, when it was planned to launch later that year. 2021 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zynga-shows-off-star-wars-hunters-for-switch-and-mobile">turned to 2022</a>, however, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zynga-delays-arena-shooter-star-wars-hunters-worldwide-launch-into-next-year">turned to 2023</a> after Zynga announced another delay to ensure the game met "the high expectations we are setting". And then, whoops, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zyngas-continually-delayed-star-wars-hunters-has-been-pushed-back-once-again">slipped yet again</a> into 2

Diablo 4's fourth season of post-launch content, Loot Reborn, arrives on 14th May and promises to be the dungeon-crawler's "biggest gameplay update yet".
</p><p>
As per Blizzard's <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24077223/galvanize-your-legend-in-season-4-loot-reborn">lengthy announcement</a>, Season 4: Loot Reborn is a little different to previous seasons; as well as delivering the expected limited-time seasonal content, it permanently overhauls "many core game systems" across both the Seasonal and Eternal Realms.
</p><p>
Itemisation is a particular focus, with Blizzard introducing changes to the way items "are earned, how they function, and how they improve" as players level through World Tiers during a season. "Dropped items are now simpler to evaluate," it explains "and we've moved their complexity and cust

Following Microsoft's announcement it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-with-mystery-game-direct">once again holding an Xbox Games Showcase this June</a>, a new report has shed some light on what we can expect to see - including a new Gears of War game and a reveal for the next Call of Duty.
</p><p>
That's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145262/xbox-games-showcase-summer-2024-call-of-duty-direct">according to The Verge's Tom Warren</a>, citing "sources familiar with [Microsoft&rsquo;s] plans".

Square Enix has abandoned a number of in-development projects, resulting in a &yen;22.1 bn (&pound;112m) loss for the financial year.
</p><p>
The news was shared today in a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20240430_01_en.pdf">Notification of Recognition of Extraordinary Losses</a> to shareholders detailing a decision made back in March, as the company reviews its consolidated forecasts for the fiscal year ended March 2024.
</p><p>
These "content abandonment losses" are part of Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu's streamlining of the company's output of games, "with the intention of being more selective and focused in the allocation of development resources".

It's a diving game and I can barely swim, but that hasn't mattered a bit. It's a game in which nothing much happens, and what does happen only happens very slowly. Don't mind. It's a game with a thirty-player multiplayer component, which is theoretically the big draw, but feels like the wrong way to play.</p><p>All of this is to say: I'm not sure that Endless Ocean Luminous is particularly good - and I certainly wouldn't want every game to be like this. But I've really enjoyed it so far.</p><p>This is a diving game. You're deep beneath the oceans, wet-suited up, and you're a scientist of some kind, which in this game means you point at fish.

The Xbox Games Showcase will be livestreamed on 9th June at 6pm UK time (10am PT, 1pm ET) across <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/YouTube.com/Xbox">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Facebook.com/Xbox">Facebook</a> (plus an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Twitch.tv/XboxASL">ASL version</a>). It's the first showcase with games from Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda, Activision and Blizzard, as well as other third-party developers.

If you played the Steam demo of Pine Hearts - an emotional indie game from Hyper Luminal Games - and it left you wanting more, I have good news. It will be released in full on Steam next month. Oh, and that's not all. Even though it was initially pegged to be a PC only release, it will also be coming to Nintendo Switch at the same time.
</p><p>
Pine Hearts will arrive on both platforms on 23rd May, publisher Little Nook announced today. The game is described as a "heartfelt love letter to all those who have experienced loss", and one which will provide players with a "welcoming and cosy refuge" where they can unwind and reminisce on fond memories. 
</p><p>
It all takes place in Pine Hearts Caravan Park. Here, players will take control of Tyke, who will reflect on the time he spent with his father while at the park. Along with meeting fello

Deliver Us Mars developer KeokeN Interactive has laid off its team due to a lack of publishing options for its forthcoming projects, but vows to rebuild in future to continue the legacy of its games.

The news was revealed in a lengthy statement on social media site X from CEO Koen Deetman and managing director Paul Deetman.
</p><p>
"Heartbroken, we've had to lay off our team at KeokeN because of nothing substantial materialising directly after our visit to GDC," the statement reads. "We've unfortunately exhausted all our possible options for publishing, work for hire, and co-development."

Considering the huge success of the Fallout TV show, it may be surprising that Bethesda doesn't have a new game to coincide with its release.
</p><p>
Yet Bethesda boss Todd Howard believes the franchise is healthy and turns to the "sneaky popular" MMORPG Fallout 76 as a key indicator.
</p><p>
Howard was interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wvqF41_Bgw&amp;t=3404s">Kinda Funny Games</a> and was asked whether Bethesda wanted a new game in the series alongside the TV show, beyond the Fallout 4 new-gen patch.

Let's be honest. Whenever playing a Jackbox party game, the urge is always there to make things a little bit more risqu&eacute; than the developer may have originally had in mind. Don't lie, we all do it. 
</p><p>
Well, it turns out that Jackbox is well aware of those players that like to 'go there' (wink, wink, nudge, nudge), and has devised an adult's only collection of games known as the Naughty Pack as a result. This pack will comprise three "provocative" games, which the Jackbox team promises will "deliver on laughter, wit, and a touch of irreverence".
</p><p>
What these three games are, however, remain a mystery for now. More will be revealed throughout the summer, the Jackbox team said, with the pack itself set to release later this year. In the meantime, you can watch a little teaser for the Jackbox Naughty Pack featuring

In addition to the four Pals, it looks like a flamethrower weapon will be added. Presumably, too, we'll get the Arena mode that was recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-best-of-the-triple-i-showcase">teased at the Triple-i showcase</a>, which looks a bit like Pok&eacute;mon Stadium.

</p><p>
So who are the four new Pals? We don't yet know the names, but the first is a frog with a stick. Does it look like a Pok&eacute;mon? No, it's a frog with a stick.
