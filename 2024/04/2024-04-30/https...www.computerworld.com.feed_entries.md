<p>More than a year and a half after the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1612473/us-senate-approves-52-billion-for-chipmakersbut-not-designers.html">CHIPS and Science Act was signed into law</a>, the Biden Administration has begun divvying up $52.7 billion in funding and tax incentives meant to spur semiconductor production on US soil, though the actual funding has yet to be dispersed.</p>



<p>Over the past several months, the administration, which championed the legislation, has allocated about $29 billion in funding among chipmakers, including Samsung, TSMC and Intel. In return, various chip designers and makers have pledged about $300 billion in current and future projects in th

Instead, Apple is <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2067633/why-is-apple-so-focused-on-vision-ai.html">accelerating at speed</a> to make people happy for a while with American AI.</p>



<p>How do we know the company is moving fast? With more than 160,000 direct employees globally and hundreds of thousands more across partner firms, suppliers, and the currently beleaguered App economy, when the ship that is Apple moves in a direction the rumor mill usually indicates the destination.
