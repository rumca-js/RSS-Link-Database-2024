What portable monitors sacrifice in size over a standard monitor they make up for in myriad other ways: Portable monitors are relatively inexpensive, easy to connect, and, best of all, portable. Whether you&rsquo;re a student, someone who works from home, or a globe-trotting executive, the ability to easily pack up and move a portable monitor when needed is appealing indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, the portable monitor market is a bit of a mess currently. The widespread availability of these displays and the ability to manufacture them cheaply has resulted in a onslaught of  unknown brands on the market.
