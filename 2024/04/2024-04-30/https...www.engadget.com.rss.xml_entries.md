<p>A federal judge has sentenced Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (often known as “CZ”) to four months in prison, as first <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/technology/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-sentenced.html">reported by</a> <em>The New York Times</em>. Prosecutors had recommended three years. Zhao <a href="https://www.engadget.com/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-steps-down-as-ceo-will-plead-guilty-to-federal-charges-210627469.html">pleaded guilty in November</a> to violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to set up an anti-money-laundering program.</p>
<p>The DOJ accused Zhao of allowing criminal activity to flourish on the crypto exchange. “Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in November.</p>

While the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_2373">European Commission’s statement</a> doesn’t explicitly mention Russia, Meta confirmed to Engadget the EU probe targets the country’s Doppelganger campaign, an online disinformation operation pushing pro-Kremlin propaganda.</p>

<p>While a direct competitor to browsers like Chrome and Edge, Arc is actually quite unique. It features a collapsible sidebar with vertical tabs and bookmarks, so there are no tabs up top. This gives users a clean view of the actual website they’re visiting, without any unnecessary clutter. It also lets people build spaces to keep things organized, which kind of works like folders on a desktop. Looking for recipes and applying for jobs at th

<p>The event will be followed by a cryptic “<strong>[REDACTED]</strong> Direct” that probably isn’t much of a mystery.

<p>I found myself in a variety of odd situations while solving puzzles in <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>. I spent some time staring at a mid-century movie poster for a documentary about a decomposing cat, wondering if I should focus on the runtime or the date it came out. I pulled up old hotel blueprints and deciphered the math of dead architects. I played a handful of ASCII-style PC games to receive messages from a 19th-century magician who calls me his sister. I found some toy blocks and shoved them into the walls of a secret cathedral. I slipped between realities and traversed a maze that shattered into shard-like pieces under my feet. I watched a woman fall to her death. I wondered if that woman was me.</p>
<p><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is a third-person noir detective game set in a haunted hotel with impossible architecture and a gruesome history. Its hallways are dense with logic-melting puzzles about magicians, mazes, astrology, filmmaking, mausoleums and physics,

<p>Instagram is overhauling its recommendation algorithm for Reels to boost “original content” in a move that will have significant implications for aggregator accounts and others that primarily repost other users’ work. The company is also changing the way it ranks Reels in an attempt to give smaller accounts more distribution in the app.</p>
<p>In a blog post announcing the changes, the company said it’s trying to “correct” its ranking system so that accounts with smaller followings will have an easier time expanding their reach. “Historically because of how we’ve ranked content, creators with large followings and aggregators of reposted content have gotten more reach in recommendations than smaller, original content creators,” the company explains. “We think it’s important to correct this to give all creators a more equal chance of breaking through to new audiences.”</p>
