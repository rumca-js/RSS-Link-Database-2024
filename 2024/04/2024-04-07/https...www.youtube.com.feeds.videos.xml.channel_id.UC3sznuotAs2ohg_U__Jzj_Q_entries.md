Loyal Theorists, our Spidey-Senses tingled when we saw that Sony dropped a new Spider-Verse short film called “The Spider Within.” But then our Theorist-Senses started tingling, and we wondered… just _what_ is up with Spider-Man’s Spider-Sense? It’s been different for the Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland versions of Peter Parker. And now the same is true for Miles Morales. Join us to find out what’s really causing Miles’ senses to tingle and how we can best handle them so he doesn’t end up being his own worst enemy (yes, even worse than the Green Goblin).
