I use these car fuses a lot, and I always expected that they protect my circuits from overcurrent and possible burning, but I never checked if they work. Particularly since I started to work with Lithium batteries capable of delivering huge currents and even burning if you are unlucky, the danger increased dramatically. Do I also have bad Chinese stuff? I am sure you want to know the truth, too. So, let\u2019s check out my fuses from AliExpress and Amazon and compare them with the proper ones from Bosch.
