<p>The art of developing a healthy relationship with our own mortality lies in neither avoiding the reality of suffering nor obsessing over it</p><p>Over the last year, I have spent a lot of time eating pre-packaged sandwiches in hospital cafeterias. I often joke that those of us who are lucky enough to hit 35 will have at least one, if not multiple, serious health scares every year. At some point, however, we will face much more than a simple scare – serious illness can impact anyone, any time, with little notice.</p><p>As well as being a source of stress, pain, and discomfort, unwanted health diagnoses have the radical potential to upend our lives and ignite burning questions relating to impermanence and human suffering which we may not have considered in the past. We may come face-to-face with our shared vulnerability for the first time – which was present all along – as well as the indisputable fact that we are all but one breath away from a health crisis or poor prognosis.</p> <a

Three weeks later they edged Munster by a point to lift the cup and three years after that a future flying winger entered the world.</p><p>This was a contest dripping with narrative but the headline was supplied by Hendy who scored two breathtaking tries as a substitute to win an epic contest for his team. Having just come on at the hour mark with the game locked at 14-14, he flew down the tram with his first touch of the ball to finish with a flourish in the corner. Then with seven minutes to play he gathered a bouncing loose ball and beat two defenders to touch down again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/07/northampton-munster-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report

The Red Bull driver comfortably beat his teammate Sergio Pérez into second place at Suzuka, with Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz in third. George Russell and Lewis Hamilton made little headway, finishing in seventh and ninth, with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc in fourth and McLaren’s Lando Norris in fifth.</p><p>For Verstappen this was another consolidation of the control he has already exerted over the season in the opening four meetings. He has won three of them with ease and would likely have been on top in the last round in Australia but for the brake failure which ended his race. His consistency remains remarkable, since the Miami GP last year he has been beaten only twice, both times by Sai

The film’s hero, Harry Caul, fears the future his job as a professional wiretapper helps to create, one in which surveillance threatens to encroach on everyday life and anti-government paranoia runs so rampant that truth seem as graspable as sand through your fingers. What would Harry make of a world where small cameras are ubiquitous in public spaces and people voluntarily give away information about themselves on social media or ice cream apps?</p><p>Consider Harry’s 44th birthday, which he celebrates by changing his mailing address to a PO Box and breaking up with a sometime girlfriend

<p>Two mega-polls suggest that the Tories are heading for a defeat more catastrophic than they experienced in 1997. What if they’re right?</p><p>Reader, I was there. It was shortly after 3am on 2 May 1997 when the Labour celebrations at the Royal Festival Hall turned from noisy exuberance at the prospect of a landslide election victory to unrestrained delirium about the epic scale of the losses being inflicted on the Tories. It was the result from Enfield Southgate that did it. When Michael Portillo, who had been widely tipped to become the next Conservative leader, was evicted from a seat that had previously looked impregnable, the Labour crowd erupted in visceral chanting of: “Out! Out! Out!” Loathed as the pomaded embodiment of the Tory arrogance and division of that era, he was one of seven cabinet ministers who were culled by the electoral reaper that night.</p><p>For his entertaining blow-by-blow account of events, Brian Cathcart chose the title: <em>Were You Still Up for Portil

<p>The British actor’s directorial debut is a visceral love letter to global action cinema that’s an exhilarating, if messy, ride</p><p>With his directorial debut <em>Monkey Man</em>, which he also co-wrote and stars in, Dev Patel (<em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>, <em>Lion</em>) cements himself both as an action star with A-list ambitions and a competent, resourceful B-movie director. This extravagantly violent and exuberantly messy revenge flick is set in a contemporary India (in a fictional city called Yatana) in which there seems to be a neon-drenched, sleaze-sodden brothel to suit every budget. It’s a place where power and money pollute, and where the poor are not just invisible, they are regarded as being less than human and little more than animals.</p><p>Patel takes this idea and runs with it, by incorporating the Indian caste system and class divisions into the story and drawing from the Hindu legend of the monkey-faced demigod Hanuman. When we meet Patel’s unnamed character – he

<p>This new biography describes Haring as a nimble, spontaneous performer and an artist of endearing naivety who was nevertheless corrupted by his popularity</p><p>Keith Haring’s career began underground, but soon zoomed to stratospheric altitudes. His cartoons of irradiated babies, attributed to an anonymous scribbler known as Chalkman, began to crawl along the walls of New York subway stations in 1978. A few years later, now a household name, Haring was shuttling across the Atlantic by Concorde, commissioned to daub liberating slogans on the Berlin Wall, to paint gymnasts cavorting on a tower at a children’s hospital in Paris, and to decorate a Tuscan monastery with a crucified Christ who supports a lolloping dolphin on his bowed shoulders. A typical side trip took him to Monaco to receive an award from Princess Caroline. In his spare time he lucratively sketched a label for Absolut vodka, painted a BMW, and opened the Pop Shop to sell branded T-shirts in New York and Tokyo.</p><p>I
