Incidents of physical assault, he argued, were only the most visible part of domestic abuse.</p><p>Drawing on 30 years of research as a forensic social worker, he documented a broader and more devastating pattern of manipulative behaviours and subjugation, closer to kidnapping or slavery, that he called “coercive control”.

Do they herald the end of the level playing field, or are they the saviour of long-distance racing?</p><p>The 31-year-old British athlete Phil Sesemann arrived at the Seville marathon in February with a clear aim: to run the 26.2-mile course in less then two hours, eight minutes and 10 seconds. If he recorded that time or went faster, he’d meet the British qualifying standard to compete for Team GB at this summer’s Olympics in Paris; one second slower, he would be watching the race from his sofa at home in Leeds.</p><p>Having a plan and executing it are, of course, very different propositions, especially in the marathon, a fabled distance that has been sadistically breaking hearts, minds and bodies for more than two millennia. And the qualifying time was no small achievement: only three British men had ever run faster. Add to this that Sesemann, who has dark hair and the angular handsomeness of Cillian Murph

But how long is she supposed to wait for it? And is there a right path to love? Love Steps goes through the ups and downs of modern dating, weaving the rush of new love with sadness and fading lust.</p><p>Told mainly in poetry and rhyming verse, the play is a series of snapshots into 34-year-old Anna’s (Sharon Rose) search for the one. She swipes through unsuitable bachelors on dating apps and gets let down by those who are intimidated by her success or want to move too fast too soon. As a black woman, she is constantly objectified and fetishised online by strangers. The pressure to settle down is drummed into her: family members ask her when it’s going to happen

<p>A spoilt queen strives to reclaim her throne from revolting peasants in a film that feels more like a sweary episode of Horrible Histories </p><p>Britain, the dark ages. Spoiled dimwit monarch Queen Dagan (<em>Sex Education</em>’s Aimee Lou Wood) is toppled by an insurrection led by woman of the people Humble Joan (Nicola Coughlan, best known for <em>Bridgerton</em> and <em>Derry Girls</em>). With just her quick-witted maidservant Shulmay (Lolly Adefope) and Bobik (Nick Frost), an itinerant manure shoveller, for support, Dagan must make her way across lands that are hostile to her and all she stands for in the hope of mustering support and reclaiming her throne. Despite a cast that reads like a who’s who of British comedy, both rising and established, this broad romp is only sporadically funny. The quixotic, child-queen character was crueler and sharper when she was played by Miranda Richardson in <em>Blackadder</em>; the small-screen tone of the picture makes it feel like a duff e

<p>The colours and fabrics of my mother’s old saris are a thread linking me to my Indian ancestors</p><p>It’s my first memory. I’m watching my mother put on her sari in her old bedroom in Southall. It’s 1969 and I’m two years old. It’s early evening, all dark browns and blacks in my mind, like a sepia-tinted film. I remember the long white petticoat, tied at her waist with string, her figure defined by a dim light from the hallway. She starts wrapping her body in the lengths of material, quickly tucking the first layer into the petticoat. Part of the sari is still lying in a heap on the floor, before she transforms it magically with her hands into an outfit that fully envelops her.</p><p>This is the primal image I carry around with me – of my mother, her body and her sari, imprinted for ever in my consciousness.

<p>Removing dams, weirs and culverts is hugely beneficial to river-dwelling species and the environment as a whole – but there may be risks in a densely populated, flood-prone country</p><p>Dotted along the length of Britain’s rivers are various obstacles – some as large as dams, others as small as weirs (which bisect a river like steps) – stopping creatures, sediment and plants from moving along the watercourse. Only <a href="https://amber.international/portfolio-item/small-barriers-in-denmark-and-the-uk/">1% of the UK’s rivers</a> are free of artificial barriers.</p><p>Moves are under way in many countries to remove such obstacles and let rivers “re-naturalise” and follow their own paths. But while many scientists agree that river barriers need to go in the UK too, other people are hesitant – concerned about creating unpredictable water flows in already flood-prone regions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/07/removing-barriers-dams-rivers-run-free-britai

<p>As the organisation’s anniversary nears, borders around the world are closing again</p><p>When trade ministers gathered in the Moroccan city of Marrakech 30 years ago this month to sign the agreement creating the World Trade Organization (WTO), the mood was celebratory. The Berlin Wall had come down only recently, communism had collapsed, and there was optimistic talk of how the body would prise open new markets and act as the arbiter when disputes broke out between countries.</p><p>The atmosphere today is much darker than it was in April 1994.

It’s also a paradise for hikers and serious mountain bikers – with 10 peaks over 2,000m. Le Marche’s capital is Ancona – four hours from Rome by train.</p> <a

He didn’t want it performed but his third wife, against his wishes, authorised a posthumous production in 1956. The rawly autobiographical work features a mother addicted to morphine, a father entranced by memories of himself as a classical actor, one tubercular and one alcoholic son; the pain of it can be gauged by the fact that a dead baby i

The country has faced dire peril many times since then, but rarely, if ever, have the external and internal threats to its continued existence appeared so dangerous and pernicious.

It also recalls a time when great sporting moments were to be experienced in the moment or not at all – before the advent of video recorders, let alone a screen in every pocket. Red Rum came in

The great thing about them is how effortlessly they can slip into your routines. Want a summer glow without foundation? A CC base will give you subtle highlights and coverage with just one blend. Or there is the simplicity of a multi-stick: some give your cheeks, lips and eyes a unified colour, while others work as a highlight and contour duo. The combinations are endless. And the best thing about these hardworking multitaskers is that you tend to spend less – one purchase works more for your money.</p><p><strong>1.
