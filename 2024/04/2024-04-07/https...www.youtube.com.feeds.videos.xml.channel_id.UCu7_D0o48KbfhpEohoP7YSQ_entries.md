When I saw this video from Louis Rossmann or this one by Tom, a fellow HAM radio operator, I said to myself: Holy shit! I use these car fuses a lot, and I always expected that they protect my circuits from overcurrent and possible burning, but I never checked if they work. Particularly since I started to work with Lithium batteries capable of delivering huge currents and even burning if you are unlucky, the danger increased dramatically. Do I also have bad Chinese stuff? I am sure you want to know the truth, too. So, letâ€™s check out my fuses from AliExpress and Amazon and compare them with the proper ones from Bosch. And I will show you how you can test yours without expensive gear.
