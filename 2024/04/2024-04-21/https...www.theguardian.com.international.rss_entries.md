<p></p><p>The league opened with Jude Bellingham and it closed with him too. Way back in August, the Englishman stood before the stands at the place they call the Cathedral and opened his arms wide having scored on the first night of the rest of his life; now, eight months later, he did it again, the entire Santiago Bernabéu welcomed in, all 77,981 of them, and millions more around the world. It has become a trademark, and it meant the title.</p><p>Ninety minutes were up in the biggest game on earth and it was 2-2 when Lucas Vázquez, tireless all night, delivered one last pass towards the far post, and there was Bellingham, the man to whom this season will always belong. Thundering in at the far post, he struck it first time with his left foot into the roof of the net, to send this place wild. It was his seventeenth league goal – no one has more – and it was the one that as good as secured the title.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/21/bellingham-settles-clas

<p>The radical right is set to dominate forthcoming European elections. Progressives need a fresh start and a new approach</p><p>The political signals coming from France are ominous. According to one <a href="https://twitter.com/Mij_Europe/status/1780624500196843886/photo/1">poll</a> last week, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party (RN) has increased its lead to a runaway 15 points ahead of June’s European elections. For Emmanuel Macron, who pledged to use the French presidency to halt the rise of the far right, all indicators point to a humiliating defeat that would overshadow the remainder of his second term. But ahead of what will surely be the most important presidential election for a generation, in 2027, the numbers also send a powerful message to France’s perennially divided left.</p><p>Add up support for the four main progressive parties, which are running separate European campaigns, and their combined share of the vote comes within touching distance of the RN.

One is her constituency agent in Norfolk. Told she is thinking about running for the Tory leadership, he tells Liz Truss it would be for the best if she lost. Another is her husband, Hugh.

The third prescient person is the late queen, who concludes the formalities appointing Truss as prime minister with the warning: “Pace yourself.”</p><p>“Maybe I should have listened,” muses the author, one of the very few acknowledgments she offers to the reader that she might have got the odd thing wrong.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/21/ten-years-to-save-the-west-by-liz-truss-review-economical-with-th

<p>Guitarist, singer and founding member of the Allman Brothers Band best known for writing their 1973 hit Ramblin’ Man</p><p>Dickey Betts, who has died aged 80, was a founder member of the Allman Brothers Band, one of the most influential US “southern rock” groups of the 1970s. The hard-living outfit blazed out of Jacksonville, Florida, in 1969 with a mix of rock, blues, country and jazz that defined the genre, also influencing artists such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, ZZ Top, the Black Crowes and Kid Rock. They scored several platinum and gold albums and were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p>Although the six-piece band was ostensibly led by the blond- haired Allman brothers, Duane and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/28/gregg-allman-obituary">Gregg </a>(guitar and keyboards/vocals respectively), as joint lead guitarist, singer and main songwriter Betts played a crucial role.

But as online clips of the 39-year-old Democrat in his city of Baltimore varsity jacket began circulating, the conversation around the bridge collapse shifted from Scott’s emergency management strategy to his skin color. “This is Baltimore’s DEI mayor,” read one viral X post panning Scott, who is Black. “It’s going to get so, so much worse. Prepare accordingly.”</p><p>Before long the Maryland governor, Wes Moore, and port commissioner, Karenthia Barber, were also attacked as DEI agents and blamed for what maritime authorities have repeatedly described as a shipping accident. “This is what happens when you have Governors who prioritize diversity over the wellbeing and

Is the solution actually surprisingly simple?</p><p>I am standing in my bedroom in my boxers and a T-shirt, while a man I have just met fiddles with my legs. His name is Parthasarathi, and he’s here with his boss Julius, who has come to set me up for a polysomnogram – AKA a sleep study. Once they have glued electrodes all over my legs, chest and head, and stuck a cannula into my nostrils, and clipped a monitor to one of my fingers, and strapped more electronics to my chest and waist, and trained an infra-red camera on my bed, and given the Guardian’s photographer a good laugh, they’ll be leaving me for the night. Then all this kit will track how long and deeply I am sleeping, how much I am snoring, how twitchy my legs are, how often I get out of bed, whether I talk, walk or … I don’t know, <em>juggle</em> in my sleep, what’s happening to my blood oxygen levels, what my heart’s

She’ll tell me very easily if something’s not right.” But occasionally – as with a baklava cheesecake that Hayden was developing last year – all criticisms fall away. “She’s like: ‘I’ve got nothing.

<p>Restaurants are serving more unusual cuts of meat, with animal heads staring up at diners to teach them about their food</p><p>Offal has become a staple on restaurant menus across the UK, with cheaper cuts attracting chefs with sustainability goals and tight budgets, boosted by the influence of nose-to-tail pioneers such as Fergus Henderson at St&nbsp;John in London. Now many are going further, creating dishes with animal heads staring at diners from their plates.</p><p>At Fowl in central London, which describes itself as a “beak-to-feet chicken restaurant”, the Sunday roast comes complete with chicken claws. At Manteca in Shoreditch, east London, you might find half a pig’s head, clearly identifiable, on your table. Newly opened Camille in Borough Market, south London serves a chicken-neck sausage, including the bird’s head.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/21/uk-chefs-offal-nose-to-tail-heads-claws-snouts-restaurants-cheaper-cuts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sweeping security measures designed to empower police and armed forces against organised crime</p><p>Ecuadoreans will vote on Sunday in a referendum on a raft of unprecedented security measures designed to empower the police and armed forces in the fight against spiralling violence and organised crime.</p><p>Voters must accept or reject 11 questions, mostly about security, in the plebiscite, which is being seen as a test of support for Ecuador’s popular young president. Daniel Noboa who took office in November on the pledge to combat the surge in violent crime, put forward the poll to push through proposals to retake control of prisons and tame soaring homicide rates.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/21/ecuador-referendum-vote-security-measures">Continue reading...</a>

He beat McLaren’s Lando Norris, who did superbly to take what was an unexpected and hugely-impressive second place, while Sergio Pérez was third for Red Bull. Lewis Hamilton came back to ninth having started in 18<sup>th</sup>, a far better result than he expected in a car which was not performing.
