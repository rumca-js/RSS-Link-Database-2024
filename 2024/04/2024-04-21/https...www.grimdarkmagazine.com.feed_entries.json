The novel hinges on the relationship between its two lead protagonists. Niels Bosch is an autistic priest with a mysterious and disturbing past. His newly arrived cantor, Beldenka Nadinov, is a physically disabled woman who uses a wheelchair. Although both Niels and Bel harbor plenty of pain from the past, the shy priest is reluctant to share personal details with his spirited cantor. Meanwhile, Bel focuses on overcoming society\u2019s view of her as a cripple and a so-called \u201cReject.\u201d She is unrelentingly positive in the face of prejudice and discrimination, displaying a strength that far surpasses anyone\u2019s expectations. Night\u2019s Reign has excellent representation of physical disability, neurodivergence, and mental health issues. A large fraction of the novel involves exploring the characters\u2019 backstories as they try to overcome trauma from the past", "language": "en-AU", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-nights-reign-by-daan-katz", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 137, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "REVIEW: Night\u2019s Reign by Daan Katz", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
