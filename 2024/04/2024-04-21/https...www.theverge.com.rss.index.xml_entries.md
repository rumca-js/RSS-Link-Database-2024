  <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="BPPYdi">A couple of weeks ago, I ran out of screen on the <em>one </em>external monitor my work-issued MacBook Air can run. So I switched to my five-year-old Windows desktop and plugged in another monitor. Love it. Productivity through the roof. But it means that I’m finally spending significant time in Windows 11, and <em>gosh, </em>is it janky.</p>

  <p id="Ddm8pN">Six weeks ago, I was having a tough time sticking to my running routines and goals. Physically, I was mostly fine. Mentally, the thought of running — a sport I usually love — made me roll into a blanket burrito and never leave my bed. I started hating myself, but none of my usual fitness apps and trackers were helping. After building a weeklong streak, I couldn’t muster the energy to get out of bed one Saturday. I broke it and spent the next day wallowing in guilt and self-pity.</p>

  <p id="TOvd4M">At any given time, there are between five and eight phones on my desk. And by “my desk,” I mean any combination of tables and countertops throughout my house. So when I watched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review">the Humane AI Pin reviews</a> start pouring in last week, I did what any logical person would do: grab the closest phone and try to turn it into my own AI wearable.</p>
