<p>Tesla has reduced the price of its Full Self-Driving software in the US and Canada. Per a post from the company on <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/tesla_na/status/1781910384674320421">X</a>, it now costs $8,000 in the US (or $11,000 for buyers in Canada) to add the so-called Full Self-Driving (FSD) Capability. This is down from $12,000 ($16,000 CAD), according to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/21/tesla-lowers-price-of-full-self-driving-to-8000-down-from-12000/"><em>Electrek</em></a>, which also reports that Tesla has discontinued the $6,000 Enhanced Autopilot option. Current owners with that package can upgrade to FSD for $2,000.</p>

<p>President Biden this weekend <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/04/20/bill-signed-h-r-7888/"><ins>signed into law</ins></a> a bill that reauthorizes a controversial spying program under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Section 702 of FISA, which has now been extended for two more years, allows for warrantless intelligence gathering on foreign targets. While its focus is on the communications of targets located outside the US, that includes any exchanges with people stateside, meaning Americans’ records can get swept up in these collections too.</p>
<p>The Senate vote on reauthorizing Section 702 came down to the wire. It was set to expire on Friday at midnight, but was recently given an extension until April 2025, according to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/us/politics/surveillance-bill-fisa.html"><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a>, lest it lapse while
