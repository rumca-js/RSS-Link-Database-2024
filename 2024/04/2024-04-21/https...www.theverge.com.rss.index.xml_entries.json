Physically, I was mostly fine. Mentally, the thought of running \u2014 a sport I usually love \u2014 made me roll into a blanket burrito and never leave my bed. I started hating myself, but none of my usual fitness apps and trackers were helping. After building a weeklong streak, I couldn\u2019t muster the energy to get out of bed one Saturday. I broke it and spent the next day wallowing in guilt and self-pity.</p>\n<p id=\"ifELyc\">Fed up, I went digging around the internet and ended up downloading the <a href=\"https://", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/24134067/gentler-streak-app-ios-apple-watch", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "source_obj__id": 359, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Gentler Streak quieted my evil brain goblin so I could run in peace", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-21T13:00:00+00:00", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro on pink and blue backgrounds showing home screens with mineral wallpaper\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hvwasclRNOXTKaE27IhSHSP3BAg=/21x0:1980x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73294039/DSC05706.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption><em>It\u2019s phones, y\u2019all.</em> | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"TOvd4M\">At any given time, there are between five and eight phones on my desk.
