Switching your Windows or Linux PCs on and off automatically or from a remote location can be important. In this video, you will learn how to do this from Home Assistant, Node-Red, and the Linux shell. As an example, I will save about 99% of the energy used by my Proxmox Backup server because it only runs a few minutes a day. I will also start a Windows PC in our remote radio station—all free of charge, of course. Wake-on-LAN is the “magic” word.
