Overall, Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is good. The world is beautiful, recruiting is fun, and there are plenty of minigames to sink time into if you’d like. I just wish its story had more meat to it rather than feeling like a generic tale I’ve heard time and time again. It is good, but just don’t expect to be blown away by some epic saga that will have you on the edge of your seat. Also, get used to dying because you will, a lot. If you’re a fan of classic ’90s JRPGs, I’d recommend it, and even if you’ve never played one but like JRPGs like Octopath Traveler, you’d probably find it fun.
