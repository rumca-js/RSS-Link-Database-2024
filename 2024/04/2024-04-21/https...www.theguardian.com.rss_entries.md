Then the bodies start to pile up …</p><p>If it’s Sunday – or Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday – it must be time for a serviceable new thriller starring Richard Armitage. They’re usually on Netflix and adapted from a Harlan Coben bestseller (The Stranger, Stay Close, Fool Me Once); though they’re also sometimes on Netflix and adapted from a Josephine Hart novel (Damage, renamed Obsession for TV). This time, he is serviceably thrilling on ITV1 and ITVX in Red Eye, written by Peter A Dowling (with Jingan Young taking on episode four).</p><p>Armitage is Dr Matthew Nolan, first seen stumbling out of a Beijing nightclub with a knife wound, before smashing his car into a traffic barrier in an attempt, one assumes, to avoid another stabbing.

<p>Liverpool discovered their shooting boots by the Thames and, in doing so, kept the three-way title race alive. Only a win would do if Jürgen Klopp was to retain serious hope of a spectacular send-off and it looked in serious doubt when Timothy Castagne equalised Trent Alexander-Arnold’s sumptuous free-kick as half-time loomed. A heavily rotated side needed to come back out firing and did exactly what Klopp would have demanded, scoring through Ryan Gravenberch and Diogo Jota before locking the remainder down. They move level on points with Arsenal ahead of Wednesday’s derby at Goodison Park.</p><p>Klopp had made five changes, loading his bench with attacking power and hoping a freshening-up might shake off the profligacy that had been costly over the previous fortnight. Within three minutes it was clear things might not be so simple: Luiz Díaz should probably have scored, or left the ball for a better placed Cody Gakpo, after attacking Alexander-Arnold’s cross but his header skidded

<p>A promising first novel takes a jazzy, improvised journey with a young woman who has a sudden loss of hearing</p><p>A good test of a writer is to take a high concept and stretch it. In <em>The Hearing Test</em>, the debut novel by American Eliza Barry Callahan, a young woman loses her hearing – or most of it – without warning. One day, she hears a “deep drone”, and then her hearing is all “rolling thunder… like God adjusting his piano stool but never getting around to the song”.</p><p>When having her sudden deafness investigated, doctors tell her she has sudden deafness, a diagnosis that reiterates the question it seeks to answer. The problem is intimately close but impossible to resolve. “We can get to the moon, but we can’t get to the inner ear,” she’s told. As a result, her treatment is “a work of improvisation. Like jazz.”</p><p><em>The Hearing Test</em> by Eliza Barry Callahan is published by Peninsula Press (£10.99). To support the<em> Guardian</em> and <em>Observer</em> orde

## Gill Meller’s secret ingredient: smoked paprika

<p>This spice gives anything from meat and fish to roast vegetables a deep, savoury hit. A little can go a long way</p><p>Whether at the fore or as a gentle hint, smoked paprika always plays its part quite nicely. It has a deep, savoury hit, and using a little can go a long way.</p><p>One of the things I’ve done for years, and encourage people to try, is make my own chorizo sausage. It’s super easy and quite rewarding. But it all starts with some good free-range, organic minced pork, preferably belly or shoulder, and some really good paprika. I add three types: a really good smoked paprika, a sweet paprika, and a hot paprika. Then I mix in fennel seeds, garlic, a little bit of red wine and salt, then give it a really good tumble. If you add enough salt, say 2% (so, for 1kg of mix, add 20g salt), it will actually preserve the mixture, and you can pop it in the fridge, and it will last for a week to 10 days. Or you can freeze batches of it, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/

<p>Plans for 2,500 new homes outside the historic market town of Faversham have gone down badly with some residents. But the UK needs housing, and this is a promising site…</p><p>“We’re all proud to have a king,” laments a resident of Faversham in Kent, “but we thought he was going to be a custodian of the land and look after it.” “Disgusting”, says a passerby, walking her dog, when asked her opinion of proposals by the Duchy of Cornwall to build almost 2,500 houses on the edge of the town. “The feel of the town is changing,” says Carol Smith, a lifelong resident who says she will move out if planning permission is granted: “It breaks my heart.” The Duchy of Cornwall is, of course, the private estate (687 years old and covering just over 200 square miles) of the Prince of Wales. These plans were a pet project of Charles III, from the time when he held that title.</p><p>It wasn’t meant to be like this. “Beauty” in architecture, according to the campaign group <a href="https://www.creat

<p>Fly away home… You can have too much of a good thing</p><p>‘Look, a ladybird!’ This was how it started. My family were staying the night in a bed and breakfast near friends in rural England – we had driven through a landscape the colour of butter to park under a hillside upon which the shadows of clouds passed like curtains closing. I was medicated, pleasantly, can you tell, in a hangover from the most painful migraine of my life, and the clouds reminded me of the visual aura that flickers across your vision just before the headache begins. We put our bag on a chair, and there, inside the window frame, was a ladybird. And then, look, there was another one. The children gathered, by the window ready to be enchanted.</p><p>A group of ladybirds is called a “loveliness”, which, to me, sounds suspicious. Sounds problematic even.

<p>​Rachel Lambert’s perceptive tale of a ​l​oner with a vividly imaginative inner life​ proves an unexpected showcase for the Star Wars actor​’s talents</p><p>Some people settle effortlessly into the business of living.

Fran (a revelatory performance from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/07/daisy-ridley-jj-abrams-star-wars-a-religion">Daisy Ridley</a>) falls into the latter camp. A painfully introverted thirtysomething office worker, Fran has barricaded herself behind a rigid routine that minimises the risk of social interaction, both at work and after it. It’s not that she’s antisocial exactly, just that she has never quite grasped the rules of small talk, the ebb and flow of polite conversation. The amiable murmur of office banter might as well be playing out in Mandarin Chinese for all she comprehends of it.</p><p>It’s far easier for Fran to sink into her rich, if somewhat morbid interior life.

His experience, he suggested, showed that the more “irresponsibly” a photographer approached the high seriousness of getting a good picture, the more likely they were to succeed. He referenced something that the French poet Paul Valéry wrote in 1894: “Most people see with their intellects much more often than with their eyes.

At a dinner party in Brooklyn, for instance, he saw his old friend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/dec/17/obituaries-2023-martin-amis-remembered-by-john-banville">Martin Amis</a>, who was then dying of cancer. After this meeting, which would be their last, Amis apparently sent Rushdie an email “so laudatory that I can’t reproduce it all”. What he will tell us, however, is that having expected his fellow writer to be altered, even diminished, by his trauma, Amis was struck by his intactness.

<p>Bright colours, neutral or time for a change?</p><p>The idea of a signature look has always appealed to me. Or actually perhaps it is more accurate to say that I admire those who have managed to adopt one and then have stuck to it – people whose wardrobe is solely made up of (chic) black clothing or have a minimalist makeup approach that consists of black mascara, nothing else. I understand the pared-down mantra means less drama in the mornings, but gosh what a commitment. Personally, I lack the discipline, much preferring the chaos of choice. Hence, the closest I’ve come to a signature look is a consistently bright lipstick. But for a good part of 2023, I wavered. I fancied a change, so I rarely wore anything on my lips that wasn’t neutral. In recent months, however, I’ve found my way back to bright lip colours. The lipsticks on this page, all by high-end/high-fashion brands, have sublime, long-lasting formulas, extensive shades and delicious packaging that make great eye candy. B

<p>A trip back to Denmark brings much-needed colour and poignant plantings</p><p>Finally, happily, reunited with a favourite flower. Deep scarlet Tagetes ildkongen (‘fire king’) came to us early in our allotment life, courtesy of a Danish seed collective. We sowed them every year. Then one day they were gone. We mourned their loss.</p><p>We have since discovered another source for the summerhouse meadow. We sow seed at Easter, perhaps a little early, but there’s plenty more in case of failure.

<p>It’s time for fresh, juicy cabernet franc to take centre stage</p><p><strong>Les Terrasses Saint Nicolas de Bourgueil</strong><strong>, Loire France 2022 (£11, <a href="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/314427205">Tesco</a>) </strong>For years, only one member of the cabernet family was known beyond the circles of serious wine enthusiasts. Cabernet sauvignon, still the world’s most widely planted grape variety, left its Pyrenean parent, cabernet franc, (DNA testing in the 1990s proved cabernet sauvignon is the progeny of cabernet franc and sauvignon blanc) in the shade when it came to reputation and recognition. Recently, however, cabernet franc has been enjoying a new lease of life, prized by growers for its ability, in the right conditions, to make red wines of fashionable freshness, elegance and crunch, many of which take well to drinking at cooler temperatures than richer, denser wines such as those made, certainly in warmer climes, from cabernet sauvignon.

There’s a soft gloss and polish to the place that would, I think, lend a comely glow to my corpse in repose. There are even dainty net curtains behind the frosted windows set into the toilet cubicle doors. What do you mean, why did they put windows in the toilet cubicle door? If there weren’t windows, how could they put net curtains behind them? Do keep up. Anyway, I fancy a bit of that, too: maybe a little window
