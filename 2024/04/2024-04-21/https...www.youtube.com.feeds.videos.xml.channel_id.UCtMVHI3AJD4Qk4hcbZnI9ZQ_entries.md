Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time I look at the surprising development where Apple who once famously never let an emulator on their store has finally caved in and while it's awesome, It dropped me down a rabbit hole of finding out just how much other emulators have grown to the point where we can now PC game under mobile devices. Thanks for watching!
