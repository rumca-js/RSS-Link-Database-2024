<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello people from the internet, does something like this exist? I have a bunch of footage of car events and throughout the events there are sometimes the same means it's quite cumbersome to go through all clips and find say these three or four occurrences per event. A search funtion how it's in the ios gallery app (i assume something like that exist in android too) would be such a great help. The footage is on a huge external hard drive which only runs on demand because it does this ticking noise when it cleans the head etc. I'm not sure if it's okay to let it run 24/7 for years that's why the database for that would be needed directly there i think. </p> <p>Any recommendations if there is something like what ? 🤣</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/magiccube22"> /u/magiccube22 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c9c8gc/photo_gallery_app_that_supports_search_functio

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So from my home, I have a ubuntu linux wireguard &quot;client&quot; connected to my VPS wireguard &quot;server&quot;. The linux machine have default route to go out to internet via the tunnel and I've confirmed this is working properly (internet from the linux going out from the VPS as confirmed on ifconfig.me)</p> <p>Now I intend to route some of the client in my home to the linux client and going out to intenet through the tunnel out from the VPS. IP forwarding has been enabled but once I've set the linux IP as the gateway for my home device, the internet just stop working. </p> <p>Any idea on how to fix this? Or any idea where can I check the log to see if packet forwarded correctly to the tunnel? I am on ubuntu and UFW is disabled at the moment. Below is wireguard config on the linux client in my home:</p> <pre><code>[Interface] PrivateKey = privatekey Address = 10.226.11.2/24 DNS = 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1 PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; i
