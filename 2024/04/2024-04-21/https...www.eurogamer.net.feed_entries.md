And so Hundred Heroes is another impossibly massive, turn-based, party-centric RPG. It tells another wartorn story about resisting an empire, cut through with goofball moments where an eyepatched Aussie kangaroo might yell made-up words.</p><p>And - because doing anything else would be blasphemy - there's another 100-plus party members to find, cosy up to, and experiment with in your six-character party. Reclusive hunters, kings, talking sharks (shi'arcs here), a literal travel bag with glowing Jawa eyes, your cute auntie who does nothing but bake cherry pies - they're all here, and the cast's staggering size is still what

I called my short time with the game '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hands-on-with-fallout-4-vr" target="_blank">underwhelming</a>' back then because the whole experience was little more than a stationary shooting gallery with bottles for targets. Even then though, it was still a thrill to feel like I was actually standing next to a real-life Red Rocket gas station.</p><p>Fallout 4 VR finally released in December 2017 to fairly positive reviews, even though there was a lot of criticism about the VR implementation and its lacklustre graphics.  Despite these faults however, most helmet-heads on PC were thrilled to have the opportunity to play through the entirety of Fallout 4 in virtual reality. Sure there were some corners cut here and the

See, there are rules for fighting game cinematics. You need a montage of assorted beefcakes, flexing and strutting for the camera, then coming to blows against the crescendo of a heavy rock track. These conventions are sacrosanct and cannot be broken. Everything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzqvmFrV46c">Tekken</a>, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrhstElDoRg">Guilty Gear</a>, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfauQE0pM_M">King of Fighters</a>, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nFd7Iylj5A">Street Fighter 5</a> follows the same recipe. Only this time Street Fighter 6 decided, no, let's not do that, and instead how about we do a 1970s proto-rap-style
