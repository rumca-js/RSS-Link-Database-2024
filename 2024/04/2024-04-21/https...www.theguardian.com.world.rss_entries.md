<p>Celebrated painter ‘went down the drain from the 1930s’, claims Rebecca John in a new interview</p><p>The granddaughter of Augustus John, Britain’s most famous and successful artist of the early 20th century, has delivered a damning critique of his later works. Rebecca John, the leading authority on the artist, says in her first interview for two decades that “most should have been burned. My grandfather went down the drain from the 1930s onwards, drank too much, lost his judgment, and took every opportunity to earn money from portraits of society ladies and the wives of notable men”.</p><p>From about 1900, Augustus John had produced beautiful drawings, stunning landscapes and portraits of great men including TE Lawrence, James Joyce, George Bernard Shaw and Thomas Hardy. He was even honoured in 1928 with a cover photo for <em>Time</em> magazine. But those artistic skills declined from the mid-1930s until his death aged 83 in 1961.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddes

<p>IMF has revised up growth forecasts but medium-term prospects remain poor as globalisation goes into reverse</p><p>The 2020s are almost halfway over and are on course to be the most difficult decade for the global economy since the 1930s. Every finance minister and central bank governor at the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington last week knows that, even if they were not prepared to admit it publicly.</p><p>The IMF likes to look on the bright side. It revised up slightly its forecast for global growth and now thinks scarring from the coronavirus pandemic and the cost of living crisis will be less severe than it originally feared. Interest rates have risen without triggering the recessions that were predicted. A soft landing has been finessed. The performance of some countries – the US and India to take two examples – has been strong.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/21/most-difficult-global-outlook-for-a-century-heralds-end-of-
