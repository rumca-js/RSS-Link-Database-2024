The Army Painter Factory Team and I went to the headquarters and factory in Denmark last week, and I've got lots to say. I'll talk about that, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made a 'zine! Check out SNARL at http://www.snarlingbadger.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
