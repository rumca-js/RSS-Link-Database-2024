The world is beautiful, recruiting is fun, and there are plenty of minigames to sink time into if you\u2019d like. I just wish its story had more meat to it rather than feeling like a generic tale I\u2019ve heard time and time again. It is good, but just don\u2019t expect to be blown away by some epic saga that will have you on the edge of your seat. Also, get used to dying because you will, a lot. If you\u2019re a fan of classic \u201990s JRPGs, I\u2019d recommend it, and even if you\u2019ve never played one but like JRPGs like Octopath Traveler, you\u2019d probably find it fun.\n\n#eiyudenchroniclehundredheroes #eiyudenchronicle #jrpg \n\nThe Escapist Merch Store \u25ba\u25bahttps://teespring.com/stores/the-escapist-store\nJoin us on Twitch \u25ba\u25ba https://www.twitch.tv/the_escapist_official\nLike us on Facebook \u25ba\u25ba http://www.facebook.com/EscapistMag\nFollow us on Twitter \u25ba\u25ba https://twitter.com/EscapistMag", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm0fSW0hfgc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCqg5FCR7NrpvlBWMXdt-5Vg", "source_obj__id": 338, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Bm0fSW0hfgc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes Review | A Decent Play on a 90s JRPG", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
