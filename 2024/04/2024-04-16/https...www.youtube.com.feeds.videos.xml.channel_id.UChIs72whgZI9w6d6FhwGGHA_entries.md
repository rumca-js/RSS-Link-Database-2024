In this hardware news episode, we recap the stability problems and "video memory" errors being seen on some Intel 13th & 14th series CPUs, AMD's new Ryzen 8000F and upcoming "9000" CPUs, discussion of a Lenovo Legion Go 2, and RGB LEDs allegedly bleaching video card backplates. It's a fun episode, made better with a conclusion on a unique Raspberry Pi hardware project!
