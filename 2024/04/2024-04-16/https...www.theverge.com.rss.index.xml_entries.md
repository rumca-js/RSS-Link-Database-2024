A point-and-click adventure built with real-world materials and then animated with stop-motion, <em>Harold Halibut</em> tells a story that’s at times slow and ponderous and, at others, cozy and heartwarming. It’s sort of like what would happen if Wes Anderson teamed up with Aardman Animations to make a sci-fi game. Which is to say that it’s charming and built with an incredible amount of care and detail. As a game, it’s standard stuff — but as a place to experience, there’s nothing quite like it.</p>

  <p id="H6x7wc">The Department of Justice is preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against Ticketmaster parent company Live Nation, according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/live-nation-justice-department-antitrust-lawsuit-ab98c268">report from <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. The lawsuit could reportedly come as early as next month and will target the company’s alleged monopoly in the live ticketing industry.</p>
<p id="vubTbt">Live Nation drew antitrust scrutiny when it merged with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-LB-24227">Ticketmaster in 2010</a>. But those concerns boiled over in November 2022 when a <a href

  <p id="1YcXOc">When you load your music streaming app of choice onto your mobile device, your audio quality settings are worth taking a minute or two to configure. If you don’t have these set to as high a quality as possible, you’re missing out on the best audio experience your streaming apps can offer.</p>
<p id="9mYDfM">Because they are managed separately for streaming music over cell and Wi-Fi networks and for downloading tracks to your device for offline listening, there is a tradeoff. Increased sound quality and fidelity means more data gets used (which might be a concern if you’re not on an unlimited cellular plan), bigger file sizes (which take up more r

  <p id="P0CR2K">Sony is working on a new “high-end version” of the PS5, codenamed Trinity and likely to debut as the PS5 Pro later this year. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24130716/sony-ps5-pro-specs-release-date-rumors"><em>The Verge</em> confirmed leaked specs</a> about the PS5 Pro earlier this week, and we’ve also obtained details on how existing and new PS5 games can be “enhanced” to take advantage of the PS5 Pro hardware. Sony is also working on an ultra-boost mode for older games to make them run better on the PS5 Pro.</p>

  <p id="xbilsr">Insta360 has launched its latest 360-degree action camera, the X4. The most obvious upgrade that the $500 camera offers over its predecessor, the X3, is the ability to shoot video in 8K at 30 frames per second. That extra boost in resolution and detail may come in handy for watching action videos on anything larger than your phone, panning around 360-degree footage on platforms like YouTube or cropping out a perspective you like from a 360-degree recording. It also includes a new 2,290mAh battery rated for 75 minutes of 8K footage and 135 minutes of 5.7K footage. </p>
<p id="RQ4ano">The X4 supports recording 5.7K at 60 frames per second as well

  <p id="hSzy3a">Motorola is introducing three new Edge series phones, reviving a classic design feature it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/29/5355632/how-motorola-brought-wood-back-with-moto-x">first introduced a decade ago</a>: a wooden back panel. The Motorola Edge 50 Ultra is the highest spec’d device of the trio, and it’s the only one with the “real wood” back panel option (though the peach fuzz vegan leather looks awfully nice, too). Motorola will launch the phones first outside of the US “in the coming weeks,” but says it’s committed to “expanding the Edge family in North America this year.” </p>
