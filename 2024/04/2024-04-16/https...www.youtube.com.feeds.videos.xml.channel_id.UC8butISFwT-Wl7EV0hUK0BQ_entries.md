In this applied Data Science Crash Course, we cover everything you need to know about A/B testing, from the concepts to the practical details they can apply in business. The course merges in-depth statistical analysis (think hypothesis testing, significance levels, and the nitty-gritty of pooled estimates, test statistics, p-values, and assessing statistical significance) with the kind of data science theories big tech firms rely on, all alongside practical Python tutorials for real-world test implementation. Plus, there's a real-life case study thrown in to help you understand the concepts more.
