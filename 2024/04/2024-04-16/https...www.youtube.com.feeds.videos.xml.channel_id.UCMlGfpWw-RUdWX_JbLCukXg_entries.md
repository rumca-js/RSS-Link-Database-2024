Lightning Talk: Spanny: Abusing C++ mdspan Is Within Arm’s Reach - Griswald Brooks - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

mdspan introduced in C++23 gave us a standard multidimensional way to view into a container of data. While the canonical use case is to refer to a stack or heap allocated data, the accessor policy allows you to inject any side effect allowing the data to come from anywhere... like a robot arm inspecting bins.
