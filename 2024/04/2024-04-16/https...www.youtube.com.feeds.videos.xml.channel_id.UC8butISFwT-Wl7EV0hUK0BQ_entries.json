The course merges in-depth statistical analysis (think hypothesis testing, significance levels, and the nitty-gritty of pooled estimates, test statistics, p-values, and assessing statistical significance) with the kind of data science theories big tech firms rely on, all alongside practical Python tutorials for real-world test implementation. Plus, there's a real-life case study thrown in to help you understand the concepts more.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course created by Tatev Karen Aslanyan.\nMore from Tatev here: https://lunartech.ai/\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:00:00) Video Introduction\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:03:49) Introduction to Data Science and A/B Testing\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:05:38) Basics of A/B Testing in Data Science\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:07:06) Key Parameters of A/B Testing for Data Scientists\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:09:24) Formulating Hypotheses and Identifying Primary Metrics in Data Science A/B", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZe0C0Qq4p0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ", "source_obj__id": 422, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/KZe0C0Qq4p0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Data Science Essentials \u2013 Crash Course in A/B Testing with Case Study", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
