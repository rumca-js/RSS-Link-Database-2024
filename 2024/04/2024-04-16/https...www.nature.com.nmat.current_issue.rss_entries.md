<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 16 April 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01862-8">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01862-8</a></p>Ion exchange is a powerful method to access metastable materials for energy storage, but identifying lithium and sodium interchange in layered oxides remains challenging. Using such model materials, vacancy level and corresponding lithium preference are shown to be crucial for ion exchange pathway accessibility.
