If you couldn\u2019t find them before as of today Factory Striders are showing up in larger numbers in Helldivers 2. We spotted them in Eradication Missions and a Destroy Automaton Fabricators mission. If you still can\u2019t find one, it looks like Eliminate Factory Strider's mission will be in the game. To take down one of these AT-AT-looking fellas use two 500 kg bombs or two 110mm rocket runs. You can blast off individual cannons and turrets to de-fang this beast.\n\n#helldivers2 #gaming #gamespot", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9Qj6KcywrQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "source_obj__id": 127, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/j9Qj6KcywrQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Factory Striders Do Exist In Helldivers 2", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-16T14:00:39+00:00", "description": "With Fallout 5 still years away and recent success of its television adaption, as well as game's Like Baldur's Gate 3, Jean-Luc thinks it's time to bring back the beloved classics that started the Fallout franchise.\n\n#fallout #fallout2 #bethesda", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNV3owlTE8E", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "source_obj__id": 127, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/sNV3owlTE8E/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "It's Time To Remake Fallout 1 & 2", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
