About 50 workers and pro-Palestinian activists gathered outside Google&#8217;s Seattle offices in South Lake Union, just a short distance from Amazon&#8217;s headquarters. The two tech companies are part of a $1.2 billion contract called Project Nimbus that provides cloud services and data centers to the Israeli government. The 3-year-old project has incited protests in the past, but the concern is amplified by Israel&#8217;s ongoing and deadly war in Gaza.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/google-and-amazon-workers-protest-tech-giants-contract-with-israel-as-war-in-gaza-continues/">Read More</a>

The home of Cyan Worlds, on the northern outskirts of Spokane, was made possible by the success of the company&#8217;s iconic adventure video game, as indicated by the nickname that Cyan CEO and co-founder Rand Miller uses for it. Miller and his brother, Cyan co-founder Robyn Miller, had been building the company in Spokane when Myst was released. After debuting for Macintosh in 1993, the blockbuster franchise would ultimately expand to basically every major game platform, on its way to lifetime sales of 15 million units across&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/how-myst-maker-cyan-worlds-ended-up-building-its-own-world-in-spokane/">Read More</a>
