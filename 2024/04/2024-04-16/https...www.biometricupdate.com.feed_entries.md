		The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has removed <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/login-gov">Login.gov</a> from its grantee payment platform after a security breach in March of last year resulted in hackers stealing millions of dollars from seven different grantee organizations last year, according to <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2024/04/hhs-removed-login-its-grantee-payment-system-after-funding-theft/395716/">Nextgov</a>.

Using a combination of publicly available information and data from SAM.gov, the federal government's system that manages award data, bad actors were able to impersonate employees at the organizations affected and changed their banking information in the system, successfully stealing $7.5 million.

		Identity verification provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/intellicheck">Intellicheck</a> and the city of Clemson have launched a 12 month pilot program that uses identity verification at 15 bars, convenience stores, and liquor stores to catch fake IDs and prevent underage drinking. Intellicheck's ID verification authenticates an ID in less than a second, according to the announcement, using a mobile device or point-of-sale scanner.

The city of Clemson is the program's underwriter. Businesses will use the same tool currently in use by the city's police department and early adopters like Tiger Town Tavern. The tavern's owner is quoted in the announcement saying the ID verification "has made a difference" in the struggle against underage drin

The first measures to come into force under the <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3339">Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (ECCT Act)</a> give Companies House more power to query information and request supporting evidence, stronger checks on company names, a requirement for all companies to supply a registered email address, and the ability to share data with other government departments and law enforcement agencies, among other tools.

		Malawi and South Sudan are set to hold general elections soon and national ID cards could prove to be a key factor in the process. As South Sudan prepares to organize its first-ever elections since it became an independent country in 2011, there are fears that citizens without national ID cards may not be able to take part in the all-important exercise in the life of the country. In Malawi, a recent legislative amendment by the government which makes the national ID card the only proof of ID for voter registration has met with criticisms from various quarters including from the country’s Law Society. In an election-related development, some officials of the Electoral Commission of Ghana, suspected to be behind the loss of a biometric verification device, have bee

		<em>By Michael Marcotte, CEO of artius.iD</em>

This year, over half the world’s population will head to the ballot box. At a time when, in many nations, democracy is already under acute pressure, ensuring these elections are free and fair is of paramount importance.

In the context of this political instability, deepfakes have entered the stage – and this year they are poised to play a larger role than ever before.

Governments, either through a lack of ability or will, have failed to sufficiently defend democracy against deepfakes. However, where the public sector fails, there’s an opportunity for the private to step in – both to safeguard democracy and reap financial rewards in the process.

Biometric firms should be leading the way in providing the next generatio
