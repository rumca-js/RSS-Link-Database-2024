<p>AMD’s latest desktop and laptop processors put the company squarely in the emerging AI PC market with the integration of generative-AI (genAI) technology into some of its most popular chip lines.</p>



<p>The idea of an AI PC is relatively straightforward, with hardware makers like Intel, Nvidia and AMD building dedicated AI chips into processors for desktop and laptop use, delivering substantive improvements on AI-specific tasks such as text-to-image generation, content creation, and image and video processing.</p>



<p>The first new chips, AMD said in a briefing last week, are part of the popular Ryzen line of desktop processors, with updates in the Ryzen 7 PRO, 5 PRO and 3 PRO designs desig

<p>Adobe will bring its Firefly generative AI (genAI) video model to its Premiere Pro video editing app later this year, and plans to provide access to third-party AI video creation tools such as OpenAI’s Sora, too. </p>



<p>Adobe <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/04/15/bringing-gen-ai-to-video-editing-workflows-adobe-premiere-pro">offered a glimpse of the Firefly video AI model in action</a> on Monday, with new features planned for Premiere Pro. </p>

<p>I don’t know whether to be amazed or horrified at how much out-of-date technology we’re still using. Maybe both. Both is good.</p>



<p>It’s been 10 years since Windows XP support expired. That’s a whole decade, people! But when I recently posted a meme “celebrating” the occasion, I started hearing from people who — God help them — are still using XP.</p>



<p>One person told me he believes XP still lives on at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center on old systems still running Windows XP Embedded (XPe). Why? Because their manufacturers wouldn’t (couldn’t?) update their systems. Of course, NASA could replace them… but at a six-figure price for new gear, no one has the budget to do it. </p>

<p>The US has committed $6.4 billion in grants to help Samsung expand its semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Texas in a bid to strengthen America’s position in chip production.</p>



<p>The funding, under the CHIPS and Science Act, will construct a comprehensive semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem in Taylor and expand an existing facility in Austin, the Department of Commerce said in a statement.</p>



<p>Samsung is expected to invest more than $40 billion in the region in the coming years, which could create over 20,000 jobs.</p>
