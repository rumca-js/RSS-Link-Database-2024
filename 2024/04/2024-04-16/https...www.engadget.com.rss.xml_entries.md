The DARPA-funded robot was designed with search and rescue missions in mind, with the idea that it would be able to enter areas that were unsafe for humans to carry out a range of tasks.

<p>Starting today, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-ride-tracker-iphone-lock-screen-060908235.html">Uber</a> app will remind you to put on your seatbelt shortly after your ride starts. Passengers' tendency to not use a seat belt remains a significant concern, the ride-hailing service wrote in its announcement of the new safety feature, even though 50 percent of all vehicle crash deaths in the US in 2022 was caused by their non-usage. Now, your driver's phone will issue an audio reminder when you hop on, telling you to &quot;Please use your seat belt for your safety.&quot; You'll also get a push notification on your phone at the same time that says: &quot;Even on a short ride and seated in the back, use a seat belt for safety.&quot;</p>
<p>The company first started testing audio seat belt alerts in 2021 based on feedback from drivers. It said at the time that it believes the alerts will &quot;increase seat belt use and help drivers ensure a safe environment while on a trip.&q

<p>There’s a cult following for 360-degree cameras. While companies like GoPro and Ricoh continue to dabble in the category, Insta360 simply dominates it. Until today, the X3 was the ultimate 360 camera, with loads of features and shooting modes that were relatively easy to use. Insta360’s collection of selfie sticks, guards, cases and peripherals added even more cool tricks like bullet time effects and fast-zoom video effects. A few years later, we’re getting the Insta360 X4, with improvements prioritizing the fundamentals. There are higher-resolution camera sensors, a bigger battery and even more versatility, thanks to multiple resolutions and framerate options.</p>

<p>Samsung reportedly shipped 60.1 million smartphone units worldwide in Q1, representing 20.8 percent of the global market share — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-is-once-again-the-leader-in-global-smartphone-shipments-122528177.html">and first place</a>. Meanwhile, Apple shipped 50.1 million units for 17.3 percent of the market share. Both companies, however, saw a decrease from Q1 2023. Apple saw an almost 10 percent drop, while Samsung’s hit was less than one percent.</p>
<p>Apple nudged Samsung out briefly in 2023, but it’s back to business as usual. The IDC’s takeaway is that the world of smartphones is strengthening (what does that mean?), with a boost to higher-priced phones—true for both Samsung and Apple.</p>
<p>Xiaomi rounded out the top five brands with 40.8 million units, Transsion with 28.5 million units and OPPO with 25.2 million units shipped. Never heard of Transsion? It’s a global smartphone powerhouse based in China, responsible for phone brands including
