<p>The former EastEnders star could have been the perfect person to take toxic men to task in this report on modern masculinity. Instead, he utterly fails to push back. What a waste</p><p>‘With traditional gender roles a thing of the past, what does it mean to be a man in modern Britain? Danny Dyer explores modern masculinity, men’s health and male identity.” So says Channel 4 in its publicity for the hour-long documentary Danny Dyer: How to Be a Man. Run through the Dyertron at the top of the programme, Danny has it thus: “Channel 4 bunged me a few quid to talk to geezers up and down the country. Is there really a war on men? ‘Fuck knows’ would be my initial reaction to that. But there’s a lotta shit going down and perhaps some men – maybe a lot of men – are resenting that.”</p><p>By the end of a superficial, overstuffed, chaotic hour it’s hard to feel that either we or Dyer are much the wiser. It begins promisingly with Dyer taking us back to his childhood home on an east London cou

<p>The mates from Darlington who clubbed together to buy an unlikely winner is a story fit for Hollywood, and the men all have moving stories to tell in this charming documentary … even if the makers are too heavy-handed</p><p>‘Basically we got pissed, got relentless and ended up buying a horse.” It might need a little light translation from the County Durhamese when they pitch it to Hollywood, but that is the essence of the hour-long documentary It’s Showtime! A group of mates from a Darlington council estate – Baz (“He’s got the dopiest facial expressions I’ve ever seen”), Anth, Jeff (“bright as a blackout”), Nick, Ste (Jeff’s nephew and group organiser), Mike and Dog (“Anth’s round the bend, but Dog’s another level”) and Kev (who does not appear in the film) – clubbed together in 2020 and bought a horse they called Showtime Mahomes for £8,000. When they started racing him the next year, he came second in his first two races, won his third and then in 2022 this darkest of dark horse

<p>Hammond takes over presenting duties at Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home – and gets all the tails wagging. Just like that, canine TV’s top dog should stay the leader of the pack</p><p>We are living through canine television’s golden (retriever) era. Idly flick through the channels and it’s odds on that you’ll land on a minor celebrity on a walking holiday, a documentary about air fryers, or a programme about dogs who either need a home or be better trained in the one they already have. For the Love of Dogs is the original, the top dog, and it remains the leader of the pack. The late Paul O’Grady hosted this look behind the scenes at Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home, for whom he was also an ambassador, from 2012 until his death last year. The title bore his name, but he was so dedicated to Battersea’s work that it would have made little sense to stop making what amounts to a primetime TV spotlight on the charity and its reach. Nevertheless, his are very big shoes to step into.</p><p>It

<p>Sunday’s defeat by Aston Villa has added jeopardy, and Mikel Arteta knows ousting Bayern will take some doing</p><p>Arsenal landed in a gusty Munich aiming to show they have not been blown off course. A week is a long time in football and it was only last Tuesday, when Mikel Arteta’s players emerged for their first leg to a rapturous reception at the Emirates, that they were being favoured to dethrone a wobbly Bayern Munich. The picture has clouded since then and there is a sense of being caught between absolutes when the rematch kicks off on Wednesday night.</p><p>If Arsenal overcome their depleted hosts, they will have achieved an outcome for the ages and can savour a first Champions League semi-final since 2009. Should Bayern make home advantage and elite-level lineage count, those hovering to sound the death knell on their season will form an orderly queue.

Beatific bordering on ecstasy. And all because he had been cancelled. Something he has longed for all his career. Failing to be elected as an MP on seven separate occasions was just proof of the limitations of democracy. Winning the Brexit referendum was almost a disappointment. What was there left for him to do? Other than to sniff around the far right in the US. Hoping for scraps. A sense of identity. But on Tuesday all his dreams came true.</p><p>Last year’s National Conservatism conference in London had been largely forgettable apart from a few attention-seeking appearances from people most go out of their way to avoid. And even these were no more than period pieces, designed merely to preach to the couple of hundred of the already converted. An exercise in futility. No more, no less.</p> <a href="ht

If only I’d seen it that way, it would have helped me no end, 10 April</a>). It’s an incredibly sad time that I don’t think you can ever be prepared for. I sat with my mum while she died. She’d been ill with Alzheimer’s for a few years and lost her life at just 59. It was horrible.</p><p>But in the days after her death, I remember thinking that while it was awful and incredibly difficult to see (her death was a drawn-out one – she never did like saying goodbye), it was also a privilege to be there. I’ve never said that to anyone before writing this letter. I’ve never heard anyone else say it,

<p>This week, Damon Albarn took umbrage at a Coachella crowd who failed to sing along. But he is far from the worst offender</p><p>When Coachella 2024 comes to be remembered by future generations, the abiding image will be that of Damon Albarn attempting to engage the crowd in a game of call and response, and then failing, and then having a bit of a go at them.</p><p>In fairness to Albarn, it was a weird booking. Blur have always fared poorly in the US. Is this the band’s fault for writing all those songs about how much they dislike America? We may never know. Either way, by berating the crowd for their ambivalence – yelling “You’ll never see us again so you may as well fucking sing it” – Blur have joined the ranks of acts who have turned against their audiences.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/apr/16/tantrums-rich-famous-nine-acts-turned-on-audience-elton-bieber-blur">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Why are there almost no tears in great works of art? Italian artist Francesco Vezzoli is rectifying this – by embroidering balloon-shaped drops on to modern mashups of Giotto and Botticelli</p><p>Since tears express intense emotion, you’d think great painters would have fallen over themselves to depict people crying. Wrong, says Francesco Vezzoli. “Just Google books about tears in art,” says the Italian artist via video call. “There aren’t any. There are some tears in Hieronymus Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights, but that’s an extreme painting. You should find tears on the face of Christ, but that happens only once.” This is in Antonello da Messina’s Ecce Homo, from 1475. “Go to the Kunsthistorischen Museum in Vienna: no tears. In European religious paintings, there should be tears on the faces of every saint because they all died for martyrdom. But tears are very rare.”</p><p>To correct this remarkable oversight, over the past 15 years Vezzoli has embroidered tears on to repr

<p><strong>National Gallery, London<br /></strong>Rage, slaughter, death, regret … The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula, believed to be Caravaggio’s last work, is so astonishing, it deserves to be a one-painting blockbuster</p><p>At the height of his fame in Rome, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio is known to have owned at least 12 books. We don’t picture Caravaggio as a reader. A streetfighter, a killer, yes – but not an intellectual. Yet his painting The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula, which has come to the National Gallery from Naples, proves he could mine a book for its hidden diamonds.</p><p>The tale of Ursula, an early Christian princess from Britain who sailed off to marry and hopefully convert a pagan prince accompanied by no less than 11,000 virgins, is one of the religious fairy tales recounted in an incredibly strange medieval compendium called The Golden Legend. Caravaggio obviously studied this 13th-century source carefully because he sees something in it no one else had.</p> <a href

It’s just to get him on the ballot.” Mr Z said he didn’t want Laurence Fox on the ballot, and the Reclaim party supporter went elsewhere for a signature – needlessly, as it turned out, because Fox <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/mar/28/laurence-fox-ruled-out-london-mayor-contest-errors-nomination">filled in the form incorrectly</a> and his candidacy was rejected.
