<p>Some people have been waiting a long time for an alternative to Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface series, and niche small form factor manufacturer Minisforum is ready to give it to them. The company&rsquo;s V3 tablet, which proclaims itself the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s first AMD 3-in-1 Windows tablet,&rdquo; is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-v3&amp;xcust=2-1-2305572-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">now available to purchase</a> and shipping in a little over a week. </p>



<p>Minisforum might be being a little grandiose in its description of the V3 &mdash; it&rsquo;s not as if it was ever impossible to use a Ryzen platform in a Surface form factor, it&rsquo;s just that no one saw a huge demand for it. But that being said, there&rsquo;s no doubt that this is some pret

<p>AMD today launched its most recent generation of business processors for business PCs, the Ryzen Pro 8000 series, for both desktop and laptops. For now, AMD will be the only CPU vendor offering AI-powered NPUs in business desktop PCs.</p>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s launch arrives on the heels of Intel&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2247114/only-intels-core-ultra-is-good-enough-for-its-vpro-lineup.html">14th-gen vPro platform</a>, which also offers desktop and mobile parts. The difference is that Intel launched its vPro refresh based upon the &ldquo;Raptor Lake Refresh&rdquo; architecture, which lacks AI; AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen Pro 8000 series is relatively consistent across both its mobile and desktop offerings. However, not every new Ryzen Pro 8000 mobile or desktop chip includes AI support.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not the first person who&rsquo;s wondered what it would be like to have a giant desktop monitor. Think of all the multi-tasking and immersive gaming you could manage if you had a 50- or 60-inch monitor instead of a standard 24-inch monitor! But you&rsquo;ve probably noticed that as monitors get bigger, they also tend to get prohibitively expensive.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably already got a big screen in your house, though&mdash;a TV. At the end of the day, isn&rsquo;t an HDTV just a giant, living-room-oriented computer monitor?</p>



<p>Not exactly. While you can use a TV as a computer monitor in most cases, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the best option. In fact, it&rsquo;s likely less attractive, convenient, and usable than you think (not

<p>If you have a Windows 10 computer, Microsoft will offer you a free upgrade to Windows 11. Provided the hardware of the Windows 10 computer is compatible, otherwise Windows 11 will refuse the installation. Microsoft has now released a large number of Windows 10 PCs that were previously not allowed to install the upgrade for the Windows 11 upgrade. </p>

<p>Good news, everyone: My bar mitzvah videos from the mid-1990s are now digitized for the ages.</p>



<p>While I have no intention of actually watching them &mdash; <em>oy, the embarrassment</em> &mdash; I recently received the original tapes from my parents and felt like they were worth preserving in a more enduring form than VHS. I was able to do it for cheap thanks to my USB capture card, which I originally bought to take screenshots of streaming devices for my <a href="https://www.techhive.com/blogs/cord-cutter-confidential">TechHive column on cord cutting</a> but which continues to have all kinds of other neat uses.</p>
