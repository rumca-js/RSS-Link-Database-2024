## Mbappé inspires PSG to comeback victory in Barcelona after Araújo red

<p>Just when Montjuïc roared, clinging to the hope that there might be a way back into this, one last chance to see Barcelona reach the semi-final for the first time in five years, there was Kylian Mbappé and his Paris Saint-Germain teammates sprinting across the running track in celebration. Two goals down from the first leg, one down in the second, Luis Enrique’s side had come back to lead 3-1 in the second, 5-4 overall, but had been on edge until the very last minute. When, at last, they broke away and silenced the Olympic Stadium.</p><p>It had been a long night for them, and even longer for Barcelona. A goal up through Raphinha, they had gone down to ten men because of a red card for Ronald Araújo and been forced to resist for just too long, goals from Ousmane Dembélé, Bradley Barcola and Mbappé giving them a 3-1 lead that they clung to in those late, tense minutes before they finally made it safe, Achraf Hakimi dashing clear to set up three successive shots which ended with Mbapp

<p>Just another raw and savage night of Champions League football at the Westfalen: the colours vivid, the sounds ear-shattering, the defences in utter disarray. Late goals from Niclas Fullkrug and Marcel Sabitzer secured Borussia Dortmund’s passage to the semi-finals, breaking open an Atlético Madrid who look a grey scale model of the battleships Diego Simeone once produced.</p><p>It was flawed and it was chaotic, and even amid Dortmund’s elation there remains the eternal question of whether they are ever going to allow us to take them seriously, whether they will ever escape this riotously entertaining cycle of boom and bust. This tie felt like a whole psychodrama in its own right, and one Atlético could quite conceivably have finished within the first half-hour in Madrid.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/16/borussia-dortmund-atletico-madrid-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new exhibition at the Met looks at the practice of hiding portraits attached to other portraits and the many reasons artists chose to be secretive with their work</p><p>During the Renaissance in Europe, a curious genre of portraiture rose to prominence and thrived: that of the so-called hidden portrait. Generally these portraits were complemented by either a cover that fit over the portrait or an obverse side on the back of the portrait, containing puzzle-like clues, symbols or a secondary portrait that enhanced the depth of the main work. A new exhibit at the Met unites dozens of these likenesses with their covers to offer a fascinating look at a largely lost art.</p><p>According to show curator Alison Nogueira, these portraits served a variety of uses, from providing a entertaining centerpiece at a gathering to celebrate a woman’s betrothal, marking a major journey, or commemorating a death. They could even be political propaganda. In evidence of that, Nogueira pointed to a par

<p>Kids pausing their football so a friend can pray; theology chats over lunch – I’ve seen the richness that religious diversity brings to school life</p><p>A Muslim student at Michaela community school in Brent, north-west London, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/apr/16/london-school-katharine-birbalsingh-prayer-rituals-ban-not-unlawful-high-court">lost a high court challenge</a> to the school’s ban on prayer rituals. As a Muslim secondary schoolteacher, I have to say I am disappointed – but not surprised.</p><p>The appeal was lost on the grounds that the school declares itself secular. This is something the headteacher, Katharine Birbalsingh, insists all students and parents know when applying. In the written judgment dismissing the student’s case, Mr Justice Linden went as far as to say that: “The claimant at the very least impliedly accepted, when she enrolled at the school, that she would be subject to restrictions on her ability to manifest her religion.”<

Her work foregrounded Black American experience with a raw and unforgettable power</p><p>When New York’s Museum of Modern Art reopened in 2019 after a radical rehang, its most headline-grabbing display placed Faith Ringgold’s American People Series #20: Die eye to eye with Picasso’s Demoiselles d’Avignon. For years, MoMA had been criticised for its shocking gender imbalance and lack of diversity. Ringgold was among the feminists to protest about the museum in the late 1960s, but it would be decades before it paid attention. The museum’s permanent display told a story of modern art imagined as a sequential progression driven almost entirely by the work of white men. In 2019, that started to change.</p><p>Painted 60 years apart – Picasso’s was completed in 1907, Ringgold’s in 1967 – the pairing of Die and Les Demoiselles invited a different kind of storytelling, one that acknowl

Sawaya was a Wall Street lawyer who was unhappy with his career, playing with his favourite childhood toys after hours to unwind. Creating elaborate sculptures from scratch wasn’t unfamiliar to him – as a child, when his parents wouldn’t buy him a dog, he fashioned a lifesize pet from Lego bricks. “It was very rudimentary, but it was what I could do as a kid,” he recalls.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artan

<p>Soups and stews are what the rice-shaped pasta was made for, but it also works in salads and even some sweet dishes</p><p><strong>What’s the best way to cook orzo?<br /></strong>“Orzo reminds me of being a child,” says Jacob Kenedy, chef/owner of <a href="https://www.boccadilupo.com/">Bocca di Lupo</a> in London. “It’s <em>very</em> comforting, and you can eat it with a spoon.” It is perhaps first worth noting that in Italy the word <em>orzo</em> literally means “‘barley”, and the pasta we know as orzo more often goes by the name <em>rosmarino </em>(due to its likeness to a rosemary needle) or <em>risoni</em> (big rice). Here, we’re talking the pasta, which Kenedy uses as a substitute for both barley and rice, and says is particularly suited to soups and broths. For the latter, Feast’s Italian correspondent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rachel-roddy">Rachel Roddy</a> would look to Naples and a “really tasty, brothy soup with tomatoes and basil”.

<p>In fact, terror attacks and hostage-taking sparked several recent conflicts that US presidents of both parties labeled genocide</p><p>My old boss Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, bravely <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/majority-leader-schumer-delivers-major-address-calling-on-the-israeli-government-to-hold-elections">said</a> recently what Joe Biden has been afraid to: “Palestinian civilians do not deserve to suffer for the sins of Hamas, and Israel has a moral obligation to do better. The United States has an obligation to do better.”</p><p>The ongoing violence, Schumer noted, threatens not just the lives of Palestinians but the security of Jewish people worldwide by alienating global allies appalled by the bloodshed.

<p>From fake news in 1902 to livestreaming a man asleep – and everything in between, the big picture gets a bit lost</p><p>Although being distributed in the UK with the title Fantastic Machine, this documentary about the camera through history originally had the much more prolix, pretentious and charming moniker And the King Said, What a Fantastic Machine. The line is a quote attributed to Edward VII who is said to have reacted with awe when he saw a film of his own coronation – although the footage in question was not of his actual coronation <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x74y2r0">but filmed by French director Georges Méliès</a> with French actors in a Paris studio in advance, the first example of “fake news”.</p><p>That is fitting because here directors Axel Danielson and Maximilien Van Aertryck explore the camera and the moving image’s ability to dazzle, deceive and delight through history.
