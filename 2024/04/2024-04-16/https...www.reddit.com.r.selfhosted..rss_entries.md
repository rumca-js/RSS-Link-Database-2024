I'm planning to use MailWizz, but those daily sending limits (200/hour, 10k/day) are like training wheels for a jet engine! <strong>I need to send 300,000 emails DAILY.</strong></p> <p>So, the question is: <strong>Can I self-host an email server to handle this volume?</strong></p> <p>I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and get technical, but I also know there might be pitfalls I haven't considered. Here's what I'm hoping you awesome folks can help with:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Self-Hosting Feasibility:</strong> Is self-hosting even the right move for this kind of email volume? What are the pros and cons compared to a dedicated email service provider (ESP)?</li> <li><strong>Server Setup:</strong> If self-hosting is a go, what kind of software do I need? Are there any recommended tutorials or guides?</li> <li><strong>Deliverability:</strong> The big one! How can I

Mostly my own photographs from old places around Ontario with family photos mixed in. Also random images I've created or saved from various places since I started online in 1997. (There are a LOT of images/photos and I've put off dealing with them for a long time). </p> <p>Free software. I do like to give a donation to developers now and then but I'm living on a tight budget. I'm not planning to make any money from my photos, just want to get them out from my hard drive. </p> <p>I don't know how to install most of the software I've found on GitHub. So I really do need something simple/ basic to install, set up and use. I can unzip an exe file, set up MySQL on my web host, nothing fancier than that.

I cannot add these people as users into nextcloud with their own logins etc. I'm willing to take a swing at building my own plugin to do this, but I don't know what service to integrate that can do the magic links.

And there i install Kopia. Excellent but..... how i could pass the path to kopia of the places he have to backup?
