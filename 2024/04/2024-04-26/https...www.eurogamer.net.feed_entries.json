Microsoft admits this is due to the net impact from the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n</p><p>\nHardware revenue, however, has decreased by 31 percent year-on-year due to poor sales of Xbox consoles. Even the release of major exclusive <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-review\">Starfield</a> last year couldn't improve hardware sales.\n\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-boosts-microsoft-earnings-but-xbox-console-sales-plummet?utm_source=feed&amp", "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-boosts-microsoft-earnings-but-xbox-console-sales-plummet?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/STARFIELD-SITE_aiZ8Li5.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Activision Blizzard boosts Microsoft earnings, but Xbox console sales plummet", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-26T09:50:24+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/fallout-4-modding-eight-years-on-01.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>\nYesterday's long-awaited <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-next-gen-update-release-time-and-date\">Fallout 4 \"next-gen\" update</a> is now available to download on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S - but has so far received a mixed response from fans. \n</p><p>\nIt was sadly to be expected that the update would break compatibility with a large number of Fallout 4 mods - and indeed, ahead of time, <a href=\"https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13480381-how-to-stop-fallout-4-from-updating-steamgogxbox/\">users of top modding site Nexus Mods offered advice</a> on how to disable the patch from being automatically downloaded.
