And it’s still on our drinks list today.

<p>EV sales have plateaued economic headwinds and weaker state subsidies but the glut might just be a temporary rut</p><p>Elon Musk became the world’s richest man by evangelising about electric cars – and delivering them by the million. Yet in recent months his company, Tesla, has struggled to maintain its momentum: sales have dropped this year, and so has its share price.</p><p>Those struggles have become emblematic of a broader reckoning facing the electric vehicle (EV) industry. After the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/25/tesla-model-3-is-first-battery-electric-car-to-top-europe-monthly-sales-chart">soaring demand and valuations</a> of the coronavirus pandemic years, the pace of sales growth has slowed.

In between relaying the routine of her days, she reflects on her altered identity – “I was just a woman! How has this not registered before?” ­– and observes the inequity of life as the mother of an infant where the working world is “an adult place from which I’ve been banished” and during which she has become an “indoor creature indentured to domesticity”.</p><p>The narrator is the

<p>As the boss of PC Music, the godfather of hyperpop confounded critics but won over Beyoncé and Charli XCX.

As a producer of elasticated outre pop his output is as&nbsp;varied as it is frenetic, taking in everything from bass-rattling electronic workouts for cultural behemoths such as Beyoncé to celestial dreamscapes for underground newcomers, via collaborations with Caroline Polachek and longterm partner in crime, Charli&nbsp;XCX. Having initially steered clear of solo albums to focus on&nbsp;running his divisive yet hugely influential label PC Music, Cook’s debut, 2020’s 7G, featured 49 tracks and more than two hours of music ranging from face-melting dance experiments to a&nbsp;lo-fi Sia cover.

<p>Raid the garden centre for established plants – or better yet, sow your own into trays or pots for a riot of colour by summer</p><p>The ritualistic morning garden inspection returned in earnest about a month ago. Taking a look every day offers a chance to pick slugs off things or unearth unwanted volunteer plants (weeds, if you prefer), but I gain more from noticing what’s growing: the perennials that have popped up overnight, what’s filling out, what’s in bloom, what’s going over. We have yet to reach the full-on helter-skelter of May, but we’re not far off: things are changing every day.</p><p>It can also be a challenge to that most crucial of gardening tools: patience. My grandfather always advised us to wait until June to see if a plant was going to do anything or not – namely, return. But even heeding that I understand the temptation to fill in the gaps in a bed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/26/resist-the-urge-to-fill-all-gaps-in-your-borders-

In an inconsistent world, I like the way this institution of marriage works.</p><p>I read the reviews and was surprised at the appearance of two words I never associated with the original Amiga: cool, and <em>love</em>.

<p>Artists from Dua Lipa to Nia Archives are tapping the boisterous energy of mid-90s music – and even embracing the union jack. Can they avoid the genre’s laddish lows?</p><p>For some, Britpop was a high point for British guitar music: that time when Blur, Pulp, Suede and Oasis thrilled the world with wit and brio. Others argue it has aged worse than Loaded magazine: blokey, beery, conservative and still clogging up the charts. Indeed, there’s perhaps something a bit dismal about the fact that James and Shed Seven have both had No 1 albums in 2024.</p><p>Nevertheless, a crop of young artists are turning to the energy and iconography of mid-90s Britain for inspiration.

Here he delegates performance duties to several very different ensembles – other guitarists, a percussion troupe, a singer and cellist – to create a diverse suite unified by a singular vision.</p><p>Minimalism is often robotic, repetitive and melodically stunted, but Crowell’s minimalism is wonderfully rich and harmonically complex: busy arpeggios sketch out dense, extended chords that constantly mutate and move in unexpected directions.

Based on Tom Wolfe’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/1998/nov/07/fiction.tomwolfe">1998 novel</a> of the same name, the drama stars Croker (Jeff Daniels) as a more nuanced figure than the book’s Trumpian character. As his business falls apart and former allies turn against him, viewers might feel their sympathies split – the forces facing Croker feel just as absurd and malign as the man himself. The adaptation (which also stars Diane Lane and William Jackson Harper) doesn’t quite manage the state-of-the-nation heft of the novel. But it’s still a nicely satirical study of American hubris. <em><br />Netflix, from Thursday 2 May</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/26

<ul><li>Atlanta selected the Washington QB with No 8 pick in the draft</li><li>Cousins signed $180m contract with Falcons this offseason</li></ul><p>The Atlanta Falcons provided the shock of the first round of the NFL draft by selecting quarterback Michael Penix Jr with the No 8 overall pick on Thursday night.<br /><br />The Falcons extended their recent trend of selecting offensive skill players in the first round by drafting Penix one month after signing Kirk Cousins to a four-year, $180m contract with $100m guaranteed. Using a draft slot normally targeted for players expected to make an immediate impact, the Falcons picked Penix as the apparent long-term successor to the 35-year-old Cousins.<br /><br />The Falcons had been expected to use the pick to boost their pass rush.<br /><br />The Falcons also focused on offensive playmakers with their last three first-round picks. Tight end Kyle Pitts was the No 4 overall pick in 2021, followed by wide receiver Drake London and running back

<p>The annual White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner returns this Saturday for a night of comedy ‘roasting’ – where the great and the good are ruthlessly mocked in celebration of the freedom of the press.</p><p>In recent years, however, the night has taken on a different tone, with the atmosphere of warm self-deprecation and bipartisan bonhomie replaced by something more scathing and serious.</p><p>This week Jonathan Freedland is joined by Jeff Nussbaum, a former senior speech writer to Joe Biden, to discuss the art of writing gags for presidents and whether there is still space for humour in US politics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2024/apr/26/is-there-humour-left-in-the-white-house">Continue reading...</a>

Ryan Gosling’s role in stuntman pic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/13/the-fall-guy-movie-review-ryan-gosling-emily-blunt">The Fall Guy</a>, hard on the heels of his show-stopping Oscars rendition of I’m Just Ken, is perfectly timed to confirm his ascension to the very top tier of stardom. Not only is it a four-quadrant entertainment turbo boost – covering all audience bases with action, romance, a legacy franchise for the oldies, John Wick-slick for the kids – it is shrink-wrapped to his public persona. His role as stunt veteran Colt Seavers, saving the skin of the idiot megastar he doubles for, caps off the stance Gosling has upheld on talkshows and memes over the last decade: stardom and celebrity as a delectable fac

<p>There’s plenty of great stuff in this documentary to keep super fans happy – but you only need to know 80s banger Livin’ on a Prayer to get emotional as the ageing band break down before your very eyes</p><p>Every pop biography has the same dilemma: fans of the artist want to know all the details, while viewers with only a passing interest just want to get to the good stuff. You can tell which side of the line Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story falls on by looking at the running time. Its four episodes are all well over an hour long.</p><p>By far the strongest instalment is the opener, which can be watched in isolation as an evocative charge through the period leading up to the band’s formation and breakthrough. The best rockumentaries have the power to pitch us into a past moment we wish we could hang out in – the place and time here that crackles with fantastic potential is New Jersey in the back half of the 1970s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/

Trembling from confusion and fear, I fled the room in tears and screams. But my mother and her sister coerced me back into that room.
