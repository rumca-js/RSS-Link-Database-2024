		Undeterred by increasing <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202404/worldcoin-reaches-10-million-users-could-face-1m-fine-in-argentina">regulatory crackdowns</a> across the globe, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a> is hoping to seal more partnerships with tech and finance companies – including OpenAI and PayPal.

For now, details are scarce. Alex Blania, who co-founded Worldcoin alongside OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman, says that the crypto platform is not ready to announce news regarding collaboration with the generative AI firm behind ChatGPT.

Worldcoin ecosystem developer Tools for Humanity has engaged in talks with PayPal per Blania. The payment company, however, has declined to comment on any moves, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com

		Scientists from the computer vision software company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/smart-engines">Smart Engines</a> have announced they have found a way to improve the efficiency of neural networks by 40 percent. The method is based on a new quantization scheme.

Currently, deep neural networks are typically executed on specialized graphics cards, and often require more computing power than most devices have due to their increasing complexity. All user devices do, however, have a central processor, which is the world standard for 8-bit neural networks.

Smart Engines researchers have proposed 4.6-bit networks, which can operate 40 percent faster than the 8-bit model with almost no decrease in quality. It achieves this by more efficiently usin

Critics say the move announced this month by the country’s central bank will bring about several challenges and slow down business given that many citizens in the country do not have ID cards.
