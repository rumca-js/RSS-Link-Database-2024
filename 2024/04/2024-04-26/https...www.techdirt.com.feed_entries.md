Well, this ought to prompt another round of police-protecting legislation in Florida. Governor Ron DeSantis recently signed two bills into law &#8212; one that creates a 25-foot &#8220;no go&#8221; zone around police officers and one that strips police oversight boards of their independence. And that&#8217;s on top of the immediate effort made by the legislature [&#8230;]

A bunch of [&#8230;]

The FCC on Thursday once again voted along party lines to restore popular net neutrality rules stripped away during the Trump administration in a flurry of protest and sleazy industry behavior. You might recall the 2017 repeal was so unpopular that telecom giants were caught using fake and dead people to create the illusion of [&#8230;]

It feels like maybe his concerns are a bit overblown? It seems that TikTok users [&#8230;]

MAGA SLAPP suits apparently aren’t going out of style, but yet another one has been tossed out of court. Remember lawyer Steven Biss?
