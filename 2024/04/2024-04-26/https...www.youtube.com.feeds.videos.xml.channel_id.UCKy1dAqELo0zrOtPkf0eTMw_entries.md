In today's Fix of entertainment news:
Director Shawn Levy claims that the upcoming third Deadpool movie won't require any knowledge of the dozen or so shows or movies featuring the X-Men. While that may be true, we're sure the myriad of easter eggs scattered throughout that movie will be enjoyed much more if you do some homework beforehand. In other news, director Fede Alvarez posted a video to social media of him having a grand ol' time playing with a facehugger. Yes, that gross spider-thing that lays eggs in your body from the Alien movies. And finally, if you've got the coin to spare, you can pre-order the latest awesome transforming Transformer toy: Megatron. It's incredibly sick, but we're waiting for them to make a Soundwave transformer that's a working bluetooth speaker.

Dead Boy Detectives Season 1, reviewed by Eric Goldman. Narrated by Erik Adams.

Dead Boy Detectives serves as an acceptable snack between seasons of The Sandman. It’s not trying to be as ambitious as its parent show, but the core conceit here – ghost detectives solve ghost mysteries – is solid and leads to some fun installments. The more serialized aspects are hit-or-miss, with some subplots and characters feeling extraneous and meandering, even while strong performances help elevate the threats posed by its villains.

Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch. This week Daemon is joined by Ryan McCaffrey of the Unlocked podcast, and Max Scoville from Beyond. The topic: are video game publishers better off making adaptations of their games, rather than making new games? Fallout and The Last of Us are two examples of a TV adaptation of a video game done right, and Sony is leaning hard into their IP for more TV series. Is it more financially viable for an IP holder to license their properties for a prestige TV show, over making a new entry in the video game franchise? And would fans prefer that, as long as the shows are good?
