<blockquote>
	<p>
		A new C++ video has been uploaded to our YouTube channel about how declarations work and what happens when they go wrong.</p>
	<p>
		Do you know which part of a declaration is the declarator? How about what can happen with multiple variables in one declaration statement? Let us entertain you with the surprising details, including some most programmers have never seen or considered.</p>

	Windows EXE files can contain resources, including binary resources. In particular, you can embedd one or more DLLs into an EXE, and then extract them at run-time. Let's learn more about that in the following article:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		A Windows .EXE executable file can contain binary resources, which are basically arbitrary binary data embedded in the file.</p>
	<p>
		In particular, it&rsquo;s possible to embed one or more DLLs as binary resources into an EXE. In this article, I&rsquo;ll first show you how to embed a DLL as a binary resource into an EXE using the Visual Studio IDE; then, you&rsquo;ll learn how to access that binary resource data using prope

<p>
	From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		The dialogue around C++ and memory safety has intensified following recent evaluations by authoritative bodies. The White House&rsquo;s Office of the National Cyber Director issued a compelling call for a pivot toward memory-safe programming languages. This stance is predicated on a history of cyber vulnerabilities linked to memory safety issues, influencing national security and the broader digital ecosystem&rsquo;s integrity.</p>
