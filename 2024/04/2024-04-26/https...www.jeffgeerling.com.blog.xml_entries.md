<p>And a couple years ago, the 'cluster on a board' concept reached its pinnacle with the Turing Pi 2, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/turing-pi-2-4-raspberry-pi-nodes-on-mini-itx-board">which I tested using four Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4's</a>.</p>

<p>Because Pi availability was nonexistent for a few years, many hardware companies started building their <em>own</em>
