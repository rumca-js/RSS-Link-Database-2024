The team has a somewhat unusual target for its investments, aiming for startups making innovative, environmentally friendly components that are used early in the supply chain when products are being manufactured. &#8220;The same core technology actually becomes applicable across a bunch of different sectors in a bunch of different applications,&#8221; said co-founder Nate Salpeter. The fund hopes to reach sectors including advanced materials, waste, infrastructure, food and energy, with the goal of backing solutions for industries that represent 1% or more of global carbon&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/founders-with-unique-backgrounds-unite-over-climate-concerns-and-launch-new-venture-fund/">Read

For its embattled Xbox department, however, there are mixed signals. This is the second quarterly report from Microsoft that included the effects of its record-setting acquisition of the formerly independent game developer Activision Blizzard King. It’s illustrative of what was actually at stake for Microsoft over the course of the last year, as it defended its Activision acquisition in courts in the U.S. and U.K. Without Activision’s software lineup on its side, the financial story might’ve been much worse for Xbox.

But today the Microsoft CEO took a different approach, talking instead about the Secure Future Initiative that the company launched last fall to improve its cybersecurity safeguards. &#8220;We are doubling down on this very important work, putting security above all else — before all other features and investments,&#8221; Nadella said Thursday afternoon, after the company&#8217;s fiscal third-quarter earnings report. It was a brief diversion from the bigger topic of the day.
