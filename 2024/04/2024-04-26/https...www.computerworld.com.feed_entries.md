<p>What a long, strange trip it’s been.</p>



<p>From its inaugural release to today, Android has transformed visually, conceptually and functionally — time and time again. Google’s mobile operating system may have started out scrappy, but holy moly, has it ever evolved.</p>



<p>Here’s a fast-paced tour of Android version highlights from the platform’s birth to present. (Feel free to skip ahead if you just want to see what’s new in <a href="#android14">Android 14</a> or the actively-under-development <a href="#android15">Android 15 beta release</a>.)</p>

I’ve lost count of the number of assorted little improvements that’ve shown up for the tool as of late, as it relates to Android and its increasingly apparent role as the platform’s next-generation virtual assistant.</p>
