Ne-Yo's setlist stoked up audible gasps with nonstop hits from his catalog and a few he's written for megastars. He came draped in a bedazzled outfit and his signature fedora (one we had to ask him to adjust to see his eyes.) Not to be outdone, the band came outfitted in matching earth tones and sounded just as good as they looked.\n\nAs with most artists who've spent years on the radio, the charts and in the club, the challenge in our space is encapsulating those moments. He accepted this challenge by putting together a medley of some of his most celebrated jams, showing off just how prolific his pen is. \"I've written a couple songs since I've been doing this thang,\" the singer said before passing Rihanna's \"Take a Bow\" to background singer, Pamela Westbrook.

Once she got to the Desk itself, to rehearse with pianist and Metropolitan Opera assistant conductor Bryan Wagorn, the sublime amplitude of her extraordinary voice rendered the space even tinier.\nDavidsen\u2019s voice, which is incongruously gigantic and intimate, has been called \u201cone-in-a-million.\u201d I was completely sold on the hype after only a few seconds of singing.
