<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I bought a domain and already setup hostnames for my jellyfin server. Now I want to create public hostnames for ntfy and my audiobookshelf too so I can access them from outside my network. For reasons unknown, my jellyfin server had no issues and it works perfectly. However, after I setup ntfy and audiobookshelf I keep getting a &quot;server not found&quot; error when I try to open it using the public domain.</p> <p>Cloudflare tunnel had automatically created a DNS record too. So I don't think that is the issue. Can someone please help? I have read so many solutions and I can't seem to figure this out.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I’m Andrios, founder and CEO of Hoopdev, and am excited to show you our web database client with a Go-based language server that’s easy to use and built for teams. As of today, we’re launching our Free plan and anyone can start using it in 100% self-hosted mode. It works with any browser.</p> <p>Desktop database clients have always felt clunky to me. After 10 years of programming, I still find myself struggling with basic tasks—like securely configuring access or just trying to pull data from a different device. Every time I'm away from my main setup, it feels like I'm locked out of my own data. These hurdles slow me down and remind me why we need to push for web-based solutions that are not just powerful, but also intuitive and accessible right from the browser.</p> <p>At Hoopdev we are building a Clojurescript client and Golang server that keeps what’s best about database clients while modernizing the experience in the web.

Restarted my duckdns docker and the ip did indeed update but what I've noticed is some strange behaviour since. </p> <p>Initially my services were accessible but then randomly would become inaccessible again. Oddly when I ping my various configured domains they will sometime resolve to the correct ip and other times seem to return the old ip. Once again signing into duckdns shows the correct ip addresses. </p> <p>I've tried a couple of online ping tools and they have the same issue.
