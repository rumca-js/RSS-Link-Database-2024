Lightning Talk: Higher-Order Template Metaprogramming with C++23 - Ed Catmur - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

At Maven Securities for the best part of a decade, I work to make developers happier and more productive, and programs (mostly C++) faster, more powerful, and more correct.
