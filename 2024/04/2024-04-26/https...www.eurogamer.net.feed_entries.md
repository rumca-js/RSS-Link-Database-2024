It mightn't be a huge surprise to hear - given we're talking about one of Steam's most wishlisted games in recent times - but solo developer Slavic Magic's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manor-lords-early-access-review-beautiful-foundations-but-missing-important-pieces">Manor Lords</a> is off to a flying start; the medieval city builder/strategy hybrid is currently Steam's best-selling title and its fourth <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">most played</a> game just hours after launch, with over 156K concurrent players at the time of writing.
</p><p>
Manor Lords has, of course, been drawing admiring glances since the launch of its demo back in 2022. That early look resulted in half a million people adding the game to their Steam wishlists and that number has only grown; another half a million peopl

Escape from Tarkov developer Battlestate has drawn fan ire after unveiling a &euro;250 (&euro;300 after tax) special edition that, alongside special advantages some are calling pay-to-win, contains an exclusive co-op PvE mode that won't be made available to those that brought a previous edition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231229002659/https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/preorder-page">promising</a> access to "all subsequent DLCs".
</p><p>
The tactical online FPS' <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/preorder-page">new Unheard Edition</a> is positively crammed with stuff, beginning with relatively innocuous inclusions such as a digital copy of the game and closed beta access. But it also includes unique weapons and a number of paid advantages - increased stash size, expanded PMC pockets, additional slots for the

Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami has opened up about his decision to leave Tango Gameworks, as he wishes to break free from the survival horror genre.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shinji-mikami-leaving-tango-gameworks-after-12-years">Mikami left Tango Gameworks</a> - the ZeniMax owned studio he founded in 2010 - in February last year.

Animal Crossing's musical pooch KK Slider takes centre stage in a second wave of Lego sets themed around Nintendo's relaxed life sim series. 
</p><p>
KK, Isabelle and Audie minifigures are included in a new town hall set which also features an RV and a small caf&eacute; stand. (Brewster minifigure when?!)
</p><p>
A second set features the landing jetty and lookout tower of Dodo Airlines. This will include Wilbur and Tangy minifigurines.

Meta is continuing to plough billions of dollars into its AR/VR division Reality Labs, despite losses of more than $1bn every month for most of the last two years.
</p><p>
The Facebook and Meta Quest owner's latest launch is a refreshed range of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, which shrink the company's hardware into a pair of designer specs. 
</p><p>
New features here include video calling and an AI that can respond to questions based on what you're looking at. But Reality Labs as a whole is still nowhere close to turning a profit, and in its latest financial results has said it expects losses to increase as it deepens its investment.

Medieval city-builder Manor Lords is out today on PC in early access, which means we finally know how much it costs.
</p><p>
In the UK, the game costs &pound;34.99 across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/manor_lords">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/manor-lords-ef795f">Epic</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/manor-lords-game-preview/9p5f966564fs">Microsoft</a>, and is available on PC Game Pass. That's $39.99 in the US and &euro;39.99 in Europe, as well as other regional prices as listed on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1363080/">SteamDB</a>.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> will feature Joy-Con controllers that connect to the main console using magnets, a new report suggests. 
</p><p>
Citing sources from accessory manufacturers, Spanish site <a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350770848/exclusiva-switch-2-conocemos-en-primicia-nuevos-detalles-de-la-proxima-consola-de-nintendo/">Vandal</a> states that the Switch 2 Joy-Con will stick to the console itself magnetically, rather than use the fiddly rail system of the current Switch and Switch OLED.

## Destiny 2 completes U-turn on sunsetting legacy weapons, although too late for many players' dismantled guns

Bungie has announced it will remove all power limits from legacy gear in Destiny 2, a major decision for fans and the final step in a now-complete U-turn on the controversial decision made four years ago.
</p><p>
The decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-sunsetting-gear-chart-7004#section-1">cap the power of Destiny 2 weapons</a> - prodding players into the pursuit of newer options, at the cost of abandoning old favourites - was controversial when it was announced in 2020. Bungie later relented, and stopped capping weapon power in 2021, though an armoury of player favourites released prior to the Shadowkeep expansion remained in limbo.
</p><p>
Now, that's no longer the case - as a consequence of Bungie's upcoming plans to allow new or lower-level players to jump into Destiny 2's upcoming climactic The

</p><p>
On the plus side, the bundle is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/787480/Phoenix_Wright_Ace_Attorney_Trilogy/">heavily discounted and available for under a tenner</a>. That's a discount of 67 percent, so consider this your PSA to grab the bundle now if you're keen.

Legendary Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama has posthumously praised new release Sand Land, a month after he passed away.
</p><p>
Sand Land, from Bandai Namco, released this week and is based on Toriyama's manga series that debuted in 2000.
</p><p>
In celebration of the release, a statement from Toriyama has been shared on social media following the sad news of his death last month. The statement is from January this year.

## Activision Blizzard boosts Microsoft earnings, but Xbox console sales plummet

Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard has contributed to a boost in gaming revenue, but Xbox console sales have taken another massive hit.
</p><p>
In its latest earnings report, Microsoft stated gaming revenue has increased by $1.8bn, or 51 percent year-on-year, while Xbox content and services revenue specifically increased by 62 percent. Microsoft admits this is due to the net impact from the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
</p><p>
Hardware revenue, however, has decreased by 31 percent year-on-year due to poor sales of Xbox consoles. Even the release of major exclusive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-review">Starfield</a> last year couldn't improve hardware sales.
