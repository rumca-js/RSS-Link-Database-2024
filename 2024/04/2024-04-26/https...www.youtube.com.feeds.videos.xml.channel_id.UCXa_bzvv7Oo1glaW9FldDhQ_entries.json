Fallout 76 has enjoyed consistently solid support from Bethesda with new updates and content additions over the years, owing to which it has built up a sizable and dedicated player base. Recent weeks, in fact, have seen that player base growing at an even faster rate, thanks to the explosion in popularity that the Fallout franchise has enjoyed as a whole courtesy of the success of Amazon Prime's recently released adaptation.\n\nFallout 76 has, as such, seen a large number of new players jumping in for the first time, and looking at its current momentum, it's safe to say that that surge will continue for a while.
