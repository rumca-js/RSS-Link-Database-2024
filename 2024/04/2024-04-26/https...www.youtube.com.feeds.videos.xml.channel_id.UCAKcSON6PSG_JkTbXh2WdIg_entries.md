On Wednesday, April 10, 2024, The Current hosted its second Minnesota Music Month event — a live taping of The Local Show featuring performances by singer-songwriter Anna Graves and rock band Porcupine. The event also featured a proclamation by Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, declaring April 10 to henceforth be commemorated as Minnesota Music Day.

Closing out the evening was a performance by indie rock band Porcupine. Veterans of multiple music scenes the band consists of guitarist and lead vocalist Casey Virock, drummer Keith Larson, guitarist and vocalist Nick Roesler and bassist Chad Haugejorden. 

Despite the warm wood accents, carpeted ground and bottom-lit Current banners backing the band, something about their set was transportive to somewhere a little darker and a little grittier.

Laamar has been a buzzed-about artist in the scene since performing at First Avenue this past January as part of the Best New Bands of 2023 showcase. And recently, Laamar returned with his band to their biggest stage yet, Palace Theater, to open for one of Minnesota’s most recognizable names in pop-rock music: Semisonic.

Just after recording an in-studio performance and interview at MPR, his soul-Americana, racial-justice song “Say My Name” hit no. 2 on The Current’s Chart Show.

Laamar (born Geoffrey Lamar Wilson) chatted with The Current about being raised by a musician father in North Minneapolis, to now taking on a similar role as a dad of two. Laamar also talked about finding confidence in singing, connecting with the local music scene and more. Watch the performance of "Home To My Baby" above.
