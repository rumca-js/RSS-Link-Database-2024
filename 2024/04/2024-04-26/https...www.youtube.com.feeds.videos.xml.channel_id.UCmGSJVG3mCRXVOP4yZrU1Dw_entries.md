Who is the Princess of Uzbekistan, really? I spent a few weeks talking to experts and scouring the internet to get a better understanding of who she is, what she’s done, and what exactly makes her one of the most hated women in Uzbekistan.

Special Thanks to Natalia Antelava, Kristian Lasslett, Andrew Stroehlein, and everyone in Uzbekistan who shared their stories with me.
