<p>According to a court document viewed by Engadget, the Federal Trade Commission accused Amazon of using Signal‚Äôs disappearing messages feature to conceal communications as part of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ftc-accuses-amazon-of-monopolistic-practices-in-long-expected-antitrust-suit-165035712.html">antitrust suit against the company</a>. The FTC says the retailer continued to auto-delete its communications even after the agency notified it that it was under investigation and asked it to preserve them. Founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos and current CEO Andy Jassy are among the accused.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor years, Amazon‚Äôs top executives, including founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos, discuss[ed] sensitive business matters, including antitrust, over the Signal encrypted-messaging app instead of email,‚Äù the FTC wrote in the full document, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/26/amazon-ftc-messages-deleted-bezos/">acquired by</a

<p>Drake apparently learned it isn‚Äôt wise to mess with Tupac Shakur ‚Äî even decades after his untimely death. <em>Billboard</em> first <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/drake-removes-taylor-made-freestyle-ai-tupac-snoop-1235667030/">spotted</a> that the Canadian hip-hop artist deleted the X (Twitter) post with his track ‚ÄúTaylor Made Freestyle,‚Äù which used an AI-generated recreation of Shakur‚Äôs voice to try to get under Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs skin.</p>
<p>The takedown came after an attorney representing the late hip-hop legend <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tupacs-estate-threatens-to-sue-drake-for-his-ai-infused-kendrick-lamar-diss-182518997.html">threatened to sue the Canadian rapper</a> for his ‚Äúunauthorized‚Äù use of Tupac‚Äôs voice if he didn‚Äôt remove it from social channels within 24 hours. However, the track was online for a week and ‚Äî unsurprisingly ‚Äî has been copiously reposted.</p>

In 2022, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikon-z-9-mirrorless-camera-review-143006924-143006725.html">released the Z9</a>, a flagship mirrorless camera that could finally hold its own against rivals, but the $5,500 price tag put it out of reach for most.

<p>With a 45-megapixel stacked sensor and the latest Expeed 7 image processor, the Z8 can do everything from sports to wildlife to scenic photography. It's also a powerful video camera, offering 8K RAW internal capture at up to 60 fps.</p>

<p>However, the NHTSA also found that ‚ÄúTesla‚Äôs weak driver engagement system was not appropriate for Autopilot‚Äôs permissive operating capabilities.‚Äù In other words, the software didn‚Äôt prioritize driver attentiveness.

<p>Say farewell to the classic XPS 13, and say hello to the spiffy new XPS 13. Dell surprised us at CES by bringing the modern (and somewhat controversial) design of 2022's XPS 13 Plus to its entire flagship lineup, which now includes the larger XPS 14 and 16 models. With this new design, they all have invisible haptic trackpads hidden beneath the glass-covered wrist rest, a capacitive top row of function keys (which can instantly switch to media controls), and wider gap-less keyboards that  have no spacing between keys. But do those upgrades actually make them better computers than Dell's previous XPS lineup? Well, it really depends on how much you like the way they look.</p>
<p>When I<a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-16-review-beauty-and-power-comes-at-a-cost-200513721.html"> reviewed the XPS 16 last month</a>, I was impressed by its sheer power and attractiveness, but its high price and a few quirks made it a tougher sell than the XPS 15 that came before it.

For May 7, an iPad refresh has been rumored for months, and Apple‚Äôs Let Loose announcement features an illustration of a hand holding an Apple Pencil. That screams iPad to us.</p>
<p>We could see some substantial upgrades to the iPad Pro series. M3 chips are a predictable addition, but we might also see OLED displays, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>‚Äôs Mark Gurman. That should bring richer colors and deeper blacks to the iPad Pro. The technology could even lead to thinner iPads too. Given the illustration, we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if there‚Äôs a next-gen Apple Pencil or even iPad Air unveiled too.</p>
