It's 5x faster than the Pi CM4.\n\nBut is it worth the price? Dive into my test results, then we'll rack up two SBC clusters: 6 Pi CM4s on the DeskPi Super6c cluster board, and 4 Turing Pi RK1s in the Turing Pi 2.\n\nSome things I mentioned in the video (some links are affiliate links):\n\n  - My Pi Cluster open source project: https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-cluster\n  - Turing Pi 2: https://turingpi.com/product/turing-pi-2-5/\n  - Turing RK1: https://turingpi.com/product/turing-rk1/?attribute_ram=8+GB\n  - DeskPi Super6C: https://amzn.to/3UuBLMW\n  - Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/\n  - DeskPi RackMate T1: https://amzn.to/44dfYww\n  - MyElectronics dual ITX rackmount enclosure: https://amzn.to/3UxidYa\n  - My 2021 video on Turing Pi 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUPYpZBfsMU\n  - My 2022 video ", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6zt8KeXFdA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg", "source_obj__id": 161, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/h6zt8KeXFdA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Meet the new SBC Linux Cluster King!", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
