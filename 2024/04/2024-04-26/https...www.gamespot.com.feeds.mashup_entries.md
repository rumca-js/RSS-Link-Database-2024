<p>One of the strangest games of 2022, High on Life, will receive a physical release for the first time on <strong>September 19</strong>. This physical edition of a shooter starring obnoxious talking guns extends its humorous creative liberties to its cover art. Along with a half-peeled alien "sticker," the phrase "Game of the Year" is hastily scrawled on a faux duct-taped label. From a player interest perspective, High on Life essentially was the GOTY on Xbox Game Pass. At the end of 2022, Microsoft confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/high-on-life-is-biggest-xbox-game-pass-launch-of-2022-microsoft-confirms/1100-6510179/">High on Life was the biggest launch</a> of the year on the subscription service.

<p>From the moment Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo slid into their matching overalls and unleashed Super Mario Bros. on to the world back in 1993, video game fans have wondered: can video game adaptations ever be... good? For years, it seemed as if the answer was a resounding no. While some films were <em>decent</em>, the vast majority left a lot to be desired--such as good dialogue and  storylines that, you know, made sense. Recently, however, everything has changed.</p><p>In the past few years, Netflix has earned not only financial success but critical-acclaim with its television adaptations of Castlevania, Arkane, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and The Witcher. Just last year, HBO delivered a The Last of Us adaptation worthy of the coveted "prestige tv" status, while Amazon Prime's Fallout series has already left fans eager for its next season. And it's not just video game-related television shows that are finding success. The Super Mario Bros. Movie was the second-highest grossing film of

<p dir="ltr">As the number of video game remakes, remasters, and spiritual successors grows, so does the hesitation surrounding these projects. Though some might see these games as loving homages to the art and stories that made us who we are, it's just as easy to see them as attempts to bottle lightning--or perhaps, more accurately, nostalgia. So, how do these games set themselves apart? Well, as Rabbit and Bear Studios' debut title Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes--a spiritual successor to legendary RPG Suikoden--proves, having a team of veteran developers united under a beloved series' creator is a great place to begin.</p><p dir="ltr">Rabbit and Bear Studios launched back in 2020, with four ex-Konami developers at its helm: character designer Junko Kawano of Suikoden fame, Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow director Junichi Murakami, Suikoden and Silent Hill's Osamu Komuta, and Suikoden's creator, the late Yoshitaka Murayama.

<p>While Andy Serkis' Caesar was last seen in 2018's War for the Planet of the Apes, he's been gone a much longer time in the upcoming sequel, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. Nearly 300 years have passed since Caesar's death, and apes are now the dominant species on Earth. However, Caesar would probably be horrified by his self-proclaimed successor, Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand). Especially since Proximus twists and perverts the meaning of Caesar's teachings while enslaving apes and humans alike.</p><div>          </div><p>Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the newly released preview clip from Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is how many of Proximus' followers hang on his every word, especially when he gets them to chant "apes together strong."</p><p>The only ape in this scene who isn't in Proximus' thrall is Noa (Owen Teague), the young and heroic ape who is the new protagonist of the franchise. It's unclear if Noa is a prisoner or if he has infiltrated Proximus' seaside fort

Below, we look back at the RPGs first year through the eyes of fans who are still playing--what they love, and what they'd still like to see improve.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Some see Honkai: Star Rail as just another gacha. To me, it’s an evolving free-to-play RPG with more self-awareness than the average release. Right away, it sets up the intriguing mystery behind the Trailblazer and the nuclear-level object inside their body called the Stellaron, and showcases flashy, effective turn-based combat that emphasizes elemental weaknesses to break enemy toughness bars. Long after I wrapped up my review, its strengths kept me coming back as a regular player, despite complaints like power creep from new units.</p><p dir="ltr">I’m not alone in this sentiment.

Life can be tough, so we're allowed to enjoy a two-hour movie where things blow up, but those films may not be the films that are "the best."</p><p dir="ltr">According to many critics, when it comes to movies, quality is much more important than escapism.

<p>A year ago this month, Russell Crowe put on a priest's collar and vestments in The Pope's Exorcist to play Father Gabriele Amorth, who was supposedly a rock star in the field of sending demons back to Hell. But in his next horror movie, The Exorcism, Crowe's character, Anthony Miller, is much more vulnerable to evil and he's not a man of God. Instead, Anthony simply plays a priest in a film within the film. That's right, he's an actor who gets possessed while making a movie about possessions.</p><div>          </div><p>The trailer reveals that Anthony was not the first actor cast in this role, and his predecessor apparently committed suicide. That should have been Anthony's first cue to turn down his part. Instead, Anthony accepts the role and feels evil tugging at his body and soul. But his daughter, Lee Miller (Fear Street's Ryan Simpkins) interprets Anthony's vulnerability as signs that he's relapsed into his old addictions.</p><p>However, any doubts about whether Anthony is sim
