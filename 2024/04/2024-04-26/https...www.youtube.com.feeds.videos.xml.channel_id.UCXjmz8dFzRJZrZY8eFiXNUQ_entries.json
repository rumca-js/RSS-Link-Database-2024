Although most Lord of the Rings Fans feel there are closer to 4-5 endings in Return of the King, there is one major event in the books that didn't make it to Peter Jackson's three film epic.  When Sam and Frodo's journey comes to an end, and it's time to return to the Shire, things aren't as perfect as the film would depict.  But why did Peter Jackson decide to omit this scene from The Lord of the Rings entirely?  Could it have made a near-perfect trilogy better?  Or was he right to keep the ending of Lord of the Rings as it is? \n\n#lordoftherings #lotr #peterjackson #nerdstalgic \n\nSOURCES\nhttps://www.cbr.com/lord-of-the-rings-movies-cut-scouring-of-the-shire-scene/\nhttps://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/22848239/lord-of-the-ring-return-of-the-king-endings-explained-scouring-of-the-shire\nhttps://collider.com/lord-of-the-rings-original-ending-explained/\nhttps://youtu.be/dGofMtgsQyk?si=GNbBKDXm6GvUApxZ&amp;t=5685", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxsPtoronL0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXjmz8dFzRJZrZY8eFiXNUQ", "source_obj__id": 236, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/KxsPtoronL0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why They Cut The Real Ending Of The Lord Of The Rings", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
