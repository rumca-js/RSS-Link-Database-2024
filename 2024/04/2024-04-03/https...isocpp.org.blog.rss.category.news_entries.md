	The annual global C++ developer survey is now open. As the name suggests, it's a one-pager:</p>
<blockquote>
	<h2>
		<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/isocpp-2024">2024 Annual C++ Developer Survey "Lite"</a></h2>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Please take 10 minutes or so to participate! A summary of the results, including aggregated highlights of common answers in the write-in responses, will be posted publicly here on isocpp.org and shared with the C++ standardization committee participants to help inform C++ evolution.</p>
<p>
	The survey closes in one week.</p>
<p>
	<em><strong>Thank you </strong></em>for participating and helping to inform our committee and community!</p>
