Matrix fans can look forward to a brand new Matrix movie coming from director Drew Goddard. Drew Goddard is helming the new film, who you might know as the man behind The Martian and The Cabin In The Woods. No Wachowski is in the driver’s seat of this one, instead Lana Wachowski will serve as executive producer. As to why Drew is helming the film, the WB’s Motion Pictures president said, “Drew came to Warner Bros. with a new idea that we all believe would be an incredible way to continue the #Matrix world, by both honoring what Lana and Lilly began over 25-years ago and offering a unique perspective based on his own love of the series and characters.” There’s no word on if #TheMatrix movie will feature the original cast of Keanu Reeves and company, but IGN will keep you posted. We also have news on Velma season 2, plus Joker Movie 2.

Watch this tense clip from The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, an upcoming movie starring Henry Cavill, Eiza González, Alan Ritchson, Alex Pettyfer, Hero Fiennes Tiffin, Babs Olusanmokun, Henrique Zaga, Til Schweiger, with Henry Golding, and Cary Elwes.

Based upon recently declassified files of the British War Department and inspired by true events, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is an action-comedy that tells the story of the first-ever special forces organization formed during WWII by UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill and a small group of military officials including author Ian Fleming. The top-secret combat unit, composed of a motley crew of rogues and mavericks, goes on a daring mission against the Nazis using entirely unconventional and utterly “ungentlemanly” fighting techniques. Ultimately their audacious approach changed the course of the war and laid the foundation for the British SAS and modern Black Ops warfare.

Saber Interactive's CEO has confirmed that work is continuing on the Knights of the Old Republic remake, telling IGN that the game is in active development, and that they're aiming to "exceed consumer expectations." Concern for the project stems from a lack of any news of the game's progress and financial trouble with Saber's former parent company Embracer Group. KOTOR was previously in development at Aspyr, where it hung in development hell for years. In other news, hackers have reported an exploit to Sony that allowed the PlayStation Portal to run emulated PSP games. And finally, Dave the Diver is diving into PlayStation Plus on April 16.

Xbox recently began putting games like Hi-Fi Rush, Grounded, Pentiment, and Sea of Thieves on competing platforms. But with ballooning game development costs and layoffs becoming more and more common it's not just Xbox discussing how their exclusive strategy will change.

The most recent story was about how Xbox exclusives would be changing in the coming years, but PS5 exclusives have also changed. PlayStation PC games have become a much more common practice from Sony, and even Nintendo has expanded to new horizons with attractions like theme parks and movies planned.
