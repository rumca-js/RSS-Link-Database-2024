Jay Inslee signed a bill into law which key players hope will be a boon for the industry statewide and may open the door for more federal funding. House Bill 2428, sponsored by three Democrats — Rep. Paul Harris, Rep. Sharon Tomiko Santos, and Rep. Monica Stonier — extended two tax preferences for the semiconductor industry which were due to expire in 2028. The bill also reinstated six other tax preferences which expired this past January. “They’re an important signal that Washington state is invested in helping companies unlock federal CHIPS Act funding,” Jennifer Baker, president and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/washington-governor-signs-bill-that-could-stoke-semiconductor-industry-draw-chips-act-funding/">Read More</a>

Quantum computing could solve certain types of problems &#8212; ranging from data encryption and system optimization to the development of new synthetic materials &#8212; on a time scale that would be unachievable using classical computers. &#8220;Scaled quantum computers would offer the ability to simulate the interactions of&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-quantinuum-error-correction-

The report focuses on a high-profile incident in May and June 2023, when the Chinese hacking group known as Storm-0558 is believed to have compromised the Microsoft Exchange Online mailboxes of more than 500 people and 22 organizations worldwide, including senior U.S. government officials.
