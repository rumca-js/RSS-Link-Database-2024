It appears the New Jersey Department of Health still believes the state&#8217;s residents are better served by giving law enforcement another way to dodge the Constitution.

We&#8217;ve written a lot about the Murthy case at the Supreme Court, and especially how poor of a job the states did in making their argument. Now, as we await the ruling, there are a lot of questions about what it will look like and how consequential it will be. This week, we&#8217;re joined by [&#8230;]

After several years of litigation across the federal appellate courts, the U.S. Supreme Court in a unanimous opinion has finally&#160;crafted a test&#160;that lower courts can use to determine whether a government official engaged in “state action” such that censoring individuals on the official’s social media page—even if also used for personal purposes—would violate the First [&#8230;]

Flock Safety &#8212; a relatively recent entrant to the surveillance tech arena &#8212; is branching out. It&#8217;s courting cops with cheap ALPR cameras, unproven claims about crime reduction, and a little lawbreaking of its own. But it hasn&#8217;t abandoned its roots. It first hit the scene with plate readers it pitched to the Fun Police: [&#8230;]

Forget Mars colonies and self-driving cars. Elon Musk&#8217;s greatest challenge yet? Defeating Twitter&#8217;s relentless &#8216;pussy in bio&#8217; spam army. And let&#8217;s just say, it&#8217;s not going well. It has really been quite incredible to watch Elon rediscover some of the basics of trust &#38; safety best practices (though while consistently messing it up) as ExTwitter [&#8230;]
