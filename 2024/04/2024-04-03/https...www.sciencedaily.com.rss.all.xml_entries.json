The first-of-its-kind meta-fluid uses a suspension of small, elastomer spheres -- between 50 to 500 microns -- that buckle under pressure, radically changing the characteristics of the fluid. The meta-fluid could be used in everything from hydraulic actuators to program robots, to intelligent shock absorbers that can dissipate energy depending on the intensity of the impact, to optical devices that can transition from clear to opaque.", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/04/240403130513.htm", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "source_obj__id": 188, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Intelligent liquid", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-03T13:04:27+00:00", "description": "Scientists have discovered that bacterial populations remain stable on factory floor despite cleaning efforts in ready-to-eat food production facilities.", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/04/240403130427.htm", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "source_obj__id": 188, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Scientists further our understanding of how a foodborne bacterium can survive in food preparation environments", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-03T12:58:05+00:00", "description": "As any surfer will tell you, waves pack a powerful punch.
