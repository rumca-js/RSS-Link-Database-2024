<p>Luke Plant shows how to use the Django system checks framework to introspect models on startup and warn if a DateTime or Date model field has been added that doesn&#x27;t conform to a specific naming convention.</p>

<p>Luke also proposes &quot;*_at&quot; as a convention for DateTimes, contrasting with &quot;*_on&quot; or &quot;*_date&quot; (I prefer the latter) for Dates.</p>
