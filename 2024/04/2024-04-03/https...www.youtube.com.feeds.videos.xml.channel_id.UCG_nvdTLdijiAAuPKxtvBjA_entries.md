Madame Web is another Sony Spider-man universe movie, following up the super successful Morbius that made 300 morbillion dollars (as covered in my Morbius - How to Get Bullied by the Internet video). And this time too, the result is that Madame Web became a meme all around the internet. Somehow, Madame Web is even worse than Morbius. So in today's Anatomy of a Failure, let's see why that is... how Madame Web manages to be the worst types of a broken film possible. It was Morbin' Time before. Now It's Webbin' Time.
