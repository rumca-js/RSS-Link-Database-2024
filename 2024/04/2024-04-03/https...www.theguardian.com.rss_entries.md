<p>Midfielder burst on to the scene at the same time as Bukayo Saka and he gave a reminder of his talent against Luton</p><p>One of the Emirates Stadium’s favourite ditties, to the tune of the Status Quo classic Rockin’ All Over the World, finishes by acclaiming “Saka and Emile Smith Rowe”. One of those players has done considerably more of the song’s heavy lifting over the past two years so, on a night that never really veered from the procedural, it was heartening to see the balance shift just a little. Defeating a limited, depleted Luton gave little cause for overexcitement but it did suggest the Arsenal faithful are not flogging an entirely dead horse by hailing two lavish homegrown talents in the same breath.</p><p>Smith Rowe’s descent from decisive sure thing to bit-part enigma has been a tough watch and owes, more than anything, to a dispiriting run of injuries. Last season he returned from groin surgery to discover Arsenal, for whom he had been a ray of light in two years of r

<p>The government’s extension of free nursery hours reflects a late recognition of problems the Tories’ are ill-equipped to address</p><p>Britain’s welfare state was conceived to care for citizens from cradle to grave, although changing governments have prioritised different parts of that demographic range. The Conservatives have tended to be most attentive to the older end of the electorate. Pensioners reliably vote Tory; infants have no vote at all. But their parents do, which is why Rishi Sunak’s administration belatedly woke up to the salience of unavailable or unaffordable childcare.</p><p>The product of that realisation was a promise to expand subsidised nursery provision in the 2023 budget. Previously, parents of children aged three to four were entitled to 30 hours of free childcare a week. As of <a href="https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2024/04/02/how-to-claim-15-hours-free-childcare-code/">this month</a>, parents of two-year-olds (and earning less than £100,000 a year) will

However, this does seem the right time for me to step back from my role as BBC cricket correspondent. This summer, my 34th in the post, will be my last. In a quickly changing cricket landscape it is time for fresh legs to cover the daily duties, leaving me to focus entirely on TMS.”</p> <a href="

Yet it is Patricia Clarkson as his “morphine fiend” of a wife, just returned from a sanatorium and tumbling back into addiction, who steals the show. Clarkson exudes vulnerability along with hard denial.

There was far less said about the likelihood of Castleford joining them. While new owner Martin Jepson has targeted his investment in off-field concerns, Castleford have won as many league games as London – none – and are going to earn precious little IMG reward for their abject performances.

<p>A gardener’s super-rich boss has gone missing in this captivating interrogation of storytelling</p><p>British novelist Jonathan Buckley writes perceptively about how loneliness attends both idealism and scepticism. His work is full of solitaries: a murdered vagrant and the investigating policeman in So He Takes the Dog; the curator of&nbsp;a&nbsp;failing museum in thrall to the memory of his free-spirited ex-lover in The Great Concert of the Night. He is preoccupied by how the yearning for communion leaves us vulnerable to the charisma of mystics and mediums. A less subtle writer would come down on the side of empiricism; Buckley, though, shows how a tough-minded refusal of transcendence can lead to a&nbsp;wintriness of the heart.</p><p>Tell, his 12th novel, is presented as&nbsp;a&nbsp;transcription of five sessions of&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, further divided into&nbsp;fragments and interruptions (“indistinct”, “inaudible” or “pause”). Abandoning one of the novel’s pretences, that i

The show-stopping moment is her&nbsp;song Live to Tell, in which she pays&nbsp;tribute to friends – and the multitudes she didn’t know – who died&nbsp;from Aids. Keith Haring’s bespectacled and adorably geeky face is one of those displayed on a huge screen. He was only 31 when he died in&nbsp;1990, Madonna having called him on his deathbed. One of the most harrowing sections in&nbsp;Radiant, a compelling biography of&nbsp;the artist by Brad&nbsp;Gooch, describes Haring’s friend Bruno Schmidt encouraging him to take off his T-shirt on the beach on one&nbsp;of the artist’s final holidays, then being appalled by what was revealed: a&nbsp;back completely blackened by Kaposi’s sarcoma, the skin cancer Aids&nbsp;patients often&nbsp;developed.</p><p>Haring’s cruel fate still seems outrageous.
