		Proposed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dr_UTm1zTkQ1BWsjZzJcINuB6NVHe-UN/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bipartisan legislation</a> would “address capability gaps” at border crossings by requiring the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop and present to Congress a plan to integrate technologies such as AI, machine learning, biometrics and nanotechnology into border control.

The proposal follows the federal government’s release of an <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/dhs-maps-its-goals-and-next-actions-for-safe-ai">AI Roadmap</a> for DHS, which itself followed the White House’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-

		Self-sovereign identity (SSI) has long been an aspiration for many people working on digital identity and access to online services. Now various sectors are becoming convinced of the potential SSI holds to help them solve some of the major problems of specific industries, and the telecommunications industry is the latest example.

The Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) is suggesting that telecoms consider adopting SSI as a means of combatting SIM swap fraud.

A <a href="https://access.atis.org/higherlogic/ws/public/download/75330/ATIS-I-0000099" rel="noopener" target="_blank">25-page report</a> on the topic from ATIS argues that “SSI not only addresses the core vulnerabilities of current identity verification systems, but it also gives user

		The initial launch of the EES border control system is expected to cause worse delays at ports than airports. Those at Kent's Channel Tunnel, where French immigration processes take place under juxtaposed controls, estimate that processing times for cars would increase from under a minute to between five and seven minutes, according to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/eu-urged-to-delay-border-checks-to-avert-travel-chaos-this-autumn-xl2pzknjm">The Times.</a>

Getlink, operator for Kent's Channel Tunnel, is building a passport processing space for non-EU states. Passengers would have to get out of their cars to register their biometrics at a terminal, and only once finished, they would be able to continue to French border control.

		The struggle to balance productivity and security is becoming more pronounced as employees increasingly turn to advanced technologies and personal devices. This shift, unfortunately, also exposes them to a 15 percent increase in cyber attacks over the past three years, as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">reported</a> by IBM.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/dashlane">Dashlane</a> has enhanced security by incorporating Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, including Splunk. The company claims that this integration streamlines the monitoring of user activity data, offering a secure method for administrators to access and monitor credential activity logs and event reporting data directly from Splunk.

		Digital IDs derived from Paraguay’s national identity card and driver’s licenses are now accepted as their legal equivalents, but a civil society group is warning that the in the absence of proper regulation, the system could undermine personal privacy and other human rights.

Paraguay-based digital rights advocacy the Association of Technology, Education, Development, Research, Communication (TEDIC) issued <a href="https://www.tedic.org/en/digital-identity-in-paraguay/">the report</a> on risks of and recommendations for the national digital ID system.

		The prevalence of identity fraud incidents is making consumers weigh the fraud protection record of businesses before signing up with them, according to a new report from Veriff. The report has been released just as Daon, Au10tix and iDenfy announce new selfie biometrics customers, and a couple of FaceTec clients reveal new partnerships.

The 2024 Veriff Identity Fraud Index shows 75 of consumers now claim to consider fraud prevention record before onboarding to a service. Accordingly, 64 percent say they would be willing to go through a longer sign-up process involving an ID document check and selfie biometrics to receive stronger identity and data protection. Just over half (52 percent) of consumers say they are happy to use IDs and face biometrics to confirm t

The law also stipulates that 14- or 15-year old kids wanting accounts must provide parental consent.

For adult content sites requiring users to be over 18, the law also requires that apps and websites offer the option of “anonymous age verification,” which, according to a report in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/25/24087979/florida-
