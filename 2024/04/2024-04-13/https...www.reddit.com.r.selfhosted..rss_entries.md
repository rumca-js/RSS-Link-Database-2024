<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to use nextcloud and immich from outside my LAN. Many on reddit and youtube recommend cloudflare tunnel. But some also mention their privacy concerns and the cloudflare ability to decrypt and see all the data passing through their tunnel and/or proxy service. </p> <p>(1) So theoretically, does this mean that cloudflare has access to my nextcloud and immich data if I use their cloudflare tunnel or DNS IP proxy service?</p> <p>(2) If I use cloudflare only as a DNS service and don't use their IP proxy service, do they still have access to data?</p> <p>(3) I understand that Tailscale and VPN are alternative options to safely access selfhosted services. If someone does not want to use those two options, is setting up a reverse proxy such as Swag (with fail2ban) the next best secure and private method to access selfhosted services?</p> <p>Thanks for all the help.

After some initial research and reading numerous comments, I tried Paperless first. I managed it quite well (one of the few), and could quickly find the folder to copy my documents into. Unfortunately, I found that Paperless-ngx doesn't allow me to create my own directories to store files. This is crucial for me, as our digital documents are currently organized into folder structures and placed into corresponding folders bound to a scanner, from which we directly scan documents into the appropriate folders. A directory structure is particularly important to me, as it should also be accessible and easy to copy via, for example, an FTP client or a simple network share on Windows clients, which is especially important for my parents, as they'll take longer to

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm in search of rss/atom feed software that doesn't have multi user functionality. I'd like something where I can grab a number of different feeds, filter those feeds with keywords, and output them to HTML on nginx. The HTML page would link to the original article and have the first sentence of the article (or similar) under the title with a read full article link. It would have no &quot;mark as read&quot; feature. Is there anything like this that is configured through a configuration file. Looking for something barebones that could maybe just pull the last week or latest x amount of posts per feed. Wouldn't need quick refreshing either. Is there something like this out there? Would really like to find something simple an minimal. I prefer dockerized software and run nginx if that helps.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Queef-LaFoopa"> /u/Queef-LaFoopa </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm fairly new to doing self-hosted stuff as I've only got a Static IP for just about 3 days. So this is pretty much my first step to learning about self-hosted things. I don't know much about proxies yet (if that's what I need to get the DNS redirecting properly). </p> <p>I do have experience in managing servers, using services from AWS (Servers) and GoDaddy (Domain), but I'm more of a back-end developer and only have little experience with hosting (specifically for domain and ssl related concerns since I only work on these kind of things like once every year or two for the past 5yrs). </p> <p>I bought a domain in cloudflare and added A, and CNAME records to point to my public IP. But I'm getting a not found error. Accessing my Static IP works just fine. </p> <p>I have not yet added an SSL which I'm pretty sure is one of the issues of why this happens. I'll look into how to configure SSL with letsencrypt on my dockerized web server. But I'm also conc
