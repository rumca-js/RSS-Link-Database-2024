That’s because the California Highway Patrol (CHP) <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5rlvWHPO8K/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">announced this week</a> that it had <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/local-2/300000-in-stolen-lego-merchandise-recovered-by-chp/3384730/">arrested four people</a> it accused of swiping what police estimated was “approximately $300,000” worth of Lego sets.</p>

It says it’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3kpwzxrcdyv2r">allowing heads of state to sign up</a> now, a little over two months after it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24062837/bluesky-drops-invite-system-begins-federation-at-protocol">opened for general signups</a>.
