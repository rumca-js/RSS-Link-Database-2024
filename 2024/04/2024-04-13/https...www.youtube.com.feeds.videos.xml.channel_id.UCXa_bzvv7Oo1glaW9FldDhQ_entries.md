Broken Roads is an ambitious debut game by Australian developer Drop Bear Bytes. Inspired by classics like Wasteland, Broken Roads feels like a fresh take on the genre with how it tackles certain aspects of those games in its own way. The best example of this is in the morality system, which is handled by a moral compass instead of a linear good-or-evil line.

The only real let down in Broken Roads is its combat system, which can often end up feeling overly simplistic. However, thanks to its unique post-apocalyptic Australian setting, the game manages to make exploring its broken world quite interesting.

Then there are the other trends no one wants - terrible working conditions for developers, layoffs and the bubble of triple-A game development unceremoniously popping. Check out 15 modern trends that are destroying your favorite games.

In the run up to Stellar Blade’s release on April 26th, Stellar Blade has been often compared to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and principally this is down to both games harbouring parry-heavy swordplay and deliberate, methodical combat.
