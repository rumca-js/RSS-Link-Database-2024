<p>Now that Bluesky has opened itself up to the public and <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bluesky-will-let-users-run-their-own-moderation-services-230017647.html"><ins>introduced some new moderation options</ins></a>, the team’s decided it’s finally time to allow world leaders on board, too. A post from the official <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3kpwzxrcdyv2r"><ins>Bluesky</ins></a> account on Friday notified users, “By the way... we lifted our ‘no heads of state’ policy.” The policy has been in place for the last year as Bluesky worked through all the early growing pains of being a budding social network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bluesky remained an invite-only platform from its launch in February 2023 until February of this year, when it finally ditched the waitlist. <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://staging.bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3juzemejvyh26"><ins>Bluesky</ins></a> had said last May that it wasn’t ready

<p>It’s somehow been almost 10 years since Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi odyssey <em>Interstellar</em> was first released in theaters, and to celebrate the upcoming anniversary, Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. are bringing it back to the big screen. Per <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/interstellar-imax-70-mm-rerelease-fall-2024-christopher-nolan-1235967907/"><em><ins>Variety</ins></em></a>, Paramount announced at CinemaCon this week that <em>Interstellar</em> will be re-released on September 27, 2024 in IMAX 70mm and digital. <em>Interstellar, </em>starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain, debuted in the US in fall 2014.</p>
<p>In true form for Nolan, the film is a bit of a mind-bender. <em>Interstellar</em> presents us with a near-future Earth that is becoming uninhabitable due to an unbeatable blight that’s wiped out nearly all food crops. A team of astronauts sets out to space in search of another planet that could supp

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-xai-will-open-source-its-grok-chatbot-this-week-141615678.html">xAI</a>, the OpenAI competitor founded by Elon Musk, has introduced the first version of Grok that can process visual information. Grok-1.5V is the company's first-generation multimodal AI model, which cannot only process text, but also &quot;documents, diagrams, charts, screenshots and photographs.&quot; In xAI's <a href="https://x.ai/blog/grok-1.5v">announcement</a>, it gave a few samples of how its capabilities can be used in the real world. You can, for instance, show it a photo of a flow chart and ask Grok to translate it into Python code, get it to write a story based on a drawing and even have it explain a meme you can't understand. Hey, not everyone can keep up with everything the internet spits out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new version comes just a couple of weeks after the company unveiled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musks-updated-grok-ai-claims-to-be-better

<p>Why choose between a gaming laptop and one meant for school when you can get a PC that does both? Gaming laptops are now cheaper <em>and </em>more powerful than ever, and many wouldn’t look out of place in a classroom. If you’re aiming to do some serious multimedia work alongside playing video games online, it’s worth taking a look at a dedicated gaming system. You can find general advice on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">choosing a gaming notebook in our guide</a>. But if you want a few models that will be perfect for school and play, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<h2><strong>Are gaming laptops good for school?</strong></h2>
<p>As we’ve mentioned, gaming laptops are especially helpful if you're doing any demanding work. Their big promise is powerful graphics performance, which isn't just limited to games. Video editing and 3D rendering programs can also tap into their GPUs to handle laborious tasks. While you can find decent GPUs on som

## Microsoft's Windows 11 beta testers may start seeing ads in the Start menu

<p>Microsoft is exploring the idea of putting ads in your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040-200028741.html">Windows 11</a> Start menu. To be specific, it's looking to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/04/12/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22635-3495-beta-channel/">place advertisements for apps</a> you can find in the Microsoft Store in the menu's recommended section. I could hear you sighing in defeat if you've used Windows 10 extensively before — the older OS serves ads in the Start menu, as well, and they're also for apps you can download. At the moment, Microsoft will only show ads in this version if you're in the US and a Windows Insider in the Beta Channel. You won't be seeing them if you're not a beta tester or if you're using a device managed by an organization.</p>
<p>Further, you can disable the advertisements altogether. To do so, just go to Personalization under Settings and then toggle off &
