However, thanks to its unique post-apocalyptic Australian setting, the game manages to make exploring its broken world quite interesting.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcBr3eZ2Qzw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gcBr3eZ2Qzw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Broken Roads Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-13T13:30:26+00:00", "description": "Trends are said to define a significant portion of one's existence, and video games are no different.
