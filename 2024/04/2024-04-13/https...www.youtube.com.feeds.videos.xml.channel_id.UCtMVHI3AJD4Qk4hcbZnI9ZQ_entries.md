Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at the Fallout TV show that just ended up dropping and while my expectations were very low it actually turns out the show has shattered any expectations and is a pretty shining example of how to turn a beloved video game into a television show properly. Thanks for watching!
