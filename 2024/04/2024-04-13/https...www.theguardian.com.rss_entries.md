<p>This season’s title race is thrilling because all the contenders are imperfect. Sport is nothing without a sense of jeopardy</p><p>In Chad Harbach’s 2011 novel <em>The Art of Fielding</em>, the shortstop Henry Skrimshander is approaching the US college record for the most consecutive errorless baseball games when a throw inexplicably goes awry and hits a teammate in the dugout. At that, his confidence evaporates to the point that he can no longer execute the most basic skills; he gets the yips. What lingers from the novel, for me, is the crushing sense of pressure of having errors recorded like that, appearing even on the scoreboard, as though the sport had become less about the achievement of glory than about the avoidance of mistakes.</p><p>Avoiding mistakes is good. Some people should be judged on the avoidance of mistakes. Postal workers, bus drivers, indexers, especially surgeons and air-traffic controllers, should carry on not getting things wrong. But sport? Shouldn’t sport

<p>For Manchester United, is there a more damning indictment of their current state than the fact they have faced more shots than anyone else in the division this season? André Onana’s goal was peppered again here and they have now conceded a league-high 574 shots. The other teams at the top that list? Sheffield United, Luton and Burnley, a trio mired deep in relegation trouble. It is so easy for sides to ruffle United and it seems Erik ten Hag does not know the solution either, though Bruno Fernandes scored twice at Bournemouth to prevent a humbling defeat. Dominic Solanke and Justin Kluivert struck for Andoni Iraola’s swarming side and the hosts thought they earned a stoppage-time penalty, only for VAR to rescue Willy Kambwala from further pain.</p><p>There were nine minutes of first-half stoppage time and while Fernandes, the United captain, clipped the crossbar with a dipping shot from 25 yards as he went in search of an equaliser, when the fourth official indicated as much it was

<p>The legal repression of activism has been fast and frightening, yet it won’t make protesters disappear and only sows division</p><p>Years ago, when Dr&nbsp;Sarah Benn recognised the scale of the climate crisis, she made sure that she was doing all the right things. She recycled, she went vegan, she stopped flying, she voted Green, she signed petitions. It was because she didn’t see real change happening, despite doing all those things, that she then went further. She glued her hand to a building. She sat down in front of an oil terminal. And she stood on a grass verge with a handwritten sign, saying, “Stop New Oil”.</p><p>Benn’s story will be pretty familiar to anyone with a passing interest in the current wave of climate protest. This wave grew out of deep frustration with existing avenues for change. And it did feel, for a time, as if these protests might be a catalyst for the wider shift that so many people recognised was urgently needed. The marches and sit-downs sparked so muc

Our writers suggest the one piece that can help you understand masters old and new</p><p>On 26 April 1937 the Basque town of Guernica was bombed by Hitler’s Luftwaffe and the Italian Legionary Air Force. Picasso, a Spanish artist settled in Paris, paid homage to the killed with this cubist history painting. Moments of revelation punch through the jagged mayhem to hit your heart. The baby cradled in a screaming mother’s arms hangs its head upside down, eyes blankly open, mouth obliviously gaping: it is dead, you realise as if for the first time. Picasso asks in each line of this figure what a child’s death means. He poses similarly agonising questions across the canvas: what does it feel like to be the woman in the burning house, arms outstretched to a God who is not showing any mercy today? And how does the universe permit the pain of that sc

<p>The destructive desires of an inoffensive family man drive this subversive satire of existentialism </p><p>For Jean-Paul Sartre’s protagonist in Nausea, it was a stone on the&nbsp;beach that prompted overwhelming abhorrence at the nature of existence. For Rupert Thomson’s Phillip Notman, it is the beep of an electronic reader as it registers a travelcard. How to Make a Bomb (published as Dartmouth Park in the US), Thomson’s 14th novel, opens with Notman leaving an academic conference in Bergen, Norway. He is returning to London, where he lives with his wife Anya. Their son, Seth, has&nbsp;recently recovered from a suicide attempt and is now at university. On&nbsp;the Bergen tram, Notman feels that a “hand had wrapped itself around his&nbsp;brain, and it was squeezing”. Everything around him is suddenly “unbearable” because it is “artificial”.</p><p>At the conference, Notman met a&nbsp;Spanish sociology professor, Inés Vaquero de Ayala, younger than him and not a mother, who wears a

They’re good with steamed seasonal greens, too. Other variations on the theme include placing a cube of mozzarella in the middle of each ball and taking this dish to the next level.
