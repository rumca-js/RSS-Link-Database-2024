All current paid subscribers will be transferred to its sister company, NordVPN. It&rsquo;s just one in a long line of VPNs that have been absorbed by larger security services in recent years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citing increased competition and rising costs as the main reason behind the shutdown, Atlas VPN stated that the &ldquo;insurmountable challenges&rdquo; had become too much and it could no longer keep up in a highly competitive market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The popular freemium VPN service was acquired by Nord Security in 2021 with promises that Atlas VPN would continue to operate independently as a business.
