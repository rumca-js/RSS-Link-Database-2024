Loyal Theorists, we all know that stunt performers are the _true_ unsung heroes of Hollywood. For crying out loud, why don't they have their own Oscar yet? But, putting that (begrudgingly) aside, today we're paying our own honors to the stunt community by asking if an action hero could be a hero in real life. And we're basing all of it on the new Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt movie The Fall Guy. Could a movie star survive an explosion? Scale a building? Jump multiple stories in a car? Today we find out!
