<p>Leading artificial intelligence companies including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta and others have jointly pledged to prevent their AI tools from being used to exploit children and generate child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The initiative was led by child-safety group Thorn and All Tech Is Human, a non-profit focused on responsible tech.</p>
<p>The pledges from AI companies, Thorn <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.thorn.org/blog/generative-ai-principles/">said</a>, “set a groundbreaking precedent for the industry and represent a significant leap in efforts to defend children from sexual abuse as a feature with generative AI unfolds.” The goal of the initiative is to prevent the creation of sexually explicit material involving children and take it off social media platforms and search engines. More than 104 million files of suspected child sexual abuse material were reported in the US in 2023 alone, Thorn says. In the absence of collective action, generative AI is po

<p>Tesla has shown off a preview of an upcoming ride-hailing feature in its app ahead of an August robotaxi unveiling. The company released mock-ups of the upcoming feature, which showed the ability to “summon” a ride from the Tesla app.</p>
<p>The company didn’t offer many details about how it would work, but images show Uber-like functionality, with the ability to remotely set the car’s temperature ahead of its arrival. Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced earlier this month that the company <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-will-unveil-a-robotaxi-on-april-8-according-to-musk-013853363.html">would unveil </a>its long-promised robotaxis August 8.</p>

<p>Roland has a new on-the-go podcasting setup with an eye-catching price. The company’s Go:Podcast studio includes a USB condenser mic (with support for four polar patterns) and a companion app that can stream to platforms like YouTube, Twitch and Facebook.</p>
<p>The company describes the Go:Podcast as “the simplest way to do high-quality live streaming with a mobile device.” For $140, you get the USB microphone and access to the companion app (iOS and Android), which supports live streaming, including dual-camera setups. The latter can work simultaneously with your smartphone’s front and back cameras, or you can pair a second “satellite” camera to complement your phone’s. It also supports wireless screen sharing for things like live-streaming mobile gameplay.</p>

<p>For most <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html">wireless headphones</a>, active noise cancellation (ANC) is a primary feature, especially at the mid-range to premium levels.

<p>If you use Sonos speakers, chances are you’ve used their app and encountered at least a little frustration at some point. I don’t think it’s a <em>bad</em> app when you consider the many functions it needs to juggle: finding and playing music from dozens of services, managing multiple connected speakers, running people through setup and troubleshooting and so on. But at the very least, it’s fair to suggest that it’s a little long in the tooth. Sonos knows this, too, and is announcing a totally new app for Android and iOS that was written from the ground up. It’ll be available on May 7.</p>
<p>I spoke to Sonos VP of user experience and user research Neil Griffiths about the redesign, and he said that it came as a result of talking to hundreds of customers about their listening habits and the way they want to use the app. From those conversations came two principles the company followed for the new app. One was to make it easier for people to play back whatever audio content they hav

The Quest OS is being rebranded to Meta Horizon OS and already has two companies interested.</p>
<p>ASUS’ Republic of Gamers (ROG) brand is working on new “performance gaming” headsets, while Lenovo’s focus is on devices for “productivity, learning and entertainment.” However, most intriguingly, perhaps, Meta says it’s also working on a limited-edition Xbox “inspired” Quest headset. (Microsoft and Meta also worked together recently to<a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-lands-on-meta-quest-headsets-204929253.html"> bring Xbox cloud gaming to the Quest</a>.) While this could just be a reskinned Quest 3, this collaboration could lead to future headsets made entirely for Microsoft’s consoles. If PlayStation can have VR, then

<p>Atlus first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metaphor-refantazio-is-a-fantasy-rpg-from-the-team-behind-persona-5-183345120.html">teased</a> that it was working on a new RPG with a fantasy setting in mid-2023 — it also said way back then that it will be available sometime this year. Now, the developer has revealed that the game, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/heres-a-new-trailer-for-that-cool-looking-fantasy-rpg-from-the-persona-5-team-012127188.html"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, will come out on October 11 at a special livestream event. Katsura Hashino, the director of the game, as well as of <em>Persona 3, 4</em> and <em>5</em>, also introduced a 30-minute hands-on gameplay that gives you quite a lengthy look at its story and combat mechanics. Similar to the Persona games, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> has a turn-based combat system with what Atlus says is a &quot;blend of real-time action.&quot;</p>

<p>Microsoft has unveiled its latest light AI model called the Phi-3 Mini designed to run on smartphones and other local devices, it revealed in a new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219">research paper</a>. Trained on 3.8 billion parameters, it's the first of three small Phi-3 language models the company will release in the near future. The aim is to provide a cheaper alternative to cloud-powered LLMs, allowing smaller organizations to adopt AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Microsoft, the new model handily outperforms its previous Phi-2 small model and is on par with larger models like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-and-microsoft-release-llama-2-an-ai-language-model-for-commercial-use-163615807.html">Llama 2</a>. In fact, the company says Phi-3 Mini provides responses close to the level of a model 10 times its size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly a year after <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-adds-generative-ai-editing-to-photoshop-110034887.html">adding</a> generative AI-powered editing capabilities to Photoshop, Adobe is souping up its flagship product with even more AI. On Tuesday, the company announced that Photoshop is getting the ability to generate images with simple text prompts directly within the app. There are also new features to let the AI draw inspiration from reference images to create new ones and generate backgrounds more easily. The tools will make using Photoshop easier for both professionals as well as casual enthusiasts who may have found the app’s learning curve to be steep, Adobe thinks.</p>
<p>“A big, blank canvas can sometimes be the biggest barrier,” Erin Boyce, Photoshop’s senior marketing director, told Engadget in an interview. “This really speeds up time to creation. The idea of getting something from your mind to the canvas has never been easier.” The new

<p>Securing your online footprint can seem like a daunting task. We’ve become accustomed to giving up bits of data for convenience, and have been forced into trusting our internet service providers because access has become so vital to everyday life. You don’t have to blindly accept this, though: using a virtual private network (VPN) can be an easy way to gain back some of your anonymity and security while browsing online. Still, it can be challenging to differentiate which service makes most sense for your online needs. We tested nine popular VPNs to narrow down our top picks and provide advice on choosing the best VPN service for you.</p>
<h2>What is a VPN?</h2>
<p>VPNs, or virtual private networks, mask your IP address and the identity of your computer or mobile device on the network and creating an encrypted "tunnel" that prevents your internet service provider (ISP) from accessing data about your browsing history. VPNs are not a one-size-fits-all security solution, though.</p>

<p>Amazon customers in California won't be able to get drone deliveries anymore. The e-commerce company has closed its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-air-lockeford-california-170945262.html">delivery site in Lockeford</a>, which has been operational since 2022, and will now offer its personnel in the area opportunities at other sites. Amazon made the revelation almost as an aside in an <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazon-drone-delivery-arizona">announcement</a> that it's launching drone deliveries in the West Valley Phoenix Metro area later this year. Its drones will be deployed from facilities near its Tolleson fulfillment center. Amazon says it's the first time drone deliveries will be fully integrated into its network, and it will allow the company to fulfill and deliver purchases more quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company doesn't have an exact launch date for its drone deliveries in Phoenix, because it's still working with the Federal Aviati
