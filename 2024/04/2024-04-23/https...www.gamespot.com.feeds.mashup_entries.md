<p>NetEase Games, the publisher behind the upcoming hero shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/">Marvel Rivals</a>, has shared a video showcasing what the god of mischief, Loki, can do in an arena. In true Loki fashion, many of his moves will be based on confusing players as much as possible.</p><p>In this new trailer, we can see his efficient long-range attacks, but that's not all he has up his sleeve. If players get too close to him, he can leave his body and move somewhere safe. He'll also have the power to teleport to nearby areas, similar to Reaper's ability in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a>. What's most notable about Loki is that his ultimate move allows him to become another character, and in doing so, he gains all of their abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">As of now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522324/">Marvel Rivals doesn't have a release date</a>, but it'll be

Instead, developer 343 Industries gave the Plasma Pistol's original functionality to the game's new electricity-based weapons, the Disruptor and the Shock Rifle. That left the Plasma Pistol without much utility aside from its normal shield-depleting charge shot, much to the sadness of old-school Halo fans.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">It may have taken two and a half years, but the Plasma Pistol will once again be useful come Halo Infinite's Banished Honor update on April 30.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-is-finally

<p>Take-Two Interactive has won a case regarding its depiction of LeBron James' tattoos in NBA 2K. While James himself was not involved in the case, his tattoo artist, Jimmy Hayden, was.</p><p>Hayden sued Take-Two by alleging that the use of James' tattoos in NBA 2K violated his rights as he was not compensated despite being the one who inked them onto the basketball star. However, an Ohio <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/akpemwrmnpr/TATTOO%20COPYRIGHT%20TRIAL%20verdict.pdf">federal jury</a> rejected those allegations. Since Take-Two had an agreement to use James' likeness in the game, the studio also had an implied license to also depict those tattoos onto his character.</p><p>As a result, the jury determined that Hayden's rights were not violated.

<p dir="ltr">Supergiant Games has never made a sequel. Instead, it's a studio that has consistently iterated and innovated with each subsequent game, arguably culminating in the team's greatest work to date: Hades. The engrossing roguelite dazzled with tight and engaging combat, an iconic visual presentation, and novel take on a persistent narrative that interweaves the progression of its story with its repeating gameplay loop. If Supergiant Games were ever going to commit to a sequel, Hades definitely provided the most fertile ground for further development, ensuring that its follow-up has a strong foundation established in a proven hit. Hades II's technical test is a small slice of the game and a very quick look at how Supergiant plans to build on the success of the first game, but it's already clear that it is anything but a safe improvement on what has come before.</p><p dir="ltr">Hades II stars Melinoe, sister of Hades protagonist Zagreus and the daughter of the titular god.

<p>We're living in an impressive era for sci-fi, and you can thank shows like Battlestar Galactica for raising the bar of episodic storytelling when it debuted in 2004. If you're looking to revisit this modern classic--which is a reboot of the 1978 TV series--Amazon has discounted the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battlestar-Galactica-Edward-James-Olmos/dp/B0036EH3U2?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series Blu-ray Box Set</a> from $100 to $62. It's worth mentioning that Battlestar isn't available with any streaming subscription services in the US. Instead, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-1/dp/B000UU2YKE?tag=gamespot-promos-20">episodes cost roughly three bucks each on Prime Video</a>, while each season can set you back $35. Needless to say, $62 is actually quite the bargain for all four seasons.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battlestar-Galactica-Edward-James-Olmos/dp/B0036EH3U2?tag=

<p dir="ltr">A new trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-raid-launch-time-and-everything-we-know/1100-6522790/">The Final Shape</a>, gives the clearest sense we've yet seen of what players can expect when they venture inside the Pale Heart of the Traveler. It's a weird, somewhat distorted reflection of the world Guardians have explored for the last 10 years, made all the more unsettling by the creeping, corrupting influence of the Witness spreading through it.</p><p dir="ltr">The new trailer sets a haunting tone for The Final Shape, which stands as the culmination of 10 years of storytelling in the Destiny universe. It's narrated by Cayde-6, the upbeat, jokey Vanguard leader who died in the Forsaken expansion and who is resurrected within the Traveler by unknown means. Nathan Fillion reprises the role after seasoned voice actor Nolan North briefly stepped in d

<p>Brian Helgeland (Man on Fire, A Knight's Tale) was writing the Game of Thrones spin-off 10,000 Ships, a series that author George R.R. Martin signed off on, but the show was never made.

<p dir="ltr">Before developer Epic decided to switch gears and build a battle royale mode for Fortnite, there was an Uber ride to Disney in 2017. That drive led to the decision to alter the game's course and arguably the video game industry as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">Donald Mustard, former chief creative officer at Epic, revealed to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/donald-mustard-fortnite-agbo-shadow-complex">Game File</a> (via <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-interview-epic-mustard-uber-ride-1851427317">Kotaku</a>) when the company ultimately agreed to a battle royale mode in Fortnite. "It was Tim Sweeney [founder and CEO of Epic] and Paul Meegan, who was the president of Epic at the time, [and] Kim Libreri, Epic's CTO," Mustard recalled. "The four of us were in the back of an Uber in California, headed to a meeting at Disney… We were already toying with this [idea that] we need to do a battle royale. We should do this. And what if we did it in Fortnite?"</p><p

<p>Another season of Fortnite Festival has brought us a new Festival Pass and a new Icon skin with Billie Eilish, but the biggest bit of news at the start of Season 3 may be that Fortnite Festival now supports guitar controllers.</p><p>With Eilish as this season's headliner, the Festival pass has undergone some significant changes to structure it more like the event passes, like the current <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-elements-event-adds-avatar-powers-aang-skin-and-more/1100-6522599/">Avatar Elements</a> pass. That means in this season (and presumably those in the future), buying the premium Festival Pass for 1800 V-Bucks will instantly unlock a skin for the related artist--in this case the Green Roots Billie skin--and you can earn an additional, exclusive style at the end of the pass.</p><p>That bonus style is another change to the way the Festival Pass works. Epic has placed a disclaimer on these passes, reserving the right to sell the cosmetics from the pass
