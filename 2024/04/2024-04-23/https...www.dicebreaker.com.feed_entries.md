But it&rsquo;s exceedingly rare that the video games filter back to the tabletop, which makes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-darktide-review-a-horde-of-minor-flaws-can-be-overcome-by-faith">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>&rsquo;s upcoming miniatures skirmish box that much more surprising.</p><p>Announced on the Warhammer Community page on April 22nd, Darktide: The Miniatures Game transmutes the setting, plot and characters of Fatshark&rsquo;s cooperative action shooter video game into a mission-based tabletop experience for up to four

The brutal and dirty introspective world of the first Fallout video game has since been buffed and shined into an impressive-looking theme park, one that features all the recognisable elements of the series - freshly adapted as a big-budget Amazon TV show - but lacks the real purpose behind them.</p><p>One of the big appeals of Fallout is its twist on the post-apocalyptic formula: positing that the political tensions of the late 1940s and &lsquo;50s continued for several decades and eventually boiled over into all-out nuclear warfare in 2077. It would make sense that if human society, as we know it, ended in a certain era, then the culture of that era would continue to remain relevant for years to come simply because it's all that&rsquo;s left. This is why the worl
