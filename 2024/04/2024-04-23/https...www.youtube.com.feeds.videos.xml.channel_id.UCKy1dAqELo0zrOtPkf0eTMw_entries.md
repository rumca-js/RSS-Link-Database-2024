The trailers for Deadpool & Wolverine definitely raise more questions than they answer. The plot of this long-awaited third Deadpool movie is still shrouded in mystery, and it’s only with the release of the full trailer that we’ve even gotten a good look at Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine. But which Wolverine is this, anyway?

That’s probably the biggest question surrounding the new trailer. So let’s take a closer look at the evidence and why this might not be a version of Logan we’ve ever seen before. And while we’re at it, what does Wolverine have in common with Tom Hiddleston’s Loki? Here’s what we know.

Deadpool & Wolverine stars Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, Emma Corrin, Morena Baccarin, Rob Delaney, Leslie Uggams, Karan Soni and Matthew Macfadyen. The film will be released in theaters on July 26, 2024.

The main voice actors for Grand Theft Auto 5 have confirmed what we all hoped was true: there was story DLC planned for the game. According to the voices of Trevor, Michael, and Franklin, work had begun on the expansion and some of the dialogue was even recorded, but it was scrapped when GTA Online blew up, becoming a huge cash cow for Rockstar. In other news, the modding team behind Fallout London is a little annoyed with Bethesda. When news dropped that Fallout 4 was getting an official current-gen update, it put the team behind Fallout London in a tough spot. The much-hyped mod may run into compatibility issues with the new update, possibly making it unplayable, and the mod team would've at least loved a heads' up from Bethesda that the update was on the way. And finally, Microsoft is rolling out a new Xbox. No, it's not a pro model, it's a Series X with a limited edition X-Men comic on the panels. And to match the console, the Xbox Design lab is making contro

The latest trailer for Indika poses difficult questions about what is fair and unfair, and gives us another look at the upcoming narrative-driven adventure game. Indika is centered on a nun grappling with the voice of the devil within her. It delves into themes of self-discovery and what we, as humans, do when we have an internal clash of our beliefs. Indika will be available on PC on May 2, 2024, and later that month on Xbox Series X/S and PS5.

Embarking on a quest to deliver a significant letter, Indika finds herself compelled to confront the very foundations of her faith. Was her devotion to a cause greater than herself a voluntary sacrifice? This deliberate imbalance not only shapes her narrative but also influences the lives of those around her. Indeed, the inherent unfairness of life itself prompts reflection—isn't that a truth we can all acknowledge?

Tales of Kenzera: Zau reviewed by Jarrett Green on PlayStation 5, also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.

The worst thing I can say about Tales of Kenzera: Zau is that it’s platforming and level designs are fun, clearly inspired by some of the best Metroidvanias around, but don’t really produce any moments that rival those inspirations. Its combat, though also simple and familiar, manages to sing thanks to the small but meaningfully different offerings of skills and enemies. And that action is ultimately just  a satisfying break from the main attraction: a truly moving tale about how to go on in this world when your loved ones have passed on to the next.
