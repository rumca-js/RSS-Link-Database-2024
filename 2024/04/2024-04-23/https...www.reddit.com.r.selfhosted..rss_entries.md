For a long time I ran all services in bridged mode and accessed them simply with &lt;NAS hostname&gt;:&lt;Port&gt;.</p> <p>For making some services available externally, I configured an NPM instance on Docker in bridged mode using other ports than 80/443 internally as both are occupied by the NAS FW. All ran fine.</p> <p>No I want to finally make also my internal services accessible with a FQDN and a split DNS setup with my external name. So, now I need NPM to run on ports 80/443 internally and also it should be able to identify internal vs. external requests. Therefore, I configured NPM to use a MACVLAN as the &quot;Host&quot;

If I leave it as it is, it just looks ugly on the dashboard.</p> <p>I was thinking about migrating to Cosmos Cloud, but I don't know if it will be OK with app installed in Portainer.
