Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news! I have been gone for a long time- taking some very much needed time away from Youtube and the internet- BUT I AM BACK!\n\nAnd it's for good reason. Meta just laid out some of the craziest plans I could have ever imagined. Almost over night solving (or potentially solving) some of the biggest issues VR has in the market right now. Of course- along with new plans comes new potential dangers. Right now we're looking at a new store, new operating system, and Meta partnering with other vendors to sell headsets with the new Quest operating system. Wild. \n\nAlso... this is 5 years on youtube as of this video! Thank you so much for all of your time and love and support. NOW LETS GO MAKE SOME COOL STUFF.\n\n\nLink to my discord server to join in ThrillseekerLab!\nDiscord.gg/Thrill\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/Thrilluwu\n\nLink to Schism VRChat Music event this weekend: \nhttps://vrc.group/SCHISM.6833\nD", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck0P8HfR_OE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCSbdMXOI_3HGiFviLZO6kNA", "source_obj__id": 368, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/Ck0P8HfR_OE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Quest is about to Change Forever - Meta's Insane Plans for VR's Future", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
