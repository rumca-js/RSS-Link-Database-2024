The U.S. Federal Trade Commission today released its final rules addressing non-compete clauses by banning all future agreements. Non-competes have traditionally restricted workers from taking jobs with a competitor or starting a competing business. The employment clauses &#8212; which are applied to wide-ranging businesses &#8212; have been particularly contentious and polarizing in the technology sector. The FTC and others portray the clauses as stifling innovation and harming workers while some argue the agreements are necessary protections for intellectual property and trade secrets. “Non-compete clauses keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism, including&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ftc-bans-all-new-non-compete

The game, which tinyBuild published for PC, console, and mobile in 2020, was developed by We’re Five Games in Minneapolis. It&#8217;s a deliberately chaotic party game for up to four players. tinyBuild subsequently acquired We’re Five Games in February 2021. Now, in an unusual deal, tinyBuild has sold the trademark and rights for TRDS, but not We’re Five Games, to Atari.

That&#8217;s the big question going into the Redmond company&#8217;s earnings report on Thursday afternoon, for the third quarter of the company&#8217;s 2024 fiscal year. In the second quarter, Microsoft reported a 30% increase in revenue from its Azure cloud platform and related services, which included a 6 percentage point boost from artificial intelligence. That lift came primarily from Microsoft&#8217;s Azure OpenAI service, which provides access to models from Microsoft&#8217;s key AI partner.

They immediately added substantial new delivery fees for consumers, which caused demand to drop. They also cranked up their lobbying efforts, spending heavily and making frequent trips to City Hall to meet with councilmembers, according to visitor logs from the Seattle City Council. Now, a new proposal could reverse the wage standards set by the law, one of the first in the nation to set minimum pay requirements for delivery drivers.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/after-lobbying-by-uber-and-doordash-new-proposal-would-overhaul-seattles-minimum-wage-law/">Read More</a>
