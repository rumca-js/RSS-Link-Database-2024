		The Open Standards Identity API (OSIA) is now recognized as an international standard by the International Telecommunication Union’s Telecommunication Standardization Section (ITU-T)

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/open-standards-identity-api">OSIA</a>, created by the Secure Identity Alliance (<a href="https://secureidentityalliance.org/">SIA</a>), becomes ITU-T <a href="https://www.itu.int/itu-t/recommendations/rec.aspx?id=15662">Recommendation X.1281</a> – APIs for interoperability of identity management systems.

“This milestone demonstrates the maturity of OSIA and its potential to foster interoperability and promote fairness in the identity management systems market," says Debora Comparin, chair of the OSIA Initiative.

The initiative was launched in 2019

		The U.S. National Institute and Standards Institute has published a supplement to its digital identity guidelines as interim advice for agencies to use authenticators like passkeys that work across different devices.

The “<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63Bsup1.pdf">Incorporating syncable authenticators</a>” supplement to NIST SP 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management, provides guidance on using these authenticators, which are typically but not necessarily passkeys, in enterprise or public-facing applications.

It comes in recognition of the phishing-resistant security provided by passkeys, but also their non-compliance with the existing Digital Identity Guidelines. As such, the supplemen

		A federal U.S. agency wants more testing of biometrics applications in the real world, stronger protections against bias and more transparency in biometrics use, after talking the matter over with other agencies, “academics, advocacy groups and technology experts.”

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified six concerns shared by stakeholders and five considerations to address those concerns in the 66-page report to Congressional Committees on “Biometric Identification Technologies: Considerations to Address Information Gaps and Other Stakeholder Concerns.”

Concerns around biometrics include exacerbation of systemic inequality, lack of transparency, biased outcomes, limited understanding of the technology’s performance and effects, the techn

		The <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a> has launched as a non-profit to support privacy, choice, and sustainability for smart homes. This will defend against surveillance capitalism, buyouts, and open-source projects becoming “abandonware,” organizers say.

The founders have transferred over 240 projects, standards, drivers, and libraries to the foundation including Home Assistant, ESPHome, Zigpy, Piper, and Improv Wi-Fi.

In partnership with Nabu Casa, a key funder that owns Home Assistant and ESPHome, the foundation collaborates on the development of open source projects. The overall aim of the foundation is to "have the resources to be an active political advocate," it says in the announcement.

		Vietnam is set to issue digital ID cards for people to use in interactions with public agencies, complementing the VNeID mobile app.

The country’s Ministry of Public Security says the digital ID will be supported for public sector services starting in early July, but to use it Vietnamese citizens will have to have the mobile app installed and set to level 2, state-run outlet <a href="https://vietnamnet.vn/en/vietnamese-can-use-e-id-for-public-services-from-early-july-2271984.html">VietNamNet</a> reports. Both level 1 and Level 2 “e-ID” accounts include facial photos, but level 2 also includes fingerprint biometrics.

Accounts can be opened at level 1 through the app, but level 2 applications must be completed in-person at an MPS or provincial police office.

		The government of Burkina Faso recently got a boost from Japan to its efforts in conducting biometric identity enrollment for some internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the country.

The support is in the form of digital equipment worth $153,000 and it has been given through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), We Are Tech Africa <a href="https://www.wearetech.africa/en/fils-uk/news/tech/burkina-faso-japan-funds-153-000-in-biometric-registration-equipment-for-idps">reports</a>.
