<p>Nikki Amuka-Bird gives a powerful performance as a gritty deputy defending her remote sheriff’s office from armed invaders</p><p>There’s an old-timey charm about this, a (mostly) one-location action movie in the tradition of Rio Bravo, or its sort-of remake Assault on Precinct 13. Partly it’s because of the remote mountainous setting in an unnamed state, the log cabin sheriff’s office, the trucks, twangy accents and mentions of second amendment nuts; and partly because of the core device of having a heroic figure – in this case, Deputy Tabby Temple (Nikki Amuka-Bird) – defending the fort against armed invaders. But the joke’s on us because nearly the whole thing was shot in Kosovo and most of the cast is British, as is writer-director Will Gilbey, who is making his feature directorial debut after a long apprenticeship as an editor, writer and second-unit dogsbody on the distinctly estuary-accented Rise of the Footsoldier movies among others. And good luck to the lot of them, becaus

Why won’t you say? It’s weird.” “I asked the police to investigate certain matters that were in the public domain,” Daly replied. Who knows why he was so cagey? I su

<p>In this flawed but powerful book, a housing lawyer argues that an abundance of private landlords, not a dearth of homes, is to blame for the miseries of ‘generation rent’</p><p>Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the housing crisis could be solved without building any more homes? There would be no carbon emissions from construction sites, no green fields covered over, no householders upset at dwellings appearing in their view. Instead, rents would become affordable and decent homes available through changes in government policy. Such is the promise of <em>Against Landlords</em> by the author and barrister <a href="https://www.gardencourtchambers.co.uk/barristers/nick-bano/sao">Nick Bano</a>, a man who has been described as “Britain’s top Marxist housing lawyer”.</p><p>The crisis, he argues, is not one of supply but of cost. There are enough homes to go around, but they are notoriously expensive. The cause of high prices is the dominance of private landlords, of whom there are now 2.5 milli
