Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news! I have been gone for a long time- taking some very much needed time away from Youtube and the internet- BUT I AM BACK!

And it's for good reason. Meta just laid out some of the craziest plans I could have ever imagined. Almost over night solving (or potentially solving) some of the biggest issues VR has in the market right now. Of course- along with new plans comes new potential dangers. Right now we're looking at a new store, new operating system, and Meta partnering with other vendors to sell headsets with the new Quest operating system. Wild. 

Also... this is 5 years on youtube as of this video! Thank you so much for all of your time and love and support. NOW LETS GO MAKE SOME COOL STUFF.
