<p>The readability, maintainability, and usability of switch statements and expressions in Java would be improved by a proposal to allow exceptions to be handled in the switch block.</p><p>The current OpenJDK proposal, “<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/8323658" rel="nofollow">Exception handling in switch (Preview)</a>,” would be part of the Standard Edition of Java, although no specific version Java SE has been designated yet as the recipient. Specifically, the proposal calls for enhancing switch so that exceptions thrown by the selector (the e in switch (e) …) can be handled in the switch block.</p><p>Goals of the plan, which was created January 12 and updated April 19, include improving readability and maintainability by allowing switch to concisely handle all possible outcomes of evaluating the selector, and streamlining the use of APIs that throw checked exceptions, when used by the selector of a switch statement or expression.</p><p class="jumpT

<p>As I’ve been saying for the past year or so, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3706092/generative-ai-may-displace-traditional-cloud-development.html">cloud conferences have become generative AI conferences</a>, as have data center conferences, databases conferences, and you name it. It’s clearly more than just a trend—it’s a game-changing push. But we’ve seen this happen enough times in the past 30 years to know nothing is guaranteed to be a true trend. Remember “push technology?” Exactly.</p><p>As enterprises rush headlong into generative AI, selecting an appropriate infrastructure is critical for optimal performance and cost-effectiveness. Comparing cloud computing and traditional on-premises solutions reveals some interesting things when cloud platforms host generative AI applications. These weaknesses may mean public cloud computing platforms are not a slam dunk when it comes to the best place for <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/art

<p>The exponential growth of data, and in particular unstructured data, is a problem enterprises have been wrestling with for decades. IT organizations are in a constant battle between ensuring that data is accessible to users, one the one hand, and that the data is globally protected and in compliance with data governance policies, on the other. Added to this is the need to ensure that files are stored in the most cost-effective manner possible, on whichever storage is best at that point in time.</p><p>The problem is there is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all storage platform that can serve as the shared repository for all of an organization’s data, especially across multiple locations. Instead, there are myriad storage choices available from as many vendors, each of which is best suited for a particular performance requirement, access protocol, and cost profile for each phase of the data’s life cycle. Users and applications simply want reliable,

<p>Okay, so I’m just going to go ahead and say it:</p><p>It is impossible to accurately estimate a software project of any significance.</p><p>Now, a non-trivial number of you are going to read that sentence and think I’m nuts.  And maybe I am. But someone has to just say what we all know to be true but don’t want to admit.</p><p>Look, there have been countless books written, innumerable conferences held, untold consulting hours purchased, and endless blog posts written on how to be better at estimating software projects. I get it. We all work earnestly to give our best effort in an attempt to placate hungry bosses who want to know when a new feature will be ready. We all set deadlines based on a conference date and not when the software will actually be ready.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715342/why-we-suck-at-estimating-software-projects.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
