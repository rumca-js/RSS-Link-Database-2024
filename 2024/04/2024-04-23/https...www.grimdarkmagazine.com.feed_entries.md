<p>Lavanya Lakshminarayan is the award-winning author of The Ten Percent Thief, a dystopian science fiction novel set in a future version of Bangalore known as Apex City. Lavanya is a Locus Award finalist and is the first science-fiction writer to win the Times of India AutHer Award and the Valley of Words Award. She has also been nominated for the BSFA Award. Lavanya’s short fiction has appeared in numerous anthologies and magazines, including Someone In Time, The Gollancz Book of South Asian Science Fiction (Vol. 2), and Apex Magazine’s International Futurists Special Issue. Her work has been translated into French, Italian, Spanish, and German. She is also a game designer and has built worlds for Zynga Inc.’s FarmVille franchise, Mafia Wars, and other games. I recently had the pleasure of discussing with Lavanya about The Ten Percent Thief, her approach to writing, and her future plans.
