<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 23 April 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01866-4">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01866-4</a></p>Combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and photoluminescence spectroscopy, an elementary excitation in hexagonal-boron-nitride-based single-photon emitters has been demonstrated, giving rise to multiple regular harmonics that can explain the wide frequency range of these emitters.
