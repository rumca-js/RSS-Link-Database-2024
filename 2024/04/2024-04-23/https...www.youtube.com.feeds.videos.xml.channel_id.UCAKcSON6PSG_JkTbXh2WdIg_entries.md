Angie McMahon is an artist from Melbourne, Australia, but several of her influences are rooted in North America; to wit: Bob Dylan, the Potawatomi author and scientist Robin Wall Kimmerer, and the Bon Iver network.

McMahon’s latest album, "Light, Dark, Light Again," was released in October 2023 on @AWAL. On tour in support of the album, McMahon stopped at The Current to talk with host Zach McCormick about her record, including what it was like to work with producer Brad Cook. (Based for several years now in North Carolina, Cook’s origins are in the creative Eau Claire, Wisconsin, nucleus that produced so many fine musicians.) “I'd never, you know, traveled across the ocean to record,” McMahon says. “I left my band back home, and Brad pulled some really great musicians together for us to do the songs, and he was really helpful with me.”

Watch and listen to McMahon’s full interview with Zach, above.

## Erik Koskinen -- Hard Times For Everyone (live at Radio Heartland for The Current)

Well, the friendship bread model is not too dissimilar from the way Erik Koskinen and his friends put together the songs for Down Street/Love Avenue, Koskinen’s latest album, released April 5. “I kind of just invited a lot of musician friends to add stuff to [my demos],” Koskinen explains. “And the idea was if I let them add something to it, and they thought of somebody else who would be good for that track, they were then invited to give it to somebody else without me even having to really know about it. It wasn't really a plan, and that built into what happened on how the record got made.”

Koskinen and his bandmates visited the Radio Heartland studio to play a selection of tracks from the forthcoming album. Watch and listen to "Hard Times For Everyone" above.
All songs from Erik Koskinen’s 2024 album, Down Street/Love Avenue, available on Real Phonic Records.
