<p>All that Arsenal can do is win, turn up the heat, ask the question of Manchester City, the defending Premier League champions, who retain control of their destiny in terms of this season’s thrilling title race.

<p>‘Bland’ or ‘absolutely breathtaking’? Our readers are divided over Swift’s epically long, richly detailed new album</p><p>As someone who has been a Swiftie for over a decade, my initial impression is that this album is one of her best lyrically, but production-wise it can get a bit repetitive by the end. While Folklore, Evermore and Midnights were full of either fictional tales or vague reminiscences, The Tortured Poets Department is a clear return to her old style of extremely personal, confessional songwriting, but still retaining the poetic lyricism she’s acquired in recent years. Some critics might find the album boring or confusing, but I think the fans familiar with her past work will have an easier time understanding the little details and references, and will have a great time analysing them. <strong>Elena, 23, Spain</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/apr/23/readers-divided-taylor-swift-the-tortured-poets-department">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Kanye West to Chris Pratt, the celebrity approach to housing is more out of touch than ever</p><p>Looking for a bargain beach house? Then you’re in luck. Kanye West has just lowered the price on his minimalist mansion in Malibu, California, <a href="https://therealdeal.com/la/2024/04/16/kanye-west-cuts-price-of-gutted-beach-home-in-malibu-to-39m/">to a mere $39m</a> (£31.5m) – a $14m discount on its original listing price. There is a catch though: the house has no windows, doors, electricity, plumbing or interior finishes. It’s completely uninhabitable, unless you happen to be a gull.</p><p>The sparseness isn’t a deliberate design choice – though you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. West, who also goes by the name Ye, is after all a man who opened up a lawsuit-magnet of a private school in Los Angeles called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/12/no-chairs-no-stairs-no-glass-in-the-windows-what-did-kanye-west-schoolkids-get-for-15000-a-year">Do

He ended up living in one of Philadelphia’s seamiest neighbourhoods where he felt right at home, and this leads into a portrait of young boxers at an inner-city Philly gym where training and competing have opened up whole new worlds for young men who otherwise might have been sucked into the violence of the streets.</p><p>Then the film starts going off

<p>Alan Ritchson is impressive as a father who can’t pay his desperately sick child’s hospital fees, but the good-neighbour plot ignores a bigger question</p><p>If you’re familiar with Alan Ritchson from his turn as Jack Reacher in the Amazon series based on the phenomenally popular Lee Child thrillers, get ready to see a different side of him in this weepy based on a true story. He’s once more playing a large, taciturn man (whether, per Reacher, his hands are still “as big as dinner plates” is not addressed), but here his problems cannot be solved by hitting things. Grieving the recent death of his wife, and drowning in debt from hospital bills, he’s devastated by the news that his youngest daughter may have only weeks or months to live, due to a condition related to that which claimed the life of her mother.

The prime minister dismissed claims there were too few nursery places for every two-year-old in England (with working parents) on 1 April, the day that entitlement to 15 hours a week began. He even said: “Staffing levels have increased and more people are at work in the sector and the number of places has also increased over the past year.” Outside the Commons, you might call that an untruth.

They also work well in savoury dishes such as today’s smoky tomato <em>tinga</em>, or shredded chicken in a spiced sauce. As for the pudding, imagine a coffee cake rolled up into a creamy caramel flan, which is my idea of heaven.

<p>As a mute avenger against a dystopian tyranny – looking like a lethal Buster Keaton – the actor makes you wish the film itself was as purposeful</p><p>Bill Skarsgård – one of eight Skarsgård siblings, six of whom work as actors – has hitherto carved out a bit of a niche as the best one to hire when you need a Skarsgård with a bit of a creepy vibe. He’s played a possibly dangerous stranger (Barbarian), a vampire (Hemlock Grove), delivered an unforgettably nasty Pennywise the Dancing Clown in the recent IT, and is about to star as the titular character in The Crow reboot. In Boy Kills World, however, he proves there’s another string to his bow: bona fide action star.</p><p>Rippling with muscles, Skarsgård plays Boy, one of those “I am an instrument shaped for a single purpose” types that thrive in the action genre. The single purpose is a time-honoured one: revenge. In this case it is against Famke Janssen’s Hilda van der Koy, the head of a wealthy ruling family in a totalitarian sta

Our families didn’t know what we were doing. Neither did our friends. We were making a film about the case that had triggered Spain’s 2018 #MeToo movement and secrecy was how we could best protect the survivors and participants. We also needed time to slowly and methodically build a documentary powerful enough that it could make something invisible – the universality of sexual violence against women – visible.</p><p>The story at the heart of our film began at the San Fermín festival in Pamplona, famous for the “running of the bulls”, where in 2016 a woman was sexually assaulted by five men who called themselves “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/23/wolf-pack-case-spain-feminism-far-right-vox">the wolf pack</a>”.</p><p>Almudena Carracedo and Robert Bahar are Goya, Peabody and three-time Emmy winning film-makers.

## Mother trees and socialist forests: is the ‘wood-wide web’ a fantasy?

<p>In the past 10 years the idea that trees communicate with and look after each other has gained widespread currency. But have these claims outstripped the evidence? </p><p>There are a lot of humans. <em>Teeming</em> is perhaps an unkind word, but when 8 billion people cram themselves on to a planet that, three centuries before, held less than a tenth of that number, it seems apt. Eight billion hot-breathed individuals, downloading apps and piling into buses and shoving their plasticky waste into bins – it is a stupefying and occasionally sickening thought.</p><p>And yet, humans are not Earth’s chief occupants. Trees are. There are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/02/scientists-reveal-there-are-3tn-trees-in-world-new-count">three trillion of them</a>, with a collective biomass thousands of times that of humanity. But although they are the preponderant beings on Earth – outnumbering us by nearly 400 to one – they’re easy to miss. Show someone a photograph of a

But he went on to phenomenal success – and has just been made president of the UK’s leading drama school</p><p>This is the first time David Harewood has stepped through the doors of Rada’s London headquarters since he became its president in mid-February, and he’s immediately struck by flashbacks of his time as a student here. “Stunning memories,” he says. “Memories of my audition, the paintings … and that staircase will always be memorable because you walk in and go: ‘Oh my God, I’m at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts!’ It’s very evocative.”</p><p>Harewood, 58, is the first person of colour to lead Rada, and he follows in the footsteps of such luminaries as Kenneth Branagh, Richard Attenborough, Princess Diana and John Gielgud. It is the most prestigious of acting schools – some would say the luvviest of them all – and has been a training ground for everyone from Anthony Hopkins to Tom Hiddleston, Fiona Shaw to P

<p>Brewing can involve incense, butter, herbs or spices, and takes so long neighbours take it in turns. But they wouldn’t have it any other way</p><p>Drinking coffee takes time in Ethiopia, a nation of caffeine lovers. In her village in Kafa, Ethiopia’s coffee heartland, Hagre Bekele starts by roasting the raw green beans over an open fire. Then she grinds them by hand and brews them in a <em>jebena</em><em>, </em>a bulbous, long-necked clay pot<em>.</em> The drink is ready when the coffee boils and almost overflows.</p><p>Her son, Abraham, serves the drink in small cups, filled to the brim, alongside thick chunks of bread and handfuls of roasted grains, a snack called <em>kolo</em>. When the first cup is drunk, Hagre brews the grounds twice more. Generally, it is considered rude not to offer three cups. She also burns incense: its aroma enhances the coffee’s taste, and some believe it keeps bad spirits away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/apr/23/its-

<p>Wada has defended its process as aggrieved athletes claim the anti-doping system only works if everyone is subject to same rules</p><p>Australian swimmer Shayna Jack has always denied consuming ligandrol, a banned performance enhancing drug. But, when Jack was subject to an out-of-competition anti-doping test at Tobruk Pool in Cairns in 2019, she returned an adverse analytical finding. As is protocol, Jack was issued a provisional suspension, the suspension was made public and the swimmer was ultimately handed a four-year ban from the sport.</p><p>On appeal, Jack insisted that she had not knowingly taken ligandrol. She speculated that legal supplements she was taking might have been contaminated, or that she could have come into contact with the substance while using public pool facilities. But because the global anti-doping regime operates on a strict liability basis, a lack of evidence that Jack did not knowingly ingest ligandrol was insufficient.</p> <a href="https://www.theguar
