If you&#8217;re not familiar with Garry&#8217;s Mod, then you obviously weren&#8217;t [&#8230;]

Back in October last year, Walled Culture wrote about a proposed law in France that would see&#160;a tax imposed on AI companies, with the proceeds being paid to a collecting society.

As case law continues to be developed, it continues to look as though the best way to hold onto your Fifth Amendment rights is to secure your devices with a passcode. There&#8217;s no solid consensus at this point, and the Supreme Court has yet to set precedent, but unless law enforcement really screws up while [&#8230;]
