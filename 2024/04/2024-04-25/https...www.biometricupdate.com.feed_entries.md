VP of Research Elie Khoury explains that the company looks for both perceivable and imperceivable. An example of the former is the struggle some text to speech AI models have with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/fricative">fricatives</a>. The text analysis, acoustic model and vocoders that make up text to speech models also tend to leave telltale signs behind which are not heard by the human ear, but give away their products’ source as generative AI.
