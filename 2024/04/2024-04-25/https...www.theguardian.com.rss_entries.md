This largely means that an afternoon-ish format, of the sort that would usually be broken up with ads for life insurance, animal charities and conservatories, now comes with the added frisson of knowing that a well-known comedian might say a bad word – see, for example, Eight Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown.

<p><strong>Arcola theatre, London<br /></strong>Andrée Bernard’s solo show is a bizarre representation of one woman’s love life, minus depth and character development<br /></p><p>This solo musical opens with a sex scene. A woman (Andrée Bernard) is pushed up against a closet by her lover. There is talk of taut flesh, unblemished skin and wrought muscle. And we return to this peak of passion against the closet, followed by the bathtub, time and again. But in between is a workaday relationship history that takes us from teen romance to a series of inappropriate partners, internet dates and a reliable-but-dull dentist. There are men who sweep the woman off her feet and others who reject her. You could call it a kind of sexual quest, in theory.</p><p>In practice, it is hard to work out what this bizarre show is saying. If the intention is to take a dive into the travails of modern love from a female perspective, it comes back up with cliches. Also written by Bernard, the romantic highs ar

But in September 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/06/airbnb-new-rental-regulation-nyc-housing">the city started enforcing a 2022 law</a> that banned people from renting their homes for fewer than 30 days (unless the host stayed in the home with guests).</p><p>Now the only legit option for people visiting the city is hotel rooms – and they’re unaffordable for many. Most of the Times Square hotels don’t have rooms for less than $300 a night. A search for Thursday 2 May found the Muse at $356, Hampton Inn at $323 and the Hard Rock at $459 (although, because of dynamic pricing, these are subject to regular change). They’re getting more expensive still. Hotel rates have increased between the first quarter of this year

<p>Paola Cortellesi’s directing debut, in which she also stars, depicts gruelling domestic abuse before finding its way to startling redemption</p><p>Italian actor and singer Paola Cortellesi has been breaking hearts and box office records on her home turf with this directing debut. It’s a richly and even outrageously sentimental working-class drama of postwar Rome, a story of domestic abuse whose heroine finally escapes from misogyny and cruelty through a piece of narrative sleight-of-hand that borders on magic-neorealism, performed with shameless theatrical flair and marvellously composed in luminous monochrome. The film pays homage to early pictures by De Sica and Fellini, and Cortellesi’s own performance is consciously in the spirit of movie divas such as Anna Magnani, Sophia Loren and Giulietta Masina.</p><p>The scene is Rome just after the end of the second world war, when American GIs were a presence on the streets and Italian women had just been given the right to vote – thoug

<p>As Taylor Swift tops $1bn in tour revenue, musicians playing smaller venues are facing pitiful fees and frequent losses. Should the state step in to save our live music scene?</p><p>When you see a band playing to thousands of fans in a sun-drenched festival field, signing a record deal with a major label or playing endlessly from the airwaves, it’s easy to conjure an image of success that comes with some serious cash to boot – particularly when Taylor Swift has broken $1bn in revenue for her current Eras tour. But looks can be deceiving. “I don’t blame the public for seeing a band playing to 2,000 people and thinking they’re minted,” says artist manager Dan Potts. “But the reality is quite different.”</p><p>Post-Covid there has been significant focus on grassroots music venues as they struggle to stay open. There’s been less focus on the actual ability of artists to tour these venues. David Martin, chief executive officer of the Featured Artists Coalition (FAC), says we’re in a “co

<p>Tired of colonial artefacts being hoarded, Chidi Nwaubani and Ahmed Abokor use tech to redistribute them from museums in audacious digital heists</p><p>In March last year, two men in tracksuits, wearing hockey masks and carrying matching laundry bags, headed for the British Museum. Just outside, patrolling police asked the two strange-looking men where they were going. “We’re going to the British Museum to loot back stolen goods,” one of them said. “Well, we’ll see you in there then!” the policewoman answered.</p><p>But no arrests were made, as nothing incriminating happened. What did take place was a “digital heist” of one of the most famous objects in the British Museum, an artefact that is, according to Egyptologist Monica Hanna, “a symbol of western cultural power” and “of British imperialism”: the Rosetta Stone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/apr/25/radical-art-collective-looty-rosetta-stone-benin-bronzes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest Neil Gaiman story about two ghosts on the run has spells, shenanigans and supernatural horrors galore. It’s impossible not to be entertained by such escapist adventures </p><p>Given the amount of exposition clunked out, the first episode of Dead Boy Detectives sure is confusing. But I think I have it worked out. There are two boys – best friends Charles (Jayden Revri) and Edwin (George Rexstrew). They are both dead – lippy Charles carked it in the 1980s, stiffly Edwardian Edwin in 1916. Somehow they are both still on Earth (though we learn that Edwin spent some time in hell before escaping) and are using their time to find souls trapped less happily here and release them. The first we meet is a maddened first world war soldier in a cursed gas mask they must slice off before Death (Kirby, formerly known as Kirby Howell-Baptiste). They always have to hide from Death lest she collect them too. They are actually dead boy detectives on the lam. Fortunately, they can jump into

<p>It is perverse that adults are legally protected from violence, yet striking a child can be defended. Calls for a ban are getting louder</p><p>When a child is scared of their parents, they can spend a long time plucking up the courage to talk. I learned this during a decade of volunteering as a Childline counsellor. There is a 20-second period, in between saying your name and waiting for them to share theirs, that is the most silent the air can ever be. You could hear a pin drop or just a caller’s breath echoing on the receiver. In that moment, a young girl who has been slapped by her father is deciding whether to ask for help or to hang up and try again to form the words in a week or two.</p><p>I thought of this silence as I <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/17/ban-smacking-children-in-england-and-northern-ireland-say-doctors">read calls</a> from leading doctors to ban parents from smacking their children in England and Northern Ireland.

<p>Our capital has many problems, but it is time to push back against attacks from those who neither know nor understand it</p><p>I have been reading about the most abysmal place. It is a land where children, red-faced with their own radicalism, march alongside bearded Islamists to make the streets a no-go zone, while nodding-dog liberals curse the Brexiter masses for inflating the cost of their arugula. It boasts an infinite array of pronouns; multimillion-pound townhouses whose residents demand you check your privilege; a thousand rainbow flags, but not a single St George’s cross. It is rife with criminal behaviour, which extends far beyond the prices charged by pub landlords. Hieronymus Bosch, put down your paintbrush: this place truly is Hell.</p><p>It also happens to be my home.</p><p>Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/25/lies-london-britain-capital">Continue reading...</a>

As a lifelong defender of civil liberties, a radical leftwinger and a close ally of the then party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, Abbott was notably different from previous holders of the role. But there was an anger and viciousness to Hester’s remarks
