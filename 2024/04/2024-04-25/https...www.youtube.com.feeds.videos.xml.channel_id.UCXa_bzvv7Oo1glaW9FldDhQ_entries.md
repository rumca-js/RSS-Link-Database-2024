The long-dormant Top Spin franchise is back with TopSpin 2K25 with a more modern approach to the amount of content the game features. Much like other 2K Sports offerings, TopSpin 2K25 offers a varied roster, as well as an excellent career mode that is filled to the brim with interesting content and a light RPG system that lets you improve your custom tennis player on their way to stardom.

While playing TopSpin 2K25 is quite a bit of fun, the game still offers a fair bit of frustration with some of its more complex mechanics. Despite a fantastic tutorial mode, the game’s control scheme makes it frustrating to pick between precision and power shots, and at higher difficulties, your athletes might even just give up on a shot that they could have easily made. These frustrations do little to take away from just how much fun playing TopSpin 2K25 can be, however.

SAND LAND is the latest anime adaptation from Bandai Namco, launching on April 26th for Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, and PC. 

As the Fiend Prince Beelzebub, players embark on a quest to locate the Legendary Spring, putting them at odds with the Royal Army. Though you can run around and punch foes into submission, SAND LAND leans heavily on vehicular combat as you punch through with a tank or stomp around with a Jump-Bot. Other vehicles become available over time, offering even more ways to explore the ruins of humanity.

While SAND LAND won't overwhelm you with its side quest design or range of activities, the solid combat and fleshed-out main cast make for a solid, enjoyable journey. Watch our review to learn even more about it.
