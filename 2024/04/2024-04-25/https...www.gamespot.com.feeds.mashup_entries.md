<p dir="ltr">Bungie is making major changes to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s Power levels, the measure of your character's strength that dictates how difficult content is, in its upcoming expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-raid-launch-time-and-everything-we-know/1100-6522790/">The Final Shape</a>. The biggest change is a new system called Fireteam Power, which brings everyone in your party up to five levels below whoever's Power is highest, which should allow anyone to join friends and play just about any content they want. That has an interesting knock-on effect, though: It undoes a move Bungie made four years ago, when it "sunsetted" a bunch of guns by putting an upper limit on their Power stats.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The impact of Fireteam Power</h2><p dir="ltr">The changes to the Power system are outlined in Bungie's latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/this_week_in_destiny_04_25_24">

<p>Earlier today, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to reinstate net neutrality. Taking place during an April Open Meeting, commissioner Anna M. Gomez voted in favor of restoring federal oversight of broadband internet access service under Title II of the Communications Act. According to a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/gomez-votes-restore-net-neutrality">press release</a>, the aim is to ensure the resource is open, safe, and secure for all moving forward.</p><p>“Broadband access to the Internet is a critical conduit that is essential for modern life,” said Gomez in the press release. “Protecting this critical infrastructure that is essential to the safety, economy, health, education, and well-being of this country is good public policy. The value is so great that we cannot wait for the flood to arrive before we start to build the levee.”</p><p>In essence, the idea of net neutrality is that internet service providers (ISPs) should not be allowed to discriminate

<p dir="ltr">In the years since the explosion of game crowdfunding, a stigma has emerged surrounding these titles. Yes, there have been plenty of games that enjoyed great success after their crowdfunding campaigns, but more people remember the high-profile flops: games with big names and ambitious promises attached that, for a variety of reasons, betrayed the high hopes fans held for them. Many of these were revivals--spiritual or otherwise--of beloved series from ages past. Now we have Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, a crowdfunded game designed to carry the torch of the much-beloved Suikoden series from the PS1 and PS2--and, with such a high pedigree attached, there's understandable trepidation: Will this be a glorious return to form, or another disappointment? Fortunately, for us (and all of the backers), it turned out wonderfully.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4293392-ss_f3b199c9360ae999b8953379ce4e00fef5aaf906.1

<p>Fallout 4's long-awaited free next-gen update is rolling out today, April 25, ushering in performance and quality improvements to help the 2015 RPG look and perform potentially better than ever. Bethesda is calling this a next-gen update, though the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles have been on the market since 2020.</p><p>The highlight of the update are performance and quality mode options. When players select "Performance" mode, they'll run the game at up to 60fps with 4K resolution via dynamic scaling. On "Quality" mode, the game runs at 30fps at 4K (without dynamic scaling).</p><p>The next-gen patch for Fallout 4 was announced back in 2022 and was originally set to debut in 2023 before Bethesda delayed it to 2024. It arrives today not long after Prime Video's Fallout TV show arrived and helped lead to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-reaches-5-million-players-in-one-day/1100-6522892/">resurgence in Fallout player numbers</a>.

While staying at the Plaza Hotel Lucchesi in Florence, Italy, Wilson discovered that someone working there is a big fan of The Office when room service sent him his silverware encased in Jello. Naturally, he had to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rainnwilson/?hl=en">share the very good joke on Instagram</a>.</p><p>The prank was a callback to a popular scene from the pilot episode of The Office where Dwight discovered that his co-worker, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), had put his stapler in Jello... again.
