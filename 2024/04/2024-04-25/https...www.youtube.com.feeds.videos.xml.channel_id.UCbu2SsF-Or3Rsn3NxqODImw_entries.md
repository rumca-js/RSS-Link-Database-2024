The Fallout 4 Next Gen update is here. Weâ€™ve gone hands on with the game on Xbox Series X, with footage of before the patch on the left and after the patch on the right. While the game has received a resolution increase, and seemingly somewhat improved colors and lighting, what is most noticeable is the framerate increase, even on the quality mode displayed here.

Sand Land's fantastic vehicular combat and adherence to the source material are let down by bland and repetitive stealth, melee combat, and mission design.
