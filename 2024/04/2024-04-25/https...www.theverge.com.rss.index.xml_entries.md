Think <em>Clash of Clans</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18093052/supercell-brawl-stars-global-launch-iphone-android"><em>Brawl Stars</em></a>, and <em>Clash Royale</em>. Now, the developer is gearing up for its next major release: <em>Squad Busters</em>, which will be out globally on both Android and iOS on May 29th.</p>
<p id="evIf28">It’s a competitive multiplayer game, but one on a larger scale than a typical mobile release. In each match, 10 players compete to collect the most gems while building up a squad of computer-controlled characters.
