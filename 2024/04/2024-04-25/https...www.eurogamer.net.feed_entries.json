I think the theory was basically talking about crustaceans, but the gist of it was, regardless of the evolutionary challenges crustaceans faced, crabbiness seemed to be a preferred answer. The raised body and tail, the flat shell, the lofty pincers. Crabs are OP.</p><p>And this came to mind when playing Another Crab's Treasure this morning. It's not just that there are crabs all over the place in this game - and there really are! It's that Another Crab's Treasure is a Soulslike, and the Soulslike increasingly feels like the equivalent of evolutionary crabbification for mid-budget video games.</p><p>To put it another way, I can imagine a time, a few years back, when Another Crab's Treasure would have been your classic action platformer.
