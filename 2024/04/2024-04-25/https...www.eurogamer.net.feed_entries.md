Bulletstorm and Outriders developer People Can Fly has officially brought development of its struggling Project Dagger to a close after concluding its commercial potential was "unsatisfactory".
</p><p>
Project Dagger, previously described as a new action-adventure IP, had been in development for around three and a half years, and was initially set to be published by GTA and Borderlands publisher Take-Two Interactive.
</p><p>
In September 2022, however, it was announced Take-Two had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-publisher-pulls-out-of-people-can-fly-project-after-two-years">pulled out of the deal</a>, and that People Can Fly would retain the rights and continue development for self-publishing. "We strongly believe in Project Dagger's potential," People Can Fly boss Sebastian Wojciechowski said at the time.

## BlizzCon is cancelled again after last year's first in-person event since 2019

Blizzard has revealed it won't be hosting its annual BlizzCon fan convention in 2024, but says the long-running event - first seen in 2005 - may return "in future years".
</p><p>
BlizzCon has, of course, had a bit of a bumpy ride in recent times, taking an extended hiatus as Blizzard <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-cancels-this-years-blizzcon-online-event-likely-early-next-year">navigated health and safety considerations</a> stemming from the coronavirus pandemic and reckoned with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-california-sues-activision-blizzard-over-frat-boy-culture">disturbing allegations</a> in a State of California lawsuit accusing it of being a "breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women".

## Fallout 4's free PS5 upgrade isn't currently free with the PS Plus version

Today's the day Bethesda's long-in-the-works <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-next-gen-update-release-time-and-date">Fallout 4 next-gen update</a> makes its debut, introducing native versions of the post-apocalyptic RPG for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. However, PlayStation users who've acquired Fallout 4 via PlayStation Plus are reporting they're unable to access the free PS5 upgrade, and are being directed to buy it instead.
</p><p>
As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-4-ps-plus-owners-currently-cannot-get-the-next-gen-update-for-free">IGN</a>, everything is working as intended for PlayStation users with a purchased version of Fallout 4 tied to their PSN accounts - they're able to access the free PS5 upgrade as expected - but those with the PlayStation Plus version in their libraries are not,

The line-up of games for Nintendo's handheld home console hybrid is arguably the strongest it's ever been, because in case you didn't notice, the Switch continued to flourish last year. Not only did we get a brand new 2D Mario platformer, the fourth mainline Pikmin game, and another new Fire Emblem to add to the pile, but also another all-time Zelda game, too.</p><p>That's before you start including all the countless indie games and third party launches out there as well, and of course, the Switch's huge back catalogue - many of which have graced previous iterations of our best games on Nintendo Switch list over the last couple of years.

## Pokémon Go Wigglet spawn locations revealed by fan-made tool

Pok&eacute;mon Go has quietly added Wigglet, the white-coloured and suspiciously-shaped species similar to Digglet that debuted in Nintendo Switch games Pok&eacute;mon Scarlet and Violet and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-unveils-official-wiglett-toy">raised a lot of eyebrows</a>.
</p><p>
Wigglet's introduction to Pok&eacute;mon Go has been unusually low-key, with no official announcement of its appearance in the game on the official site. Still, Niantic has pulled off similar surprise-launches before, and Wigglet's appearance now seems tied to the rollout of Pok&eacute;mon Go's admittedly very pretty new overworld visual refresh, which highlights the in-game biome you're currently located within.
</p><p>
Fans quickly realised that Wigglet was only spawning in the game's new beach biome - which makes it relatively access

## Windows 11 prestige handhelds review: Lenovo Legion Go vs OneXPlayer 2 Pro vs AyaNeo Kun

It's time to take another look at a range of Windows-based handhelds and this time, we're testing the most advanced, most powerful hardware on the market right now - the actual big boys of the handheld range - stacking them up against the established frontrunners: Steam Deck (in both LCD and OLED incarnations) and the Asus ROG Ally. 
</p><p>
Primarily, I looked at three offerings and you'll find their comparative specifications in a handy table below. They are all fundamentally based on the same AMD silicon (whether you want to call it the Ryzen 7 7840U or the Z1 Extreme) paired with LPDDR5 memory. The amount of memory varies - 16GB is generally enough, but we're starting to see titles that would prefer more (a factor of that 16GB being shared between graphics and system memory). With that in mind, the 32GB and 64GB of the OneXPlayer 2 

## No Rest For the Wicked early access review - a shaky start, but there’s potential

In the same way that Salt and Sanctuary bridged a gap between Metroidvanias and the Souls series, No Rest exists as a stop on an imaginary evolutionary journey from Diablo-style action RPGs and the aforementioned Souls both Demonic and Dark. Taking the isometric view and randomised loot from the former, and the exploration and more measured approach to combat from the latter, No Rest attempts to craft something new from familiar ingredients.</p><p>At first, I thought it was a horrible mistake. After a brief tutorial, you&rsquo;re shipwrecked on the island of Sacra and left to find your way to the nearest settlement. Almost immediately, the clash between the two disparate game styles becomes apparent, and the focal point of this dissonance is loot.</p><p>D

I've watched the Fallout Prime series and, like so many others, I have been dragged back into Fallout 4. The only problem is, I've done three playthroughs now - and this makes it hard to enjoy the game when I know how all the quests turn out. Or do I?
</p><p>
Unbeknownst to me there were still some I just hadn't found, so this video is from me to you, for us folks who have played Fallout 4 to death but want to revisit it, as well as to those who are new to Fallout entirely. I've tracked down hidden, rewarding story-related content and missions that you may have missed in the Commonwealth so you can go forth and either enact the golden rule... or completely ignore it.

## GameCube and Wii emulation on iPhone unlikely - due to technical constraints, rather than piracy concerns

It's unlikely we'll see widespread emulation of GameCube or Wii games via emulators on the iPhone App Store, a new report suggests, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apples-app-store-permits-game-emulators-for-the-first-time">Apple giving the green light to emulation for games from earlier Nintendo consoles</a>.
</p><p>
This isn't because these games are free from copyright, or because of Apple's vague stance that "retro" game emulation is allowed. Instead, this is because of technical limitations, as detailed in a new blog post from veteran Nintendo hacker and dataminer <a href="https://oatmealdome.me/blog/why-dolphin-isnt-coming-to-the-app-store/">OatmealDome</a>, who works on GameCube and Wii emulator DolphiniOS for jailbroken phones.

</p><p>
Dataminers discovered the unfinished scene several months ago and pieced what they could together from various files. (We'll remind of you what happens in the scene below, as it's unclear whether this is content Ubisoft ultimately decided against including, or files left lurking within Mirage to be activated by another patch down the line.)

Capcom has revised its full-year earnings forecast after the success of Dragon's Dogma 2 and its other popular releases over the last year.
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240425.html">statement</a> released today, the company has raised its net sales forecast by 8.9 percent to 152.4m yen (&pound;783m), and its net income by 8.3 percent to 43.3m yen (&pound;222m).
</p><p>
The reason for this is the success of Capcom's recent games, in particular Street Fighter 6 and Dragon's Dogma 2.

Every Final Fantasy fan knows, there's nothing scarier than a Tonberry. Sure, the little green guys look sweet enough with their big shoes and bulging eyes. But let them get close and their knife attack means instant death.
</p><p>
In Final Fantasy 16's The Rising Tide DLC, though, Tonberries look more terrifying than ever. In keeping with the game's grim and grounded tone, these creatures now have a more realistic, snake-like appearance, but with slimy green feet as they stagger towards you. And then there's the Tonberry King who's imposing enough towering over protagonist Clive in his ragged cloak, but the giant butcher's knife - cracked and worn from bloody overuse - is truly frightening. At least, the Tonberries scare until defeated and goofily <a href="https://x.com/_kokokisu/status/1782305643489308763">laying fac

Garry's Mod developer Facepunch Studios has been ordered to remove all Nintendo related items from the Steam Workshop.
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4000/view/4200245595694413052?l=english">statement on Steam</a>, the developer confirmed the takedown notice is "not a mistake" and came from Nintendo, seemingly referencing <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/discussions/5/4211497623308213915/">fraudulent claims from back in February</a>.
</p><p>
"Honestly, this is fair enough," reads the statement. "This is Nintendo's content and what they allow and don't allow is up to them. They don't want you playing with that stuff in Garry's Mod - that's their decision, we have to respect that and take down as much as we can."

I think the theory was basically talking about crustaceans, but the gist of it was, regardless of the evolutionary challenges crustaceans faced, crabbiness seemed to be a preferred answer. The raised body and tail, the flat shell, the lofty pincers. Crabs are OP.</p><p>And this came to mind when playing Another Crab's Treasure this morning. It's not just that there are crabs all over the place in this game - and there really are! It's that Another Crab's Treasure is a Soulslike, and the Soulslike increasingly feels like the equivalent of evolutionary crabbification for mid-budget video games.</p><p>To put it another way, I can imagine a time, a few years back, when Another Crab's Treasure would have been your classic action platformer.
