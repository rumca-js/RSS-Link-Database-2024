<p>This multigenerational tale travels from China to New York in search of the true meaning of good fortune</p><p>It’s often said that good luck is the result of good planning: you make your own. But is our luck in life ever entirely under our control? And how much luck, and planning, might be enough? Real Americans, Rachel Khong’s second novel, strikes directly at the heart of these questions. Its Chinese-American characters are brought into&nbsp;contact with fabulous wealth – a prototypical stroke of luck. But their resulting choices demonstrate how the obsessive pursuit of money and control can warp a life, and what it might take to reject this over­abundance. At one point a Chinese geneticist named Mei, recently arrived in the US, reflects on&nbsp;the dual definitions of the word “fortune” as both luck and money. “Maybe there was an amount of money that was as unfortunate as poverty could be,” she thinks.</p><p>Each of the novel’s three parts tells a rags-to-riches story, tracing
