Dropzone\u2019s pre-trained AI security agents use large language models and work alongside human security analysts, handling repetitive tasks and investigating alerts. The agents mimic the thought process and techniques of expert security analysts. The rush of AI and generative AI technologies is sparking concerns about cybersecurity, with both security experts and hackers taking advantage of new capabilities. Dropzone is led by CEO and founder\u00a0Edward Wu, who previously spent eight years at Seattle-based security company ExtraHop.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-cybersecurity-startup-dropzone-ai-raises-16-8m", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-cybersecurity-startup-dropzone-ai-raises-16-8m", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Seattle startup Dropzone AI raises $16.8M to develop autonomous agents for cybersecurity", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-25T20:14:12+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/microsoft-logo-1260x945.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Microsoft posted a 17% increase in revenue, to $61.9 billion, with $21.9 billion in profits, up 20%, and earnings of $2.94 per share, beating Wall Street&#8217;s expectations across the board for the third quarter of its 2024 fiscal year.
