Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Dabney Coleman starred in the film, which was scripted by Patricia Resnick with Colin Higgins, who also directed. It was based on an idea by Fonda, who commissioned the film as a vehicle for herself and Tomlin before bringing Parton on board.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/25/jennifer-aniston-9-to-5-reboot-diablo-cody\">Continue reading...<", "language": "en-UK", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/25/jennifer-aniston-9-to-5-reboot-diablo-cody", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "source_obj__id": 340, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a409327f95fcab0273f5db636d2b84cc4b14828/0_308_4200_2521/master/4200.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9cf61e0041c5cddddd8fcd4d07a8c12", "title": "A way to make a livin\u2019: Jennifer Aniston set for 9 to 5 reboot", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-25T10:55:43+00:00", "description": "<p>From Gold Lion winner Archie Moore to Brazilians the Tupinamb\u00e1 collective, First Nations artists are making their voices heard at \u2018the Olympics of art\u2019.
