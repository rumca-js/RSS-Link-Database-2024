Sugar signaling is one of the most important regulatory signals for plant growth and development, and its metabolic network contains many regulatory factors. Sugar signaling molecules regulate cellular activities and organismal development by interacting with other intrinsic regulators and environmental cues. HXK, SnRK1 and TOR are three proteins that play key roles in the plant sugar metabolism network.

## A better way to predict Arctic riverbank erosion

Arctic riverbanks are typically resilient, thanks to the power of permafrost. This permanently frozen soil locks in sediment, leading to low erosion rates. But as Arctic river water warms due to climate change, some researchers worry that riverbanks in the region will thaw and crumble. This, in turn, could cause problems, including the release of stored soil carbon and damage to infrastructure near rivers.

How do they know where to go? And how did they get so complicated to begin with? Simple yet profound questions like these are at the heart of curiosity-driven basic research, which focuses on the fundamental principles of natural phenomena. An important example is the process by which cells or organisms move in response to chemical signals in their environment, also known as chemotaxis.

In most industrial chemical reactions, catalysts combine with the starting materials and accompany them through intermediate stages to the product. In chemistry, this pathway is known as the reaction mechanism, and it is a kind of black box: nobody knows what is happening at the molecular level at first.
