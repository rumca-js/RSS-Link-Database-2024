Debate breaks out on Missouri House floor as legislators vote to defund Planned Parenthood following a Project Veritas' undercover investigation which depicted Planned Parenthood officials admitting to illegally transporting minors across state lines for #secretabortions.

The bill passed 106-48 and will make it illegal for Missouriâ€™s Medicaid program to reimburse Planned Parenthood for health care services. It now heads to Governor Mike Parson's desk where his support is expected.
