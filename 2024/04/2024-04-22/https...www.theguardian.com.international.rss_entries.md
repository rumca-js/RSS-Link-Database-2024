<p>The Last Week Tonight host looks into speculation, study an cover-ups about unidentified flying objects in the US</p><p>John Oliver took on the tricky, potentially fun topic of Unidentified Flying Objects (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ufos">UFOs</a>) on Sunday evening – a “difficult subject to talk about”, the Last Week Tonight host noted, “because UFOs tend to get discussed in one of two ways”. The first is “wildly speculative”, such as claiming Renaissance painters depicted alien invaders. And the second way is outright dismissal “with borderline contempt”.</p><p>But the topic has been back in serious headlines in recent years thanks to secret UFO files released by the government in 2017, the beginning of “a cascade of revelations”, said Oliver, including the DoD revealing that it had 11 reports of documented instances in which pilots had near misses with Unidentified Flying Objects.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/22/john-oliver-ufos-

<p>From an alligator ride across Asia to an escape to outer space, the Venice Biennale’s ‘foreigners everywhere’ theme leaves our critic beguiled, tantalised – and frequently appalled</p><p>Venice. Terrible. Foreigners everywhere, and it is even worse during the biennale, where the exhibition opened to the public on Saturday. Marked by unrest and protests, the <a href="https://www.labiennale.org/en/art/2024">60th Venice Biennale</a> leaves us uncertain of art’s ability to draw us together in a world in crisis. It is filled with the clamour of conflicting voices and doubtful purpose.</p><p>On posters and on the sides of the water buses, written in neon and hung in the entrances to the central pavilion in the Giardini and to the Arsenale, the phrase Foreigners Everywhere, written in languages living, endangered and dead, is ubiquitous. Dangling in a roofed-over section of the medieval dock, the words multiply, reflecting brightly in the sullen waters below with a cheer that belies a gen

He brought along his longtime staff writer José Arroyo in character as “Dr Arroyo”, an incompetent yet affordable physician on hand to ensure that O’Brien’s gentle Irish constitution could withstand all the spice. After finishing each hot wing, O’Brien stashed the bones in his pocket until it bulged to capacity, at

<p>International attention is on Gaza – but attacks by Israelis who live on Palestinian land have been increasing</p><p>While international attention has been turned toward Gaza, violence against Palestinians has increased in the West Bank too. Israeli settler attacks have become more frequent.</p><p>Settlers are Israeli citizens who live on Palestinian land. In most cases, this happens because Palestinians are prevented from accessing their land and are physically attacked by settlers. In a third of cases, Palestinian property is damaged by settlers.

<p>Stephen Giddings gives a committed performance as a recovering alcoholic who’s started betting again in this often tense experimental docudrama</p><p>The line between fact and fiction is thin to vanishing in this Liverpool-set experimental docudrama, a study of addiction and how it rumbles down through generations. It’s directed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/09/a-girl-growing-up-on-film">visual artist Melanie Manchot</a> and is being shown as a multiscreen installation in Cornwall as well as screening in cinemas. Manchot worked with a Liverpool recovery group, hiring members, with lived experience, as actors. At its worst the result has a bit of a workshop feel, stilted and a bit studied; there’s also expressionist dancing. But at its best, this is a painful, raw study of addiction, with a powerful, committed performance by Stephen Giddings.</p><p>Giddings plays himself (or a version of himself), a recovering alcoholic and aspiring actor up for the l

<p>Fried corn tacos stuffed with stringy melted cheese and roast salad onions </p><p>During some quesadilla chat with my friend <a href="https://mexicanfoodmemories.co.uk/author/mexicanfoodmemories/">Karla Zazueta</a>, we got on to the subject of cheese. Your choice of cheese is crucial, said Karla, who always opts for one with a long, stringy texture. One option is Anatolia cheese – a Turkish variety similar to quesillo, a cheese from Mexico’s Oaxaca region; you can find it in Turkish shops. Alternatively, a combination of hard mozzarella (a block or ready-grated) mixed with cheddar also gets delicious results. More importantly, we agreed that there is nothing better than standing at the hob and eating a quesadilla fresh from the pan.</p><p>Kitty Coles’ book, Make More with Less: Foolproof Recipes to Make Your Food go Further, is published by Hardie Grant at £22.
