The Redmond Technology Station Bridge, an 1,100-foot span that crosses more than 20 lanes of roadway beneath \u2014 and two sets of light rail track \u2014\u00a0is being ushered in as a greener, safer way to move the tech giant&#8217;s employees and other commuters and community members around what&#8217;s hoped will be a bustling Sound Transit station.

Nearing the final stages of a strategic restructuring after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last fall, the company once valued at $47 billion has been making progress on negotiations related to its real estate portfolio. WeWork says it has saved over $8 billion in total future rent commitments (a more than 40% reduction) and has reached a path forward at 90% of its buildings globally.

Later this year, customers in the West Valley region of the Phoenix metro area will be able to get their purchases via drones dispatched from Amazon&#8217;s Same-Day Delivery site in Tolleson, Ariz., the company said today. The West Valley region joins College Station in Texas as an Amazon drone delivery site. Last year, Prime Air began free prescription deliveries in 60 minutes or less to customers in College Station, in partnership with Amazon Pharmacy.

No one has been identified and prosecuted for creating the graphic and sometimes violent images of Swift using artificial intelligence tools. The response from the tech sector has been limited. For Melissa Hutchins, the episode was disappointing but not surprising. Research shows that women and girls are overwhelmingly the victims of this sort of exploitation. But most of the attention on stopping malicious deepfakes is focused on political candidates and issues, Hutchins notes, which&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/after-personal-experience-with-cyberstalking-tech-founder-launches-startup-battling-deepfake-content/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/after-personal-experience-with-cyberstalking-tech-founder-launches-startup-battling-deepfake-content", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "After personal experience with cyberstalking, tech founder launches startup battling deepfake content", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-22T14:30:00+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"874\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/atomoroastery-1260x874.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Atomo, the Seattle-based beanless coffee maker, is marking Earth Day with the grand opening of a new roastery in its hometown that will produce the company&#8217;s grounds for coffee shops around the country.
