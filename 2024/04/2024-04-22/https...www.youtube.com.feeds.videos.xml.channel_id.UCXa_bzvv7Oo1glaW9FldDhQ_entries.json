Initial trailers looked solid, and the reveals of its many unique heroes were compelling.\n\nNow that I've finally gotten my hands on it, Rabbit and Bear Studios' first title is an epic through and through, telling the tale of an extensive war with all kinds of characters and intrigue. Though it starts in a typical fashion, the plot encompasses the journeys of three protagonists - Nowa, Seign and Marisa - as they gather allies against the Galdean Empire.\n\nThe premise is strong, backed by a capable aesthetic and music, and it's enough to weather some of the issues with combat, quest design and enemy difficulty.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YruC1N1jTx0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/YruC1N1jTx0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-22T17:30:07+00:00", "description": "Do you ever complete a narrative heavy game, one with arduous journeys, immense challenge, or emotional punishment, and instead of experiencing a sense of euphoria you feel as though you\u2019ve lost something? \n\nThe fifteen games on this rundown aim to highlight this feeling.

Maybe humanity is saved, but you\u2019ve lost something near and dear to you. Maybe you thought you were acting in service of something else, only to find you were being manipulated the whole time.
