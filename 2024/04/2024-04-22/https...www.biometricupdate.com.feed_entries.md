		Microsoft is the latest tech giant to tease an AI product so good at producing deepfake humans that it poses a threat to real ones. In a striking demonstration of how quickly generative AI is advancing, VASA-1 can generate “hyper-realistic talking face video” from nothing but a single static image, an audio clip and a text script. A <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/vasa-1/">research paper </a>from Microsoft says VASA-1 produces “lip movements that are exquisitely synchronized with the audio,” plus “a large spectrum of facial nuances and natural head motions that contribute to the perception of authenticity and liveliness.”

Dozens of accompanying video samples illustrate this capability, applied to both real humans and artificial faces (in one pa

		The UK’s prospective data protection law is facing criticism from lawmakers and rights groups over plans to introduce bank account monitoring of benefit recipients and changes to biometric data oversight.

A cross-party group of parliamentarians has called for the government to reject an addition to the  Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (DPDI) that would give powers to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) access to the bank accounts of individuals receiving state benefits. The proposal was introduced in the Bill in December to combat welfare fraud.

		In preparation for the Olympics, Paris has tested its AI surveillance systems deploying crowd surveillance technology during two large events.

With police authorization, rail company SNCG and transport operator RATP conducted the surveillance testing over the weekend. The tests took place at four train stations close to a pop concert by the Black Eyed Peas and a soccer match between Paris Saint-Germain and Olympique Lyon.

The two companies were allowed access to images from 100 cameras. Signs and posters have been installed at the entrances and exits of the trial areas to warn users, television network TF1 <a href="https://www.tf1info.fr/high-tech/videtics-sncf-ratp-psg-ol-concert-black-eyed-peas-videosurveillance-algorithmique-cameras-de-surveillance-et-intelligence-

		Apple’s tap-and-go mobile payments system, ID scanning and biometric capabilities should be available to rivals soon, with a report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apples-offer-open-up-tap-and-go-tech-be-approved-by-eu-next-month-sources-say-2024-04-19/">Reuters</a> saying European antitrust regulators could approve Apple’s offer by next month. The approval would conclude a four-year investigation by the European Commission into alleged attempts by Apple to thwart competition for its Apple Pay mobile wallet. It would also likely cancel the possibility of Apple facing substantial fines.

The tech giant first offered to make its tap-and-go near-field communication (NFC) technology available to rivals for use on non-Apple wallet systems o

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idex-asa">Idex Biometrics</a> is supplying fingerprint biometric technology for payment cards to Bangladesh-based Mutual Trust Bank, as the biometrics provider expands its reach in Asia.

The cards are based on Idex’ Pay solution.

“These cards are expected to attract new customers and increase card usage among existing customers, bringing financial empowerment to the people of Bangladesh,” says Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director and CEO at MTB.

Idex also revealed an agreement to provide biometric payment cards to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/idex-reveals-asian-issuer-for-metal-biometric-payment-cards">Bangladesh’s Eastern Bank</a> at the tail end of last year.

		Uber is introducing a blue check system to verify users on its app, in a move designed to increase safety for drivers. But it will not require the type of selfie biometric face matching that drivers have requested in the past, instead relying on document verification.

A <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/uber-rolls-out-blue-checkmark-system-for-rider-verification-in-12-cities/ar-AA1ngsdc">report</a> from the Chicago Tribune says the ride sharing company is piloting the document verification program in 12 U.S. cities. The majority of existing users will receive verification automatically, without taking any additional steps. <a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/safety/rider-verification/">Uber’s website</a> says the rider verification process “involves cr

		LinkedIn is rolling out identity verification using biometric passports in Singapore.

The feature is provided by San Francisco-based selfie biometrics provider<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/persona"> Persona</a>. To apply for verification, Singaporeans can scan the passport’s photo page with the camera feature in the LinkedIn app and use the smartphone’s NFC reader to scan the passport’s NFC chip. The process is completed by taking a live selfie, The Strait Times <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/linkedin-rolls-out-passport-verification-feature-to-combat-scams">reports</a>.

		Canada is seeking smartphone-based face biometrics to verify the identity of travelers crossing its borders.

The contract with the Canadian Border Services Agency is expected to be worth anywhere from $5 million Canadian (roughly US$3.6 million) to CA$25 million ($18.2 million), according to the <a href="https://service.ariba.com/Discovery.aw/ad/viewRFX?id=19419266">public posting</a>.

CBSA “is looking to acquire and test biometrics FRT solutions (also known as “algorithms”) to evaluate technical performance compared to what is currently in use in the Canadian context.”

Bidders must be based in a country that is a NATO member or part of the Five Eyes alliance (Canada, the U.S., the UK, Australia and New Zealand) to meet security requirements.

		Cypriots may be able to access public services using a dedicated digital government portal from either June or July this year while efforts continue to progressively introduce digital services on the platform, a government minister has announced.

The deputy Minister of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy, Nicodemos Damianou, disclosed this in a recent interview granted to the Cyprus News Agency, Stockwatch <a href="https://www.stockwatch.com.cy/en/article/tilepikoinonies/dep-minister-people-will-see-results-digital-transition-year">reports</a>.

		The visions shared by the G7 and G20 on the development of digital public infrastructure (DPI) differ at three major levels, even if the ultimate goal is to make life more liveable for citizens of the world.

This is according to digital policy commentator and non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Center, Anand Raghuraman.

While the G20 has been a participant in the global DPI development discourse for some time, the G7 just recently made its position know on the subject <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/g7-committed-to-dpi-for-socio-economic-transformation-oecds-digital-id-governance">through a declaration</a> adopted in March by industry, tech and digital ministers of member states at the close of a meeting in Italy.

		An app that is supposed to streamline the upcoming European Union’s Entry-Exit System (EES) will not be ready on time, sparking concerns over massive queues at the border with the United Kingdom.

CEO of Eurostar Gwendoline Cazenave revealed the delay last week, noting that the railway service plans to install more than 49 kiosks at London’s St Pancras station to facilitate passport checks. That is the number of biometric kiosks Eurostar said in February would be needed to stave off “<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/eus-biometric-passport-checks-could-lead-to-limits-for-eurostar-passenger-numbers">unacceptable passenger delays</a>.”

		India’s airport facial recognition program Digi Yatra is courting controversy again after an app update and accusations that passengers’ personal data has been breached, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/digi-yatra-foundation-drops-app-maker-after-data-breach/article68093722.ece">The Hindu</a> reports.

An app made by the same company was used by Andhra Pradesh police from 2019 until 2023, when it was abandoned due to allegations of fraud.

The Digi Yatra Foundation released a public statement on March 27 telling users to uninstall the old version of the app, install the new version and re-register their account.
