<p>Newsletter platform Ghost is the latest service to pledge support for ActivityPub, the open source protocol powering the fediverse. The company <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://activitypub.ghost.org/"><ins>announced</ins></a> Monday it would add ActivityPub support later this year in a move that could bring tens of millions of people into the fediverse.</p>
<p>The fediverse is a growing collection of services, including Mastodon, Flipboard and Threads, that support the ActivityPub protocol. It’s part of a growing movement for <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/is-decentralization-the-future-of-social-media-194554192.html"><ins>decentralized social media</ins></a> services, which rely on open protocols rather than closed networks.

<p>A Russian military court sentenced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/meta/"><ins>Meta</ins></a> spokesperson Andy Stone in absentia to six years in prison for "publicly defending terrorism," <em>Reuters </em>reports. Stone's lawyer reportedly asked for an acquittal and there are plans to appeal the sentence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few months after Russian officials placed him on a wanted list and started a criminal investigation, a Moscow court <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russian-court-orders-arrest-absentia-160002073.html"><ins>issued an arrest warrant</ins></a> for Stone on several terrorism-related charges in February. It cited Stone's alleged "promotion of terrorist activities, public calls for terrorist activities, public justification of terrorism or propaganda of terrorism and public calls for extremist activities."</p>

<p>The European Union (EU) <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2227"><ins>has opened a second formal investigation</ins></a> into TikTok and has accused the platform of running afoul of the region’s Digital Services Act (DSA), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/tiktok-lite-dsa-probe/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>. The probe involves the addictive nature of TikTok Lite, which is a smaller version of the app that takes up less memory on a smartphone and was built to perform over slower internet connections.</p>
<p>TikTok Lite launched earlier this month in France and Spain and includes a design aspect that allows users to earn points by watching and liking videos. These points can be exchanged for stuff like Amazon vouchers and TikTok’s proprietary digital currency, which is typically used to tip creators.

<p>In a huge move for the mixed reality industry, Meta <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox/">announced today</a> that it's opening the Quest's operating system to third-party companies, allowing them to build headsets of their own. Think of it like moving the Quest's ecosystem from an Apple model, where one company builds both the hardware and software, to more of a hardware free-for-all like Android. The Quest OS is being rebranded to &quot;Meta Horizon OS,&quot; and at this point it seems to have found two early adopters. ASUS's Republic of Gamers (ROG) brand is working on a new &quot;performance gaming&quot; headsets, while Lenovo is working on devices for &quot;productivity, learning and entertainment.&quot; (Don't forget, Lenovo also built the poorly-received <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-04-oculus-rift-s-review-vr.html">Oculus Rift S</a>.)</p>

<p>It’s never good to recommend a comedy by saying it makes you weep, but somehow <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-shows-to-binge-watch-over-the-holidays-in-2022-141502077.html"><em>Bluey</em></a>, a comedy for kids, feels more real and more truthful than anything else on TV. I see so much of myself in Bandit’s triumphs and failures as he tries to parent his two daughters. I nod along to all of his unsuccessful parenting tactics that, I’ll admit, I’ve also tried on my own two kids. And then, at the end of so many episodes, I’ll realize that the front of my t-shirt is wet with tears because I've been crying.</p>
<p>There can’t be many people unfamiliar with <em>Bluey</em>, the biggest kids’ TV series on the planet, if not the biggest series overall. Each seven-minute episode is a slice-of-life sitcom about the Heelers, a family of anthropomorphic dogs living in Brisbane, Australia. Bluey and her younger sister Bingo live with parents Bandit and Chilli.  The show started out focus

<p>If you love physical notebooks like me, an E-Ink tablet could serve you well. I’ve had hundreds of paper notebooks over the years, serving as safe places for me to dump story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. But at a certain point, I turned away from physical notebooks because it became easier to save all of those things digitally in various apps that were always available to me on my phone. E-Ink tablets marry the tactile satisfaction of physical notebooks with many of the conveniences found in apps and other digital tools. E-Ink tablets have come a long way over the years, especially in the last couple of years, to the point where you have a few solid options to choose from now.
