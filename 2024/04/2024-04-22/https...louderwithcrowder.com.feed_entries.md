When Joe Biden sees these polls, he's going to go through an entire economy-sized back of Depends. Are old man poop jokes cheap? Sure, but in my defense, Biden is a sh*tty president. And one that finds himself less likable than Donald Trump. Yes, THAT Donald Trump.</p><p>It's remarkable. Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) have done everything they possibly could to sabotage Trump's chances in November, up to and including around 217 different Trumped-up indictments.
