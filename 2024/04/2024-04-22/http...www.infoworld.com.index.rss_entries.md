With heavier use and more complex data manipulation requirements, he says, “they often start to fail and cause workload and performance issues.”</p><p>I've used low-code and no-code platforms for over two decades and have written extensively about them, including articles on <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3713500/how-generative-ai-impacts-low-code-development.html">how generative AI is changing low-code</a>, using low-code to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3700329/when-low-code-and-no-code-can-accelerate-app-modernization.html">accelerate application modernization</a>, and <a href="h
