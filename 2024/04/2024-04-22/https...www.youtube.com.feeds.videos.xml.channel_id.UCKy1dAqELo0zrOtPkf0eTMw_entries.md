In today's Daily Fix:
It finally happened: Grand Theft Auto 5 is on Switch. Well, not really, but it's proof that it can be done. Modders took the game's source code and got it running on the Nintendo Switch. It doesn't run well, but maybe if Rockstar put some resources behind an official port, it probably maybe sort of can be done. In other news, an EA exec is  mad at Stellar Blade—not over the game itself, but that Stellar Blade is a pretty violent game, and somehow that passed the Japanese ratings board, but Dead Space didn't. And finally, we're partnering with Xbox for the next ID@Xbox Showcase, so tune in on Monday, April 29th at 10am Pacific for a look at some upcoming indie games you won't want to miss.

Spider-Man 4 is still happening in the MCU, with Tom Holland giving Marvel fans an update on where the creative team is at with the process. Speaking to Deadline, Holland gave a few details on the webcrawler’s legacy, #SpiderMan4 and his involvement in the creative process of the still-untitled fourth film within the #MCU: “We have the best in the business working toward whatever the story might be. But until we’ve cracked it, we have a legacy to protect. The third movie was so special in so many ways that we need to make sure we do the right thing. This is the first time in this process that I’ve been part of the creative so early. It’s just a process where I’m watching and learning. It’s just a really fun stage for me. Like I said, everyone wants it to happen. But we want to make sure we’re not overdoing the same things.” He went on to talk about how he owes his career to Spider-Man, first starring in the role back in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War film.

Driven by his inner voice (H. Jon Benjamin), one which he co-opted from his favorite childhood video game, Boy trains with a mysterious shaman (Yayan Ruhian) to become an instrument of death and is set loose on the eve of the annual culling of dissidents. Bedlam ensues as Boy commits bloody martial arts mayhem, inciting a wrath of carnage and blood-letting. 

As he tries to get his bearings in this delirious realm, Boy soon falls in with a desperate resistance group, all the while bickering with the apparent ghost of his rebellious little sister.

Ever since Game of Thrones became the standard bearer for contemporary prestige TV, it's been an inevitability that each network is looking for that one show that could become "The Next Game of Thrones." No one can ever truly predict what will catch fire and become a prestige TV smash, but that’s where Shōgun on FX comes in. 

The Shōgun TV show has kept fans in awe, with Shōgun episode 8 and Shōgun episode 9 taking things to the next level at every turn. Hiroyuki Sanada is inspired as Yoshii Toranaga, and Anna Sawai’s Lady Mariko has easily won the heart of the internet. Cosmo Jarvis’ John Blackthorne has even wiggled his way in there as well! 

Now, with the Shōgun finale around the corner, it seems like it’s time to finally call it: Shōgun is everything Game of Thrones should have been.
