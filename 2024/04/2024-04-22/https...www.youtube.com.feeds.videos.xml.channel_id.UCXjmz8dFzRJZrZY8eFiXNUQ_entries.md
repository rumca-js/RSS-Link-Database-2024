After it's first season, Parks and Recreation wasn't off to the best start.  It was panned for it's similarities to The Office, and overall didn't live up to the hype of it's predecessor.  But at the end of season two, Ben Wyatt and Chris Traeger were introduced and Parks and Rec would never be the same.  It's rare that a sitcom can completely save it's self by adding to the central cast, but shows like The Office and Parks and Recreation took the gamble and it paid off.
