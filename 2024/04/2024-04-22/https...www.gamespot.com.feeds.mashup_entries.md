Yet there's one phrase, inscribed on his X (formerly Twitter) bio that surmises much of his work and, presumably, his person: "70% of my body is made of movies."</p><p>It's no secret that much of Kojima's work is inspired by his love of movies, which started when he was a child and continues to this day. As such, Kojima has not only worked with Hollywood directors and actors in his games, but spends a not-insignificant amount of time both watching, and unofficially reviewing, movies.

<p>Multiple major entertainment companies, including Prime Video and Max, may have unknowingly outsourced animation work on their shows to North Korea, despite US sanctions on the country. Cybersecurity researcher Nick Roy has been scanning North Korea's tiny internet presence, spotting new websites coming online and providing a glimpse of its digital life for almost 10 years.</p><p>However, in December last year, Roy discovered a weak cloud server on a North Korean IP address containing thousands of animation files that hinted North Korea was working on international TV projects. The country had sanctions placed upon the regime due to its ongoing human rights abuses and nuclear warfare programs, prohibiting US companies from working with Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) companies or individuals.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-amazon-max-animation-exposed-server/">Wired</a> reported that the cache had animation cells, videos, and even notes discussi

<p dir="ltr">Lego Fortnite thinks you need some animal buddies in your virtual life, so a new update arriving tomorrow, April 23, is called Farm Friends. Developer Epic will raise the recruitment cap for your village so that cows, sheep, chickens, and pigs can join your home.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-v29-30-farm-friends">the Fortnite website</a>, Epic says the cap will grow to 10. Lego Fortnite players can dedicate up to seven of those spaces to animals, with three solely dedicated to the cute creatures. Three slots are only available to Villagers, meaning the final four are customizable to include either group.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with being adorable, a major reason to recruit these Farm Friends relates to resources. All four pet pals will produce fertilizer, while they each offer their own reward, too. Chickens will drop feathers; cows can make milk; sheep will grow wool; and pigs apparently end up providing mushrooms.</p><a href="htt

<p>After a couple of years, it's only natural that you'd want to change up the look of your consoles. Sure, the pristine white and the carbon black finish of the PS5 and the Xbox Series X loo great, but over at Amazon you can score several of Razer's vinyl wraps for your console at their best prices yet. Normally priced between $40 and $60, you can save up to 60% on several designs.</p><p>According to Razer, these are scratch-resistant vinyls that are precision-cut to ensure a uniform fit on your console. As thin as a sheet of printer paper, they add hardly any extra weight and feature several different textures. The other big plus here is that should you get bored of this wrap, they're easy to remove and they won't leave any residue on your Xbox or PlayStation. Because nothing is worse than a console full of sticky glue stains.</p><p>For the designs, Amazon has several for the Xbox Series X and both of the chunkier PS5 console variations.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles

<p>Grief is a messy, convoluted emotion to navigate. There's rarely a straightforward path to get through it; oftentimes it can feel like you're walking in circles around what you're looking for, or banging your head against the same mental roadblock again and again. In many ways, the experience of playing through a metroidvania mimics the feeling of working through grief--the genre is built on a similar path of progression, where the necessary tools to move forward are earned step-by-step, and a protagonist's evolving moveset makes it easier to overcome its challenges and navigate a seemingly inescapable world. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau/">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a> leans into that parallel, creating a powerful and moving message within the context of a stellar action-adventure game.</p><p dir="ltr">Tales of Kenzera sees you play as Zau, the fictional hero of a story that a father wrote for his son just prior to the father's death.

<p dir="ltr">Sonic the Hedgehog was widely hailed as a live-action video game adaptation done right, thanks to borrowing a well-worn Hollywood formula--a buddy road trip with small-town sheriff James Marsden as his human sidekick. Now comes Knuckles, a six-part show pairing up the Sonic sidekick with Marsden's sidekick, Deputy Wade Whipple (Adam Pally). But whereas the Sonic movies focused primarily on the hedgehog and used Marsden's character for Sonic to bounce off of, the Knuckles adaptation flips that precedent on its head. Wade Whipple is the primary focus here, and Knuckles (Idris Elba) is alternatively the sidekick, mentor, and MacGuffin as the plot requires. The result is a generally entertaining family comedy about deputy and aspiring bowling champion Wade Whipple, which happens to have Knuckles peppered in.</p><p dir="ltr">Knuckles does feature heavily in the first episode, as we see his warrior traditions clashing with Sonic's family, including brief cameos from Sonic, Tail
