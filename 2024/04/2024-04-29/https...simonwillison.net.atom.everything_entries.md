There's a new, unlabeled and undocumented model on the LMSYS <a href="https://chat.lmsys.org/">Chatbot Arena</a> today called <code>gpt2-chatbot</code>. It's been giving some impressive responses - you can prompt it directly in the Direct Chat tab by selecting it from the big model dropdown menu.</p>
<p>It looks like a stealth new model preview. It's giving answers that are comparable to GPT-4 Turbo and in some cases better - my own experiments lead me to think it may have more "knowledge" baked into it, as ego prompts ("Who is Simon Willison?") and questions about things like lists of speakers at DjangoCon over the years seem to hallucinate less and return more specific details than before.</p>
<p>The lack of transparency here is both entertaining and infuriating. Lots of people are performing a parallel distributed "vibe check" and sharing results with each other, but it's annoying th

Placing liability on the creators of general purpose tools like these mean that, in practice, such tools can not be created at all, except by big businesses with well funded legal teams.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Instead of regulating the development of AI models, the focus should be on regulating their applications, particularly those that pose high risks to public safety and security. Regulate the use of AI in high-risk areas such as healthcare, criminal justice, and critical infrastructure, where the potential for harm is greatest, would ensure accountability for harmful use, whilst allowing for the continued advancement of AI technology.</p></blockquote><p class="cite">&mdash; <a href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-04-29-sb1047.ht

Anna Andersen writes about a spectacular user interface design case-study from this year's Icelandic presidential election.</p>
<p>Running for President requires 1,500 endorsements. This year, those endorsements can be filed online through a government website.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://island.is/forsetaframbod">page for collecting endorsements</a> originally had two sections - one for registering to collect endorsements, and another to submit your endorsement. The login link for the first came higher on the page, and at least 11 people ended up accidentally running for President!
