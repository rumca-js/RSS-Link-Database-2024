Lightning Talk: Let's Fix Sparse Linear Algebra with C++. It'll Be Fun and Easy! - Benjamin Brock - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

Sparse linear algebra is hard.  There are a large variety of different sparse linear algebra formats, and they all require obtuse index arithmetic in order to use.  But what if we could fix this?  In this talk, I'll present an idea for "fixing sparse linear algebra" using customization points, the ranges library, and high-level multi-dimensional iteration.
