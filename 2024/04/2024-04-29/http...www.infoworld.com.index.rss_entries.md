<p>In the rush to embrace <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3699140/review-codewhisperer-bard-and-copilot.html">coding assistants like Amazon CodeWhisperer</a> to generate new code for developers, we haven’t spent much time asking if that code is any good.

<p>At the end of March 2024, Mike Stonebraker <a href="https://www.dbos.dev/blog/announcing-dbos" rel="nofollow">announced in a blog post</a> the release of <a href="https://www.dbos.dev/dbos-cloud" rel="nofollow">DBOS Cloud</a>, “a transactional serverless computing platform, made possible by a revolutionary new operating system, DBOS, that implements OS services on top of a distributed database.” That sounds odd, to put it mildly, but it makes more sense when you read the origin story:</p><blockquote>
<p>The idea for DBOS (DataBase oriented Operating System) originated 3 years ago with my realization that the state an operating system must maintain (files, processes, threads, messages, etc.) has increased in size by about 6 orders of magnitude since I began using Unix on a PDP-11/40 in 1973. As such, storing OS state is a database problem. Also, Linux is legacy code at the present time and is having difficulty making forward progress. For example th

<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://redis.com/blog/what-redis-license-change-means-for-our-managed-service-providers/" rel="nofollow">Redis changed its license</a> from the Open Source Initiative (OSI)-approved <a href="https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause" rel="nofollow">BSD 3-Clause license</a> to the <a href="https://redis.com/legal/rsalv2-agreement/" rel="nofollow">Redis Source Available License (RSALv2)</a>. This move echoed Elastic’s earlier <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing" rel="nofollow">license change for Elasticsearch</a>, which switched from the Apache License 2.0 to the Elastic License (ELv2). Then, just as <a href="https://opensearch.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenSearch</a> was forked from open-source Elasticsearch, <a href="https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey" rel="nofollow">Valkey</a> has been forked from open-source <a href="https://redis.com/" rel="nofollow">Redis</a>.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/37
