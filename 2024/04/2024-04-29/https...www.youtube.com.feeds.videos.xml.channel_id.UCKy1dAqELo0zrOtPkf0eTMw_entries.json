Just a couple weeks ago, McDonald's inadvertently showed off new characters from the upcoming Captain America: Brave New World movie via a leaked ad. Now, our first look at the new Falcon, played by Danny Ramirez, is prominently displayed on a new poster that will presumably be available at McDonald's. This is probably due to the movie's release date being pushed back from this summer, and McDonald's already had a bunch of marketing material ready to go. In other news, Avengers: Endgame directors Anthony and Joe Russo have kind of a hot take with regards to superhero fatigue and Marvel's diminishing box office returns since the Infinity Saga wrapped up. The culprit according to them: social media and short attention spans. And finally, Sony's latest Marvel entry, Kraven the Hunter, will now be facing off against Disney's Mufasa this December, after some shuffling around of release dates by Sony.\n\n#IG", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj29wKUr1Vs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/vj29wKUr1Vs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "McDonald's Spoils First Look at Captain America 4's New Falcon - IGN The Fix: Entertainment", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-29T22:13:11+00:00", "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nFallout 4's \"free\" next-gen update dropped last week, but many PlayStation users were left out in the Wasteland when a supposed bug kept it from certain versions of the game.
