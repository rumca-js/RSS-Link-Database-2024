<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 29 April 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01876-2">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01876-2</a></p>Iodide-related defects pose serious challenges to the irradiation, thermal, light or reverse-bias stabilities of perovskite solar cells. Here, the authors find that by using the iodide/polyiodide capture and confine effects of perfluorodecyl iodide interfacing with perovskites, inverted perovskite solar cells achieve much improved stabilities.
