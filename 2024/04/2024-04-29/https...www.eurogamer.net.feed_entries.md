It's been a while since Bethesda's had anything significant to say about Starfield, but that should be changing soon - not only is its Shattered Space story expansion now confirmed to be gearing up for an autumn release, a new free update should be launching soon.
</p><p>
Shattered Space first reared its head <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/of-course-theres-a-300-edition-of-starfield">last June</a>, when it was bundled into a couple of Starfield special editions for release sometime this year. And Bethesda's Todd Howard, speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wvqF41_Bgw">Kinda Funny Games</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/starfields-shattered-space-story-expansion-is-launching-this-fall/">VGC</a>) has now narrowed that down, confirming the expansion - which promises new story conten

## Amazon's Fallout TV show was watched by 65m people in its first two weeks

Amazon's Fallout TV adaptation is doing alright for itself; not only has it been a hit with the critics, it's been a hit with viewers too - to the tune of 65m people in its first 16 days of release, according to new figures shared by the streaming service.
</p><p>
As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/fallout-amazon-series-ratings-1235985817/">Variety</a>, Fallout's big 65m-strong success makes it the second most-watched show on Amazon, only losing out to 2022's The Lord of the Rings: The Ring of Power - but as the publication notes, Amazon hasn't qualified what it considers a viewer in its figures, so it's unclear how much of the series any of those counted have actually watched.
</p><p>
Even so, it's clearly drawn the crowds, with Amazon adding the live-action Fallout adaptation is its most-watched show ever in the 

## Vampire Survivors gets go-karting and Santa in new 'hyper realistic AAAA' Laborratory update

Vampire Survivors - still vampire-free before you ask - has surprise-launched its brand-new Laborratory update - a "hyper realistic holiday themed" update so mindblowingly spectacular, developer Poncle is even going as far as to herald it a "AAAA" release.
</p><p>
The free Laborratory update (yes, with two 'r's) plunges players deep into the dark halls of a science lab - a "former pinnacle of weapons science, now overtaken by the forces of evil and a corrupted milk magician" - where one new character, one new secret character, three new weapons, and two new stages, including a bonus go-karting stage, because of course, await.
</p><p>
It's an update that - and I'm quoting the developer directly here so don't blame me if your sky-high expectations aren't met - "pushes Vampire Survivors to such wild new heights that Poncle

If you've played Kaizen Game Works' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradise-killer-review">wonderully weird</a> cosmic-horror-tinged vapourware deduction adventure Paradise Killer, you'll know the studio isn't afraid to mix things up, and its newly announced Promise Mascot Agency looks to be an equally wild, genre-bending ride.
</p><p>
Kaizen Game Works describes Promise Mascot Agency as the "world's first (and best) open-world mascot management crime drama", and it charts the adventures of a disgraced yakuza lieutenant - Michizane "Michi" Sugawara - after he's exiled to a cursed town and forced to turn a bankrupt mascot agency into a profitable business.
</p><p>
And things only get weirder from there. As Michi, players must explore the town of Kaso-Machi in their run-down truck, making friends, striking deals, a

It's been a good while since we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-life-is-strange-team-share-first-teaser-for-new-project">first laid eyes on</a> Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, the new narrative adventure from Don't Nod - specifically the team behind Life is Strange 1 &amp; 2 - but the studio has now given us another tantilising peek in a new trailer.
</p><p>
Bloom &amp; Rage - described as the first game in Don't Nod's new "Lost Recordsuniverse" - is intriguingly split across two timelines, with part of its action unfolding in 1995, as high school friends Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat embark on a "magical summer" of self-discovery.
</p><p>
But Lost Records is also set some 27 years later, when, after decades without contact, the group is reunited "to confront the long-buried secret that made them promise to never speak ag

The addition of a 40fps 'favour quality' mode in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora strikes an excellent balance between resolution and visual features for Xbox Series X and PS5, while Lords of the Fallen's 1.5 update finally addressed the long-standing '0fps' problem we reported on back in the day. However, by far the highest profile addition is the 'next-gen' update for Fallout 4 - and it's swiftly unfolding into a bit of a saga.</p><p>A few weeks back in DF Direct, we outlined some of the existing issues in the PC version that really needed addressing - the ability to scale the game above 60fps and fixing the weapons debris option that crashes literally any RTX graphics card.

A Stardew Valley mod will add the likes of Astarian and Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3.

The project was shared over the weekend, with a tease of the mod's map (appropriately called Baldur's Village) and its pixelated Baldur's Gate 3 residents. 
</p><p>
The mod's team - which comprises three dedicated fans - said it is currently working on Astarion, Shadowheart, Gale and Halsin, but more characters will come. Oh, and we will be able to date Asterion, with the silver-haired vampire having his own "unique romance plot".

The dinky yellow Playdate handheld has plenty of odd games already - but here's an even odder proposition we thought we'd never see: WipEout.
</p><p>
Yes, that WipEout, of PlayStation fame. Except not quite. 
</p><p>
For starters, this version of Psygnosis' classic retro racer is based on <a href="https://github.com/phoboslab/wipeout-rewrite">rewritten code</a> that has been floating around the internet since at least last year for PC, Mac and Linux. This version, in turn, was written based on the original WipEout's leaked source code, posted online by Forest of Illusion in 2002.

There's a snazzy new video to celebrate 25 years of Lego Star Wars and within it, for the first time, we can see a minifigure Cal Kestis. 
</p><p>
Kestis is, of course, the protagonist of the Star Wars Jedi video game series. The red-haired hero can be spotted along with his droid companion BD-1 as part of Lego Star Wars' anniversary teaser video, which also includes faces from the likes of the Andor TV series and more.

"Celebrate 25 years of Lego Star Wars with your favourite characters from across the galaxy!" the social media team proclaimed over the weekend. And, if you scoot forward to around the 2:08 mark, you will see Kestis popping onto the scene, lightsaber in hand and wry grin on face.

A mysterious tease from Returnal developer Housemarque Studios has promised an imminent announcement from the studio behind the hugely-popular PlayStation and PC roguelike.
</p><p>
Housemarque posted a black-and-white teaser image to social media platform X this morning. It shows a pair of eyes peering through what looks like fractured glass, captioned with a single word: "Tomorrow".
</p><p>
Are those the eyes of Returnal's Selene Vassos? I think it's meant to be ambiguous - and indeed, the initial replies to Housemarque's post are from dozens of Returnal fans hoping for news of an expansion or sequel.

A new massively-multiplayer online RPG set in the world of Game of Thrones is reportedly being worked on by Korean publisher Nexon.

The untitled Game of Thrones MMORPG will initially be set in the North, home to the (mostly) heroic Stark family. Indeed, Winterfell and The Wall will be in-game locations.

Moon Studios CEO Thomas Mahler has compared its new game No Rest for the Wicked to Lord of the Rings, stating there's plenty to come after the game's 1.0 release - so don't expect a third Ori game "any time soon".
</p><p>
The dark fantasy action-RPG released in early access earlier this month, but after its forthcoming full 1.0 release Moon Studios plans to work on the game for "another five to 10 years" according to a post by Mahler on social media site X.
</p><p>
"Folks, we're nowhere near done with No Rest for the Wicked. There is so much that we've already built that none of you even know about and we want to deliver this in a masterful way!" said Mahler.
