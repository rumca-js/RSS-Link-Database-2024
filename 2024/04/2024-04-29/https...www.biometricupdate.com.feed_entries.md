		China’s hotel industry is backing off from facial recognition “overuse” as the country’s authorities put more emphasis on protecting biometric data privacy.

Hilton, Marriott and H World are some of the hotel chains in Shanghai that have already discontinued the practice of scanning their guests' face biometrics during check-in, Yicai Global <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/shanghai-hotels-stop-scanning-faces-at-check-in-should-boost-inbound-tourism-insiders-say">reports</a>.

		Estonia is keeping its physical identity cards until the creation of the European Union Digital Identity (EUDI) wallet.

In January, the Estonian Ministry of Interior proposed making ID cards optional as more citizens rely on the country’s multiple digital solutions. The proposal, however, has been met with resistance within the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (MKM).

Estonians are legally obligated to have an ID card while digital IDs are still voluntary. Passports are also not mandatory. This means that If the requirement for an ID card is lifted, some residents could end up with no ID at all, Estonian Public Broadcasting (ERR) <a href="https://news.err.ee/1609271010/id-card-to-remain-mandatory-until-european-union-digital-wallet-created">reports</a>.

The document signed by the mayors also contains proposals on which some action is required by the government in order to improve birth registration figures in the country.

The Yaounde forum – the first of its kind – brought together all the 374 local and city council mayors, heads of secondary civil status registration centers, civil status registration secretaries, civil society actors involved in citizen action, repre
