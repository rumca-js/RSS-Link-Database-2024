In today's Fix of entertainment news:
McDonald's is at it again with Marvel spoilers. Just a couple weeks ago, McDonald's inadvertently showed off new characters from the upcoming Captain America: Brave New World movie via a leaked ad. Now, our first look at the new Falcon, played by Danny Ramirez, is prominently displayed on a new poster that will presumably be available at McDonald's. This is probably due to the movie's release date being pushed back from this summer, and McDonald's already had a bunch of marketing material ready to go. In other news, Avengers: Endgame directors Anthony and Joe Russo have kind of a hot take with regards to superhero fatigue and Marvel's diminishing box office returns since the Infinity Saga wrapped up. The culprit according to them: social media and short attention spans. And finally, Sony's latest Marvel entry, Kraven the Hunter, will now be facing off against Disney's Mufasa this December, after some shuffling around of release dates by Sony.

In today's Daily Fix:
Fallout 4's "free" next-gen update dropped last week, but many PlayStation users were left out in the Wasteland when a supposed bug kept it from certain versions of the game. Gamers who downloaded the game via PS Plus were unable to download the update, with Bethesda saying it was a bug. Now the publisher is confirming that players who own the game via the PS Plus Collection will NOT be getting the update, but owners of the game through PS Plus Essentials will get it after they fix that bug. Confused? So were we, but we've got a full breakdown in today's episode. In other news, the Tomb Raider remastered trilogy caught some flack for removing Lara Croft pinup posters from the third game. Now developer Aspyr is putting them back in. And finally, a Mario Kart RC car is being recalled for practically the same issue as Tesla's Cybertruck.
