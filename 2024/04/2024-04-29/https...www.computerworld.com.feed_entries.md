<p>The EU has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_2363" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">given Apple just six months to open up iPads</a> in the same way it’s been <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2092396/apple-sidles-into-sideloading-in-the-eu.html">forced to open up iPhones in Europe</a>. The decision follows an EU determination that the iPad — which leads but does not dominate the tablet market — should be seen as a “gatekeeper.”</p>



<p>Apple <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2075606/apple-will-continue-to-enhance-its-dma-compliance.html">will not have much time to comply</a>.</p>

<p>A lot has changed regarding built-in backup and recovery tools in Windows 11. Enough so, in fact, that it’s not an exaggeration to talk about a new approach to handling system backup and restore, as well as system repair and recovery.</p>



<p>That’s why the title for this article uses the “P-word” (paradigm). This a term much-beloved in the USA in the 1970s and ’80s, plucked from Thomas Kuhn’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-50th-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B007USH7J2/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em></a> (1972) to explain how and why radical changes happen in science.</p>

<p>Like many universities, Georgia Tech has been grappling with how to offer students the training they need to prepare them for a recent sea change in IT job markets — the arrival of generative AI (genAI).</p>



<p>Through a partnership with chipmaker Nvidia, Georgia Tech’s <a href="https://coe.gatech.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">College of Engineering</a> built a supercomputer dubbed <a href="https://coe.gatech.edu/academics/ai-for-engineering/ai-makerspace" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AI Makerspace</a>; it uses 20 Nvidia HGX H100 servers  powered by 160 Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPUs (graphics processing units).</p>
