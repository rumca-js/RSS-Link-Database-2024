It'll Be Fun and Easy! - Benjamin Brock - CppCon 2023\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023\n\nSparse linear algebra is hard.  There are a large variety of different sparse linear algebra formats, and they all require obtuse index arithmetic in order to use.  But what if we could fix this?  In this talk, I'll present an idea for \"fixing sparse linear algebra\" using customization points, the ranges library, and high-level multi-dimensional iteration.\n---\n\nBenjamin Brock\n\nBen Brock is a PhD student at UC Berkeley, where he works on building libraries, tools, and algorithms for high-performance computing. His main work focuses on building a cross-platform library of data structures for distributed applications, with a focus on sparse linear algebra and graph algorithms. Ben is also a member of the GraphBLAS Languages Committee and is involved in drafting the C++ GraphBLAS API Specification.\n---\n\nVideos Filmed", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhpj-pQTJPA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "source_obj__id": 420, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/vhpj-pQTJPA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lightning Talk: Let's Fix Sparse Linear Algebra with C++.
