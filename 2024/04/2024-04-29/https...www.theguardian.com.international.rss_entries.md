<p>As this documentary smugly rehashes the transphobia that made Miriam Rivera’s life hell – claiming it would never happen today – it becomes just as tawdry. Has TV learned nothing in the past 20 years? </p><p>It was, all in all, a moral quagmire of a TV format. In 2004, There’s Something About Miriam saw six men vie for the attention of Miriam Rivera, a 21-year-old Mexican model who unbeknown to them had a “secret”: she was transgender. Even before it aired, this British reality-dating show had whipped up a tabloid frenzy, fuelled by the news that the contestants who had wooed Rivera were mounting a legal challenge to&nbsp;stop the show from airing. Lawyers claimed their lack of informed consent equated to a conspiracy to&nbsp;commit sexual assault.</p><p>Miriam: Death of a Reality Star retells the story of&nbsp;this queasy moment in pop culture, while also delving into Rivera’s traumatic early life and suspicious death. Yet despite looking back disapprovingly, this three-part&nbsp;

<p>The Indian PM may still be in a strong position; but incendiary, anti-Muslim rhetoric shows that all may not be going to plan</p><p>When Narendra Modi ran for prime minister for the first time in 2014, his overriding aim was to convince voters that he was a different man – no longer the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat, where, under his watch, more than 1,000 people were massacred in a communal pogrom in 2002. (A British government report found Modi “directly responsible” for not stopping the killing of Muslims; he has always denied culpability and was cleared of all charges by the supreme court.) Modi was going to be the man who would transform India by ushering in <em>vikas</em>, or economic development, for everyone.</p><p>His record as prime minister in the past decade belies that.

<p>Government tells operators they must join cooperatives by Tuesday and gradually replace their vehicles with greener options</p><p>A three-day strike by drivers of jeepneys in the Philippines began on Monday as transport groups warned that thousands could be pushed off the roads by government modernisation plans.</p><p>The jeepney is the backbone of the Philippines’ transport system. The customised, privately-owned buses, which look like a cross between a Jeep and a van and are decorated in flamboyant colours, ply routes in neighbourhood streets and city centres, offering rides for as little as 13 pesos (23 US cents). They have featured in pop songs and films – Pope Francis even travelled through Manila in a jeepney-inspired popemobile.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/29/jeepney-strike-philippines">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Elected in the 1997 landslide, Westminster’s answer to Hugh Grant was one of the first openly gay MPs – and a firebrand on TV. After 27 years, he reveals why he’s leaving politics behind</p><p>After Ben Bradshaw was selected as the Labour candidate for Exeter in 1997, Peter Mandelson apparently said: “Bloody hell, where did you come from?” Bradshaw had been a journalist, BBC Radio’s man on the ground at the fall of the Berlin Wall. He won the seat, at the age of 36, surfing the wave of enthusiasm for Tony Blair. Perhaps more importantly, as an openly gay candidate – only the second in British parliamentary history – he proved that the country had had enough not just of the Tories in general but of raging homophobes. Adrian Rogers, whose majority he overturned, notoriously described homosexuality as a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-politics-of-the-bbc-ben-bradshaw-candidate-1270807.html">“sterile, disease-ridden and God-forsaken occupation</a>”.</p><p>I meet B

<p>Years of pressure by those fined for urinating in street due to lack of facilities pays off with €4m plans</p><p>The need kicked in as Geerte Piening was on her way home from a bar one night in 2015. She swiftly weighed her options: it was past closing time in Amsterdam’s lively Leidseplein area, meaning she could not duck into a bar to use their facilities, while the nearest public toilet was 2km away.</p><p>She resorted to squatting in an alleyway, coaxing her friends to cover her as she did so. Police soon turned up, handing her a €140 (£118) fine for public urination.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/29/urination-equality-amsterdam-women-win-fight-more-public-toilets">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As she takes the words of Grenfell Tower fire survivors to the New York stage, the playwright talks about being drawn to painful subjects, and the disaster’s worldwide relevance</p><p>The night I saw Grenfell, the play by Gillian Slovo based on interviews with survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire, there was a small but unprecedented response from the audience. On paper, Grenfell, which has transferred to New York after its successful run in London, is a tough sell to American theatregoers: the disaster wasn’t big news in the US and the play’s setting is peculiarly British. Towards the end of the play, however, when a survivor suggests the fire wasn’t caused by the system being broken but rather by the system performing exactly as built, the audience at St Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn broke into spontaneous applause. “We haven’t had that reaction before,” says Slovo.</p><p>The 72-year-old playwright and novelist is accustomed to chronicling failures in government and if the subject m
