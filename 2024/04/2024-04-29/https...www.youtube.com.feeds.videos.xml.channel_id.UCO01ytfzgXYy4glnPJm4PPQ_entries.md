Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media has uncovered the dangerous right-wing conspiracy to have babies and stave off human extinction. We'll talk about this dastardly plot today. Also, an activist at Columbia University gets himself expelled for calling for the death of "Zionists." But what do these activists even mean when they talk about "Zionists"? And Jerry Seinfeld says that comedy is basically dead and the extreme Left killed it. Plus, Kristi Noem gets huge blowback from the Left and the Right after she reveals that she killed one of her dogs on her farm 20 years ago. Is the reaction justified?
