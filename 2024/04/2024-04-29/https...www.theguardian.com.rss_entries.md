<p><strong>British Museum, London<br /></strong>Michelangelo’s drawings were anything but dull, but this exhibition sucks out all the drama by focusing on his spirituality at the expense of his sexuality<strong><br /></strong></p><p>Lord Elgin, you let us down. With all the masterpieces of world art that Britain’s rapacious collectors grabbed from hither and yon, couldn’t they have got their hands on a single statue by Michelangelo? No, the only original work in marble by the great sculptor, painter, architect and poet in a British collection is a circular relief owned by the Royal Academy. What we have instead are extensive holdings of his drawings in the British Museum and Royal Collection. Unfortunately, the BM’s hushed use of these works on paper to try to illuminate his later life shows what poor recompense they are.</p><p>The problem is disappointingly obvious from the start.

Wedged between two major road junctions and approached either through a concrete jungle of slip roads or a 40-minute schlep on the train followed by a long trudge past a sewage treatment plant, perhaps the nicest thing you can say about the location of Bayern Munich’s stadium is that it at least offers easy access to everywhere else.</p><p>How many times will Harry Kane have to peer at this stadium through blacked-out windows before it begins to feel like home? The language will take years to master, if he ever manages it.

The first one was better”’</p><p>I was still a teenager when I saw the 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers and was really affected by it. Two decades later, when I started to think about doing a new version, I went to see Don Siegel, who directed the original. While we were talking, his movie’s male lead, Kevin McCarthy, happened to pop in. They told me they’d wanted to make their version funnier, and with a really scary ending, but the studio had made them add the scene where the FBI solves everything. I cast them both: Don plays the taxi driver, and Kevin is the guy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxhn43IZ5RI&amp;t=123s">who runs into traffic</a> trying to warn people, just as he did in the first movie.

While some Democrats may lend support from across the aisle, many of these proposals are simply messaging bills meant to impress GOP voters back home ahead of the November elections, and will likely be rejected by the Democra

<p><strong>Underbelly Boulevard, London<br /></strong>There are shocks aplenty as daredevils perform death-defying acts hair-raisingly close to the audience<br /></p><p>Circus used to happen in big tops. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/nov/20/new-soho-theatre-underbelly-boulevard-bernie-dieter-club-kabarett-batsu">Underbelly Boulevard</a> is a very small top, a venue where the fire-breathers almost singe your eyebrows and the roller-skaters leave eau de axle grease lingering up your nose. Sophie’s Surprise 29th is a circus and cabaret show masquerading as a birthday do, where a conceit thinner than the tissue on your party hat is spun around a series of death-defying acts. There’s no safety net, nor any reassuring margin between audience and performers. You realise with a gulp that were this or that aerialist to lose their grip, it’s not just their neck on the line, but quite possibly yours too.</p><p>That’s part of the thrill, of course, and there are thrills, and

<p>A man tells a stranger a story in a doctor’s waiting room to distract her, sparking a fairy tale of loss and desperation</p><p>Film-makers Claire Coache and Lisle Turner are a couple who survived the horrific experience of losing two babies during pregnancy: one to a medical termination and one to miscarriage. With Cold, they transmute this trauma into a near-wordless performance of allegorical art, one that was filmed during lockdown first in an empty theatre and is now being distributed online for free in order to make the subject accessible to everyone. That’s both very noble and savvy because this discreet, extremely intimate film starring two barely known actors might have struggled to pull in paying customers considering the subject is so painful.</p><p>Janet Etuk and Jacob Meadows play a couple first met waiting in a hospital to be seen by a doctor, stressed and worried about the child she’s carrying.

This was the dilemma facing one of my schoolfriends, the standup comedian Kiri Pritchard-McLean, who lives on Ynys Môn (Anglesey) with her partner. Like many people in their 30s, they were surrounded by friends embroiled in the maelstrom of babies and young children. But the prevailing narratives around motherhood didn’t really speak to Kiri, nor did the hard, thankless work of it appeal to her (to quote one of her jokes, “I see what my friends have got, and it’s the fucking Manson family … chaos, violence, no one’s washing their hair, everyone’s talking about sacrifice. It is a cult.”)</p><p>Foster caring isn’t something that many millennials consider – the largest age group of carers are <a href="https://fosterwales.gov.wales/am-i-too-old/">peop

There was practically no other way for Jews living in Europe in the 19th century to be part of the business class without renouncing their religion.</p><p>This practice actually harkened back for eons, at least two millennia to be precise, as Jews in Europe found other ways to live, always squeezed out of mainstream society, and especially so with emerging nation states (in contrast to when the Habsburg empire controlled much of Europe, where many Jews resided, and was more hospitable to Jews).

<p>This kids’ adventure story with a faux medievalist vibe has a cute conceit and some fun sequences but the inexperience of the cast and director shows</p><p>If you’ve ever tried to make a home movie with young children, you quickly come to appreciate how hard it is to get the little monsters to remember their lines and hit their marks, let alone give good performances. It’s an education in the difference between good and bad direction, the raw, primary-teacher skill in herding cats while also managing tone, quality control and all that storytelling stuff. Just try it for yourself and you’ll realise just how good a job directors such as Garth Jennings or Taika Waititi did with child-led films like Son of Rambow or Hunt for the Wilderpeople.</p><p>At the very least, this awareness will help you be a bit more forgiving of a film like Riddle of Fire. This would-be work of whimsy stars three kids – eldest but still preteen leader Alice (Phoebe Ferro) and her friends Hazel (Charlie Stover

I can be precise thanks to the boastful photographs of marmalade I took on 25 January, having bought the fruit the day before. Only half the oranges became marmalade (which filled 10 jars and made every surface in the kitchen sticky), so to start with a dozen or so sat in the bowl. They are not bitter oranges, nor are they sweet, which is why they have been consumed so slowly, watching other fruit come, go and succumb to rot (something these last two seem immune to).</p><p>They have shrunk, of course, and, like all ageing creatures, developed plenty of fine lines and open pores, but otherwise remain in excellent orange health, while their rich, oily scent is stronger than ever.

A wealth of competing options at the festival makes it completely acceptable to drift in and out of performances mid-set, and many of the most exciting gigs featured young people we’d never heard of. Reliant on better-informed friends, my wife and I went where we were told.

The liminal time on his bicycle is what Peck calls “one of the few Zen moments of the day”, where his foremost rule is to avoid any distraction and just pedal. “I don’t even listen to music, because even then I am doing something.”</p><p>Peck has been on the go for almost two decades now.

But Williams’ arrival is a victory unto itself for the Bears, who have been in the QB wilderness for decades. Chicago fans will expect Williams to be the team’s best quarterback ever, and it won’t even be so unreasonable of them given his sublime talent and the team’s barren history at the position. General manager Ryan Poles has also done well to surround Williams with one of the best groups of receivers in football. Poles traded for Los Angeles Chargers star Keenan Allen earlier this year, and he then used the ninth pick to add Washington’s Rome Odunze to a fold that already included the talented and productive DJ Moore. Maybe the Bears won’t win big in 2024, but they should be more fun to watch than

<p>Yes, I revelled in the thrill of film-making, yet a fear of failure nagged at me. Behind it lay a truth I’d been ignoring </p><p>For just over a decade I lived on the edge of danger, leaping from cliffs, jumping out of the back of trains and even being set on fire. I was a television and film stunt performer. Think Tom Cruise without the credits, in sky-high heels and hotpants. Every job was a calculated risk, and every performance felt like a dance with death. My job demanded the spirit of a daredevil and the agility of an acrobat with the presence of an actor, tasked with bringing the heart-pounding thrills of Hollywood to life. But as my star rose and opportunities knocked on my door, I made a decision to step back, leaving behind bewildered friends and colleagues who couldn’t understand why I was abruptly extinguishing my own flame.</p><p>While I revelled in the thrill of physical activity and globetrotting adventures, there was always a nagging sense of impostor syndrome gnawi

She would work on her sculptures for months at a time, going for hours without stopping. She would smack her hands together when she knew a piece was done – and immediately get to work on the next.

<p>The standup on being a vibe killer, studying Richard Pryor and why comedy isn’t for good-looking people</p><p><strong>Who is your comedy hero?<br /></strong>I grew up idolising a lot of standups: Chris Rock, Maria Bamford, Bridget Christie. I followed Ross Noble around (that sounds creepier than I intended) and watched him do a lot of shows in the early 2000s. At university, instead of doing my degree, there was a three-month period where I did an intensive Richard Pryor study. Through illegal downloading, I got all of his comedy albums and I would listen to each in chronological order and then build up to Live in Concert. I would say the intense focus I devoted to Pryor’s comedy came really at the expense of my degree.</p><p><strong>And your non-comedy hero?<br /></strong>I’m unsettlingly obsessed with Bob Dylan and André 3000 from Outkast.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.nishkumar.co.uk/gigs/">Nish Kumar: Nish, Don’t Kill My Vibe is on tour from September</a></strong></p> <a h

<p>From therapy sessions to bookshelves, interest in non-monogamous relationships seem to be soaring</p><p>When <strong>Molly Roden Winter</strong> stormed out of the house one evening, fed up with her husband returning home too late to help with their children, things took an unexpected turn. She went to a bar with a friend and ended up meeting a much younger man. But instead of an affair, she tells Helen Pidd, her interest in this other man sparked a surprising conversation with her husband – and led to them opening up their marriage to other people.</p><p>Non-monogamous marriages and polyamorous relationships are hardly new or unheard of. But Winter’s book seems to have hit a chord because her family and her marriage looked so conventional – and she says we still seldom hear stories about mothers in relationships with more than one person. Winter explains what she learned about herself and relationships from her open marriage. And how she discovered her mother had also had an open
