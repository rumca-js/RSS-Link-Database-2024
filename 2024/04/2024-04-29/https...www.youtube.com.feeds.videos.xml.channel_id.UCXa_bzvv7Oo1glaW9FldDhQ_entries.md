Remnant 2's second paid DLC, The Forgotten Kingdom, is finally available.
When taking the new dungeons and plethora of items into consideration, The Forgotten Kingdom works as a complement to the base game. However, it's narratively lacking, with much of the biome giving way to some serious deja vu.

Promising a new, cinematic campaign that will continue the series’ gripping story, significant improvements to its tactical RTS gameplay in more ways than one, major visual and technical improvements to make the experience feel that much more cinematic, and even a new roguelike mode, Homeworld 3 is looking like a promising return to the limelight for the franchise. Here, we talk about all of that and more.
