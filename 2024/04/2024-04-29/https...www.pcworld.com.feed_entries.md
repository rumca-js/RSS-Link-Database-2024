<p>Microsoft and IBM&rsquo;s DOS operating system is an important milestone in the history of personal computing, and it&rsquo;s just as important that we can dig into it and see what makes it tick. That&rsquo;s part of the reason that both companies have released the source code for certain versions, including MS-DOS 1.25, 2.11, and as of now, 4.0. The 1988 releases added support for partitions above 32 megabytes (yes, megabytes, as in &ldquo;smaller than a modern digital camera photo&rdquo;). </p>



<p>Microsoft and IBM released the updated code under the open-source MIT license <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2024/04/25/open-sourcing-ms-dos-4-0/&amp;xcust=2-1-2318304-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">earlier this month</a>.

<p>There&rsquo;s an ongoing saga around some of the latest Intel Core desktop CPUs, and how they&rsquo;re crashing when running 3D games and other resource-intense programs. Intel has previously stated that it&rsquo;s aware of the issue, and a few motherboard makers have issued BIOS updates trying to fix it. Now an internal memo from Intel is pointing the finger straight at those motherboards. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.igorslab.de/en/intel-releases-the-13th-and-14th-generation-k-sku-processor-instability-issue-update/&amp;xcust=2-1-2318151-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a report from Igor&rsquo;s Lab</a>, Intel has issued a message to motherboard manufacturers addressing the crashes on 13th- and 14th-gen Core processors, which we&rsquo;ve seen on <a href="https://

<p>I&rsquo;m an Olympic gold-medal trash talker &mdash; on the level of the best NBA haters raining 280-character S*&amp;T talk on X.com micro-seconds after your team&rsquo;s tearful exit from the play-in (sniff, go Warriors).</p>



<p>Example: When I&rsquo;d see a fellow journalist or analyst at a trade show sporting a laptop using Qualcomm&rsquo;s previous Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 running Windows, it was the perfect opportunity to do some class-A trash talking.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I guess, you&rsquo;re okay with Arm &mdash; because you must not do any work on your laptop.&rdquo;</p>
