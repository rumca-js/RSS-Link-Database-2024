<p>Meta is offering some creators thousands of dollars if they go viral on Threads. The payouts are part of a new invitation-only bonus program that rewards creators who use Meta’s newest app.</p>
<p>An Instagram <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://help.instagram.com/543274486958120"><ins>support page</ins></a> offers some details about the bonus program, which Meta hasn’t formally announced. It states that creators can earn money “based on the performance of your Threads posts” or “the number of posts you create.” It appears that specific terms of the bonuses are individualized to each creator. “Details of the bonus program may vary by participant,” the company notes.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The program seems to be a small-scale effort for now — the company refers to it as being in “testing” — but it offers a preview of how Meta may look to ramp up its efforts to use creators to boost engagement on the service.

<p>Streamflation is real y'all. Peacock just announced its raising prices again, less than a year after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-raises-subscription-prices-for-the-first-time-164405324.html"><ins>it last upped subscription costs</ins></a>. The new price will be $8 per month for Peacock with ads and $14 per month for an ad-free experience, starting on July 18 for new subscribers and August 17 for pre-existing users. An ad-free subscription will be the same price as Disney+ and nearly as much as Netflix. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mrs-davis-review-damon-lindelof-nun-vs-ai-peacock-150006136.html"><em><ins>Mrs. Davis</ins></em><ins> was good</ins></a>, but was it <em>that</em> good?</p>
<p>To put this into perspective, just one year ago a subscription to Peacock set you back just $5 to $10 per month, depending on if you went with ads or not. Then there was a $1 increase last summer, and now a $2 increase this summer. If this rate of increase keeps up, Peacock will

<p>“It is right, of course, that AI platforms pay publishers for the use of their material,” said <em>Financial Times</em> CEO John Ridding in a statement and added that the <em>Times</em> is “committed to human journalism.” Neither company disclosed the financial terms of the agreement.

<p>Getir is hightailing it out of everywhere but Turkey. On Monday, the “instant delivery” startup said it would exit the US, UK, Germany and the Netherlands to serve its Turkish home market exclusively. <em>TechCrunch</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/29/getir-getout-instant-delivery/">notes</a> the closures are likely to wipe out 6,000 jobs at the company.</p>
<p>Getir's business model, distinct from traditional shopping services like Instacart (which has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instacart-cuts-250-jobs-after-reporting-increased-revenue-112503431.html">problems of its own</a>), involves establishing micro-fulfillment centers in urban areas that carry groceries and household essentials. This often lets them fulfill orders within minutes —&nbsp;hence the “instant delivery” moniker. Once valued at $12 billion, the startup experienced a surge in growth during the pandemic as investors bet on COVID-era consumer shopping habits enduring after lockdowns. So much for tha

<p>OpenAI has been hit with a privacy complaint in Austria by an <a href="https://noyb.eu/en"><ins>advocacy group called NOYB</ins></a>, which stands for None Of Your Business. The complaint alleges that the company’s ChatGPT bot repeatedly provided incorrect information about a real individual (who for privacy reasons is not named in the complaint), <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-chatgpt-targeted-austrian-privacy-complaint-2024-04-29/"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>. This may breach EU privacy rules.</p>
<p>The chatbot allegedly spat out incorrect birthdate information for the individual, instead of just saying it didn’t know the answer to the query. Like politicians, AI chatbots like to confidently make stuff up and hope we don’t notice. This phenomenon is called a hallucination. However, it’s one thing when these bots make up ingredients for a recipe and another thing entirely when they invent stuff about real people.</p>

<p>DJI‚Äôs latest product is another Mini drone. It can capture 4K video at up to 30 fps and 60 fps footage at 2.7K resolution, with increased video bitrates up to 100Mbps, which should ensure higher quality video at both settings. While those specs may not excite,  maybe the price will.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with the Mini Pro series, which is several hundred dollars more, the $299 Mini 4K weighs less than 249g, is foldable and requires no FAA registration.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The specifications won‚Äôt move the Mini series forward, but they cover all the essentials for beginner drone pilots, including 2x digital zoom while recording in 4K, a 3-axis gimbal and electrical image stabilization.

There‚Äôs also level-5 wind resistance, once again, and it can fly for up to 31 minutes (or up to 93 minutes with DJI‚Äôs $449 Fly More bundle.)</p>

<p>Apple Vision Pro headset production is reportedly being cut, sales are reportedly ‚Äúway down.‚Äù But but but wait: Wasn‚Äôt the Vision Pro meant to change the world of VR/AR, ushering in an era of spatial computing? Is the dream over?</p>
<p>Hah, no.

It‚Äôs almost as if early Vision Pro sales numbers don‚Äôt matter. Remember: The first iPhone wasn‚Äôt great either.</p>
