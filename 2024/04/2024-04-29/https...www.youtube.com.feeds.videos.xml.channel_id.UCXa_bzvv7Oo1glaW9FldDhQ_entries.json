Promising a new, cinematic campaign that will continue the series\u2019 gripping story, significant improvements to its tactical RTS gameplay in more ways than one, major visual and technical improvements to make the experience feel that much more cinematic, and even a new roguelike mode, Homeworld 3 is looking like a promising return to the limelight for the franchise.
