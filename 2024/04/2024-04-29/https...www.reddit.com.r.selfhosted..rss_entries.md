<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After a year or so of running various applications on my homelab, I managed to get the oracle cloud free tier account and wanted to see what I could run from there. Mainly I just wanted to educate myself on setting up infrastructure outside of my LAN and how . From what I can tell, advantages (possibly) of hosting on the cloud are:</p> <ul> <li>A static ip address</li> <li>Having more reliable internet than my home connection, which gets disconnected from time to time</li> <li>Not having to expose any ports on my home network</li> </ul> <p>A big disadvantage to me is the lack of privacy, being on a public cloud, from Oracle themselves.</p> <p>One of the things I tried to run experimentally was ad guard, and I generally followed these instructions with a few tweaks:</p> <p><a href="https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-home-on-public-server.html">https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-home-on-public-server.html</a></p> <p>The main tweaks were running adguar

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I have a forum with over 500k members (est. 2001), and I'm looking for setting up a self-hosted SMTP server to be able to start sending out monthly newsletters and occasional promos via DMs to our users. Every sent DM triggers the forum to send an email to a user &gt; therefore we need a SMTP solution.</p> <p>We have just set up Postal and it was fine for individual messages. My issue = can't see decent statistics (love postmarkapp stats) and after the 1st test we have only 150k outgoing messages out of 500+k messages with a rate 10.3 messages/minute. And this is with a 64gb ram 6c/12t dedi (total overkill, I know). I am sure that we can improve the sending speed with Postal &gt; not sure about stats.</p> <p>What would be your suggestions for a self-hosted SMTP server for transactional stream emails only (not incoming) with good stats and ability to quickly move 1/2mil emails?</p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a

This was an easy solution for me because for the life of me, I was not able to port forward for reasons unknown.

At this point, I’m worried what might happen in the event all users login at the same time and start streaming movies/shows. Would this crash my server or slow it down?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey All,</p> <p>I recently set up a MotionEye CCTV system on my property with the help of you fine folks here at <a href="/r/selfhosted">r/selfhosted</a>. I'm using a laptop with a 256gb SSD boot drive and have mounted a 600gb HDD to the device via a SATA/USB adapter to record security footage to. I believe I mounted the drive correctly because when I run BASHTOP I can see the drive in my available disks and I have set the appropriate permissions to the folders that I have created within that drive. That being said, I can't seem to get motioneye to record to this mounted USB drive. I tried editing the motioneye.conf file to record media to the USB mounted drive, I tried editing my docker-compose file to point to this directory, and still the container defaults to my root disk. Any suggestions here?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PrettyDumbITGuy_87"> /u/PrettyDumbITGuy_87 </a> <br /

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! Lately, I've noticed I have a need for some way to see, at a glance, a lot of metadata about the applications I use. My first thought was to look to the package managers I'm already using, but especially on Windows or when working on multiple operating systems back-and-forth (as I currently do), not one package manager covers *all* of your software, nor do I think we could ever reasonably expect one to for that broad of a use case. So from here I've been looking to see if there's some new &quot;class&quot; of application I haven't thought of that might do this? (allow a user to manage their software and see relevant information about it across install methods) </p> <p>For context on what kind of &quot;metadata&quot; I'm talking about, some things I might like to see are:<br /> - whether an app is open source, proprietary, etc... (I really appreciate how <a href="https://alternativeto.net/">AlternativeTo.net</a> handles this)<br /> - tracked issues
