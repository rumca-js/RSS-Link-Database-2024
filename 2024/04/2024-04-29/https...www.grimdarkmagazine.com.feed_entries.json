This new dark fantasy by Australian indie author L.R. Schulz is equal parts exciting and thought-provoking. Soul Cage is told from three third-person perspectives, starting with the legendary Myddrin, who had once killed the most dominant mage in the land but has now retreated from the world.

My favorite character is Will, a talented and possibly neurodivergent boy who sees the world in terms of unique patterns. Will wishes to protect others by becoming a Knight of Aen, developing his magical gifts to control and enhance his powers. Finally, Tvora is a broken warrior on the verge of losing her sanity amidst the oppressive squalor of the fighting pits.
