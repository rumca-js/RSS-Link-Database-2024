The author of The L-Shaped Room and The Indian in the Cupboard, who died on Thursday aged 94, was a writer I admired and liked a lot – and someone who helped me find a pathway for myself.</p><p>I have a huge admiration for the breadth of her writing. Her first novel was for adults, The L-Shaped Room. It was a great hit, and was adapted into a film. Where do you go after that? And the answer was, she didn’t follow the commerce, she didn’t go to Hollywood or spend time just writing film scripts. She went on writing what she cared about.</

<p>Despite evident passion from the film-makers, this personal transformation through sporting achievement story borders on parody</p><p>Traditionally, genre labels gave a broad sense of what kind of experience you might be in for, whether horror, comedy or action. In the streaming era, things are much more specific, with platforms such as Netflix offering ever more niche microgenres: “Cynical Comedies Featuring a Strong Female Lead” for example, or “Classic Feelgood Opposites-Attract Movies”. Bobcat Moretti feels tailor-made for this kind of categorisation. Here we have an “Inspirational Personal Transformation Following Tragic Life Event Sports Movie”, in which a man with multiple sclerosis takes up boxing as part of an effort to turn his life around after a horrific family tragedy.</p><p>The passion and commitment of the film-makers are evident. Starring as the eponymous Bobcat, Tim Realbuto also co-wrote the script (with director Rob Margolies) and lost 70kg (11st) during the cour

<p>This lively, accessible insight into a quartet of female writers in Elizabethan and Jacobean England explores the complex political, patriarchal and religious backdrop to their lives</p><p>Virginia Woolf, in her seminal essay <em>A Room of One’s Own</em>, famously asserted that any hypothetical sister of William Shakespeare would have had her literary gifts thwarted from the outset, thanks to the restrictions on women’s education in the Elizabethan age, not to mention the burdens of motherhood and domestic drudgery.</p><p>In the last few decades, the field of feminist literary and historical studies has vastly expanded, holding up to the light those female writers who, despite Woolf’s dismissal, did exist and create in Elizabethan and Jacobean England.

<p>Kai Havertz inspires Arsenal again, Jarrad Branthwaite stands tall and Manchester City prioritise fresh legs</p><p>If emotion is carrying Liverpool towards a glorious farewell to Jürgen Klopp, then Old Trafford required cooler heads. Harvey Elliott’s point-rescuing contribution as substitute stood out because, for all his energy, he played with intelligence, seeking to progress the ball and tempting Aaron Wan-Bissaka into conceding a penalty. The likes of Dominik Szoboszlai and even usual pass-master Alexis Mac Allister had allowed a red mist to consume them. Luis Díaz, Mohamed Salah and Darwin Núñez – a modern “Crazy Horse” yet more madcap than Emlyn Hughes – were also guilty of impetuousness. On the sidelines, Klopp himself looked in danger of exploding, particularly after Kobbie Mainoo was granted space to score.

<p>In Paris staff readily help a wheelchair passenger to and from a train, but not in London </p><p><strong>A friend who uses a wheelchair recently bought a return trip from Paris to London with Eurostar and booked assistance at both ends of his journey. At the Gare du Nord in Paris, he was duly wheeled to the train, but on his arrival in London he was told that Eurostar staff were no longer allowed to push a wheelchair. Passengers must either propel their own chair, or be accompanied by a companion. Eventually, a member of staff asked if they could take his photograph to show their boss in case of any later difficulties, then wheeled him and his bag to the taxi rank. On his return journey, he was again informed that staff could not push his wheelchair. He was told that in Paris, Eurostar employs an agency to provide the service, but in London it now relies on its own employees. Eventually, he was told he could be wheeled on to an earlier service. It was stressful to discover that he

<p>Percival Everett’s gleeful reboot of Mark Twain puts the enslaved Jim centre stage in a horrifying, painful and funny novel</p><p>For most of his prolific, 40-year career, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/percival-everett">Percival Everett</a> has been published by a non-profit imprint in Minneapolis, outside the traditional centre of US publishing in New York. In the UK, he was long out of print until being picked up by Influx Press, the small independent that in 2022 published his Booker-shortlisted <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/31/the-trees-by-percival-everett-review-potent-satire-of-us-racism">The Trees</a></em>. But after the success of that novel, major labels on both sides of the Atlantic came calling. Suddenly he’s hot property: his new book, <em>James</em>, arrives hard on the heels of the Oscar-winning film <em>American Fiction</em>, adapted from Everett’s 2001 novel <em>Erasure</em>, about a frustrated black novelist who decides to liv
