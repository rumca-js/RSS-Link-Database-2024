<p>This documentary is an inspiring look at the astonishingly brave activists who took on the National Front in the 1970s and 80s – and changed Britain for the better. It’s full of dark parallels with today</p><p>With a prime minister, first minister for Scotland and London mayor all of south Asian descent the UK has changed dramatically in the 50 years since the events of Channel 4’s Defiance: Fighting the Far Right. While anti-British Asian sentiment is still rife – and you only have to look at the treatment of Britain’s cricket stars or read about the 31% pay gap between white men and Pakistani women to realise that we don’t live in a post-racial utopia – the progress made in the decades since the events of the programme is still staggering. Increased tolerance is not something that naturally evolved, however, and this three-part documentary shows how the British Asian community stood up to the racism that sought to destroy it – and fought for their right to live with dignity.</p><

<p>Real Madrid loanee is playing his best football but spells in cold and snowy England provided tranquility needed for the top level</p><p>Real Madrid’s No 14 has a familiar face and a very familiar name. He does according to Jude Bellingham, anyway. Bellingham calls him Peter Crouch, in his passport he’s José Luis Mato Sanmartín, and his shirt reads Joselu. Yes, <em>that</em> Joselu. “That’s me,” he says smiling as he settles into a sofa at the Spanish national team training base: the former Stoke and Newcastle striker who has a better goals ratio than anyone in the <em>selección</em> and is banging them in for the biggest club on the planet.</p><p>Already the scorer of more in one season in Madrid than the three he had in the Premier League, Joselu has experienced a long journey and says he is better for it, though it might not always have felt that way. He is living moments now that are more special for those lived before, his success an example of perseverance, never losing hope.

<p>Remember the good old days when you could get on a train or go to a party without wondering if it was worth the risk? It’s time for a revival</p><p>In a series of deft manoeuvres that remain fascinating to me, my 16-year-old son managed to barter me down from a four-day trip to Devon to 13 hours in Broadstairs on the Kent coast, during which every train, meeting and arrangement was a white-knuckle ride, as to miss one would render the entire thing, plus the weeks either side of it, some variation of pointless. But we caught every train, we made every meeting, and he watched Match of the Day with his friend while I went to an Afrobeats club night with mine. In the morning he ate vegan bacon in record time, while I studiously didn’t mention how incredibly tired I was, and then he had the brass neck to complain about sleep deprivation all the way home. But by then I wasn’t tired any more, because I’d had a huge, adrenalised revelation: this whole escapade had a pre-pandemic feel.</p><

In it she argued that old age is culturally defined, arriving at different moments in the human life cycle depending on the time and place. “Society,” writes de Beauvoir, “looks upon old age as a kind of shameful secret that it is unseemly to mention”. As a result, ageing is notably absent from literature, and many find it easier to imagine death: “in the old person that we must become, we refuse to recognise ourselves”.</p><p>Almost 60 years later our essential attitude towards ageing has not changed

It was a revelation, albeit not an easy one</p><p>Twenty years ago this August, I went to my first music festival. My best friend’s mum kindly – bravely – drove us two 15-year-olds from Cornwall to Reading and supervised from a distance while we queued at the signing tent to meet Goldie Lookin’ Chain, Razorlight and the Hives, joined in the euphoric yells of “bollocks!” that swept across the campsite and eschewed the homemade food she had brought to rejoice in eating kebab-van burgers as flat and flavourful as CDs. In the photos, we look drunk – wide-eyed and giddy at the (relative) freedom, the disbelief that the pages of NME were coming to life before our eyes. But we were completely sober. Save for a couple of small local events the following summer, I think that was, until very recently, the last time I ever went to a festival without drinking. And work has taken me

## ‘A trophy is a trophy’: Jon Rahm on LIV, Augusta and Seve Ballesteros

<p>The Masters champion has gone from critic of LIV Golf’s format to its pin-up boy. He talks about perception and the future</p><p>Jon Rahm roars with laughter. “I gotta be careful here. I don’t want to create a headline.” Of the unwanted sort, he means. Rahm has featured on billboards for years. The question should be simple enough. Who, in his mind, is currently the best male golfer in the world? Yet Rahm, the reigning Masters champion, is aware it opens the gargantuan can of worms created by the departure of him and others to LIV Golf. The rebel circuit’s failure to gain official world golf ranking recognition adds a layer of complexity that Rahm has been vociferous about in the past. This time, he composes himself and gives a perfectly sensible answer.</p><p>“Let me say it this way; I think I can compete with anybody at any given time,” says Rahm. “I am going to leave it at that. I think at my best I can take on anybody. But that’s what everybody should be thinking. I think Rory

<p>Democrats have a chance to corner Republicans on an unpopular issue – and defend a modern and egalitarian society</p><p>They don’t need Congress. The anti-abortion movement is preparing to ban abortion nationwide as soon as a Republican takes the White House, and under a bizarre legal theory, they don’t think they even need congressional approval to do it. That’s because anti-choice radicals have begun to argue that an 1873 anti-obscenity law, the Comstock Act, effectively bans the mailing, sale, advertisement or distribution of any drug or implement that can be used to cause an abortion.</p><p>For a long time, this was a fringe theory, only heard in the corners of the anti-choice movement with the most misogynist zealotry and the flimsiest concerns for reason. After all, the Comstock Act has not been enforced for more than half a century: many of its original provisions, banning contraception, were overturned; other elements, banning pornography and other “obscene” material, have

<p>No duck nest was safe when Oscar was on the prowl. But one of his raids had an unexpectedly happy ending</p><p>When I first saw Oscar he seemed the most chilled puppy ever, five months old, a black labrador/something cross, lying placidly on a sofa in a foster home in Sussex. I already had a German shepherd, Phoebe, and wanted a playmate for her after losing our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puli_dog">Hungarian puli</a> to old age. I took Phoebe into the room to see how they might get on. Oscar lifted an eyelid as if to say “Whatever” and closed it again …</p><p>But when we took Oscar home, he panicked in the car and threw up. We later learned that he had been found wandering the streets of Havant in Hampshire, and we guessed perhaps he had been thrown out of a car. As a patron of the RSPCA, I am passionate about rescuing animals in need. This particular experience taught me the importance of knowing the history of the animal you are adopting so you can adapt to their need

Pollen trapped in sediment, or fossilised within rocks, can be analysed by paleoclimatologists to chart changes in vegetation and climate going back hundreds of thousands of years. It was pollen that revealed hazel to be the first of the deciduous forest trees to migrate from what is now Asia Minor and send down roots all over the place in the postglacial period. And in the mid 1990s, archaeologists found evidence of Stone Age nut processing on the Isle of Colonsay, Scotland, in the form of a pit filled with hundreds of thousands of burnt hazelnut shells (similar sites have since been found in temperate climates all over the globe). All of which to say: humans have been enjoying toasted hazelnuts for a <em>very</em> long time.</p><p>The ori

Then he found a way to catch his breath</p><p>Throughout his 30-year career as a tech professional, Ken Lunn regularly gave talks to rooms packed with experts and leaders in their fields.

Ten or 15 years ago, they seemed urbane, clever and super-confident. Even if some of it went only skin deep, they professed to be green, socially liberal and culturally switched on. Now, though, they tend to look dishevelled and saggy-eyed. After a few drinks – and sometimes before – they speak an increasingly hysterical language of conspiracy theory and political paranoia. They also seem to be furtively spending some of their time with thugs and bigots: the kind of people whom that great English social commentator Paul Weller once associate

Resembling a billowing pavilion or awning, the exterior has been transformed by a vast expanse of pink-purple striped material, embroidered with garments that tumble exuberantly down the face of the building. “The building is very masculine and I wanted something that would somehow soften it,” says Ibrahim Mahama, the Ghanaian artist behind this textile takeover.</p><p>Based in the northern city of Tamale, Mahama, 36, has gained international renown for enveloping buildings in curtains of tattered jute sacks stitched together.

What would once have been a compulsion can now be overpowered by logic and consequences. “You want to take that car for a joyride? Yes, but if I did that, I’m probably going to have to answer for it. And do I want to? Not really.” This isn’t to say that Gagne wouldn’t jump at an opportunity, if she could argue she wasn’t at fault. It happened recently, she says. Waiting for her car, parked by a valet, she was given the keys to someone else’s and drove off in it. “They handed me the keys! And then I was like” – she puts on a mock-surprised voice – “‘Oh, this is not my car.’” Her husband, when he heard, “didn’t love it”, sh
