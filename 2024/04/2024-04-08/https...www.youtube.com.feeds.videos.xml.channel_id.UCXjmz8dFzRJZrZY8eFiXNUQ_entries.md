Theres no question that both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are some of the best hour long dramas to ever hit the airwaves.  But early in Breaking Bad's production, a prior commitment for Bob Odenkirk meant that Saul Goodman wouldn't be available.  So instead Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan created the character of Mike Ehrmantraut to fill the gap.  Little did he know, Mike Ehrmantraut would be a seminal part of not only Breaking Bad but the future prequel series Better Call Saul.
