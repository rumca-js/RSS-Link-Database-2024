<p>Just a few years ago, a <em>prompt</em> was something English teachers used for homework assignments, which filled up weekends and kept students inside on sunny days. Now it seems we’re all teachers, tasked with distributing perfect prompts that direct <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709489/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> to do our bidding. These prompts are also endowed with the power to ruin weekends, but it’s not the machines that are suffering.</p><p>The power of prompts can seem downright magical. We toss off a few words that approximate a human language and, <em>voila!</em> Back comes a nicely formatted, well-structured answer to whatever question we asked. No topic is too obscure and no fact is out of our reach. At least as long as it’s part of the training corpus and approved by the model’s shadowy controllers.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3714930/how-to-talk-to-m

<p>We need to have a frank conversation about large language models (LLMs). At their core, LLMs are nothing more than sophisticated memorization machines, capable of reasonable-sounding statements, but unable to understand fundamental truth. Importantly and despite the fervent hopes of many, they are far from delivering or even prefiguring artificial general intelligence (AGI). The hype surrounding LLMs has reached stratospheric levels, fostering a misguided belief in their potential as AGI precursors.</p><p>We find ourselves at a critical juncture where the erroneous linkage between LLMs and AGI threatens to slow down—not accelerate—genuine progress in artificial intelligence. The clamor for LLMs to evolve into AGI solutions epitomizes tunnel vision at its finest. Consider the vast investments poured into training ever-larger models, yielding only marginal improvements in tasks that are not text-based. Let’s face it: LLMs are not learning how to do m

<p>Many business processes involve communicating with external parties such as suppliers, logistics providers, insurance providers, and government institutions. Unlike internal communications, these inter-organizational communications usually have to follow various regulations and standards, and could introduce delays if one party doesn’t comply.
