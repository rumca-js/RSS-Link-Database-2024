In today's Fix of entertainment news:

James Mangold's tentatively titled movie, Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi, has a new co-writer. Beau Willimon, who created Netflix's House of Cards, and wrote several episodes of the acclaimed Star Wars show, Andor, will be joining the team, co-writing the script with Mangold. The project is still a ways off, and we will likely see The Mandalorian and Grogu hit theaters first. In other news, Jonathon Nolan wants to finish Westworld after the series was canceled by HBO and left on a cliffhanger. And finally, Robert Downey, Jr. wants to come back to the MCU, saying the role is "part of DNA."

## Botany Manor Review

Botany Manor reviewed by Saniya Ahmed on PC, also available on Xbox and Nintendo Switch.

Clever clues entwine with Botany Manor’s charming old English setting to make a lighthearted first-person puzzler worth tending to. Figuring out how to grow its fantastical plants keeps you on your toes, and the blossoming flora painting onto the pages of your herbarium with bright colors provides a comforting sense of achievement. Deciphering its puzzles was more engaging than reading the notes and letters that make up its fairly one-note story, but the variety of surreal seeds with unique traits in each new area gave an exciting cadence to the somewhat repetitive act of tracking down clues. Botany Manor is a laid-back game that doesn’t ask you to do too much, simply grow some strange plants and decompress – and sometimes that’s exactly what you need.
