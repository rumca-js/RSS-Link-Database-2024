		Face image morphing is a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/adding-morph-image-to-anti-fraud-tool-defends-against-morphed-images">significant threat</a> to face biometrics applications such as border crossings and identification.

Since 2020, Europe has had a project dedicated to this threat called iMARS, focused on uncovering document fraud and image manipulation, particularly morphed face images. The research project, funded by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 program, has been working on developing algorithms for morphing attack detection (MAD) and other fraud detection tools for identity verification software.

iMARS recently held its <a href="https://imars-project.eu/imars-workshop-march-20th-2024/">second workshop</a> where it presented

		Jamaica is planning a major upgrade to its border control system, including the deployment of biometrics to air and sea ports.

The Passport, Immigration and Citizenship Agency (PICA) <a href="https://www.gojep.gov.jm/epps/cft/prepareViewCfTWS.do?resourceId=4954763">seeks</a> an integrated border management system that can be implemented this year with biometrics “such as but not limited to fingerprints, and facial recognition,” reports the <a href="https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20240405/big-biometrics-project-unfold-airports-cruise-port">Jamaica Gleaner</a>.

		Ensuring <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/proof-of-personhood">proof of personhood</a> in a secure and private way has become crucial in a decentralized environment. This is particularly important to prevent issues with bot users. TON Society and <a href="https://humancodeai.com/#/main">HumanCode</a> have collaborated to develop AI-powered palm biometrics technology to enhance digital identity verification methods for online security and user verification.

The partnership recently unveiled a $5 million incentive program at the 2024 Hong Kong Web3 Festival, designed to encourage the TON community to adopt this new standard in digital verification. As part of this initiative, TON Society announced a 1 million Toncoin incentive program to accelerate th

		Victoria is the latest Australian state to adopt mobile driver’s licenses as a valid form of digital ID. A release from the office of the Premier of Victoria, Jacinta Allan, the full rollout follows a successful six month trial of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/mobile-drivers-license-pilot-to-launch-soon-in-victoria-australia">mobile driver’s licenses</a> in the city of Ballarat, and will mean that more than 4.5 million of Victoria’s drivers can switch from physical ID cards to digital licenses. At first, only fully licensed drivers, motorcyclists, or large vehicle operators will be eligible, but the program will expand to cover learners by 2025.

		Americans recognize the challenge of securing their social safety net, as shown in a <a href="https://www.govtech.com/magazines/fighting-benefits-fraud-requires-a-holistic-approach-to-id-verification">GovTech</a> article touting a holistic approach to the problem. What exactly that means appears to remain a source of some confusion.

The article notes the role of facial recognition, and that biometrics can “establish physical proof of a person’s identity.” It also notes the potential of digital IDs like mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs), AI anomaly detection and best practices. It also suggests fingerprints and voice biometrics could be part of the picture, a strange claim given that there is no obvious reference database of Americans’ voice biometrics to compa

		India's advances in digital modernization have taken an enormous rise with the advent of digital public infrastructure (DPI), known as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/india-ups-investment-in-digital-public-infrastructure-plans-digilocker-extension">India Stack</a>, composed to overhaul the country’s landscape. The <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/digital-public-infrastructure-developing-world">foundation</a> of India’s DPI in 2009 in the form of the India Stack marked a key moment in India’s mission for digital inclusion.

		The UK government has released guidelines on how to make the GOV.UK ID Check app is more accessible. The document gives instructions on how to implement Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 both for Android and iOS apps.

The GOV.UK ID Check allows users to confirm their identity while signing into government services with the country’s single-sign-on system <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/one-login">One Login</a>. It works by matching the users’ faces to their photo IDs. The app was released last year by the Government Digital Service (GDS) office.

		The UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has released a new strategy for its Children’s code, aimed at protecting the data of minors who use social media and introducing stronger age assurance tools.

“Children’s privacy must not be traded in the chase for profit,” says Information Commissioner John Edwards in a news release outlining the regulator’s priorities for the next year. “How companies design their online services and use <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202401/age-verification-laws-in-the-uk-and-us-reassessed">children’s personal information</a> have a significant impact on what young people see and experience in the digital world.”

		The United States and the European Union are continuing to work on making technical standards for digital identity compatible. Following a Trade and Technology Council (TTC) ministerial meeting in Leuven, Belgium last week, the two sides released a joint statement, detailing the progress that has been made and outlining future steps.

“The next phase of this project will focus on identifying potential use cases for transatlantic interoperability and cooperation with a view toward enabling the cross-border use of digital identities and wallets,” the statement says.

According to the ministers, the cooperation mechanism, which seeks to align the U.S. and EU on technology and trade policy, has led to tangible results over the past two years. Among them is the <a href="https://futu

		Malaysia’s digital identity project MyDigital ID is postponing enrollment for the public until May. That same month, financial institutions, including banks, insurance firms and wallet companies will be able to use the digital ID for eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer) and authorizing transactions.

Its rollout was originally planned for March but although the system is ready, delays have been introduced to allow integration with more websites and mobile apps. The digital ID is currently being integrated with government agency platforms, according to My Digital ID Sdn Bhd, the company managing the project and a subsidiary of the Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic Systems (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/mimos">Mimos</a>).

		The Philippines Statistics Authority (PSA) has cleared the air that the country’s national ID database suffered no leaks following a recent alarm which turned out to be false.

This is in response to an alarm raised a by cybersecurity group, Deep Web Konek, that the database of the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) had been breached, putting the ID data of millions of ID registrants at risk.

In a statement issued April 4, the PSA Undersecretary and National Statistician and Civil Registrar General, Claire Dinnis Mapa, said the report was untrue and called for calm and vigilance.

“The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) monitored posts on social media about an alleged data leak in the National ID system. As the central authority on official statistic

		A piece of legislation which sets out a robust legal template for data protection in Ethiopia has got the nod of the country’s federal House of Representatives.

According to local media reports, the Personal Data Protection Proclamation (PDPP) was passed on April 4.

Ethiopia’s National ID Program (NIDP) hailed the move in a <a href="https://twitter.com/IDethiopia/status/1775831643707613602?t=ApDkcPHtTo4tdEZqp_-mVQ&amp;s=19">post on X</a>, calling it “an important step” that sets up the country on the part of better safeguarding the data privacy of citizens and ensuring international compliance as it looks to swell up its digital ID issuance numbers.
