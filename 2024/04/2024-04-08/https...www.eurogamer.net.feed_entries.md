Balatro, the acclaimed poker-themed roguelike from developer LocalThunk, has just received its first big content update - officially known as Update 1.0.1c - with the patch currently in Steam public testing ahead of a full release "in about a week".
</p><p>
Update 1.0.1c, as per some sizeable patch notes shared on Balatro's official Discord channel (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1byktoa/101c_experimental_branch_is_live_on_steam/">via Reddit</a>), promises "a lot of changes", with LocalThunk explaining they're opting to have an extended public test "to ensure everything is working smoothly before pushing it live for real".
</p><p>
There're a couple of bug fixes and a lot of balance changes to be found in the patch notes, with some cards getting buffs while others see their effects and rules of play tweaked -

Staff members at UK high street video game giant GAME have been told to expect redundancies, Eurogamer undertands, as the company moves most employees to zero hours contracts.
</p><p>
GAME already employed newer junior staff members, referred to as "cast members", on zero hours contracts. Eurogamer understands the chain will now employ most non-managerial staff with zero hours contracts going forwards. 
</p><p>
Multiple staff members speaking to Eurogamer under condition of anonymity today confirmed the changes, and said the move to make zero hours contacts standard across the business was not unexpected. Eurogamer has contacted GAME for comment.

Processing fees, for example. Drain flies that flit around your face before dive-bombing your beer can. Likewise, "influencers" - TikTok creators, YouTubers, and other hair-gelled 22-year-olds - tend to inspire bone-deep resentment, which could be why Content Warning doesn't mind tossing them into a horror game.</p><p>But, unlike your displeasure with dumb flies, influencer fatigue also tends to ripple with jealousy: "Why don't I have one bajillion followers?" you might find yourself wondering at weak moments, when work feels particularly crushing.

## DF Weekly: re-assessing benchmarking and PC gaming coverage

Another Monday, another episode of DF Direct Weekly. Myself, John Linneman and Alex Battaglia battle our way through the topics of the week, including initial reactions to the Hellblade 2 previews from last week - but what I want to talk about here is how Alex spent his time last week. Within this week's Direct, you'll see his tests with Intel's PresentMon 2.0, which may well change the face of PC benchmarking... to a certain degree, at least.
</p><p>
PresentMon forms the basis of just about every reputable benchmarking tool out there. Intel pioneered it and adds new features (more about that shortly) but it's used by the likes of CapFrameX, AMD OCAT and even Nvidia FrameView. All of them mix and match various features but it's PresentMon at the core of it, which makes the latest additions interesting. We first caught si

The Sonic the Hedgehog films are aiming to be "Avengers-level events".
</p><p>
That's according to Sonic franchise producer Toby Ascher, who spoke to <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/animation/animated-series-news-april-2024-ark-the-animated-series-fright-krewe-kaiju-no-8-knuckles-sonic">Paste</a> about the decision to create the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knuckles-tv-spin-off-gets-new-trailer-and-release-date">forthcoming Knuckles TV show spin-off</a>, starring Idris Elba.

"We got really excited about the idea of expanding our characters in our world into television, specifically, because it gives us a platform to really do character studies," he said.

Palia developer Singularity 6 has laid off 35 percent of its staff just months after the game entered early access.
</p><p>
Workers from the studio began sharing news of layoffs at the end of last week, which Singularity 6 then confirmed in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palia-dev-lays-off-35-percent-of-workers-for-long-term-stability">IGN</a>.
</p><p>
"Following Palia's release on Steam, we evaluated the support needed to deliver the highest-quality gameplay service for long-term stability," reads the statement. "We made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce, which impacted around 35 percent of our talented and hardworking team members. We value their contributions and are committed to supporting them throughout this process, including severance, work-placement and career guidance assistance, an

Over the weekend, intrepid Helldivers accomplished what perhaps once seemed unimaginable: eradicating all bots in Helldivers 2. Combined with the news that all those Terminind bugs are now "contained", to use developer Arrowhead's words, the feeling among players is one of celebration. Right? We beat Helldivers 2?
</p><p>
Indeed, in a <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1777058473311625238">post</a> on social media platform X, the Helldivers 2 team proclaimed the "galaxy is free once more", which surely means we can all breathe a sweet sigh of relief.

Yuji Naka, co-creator of Sonic the Hedgehog, has returned to social media after an extended hiatus to accuse Dragon Quest producer Yu Miyake of lying during Naka's insider trading trial last year.
</p><p>
In March 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-sonic-boss-yuji-naka-admits-insider-trading-reports">Naka pleaded guilty to insider trading</a> following his arrest in November 2022. He was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-co-creator-yuji-naka-gets-prison-sentence-for-insider-trading">sentenced to two-and-a-half years in jail</a> and multiple fines totalling just under &pound;1m; he was later given a suspended sentence.
</p><p>
Now, Naka has posted on social media platform X in response to the news that Miyake is leaving his position as Dragon Quest series producer as part of a reshuffle at Square Enix. Miyake w

Larian, the developer behind hit role-player Baldur's Gate 3, has said it will likely follow the same early access release model for its unannounced next project. 
</p><p>
In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/baldurs-gate-iii-interview-michael-douse">GameFile</a>, Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse said early access was "the only way to do it now" to ensure the project grows alongside and in response to player feedback.
</p><p>
"This is the only way to do it now, especially if you consider the fact that the whole point of this stuff is to create social resonance, to create a situation where you have a constant dialogue with the players," Douse said.
