The net decrease in the state comes as Amazon builds up its workforce in downtown Bellevue, but sees its overall employment decline at its main headquarters campus north of downtown Seattle. Meanwhile, the company is continuing to expand its employee base in Virginia, home to Amazon&#8217;s second headquarters.

Researchers at the University of Washington and Seattle biotech startup AltPep are building on a track record of success with their latest publication. Their study used 265 blood plasma samples from two different organizations and tested them in two different laboratories by different personnel.
