<p>We knew it was coming, but that doesn’t <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-will-shut-down-most-wii-u-and-3ds-online-services-by-april-8-150807925.html"><ins>make it any easier to say goodbye</ins></a>. Nintendo shut down the online servers for both the Wii U and 3DS today. This means the end of online multiplayer gaming for both consoles, turning <em>Mario Kart 7</em> for 3DS and the original <em>Splatoon</em> for the Wii U into single player or couch co-op experiences. The first <em>Super Mario Maker</em> is also effectively dead, as there’s no way to browse for and download player-created levels.</p>
<p>Both consoles are relatively controversial. The 3DS was originally considered a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-03-21-nintendo-3ds-review.html"><ins>lukewarm follow-up to the barn-busting DS</ins></a>, though it eventually <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-30-nintendo-3ds-reader-review-roundup.html"><ins>became a success in its own right</ins></a>. This was

<p><em>Fly Me To The Moon</em> is an upcoming comedy-drama from Columbia Pictures and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple-tv-plus/">Apple</a> that goes behind the scenes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nasa/">NASA</a> trying to improve its image while preparing for the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon. A  trailer makes it seem like a lighthearted, fun time at the movies, though conspiracy theorists may have a field day with one of the key plot points.</p>
<p>Scarlett Johansson plays Kelly Jones, a PR expert who NASA brings in to improve public perception ahead of the launch. Along with butting heads with launch director Cole Davis (Channing Tatum) and turning the crew into global celebrities, Kelly is handed a particularly difficult task: to secretly create a fake version of the Moon landing, just in case the mission goes sideways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Google has <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-find-my-device">finally launched its long-awaited</a> Find My Device network after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-googles-io-keynote-here-at-1pm-et-160030971.html"><ins>teasing it at last year’s I/O event</ins></a>. The technology leverages a crowdsourced network of over a billion Android devices to help people locate lost gadgets, with a basic functionality in line with similar offerings from Apple and Tile. It’s rolling out today to Android users in the US and Canada, with a global release coming soon.</p>
<p>Once installed, people can use the app to locate compatible Android phones and tablets. The tool will cause them to ring at your command and their location will pop up on a map. This map data works even if the items are offline. Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro smartphones will appear on the map if they’re powered off or if the battery is completely dead. That sounds pretty handy.</p>

When you toss a battery grip into the mix, the company says you'll get over five hours of continuous 4K recording at 30 frames per second (depending on conditions). That's bound to be pretty enticing for those who like to capture as much footage as they can during a day of action sports or travel vlogging.

<p>Apple, in its latest update to its App Store developer guidelines for iPhones and iPads, flagged by <em>9to5Mac</em>, says it will allow <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-officially-allows-retro-game-emulators-on-the-app-store-130044937.html">game console emulators</a> – and even downloadable games.</p>
<p>Apple warns developers, however, they “are responsible for all such software offered in [their] app, including ensuring that such software complies with these Guidelines and all applicable laws.” So don’t expect to play <em>Super Mario, Spyro,</em> or a third game series that starts with an 'S'.</p>

<p>I’ve always preferred the glow of multiple lamps to the onslaught of overhead lights, but clicking them off one by one can get tedious. With smart plugs, any lamp can be controlled with a phone, your voice or even a programmed schedule or routine so you don’t have to think about them at all. Smart plugs also work with some appliances like basic coffee makers, fans, humidifiers and other items that have a simple on/off switch. Smart plugs all look pretty similar — a white rectangle with rounded corners —  but as we've learned in our testing, they don’t all perform the same. We tested over a dozen models for both indoors and out to find ones that are easy to set up and perform reliably within your chosen smart home ecosystem so you can pick the best smart plug for you.</p>
<h2>What to consider when buying a smart plug</h2>
<p>Before you buy one, it helps to know how a smart plug works best. They are designed for things that have an on/off switch, making them great for turning lamps i
