Buy one on Amazon: https://lon.tv/frndly (compensated affiliate link) - Frndly TV is a super low cost TV streaming service that brings a very limited bundle of cable television channels like History, A&amp;E and Lifetime. It's a nice way to supplement a cord cutting strategy where your line up is pieced together with OTA options.
