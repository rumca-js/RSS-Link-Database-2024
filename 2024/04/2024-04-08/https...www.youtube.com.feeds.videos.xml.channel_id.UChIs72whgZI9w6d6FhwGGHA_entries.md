Hardware news this week recaps a one-sentence AMD Zen 5 rumor that set the internet ablaze, a one-page shipping manifest containing Intel Arc Battlemage that also set the internet ablaze, ASUS' new Mjolnir not-a-joke battery bank, SSD prices climbing with flash contract price increases, Intel's $7B loss and some fuzzy accounting math, and more! Busy week!
