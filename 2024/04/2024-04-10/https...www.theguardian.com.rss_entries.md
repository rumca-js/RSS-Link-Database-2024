<p>Axel Witsel had said that Atlético Madrid had to play as if there was no second leg and for much of a noisy night at the Metropolitano, it seemed his side might make good on that approach, effectively ending the tie here. Instead, having dominated the first half and taken a 2-0 lead, then defended it the way they used to, keeping Borussia Dortmund at a safe distance and creating chances to have scored a third, an 81st-minute goal from Sébastian Haller means everything is still in play in six days’ time.</p><p>It might have been even more on a knife edge too, Julian Brandt hitting the bar with the very last touch of a noisy night. Ultimately, Rodrigo De Paul and Samuel Lino’s goals were just enough, and when Diego Simeone comes to analyse this, he will at least take comfort from the fact that they have a lead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/10/samuel-lino-gives-atletico-lead-but-sebastien-haller-offers-dortmund-hope">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s back! The BBC’s smartphone-free travel sends contestants racing from Japan to Indonesia, and it’s as full of human kindness and intimate relationship portraits as ever</p><p>Race Across the World might be one of television’s most wholesome shows. Now into its fourth series proper, after a Covid-delayed celebrity spin-off last year, it follows paired teams as they attempt to travel thousands of miles without some of the comfortable trappings of modern life. Contestants hand over their smartphones and bank cards and are given the cash equivalent of the cost of a one-way flight to their final destination. They must get to the end through a series of checkpoints using public transport and ingenuity, taking on odd jobs to earn extra funds, and, crucially, relying on the kindness of strangers along the way.</p><p>Since it made its debut in 2019, the series has grown in popularity, and by 2023, moved from its original BBC Two home to BBC One, much like Bake Off and Peaky Blinders bef

The confirmation in 2012 of the existence of the Higgs boson particle, five decades after Higgs had first theorised its existence, paved the way for his 2013 Nobel win. Nicknamed ‘the god particle’ the Higgs boson was part of an attempt to explain why the building blocks of the Universe have mass.

But there is one more thing I need to share. I’ve had many nice texts and emails from friends close and distant over the last few weeks since my dad died. Here’s one that I stared at for a long time. It came from a woman I’ve known for 50 years, since we were kids on holiday at the seaside. Our families had neighbouring caravans on the same site on the Gower peninsula way back in the last century. Our parents were close friends; three of the four of them are no longer with us. Actually, “no longer with us” is a truly crap phrase. I will not be using it again. Those we love are forever with us, obviously. Anyway, this is what she wrote. She speaks, by the way, in that astoundingly sing-song variant of the south Walian accent spoken by p

As the Fender Stratocaster turns 70, we explore its extraordinary life</p><p>‘I found the cheapest Strat in all the shops,” says Nile Rodgers, speaking to me from Miami Beach, the very place he went trawling for what would later be regarded as the world’s greatest electric guitar. “I traded in my Gibson Barney Kessel. The guy behind the counter gave me the Strat – and $300 back. It was the real runt of the litter.”</p><p>In a nod to the model played by his hero Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock in 1969, Rodgers stripped the guitar and painted it Olympic white. He then locked himself in his bathroom for three days – “woodshedding” he calls it – until he’d mastered “chucking”, a dazzling new technique that blended offbeat strumming with the muting of fretted notes. It’s a style made for the Strat’s rich percussive qualities and slick feel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music

The disc leans a little to the right of the square sheet of paper that contains it, as if it had been nudged out of alignment by some unseen gravitational force. Measuring its diameter with my arms outstretched, I’m eluded by the scale and exact position of the circle, and it seems to be pulling me off-kilter.

In her new memoir, humour is applied to just about anything, from single motherhood to a failed gastric band to sex work (as a naive 19-year-old, Lederer worked in a massage parlour and worried about whether talc or oil should go on first, and whether using too much of each might create “some kind of clay vase”). Pain and laughter are never far from each other. A recent example: at an event with other famous guests, Lederer counted three or four people moving away from her in search of – what? – someone more important, perhaps. She finds it, she says, “quite hurtful, but also funny. What is it about me? Is it because they feel s

<p>Californians are suing the brand after thwarted attempts to buy the coveted items – a process said to require more than money</p><p>“Hell hath no fury like a wealthy person being told no,” says Alex Pardoe, a Hermès superfan and TikTok creator, recalling the many times he has seen “grown men and women having five-star meltdowns” within the otherwise fragrant environs of the Hermès flagship store in Paris.</p><p>These tantrums, says Pardoe, are always sparked by the same conflict: a rich person walks in, asks to buy a Hermès Birkin – fashion’s most high-status handbag, which costs $10,000 or more – and is told that none are available. This happens a lot, because Birkins, according to luxury handbag lore, are not mere products to be sold over the counter like cans of baked beans. Buying a Birkin takes more than money, so the received wisdom says: deliveries are limited and sales associates will earmark them for their favourite clients.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion

<p>Striker sees parallels between run to the final four years ago and his current club’s European adventure amid domestic woe</p><p>Harry Kane emerged from the Emirates with the look of a man who had enjoyed himself. “I think they have a soft respect for me, the Arsenal fans,” he laughed, a glimmer of mischief crossing the striker’s face as he remembered the cacophony that had accompanied his every move upon returning to enemy territory.

## Hagstone by Sinéad Gleeson review – portrait of an artist

<p>Strange happenings haunt an Irish island in this debut about an artist’s isolated existence</p><p>To write fiction about art is notoriously hard. Inventing bad art is easy, an excellent parlour game, but to imagine a successful artist you have to create a body of work that justifies their success, and that’s a&nbsp;different matter. In Hagstone, Irish critic and essayist Sinéad Gleeson’s first novel, this is done deftly and convincingly. The book centres on Nell, an artist living and working on an&nbsp;island a half day’s journey from the&nbsp;Irish mainland. Her work includes sand sculptures and sound pieces; underwater statues; a hypothetical project involving a lighthouse – all of&nbsp;which, as Gleeson explains in an afterword, were inspired by the work of real artists. This plausibility is vital because it underpins Nell’s character: we have to believe in her work to believe in her, and in her choice to put this work at the centre of her life. The result of Gleeson’s care is a

There were catalysts – the mutation of a long-term romantic relationship into a deep friendship, the sense of fracturing and fractiousness that beset the UK after the referendum in 2016 – but there was also a more gradual realignment of priorities, a slow realisation that there may be a different and more generative way to live.</p><p>Maybe it started when Smillie rescued Isean from a boatyard in the west of Scotland, the vessel’s graceful lines blinding her to the thousands of&nbsp;pounds that would be needed for restoration.

<p>The village life of a 10-year-old girl is disrupted by a newcomer in a tale of youthful mystery and shifting emotions</p><p>For the past 20 years, Suzannah Dunn has been known for historical novels focusing on the Tudors., such as 2004’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview17">The Queen of Subtleties</a> and 2010’s The Confession of Katherine Howard. Yet for many readers it is her earlier books that retain a unique hold: critically acclaimed contemporary novels and a volume of short stories mostly featuring young women at a crisis point in their lives (a theme that can, of course, be equally applied to her court dramas of Anne Boleyn or Lady Jane Grey). Brilliantly articulated and often piercingly sad, Dunn’s characters find themselves caught up in what may today be termed quarter-life crises – they are unsettled, dissatisfied; prone to despair, to jealousy, to falling unsuitably in love, to deep, unnavigable loss. There is Elizabeth

I had it circled as one to enjoy. Perhaps if it were warm, I would have a dip in Lac de Ninu, douse the fires in my calves. But when hail came, adding spikes to a slapping wind, and thunder began beating a drum behind the blank grey horizon, I thought: “Better put more layers on than take off.” I struggle with the zips, but just about find enough digital strength without resorting to anything unsanitary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/apr/10/my-hike-on-the-hardest-trail-

<p>Reconstructing the US senate investigation that followed the disaster, this was made with a tiny fraction of James Cameron’s budget but has an authentic feel</p><p>It’s been over a century since the RMS Titanic disaster, and while all manner of catastrophes have happened since, somehow this one haunts the imagination of storytellers and historians. You could blame James Cameron for making the blockbuster Titanic in 1997, but clearly that film was a symptom not a cause. Maybe it’s the scale of tragedy, the huge numbers of dead, or the adjacent fact that so many of them died senselessly because there weren’t enough lifeboats and the upper-class passengers were packed on to what boats there were before the tired, huddled masses travelling below deck could even get close.</p><p>Made on a limited budget that probably wouldn’t have covered the cost of supplying the crew with biscuits for Cameron’s epic, this dramatised feature tries to explore what was so significant, shocking and singul
