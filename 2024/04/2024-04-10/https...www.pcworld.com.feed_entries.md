<p>Some of the best AI editing tools Google Photos offers, including Magic Eraser, are coming to Chromebooks &mdash; no subscription required. But PCs are apparently being left out in the cold.</p>



<p>Google has traditionally launched new features on its Pixel phones. Those have included <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2091017/google-pixel-8-best-take-ai-photo-tool.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2300916-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Magic Eraser</a>, along with Photo Unblur and Portrait Light, which use various AI tricks to spruce up your photos. Portrait Light, for example, can &ldquo;reposition&rdquo; the sun to light up your photo in a more attractive way, and Magic Eraser can simply zap an unwanted object from your picture.</p>

## Broadband ‘nutrition labels’ kick in, revealing hidden fees for ISPs

<p>New FCC &ldquo;broadband nutrition labels&rdquo; go into effect beginning today, forcing ISPs to disclose all of the normally hidden costs and speeds.</p>



<p>And yes, the term &ldquo;nutrition label&rdquo; is accurate &mdash; they&rsquo;re modeled after the list of ingredients you might find on a box of cereal, say, along with a breakdown of what you&rsquo;re being charged. Those labels must be posted on the websites of ISPs as well as in retail stores. The labels also cover both wired and wireless broadband plans, so you should see them, for example, in a Verizon store.</p>



<p>The idea is to allow consumers to know just exactly what they&rsquo;ll receive when they sign up for broadband service &mdash; and what they&rsquo;ll be charged for, too. The new labels won&rsquo;t eliminate the fees that are sometimes hidden in a customer&rsquo;s bill &mdash; they&r

<p>Windows is getting pretty heavy in terms of memory, to say nothing of frequently-used applications like Chrome. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s hard for us to recommend any new Windows machine, even a deal, with just 8GB of memory. Fortunately, Lenovo is selling a new ThinkPad laptop with a generous 16GB of RAM <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/176251332440?itmmeta=01HV39ZG7KA5FM13HDXDT8AD9X&amp;&amp;xcust=2-1-2300824-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">for just $364.99</a>. The refurbished deal is over on eBay. </p>



<p>Normally, we&rsquo;d hesitate to feature a refurbished item as a deal, but this one has a couple of extenuating circumstances. First, it&rsquo;s being sold directly from Lenovo, so it&rsquo;s truly &ldquo;certified refurbished&rdquo; and not just a used laptop with a st

<p>On Patch Tuesday on April 9, 2024, Microsoft provided several security updates to fix 147 vulnerabilities. Microsoft classifies three vulnerabilities in Microsoft Defender for IoT as critical and classifies all but two of the other vulnerabilities as high risk. According to Microsoft, none of the vulnerabilities have been exploited for attacks to date. However, this could change at any time. Trend Micro has also spotted ZDI exploit code in the wild.</p>



<p>Microsoft offers sparse details on the vulnerabilities for self-searching in its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/&amp;xcust=2-1-2300786-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">security update guide</a>.

<p>There&rsquo;s a technological oddity floating around the social network formerly known as Twitter. On first glance this motherboard looks like a standard Asus ROG Maximus XIII Hero, a popular choice for high-end gaming builds. But peer a little closer and you&rsquo;ll notice that the long desktop DIMM slots for the RAM have been replaced with teeny tiny SO-DIMM slots for laptop RAM. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s not all. Despite the ROG branding for Asus&rsquo; top-of-the-line gaming hardware, it&rsquo;s clearly using a TUF-branded CPU cover, indicating that it&rsquo;s from a cheaper Asus line. It&rsquo;s also missing some of the ROG heatsink gear, replaced with generic alternatives. And when <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/wxnod/status/1777357353265877234&amp;xcust=2-1-2300651-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/

<p>Google&rsquo;s Nest thermostat is something of a godsend. Not only does it keep your humble abode feeling nice and comfortable, but it&rsquo;s also incredibly easy to install and it monitors your HVAC system, which is useful if anything goes haywire. I&rsquo;ve got one in my house and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with it. This little device saves me a good amount of money in heating and cooling costs. If you&rsquo;re looking to pick one up, good news!

But you won&rsquo;t find one of its models in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/835195/best-wireless-gaming-keyboards.html">equivalent gaming keyboard roundup</a>, because it tends to demand a high price without delivering in hardware.

<p>The motherboard is one of the centerpieces of every PC &mdash; for better or worse. Motherboard problems can affect a variety of components and are not always easy to diagnose.</p>



<p>One of the first signs of a possible motherboard problem is the failure of the POST (Power On Self Test), which is carried out when the computer is started. A failed POST may indicate a faulty motherboard. However, it is difficult to determine the exact cause. </p>



<p>Errors such as &ldquo;Inaccessible Boot Device,&rdquo; defective RAM, or other component errors are possible. Some systems use special acoustic signals to identify which component is causing a problem. You can look up the exact signals online or in the motherboard manual. </p>
