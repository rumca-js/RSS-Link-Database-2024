Powwow singer Joe Rainey performed three tracks from the critically acclaimed 2022 record Niineta at The Current. With support from producer Andrew Broder, the two mix orchestral and experimental electronic soundscapes with gorgeous native chanting. Local Show host Diane talked with Rainey, a Minneapolis native now based in Wisconsin, about the inspiration for this unique collaboration, as well as his aspirations to uplift and amplify Native culture.
