The spike protein exhibits pathogenic characteristics

Multiple studies have shown an increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

mRNA vaccines can result in spike protein expression in

Muscle tissue

Lymphatic system

Cardiomyocytes

Other cells after entry into the circulation.

There is concern that COVID-19 vaccination per se might contribute to long COVID, 

giving rise to the colloquial term ‘Long Vax(x)’

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits pathogenic characteristics and is a possible cause of post-acute sequelae,

after SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination. 

COVID-19 vaccines utilise a modified, stabilised prefusion spike protein that might share similar toxic effects with its viral counterpart.
