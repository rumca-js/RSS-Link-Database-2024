Over 12 million people worldwide suffer from a chronic infection with the hepatitis D virus. This most severe viral liver disease is associated with a high risk of dying from liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which uses the surface proteins of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a vehicle to specifically enter liver cells via a protein in the cell membrane -- the bile salt transporter protein NTCP.

## 3D mouth of an ancient jawless fish suggests they were filter-feeders, not scavengers or hunters
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/04/240410112736.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/04/240410112736.htm)

Early jawless fish were likely to have used bony projections surrounding their mouths to modify the mouth's shape while they collected food. Experts have used CT scanning techniques to build up the first 3D pictures of these creatures, which are some of the earliest vertebrates (animals with backbones) in which the mouth is fossilized. Their aim was to answer questions about feeding in early vertebrates without jaws in the early Devonian epoch -- sometimes called the Age of Fishes -- around 400 million years ago.

Now, researchers have constructed a waterproof 'e-glove' that wirelessly transmits hand gestures made underwater to a computer that translates them into messages. The new technology could someday help divers communicate better with each other and with boat crews on the surface.

Those with CLTI often suffer severe pain even at rest, caused by fatty plaque buildup obstructing blood flow, typically to the leg or foot.
