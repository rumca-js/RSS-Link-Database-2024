Here, we'll continue exploring our new stack while cleaning up and abstracting the example application's data access layer and adding more complex HTMX interactions. We'll also add another component to the tech stack: Pug, a popular JavaScript template engine that works well with HTMX and helps with configuring DOM interactions.</p><h2 class="toc">The example application</h2>
<p>Our example application currently consists of a form and a table. The form lets users enter quotes along with their authors, which can then be searched and displayed using the application's user interface. I've added a bit of CSS to the interface to make it look more modern than what we left off wit
