		The Open Source Face Image Quality (OFIQ) assessment software library and the Draft International Standard it is a reference implementation for are now available on <a href="https://github.com/BSI-OFIQ/OFIQ-Project">GitHub</a>.

OFIQ can be used to identify images that will be difficult for face biometrics systems to process due to low image quality.

<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/81005.html">ISO/IEC 29794-5</a> is the standard for face image data within the biometric sample quality family of standards.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/pindrop">Pindrop</a> has won the Voice Cloning Challenge run by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), along with three smaller organizations.

The challenge results were announced just as investors in India were viewing recommendations on stock purchases that appeared to be from National Stock Exchange (NSE) CEO and MD Ashishkumar Chauhan. The fraudulent video, shared on social media, faked both the face and voice of Chauhan and the NSE logo. The NSE has issued a <a href="https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/web/sites/default/files/2024-04/PR_cc_10042024.pdf">public caution</a> about the deepfake reminding investors of the sources for legitimate information.

		UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak today announced a major new investment in facial recognition technology as part of a wider crackdown on retail crime.

“To the shoplifters and those abusing shopworkers, enough is enough,” says a release from the Home Office, which specifies that assaulting a retail worker is to be made a standalone criminal offense.

The £55.5 million (US$69.5 million) to be spent on <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/uks-230-million-plan-to-implement-police-facial-recognition-and-drones">facial recognition technology</a> over the next four years includes £4m for “bespoke mobile units that can be deployed to high streets across the country with live facial recognition used in crowded areas to identify people wanted by the police – including

		A variety of approaches to age verification were on display during Day 2 of the <a href="https://events.ringcentral.com/events/global-age-assurance-standards-summit/registration">Global Age Assurance Standards Summit</a>. Presenters representing regulatory bodies from different countries wrestled with questions about what age assurance is, what it is not, and how to balance the digital rights of kids with safeguards designed to keep them away from adult content.

In her keynote, “Towards Global Regulatory Standards for Age Assurance,” children’s digital rights activist <a href="https://beeban.com/">Beeban Tania Kidron</a> makes a salient point about why age assurance is not widely implemented, despite being an easy lift.

“It’s always felt to me rather pathetic, that an indu
