  <p id="jbKzSD">Finding files on your Mac drive can get tricky — especially when you’re not sure exactly what it is you’re looking for. Apple being Apple, file management “just works” most of the time, but that’s not always the case if you need to hunt down something that’s buried deep.</p>

If neither of those work, you’ve got third-party tools you can turn to as well. (If you can’t find what you’re looking for after you’ve exhausted all of those options, it might be time to admit that the file isn’t actually there.)</

  <p id="9iQu5R">Rakuten Kobo is launching its first color e-readers, the Kobo Libra Colour and the Kobo Clara Colour. Both use E Ink’s latest Kaleido color screen technology, which has subtle, pastel-like hues and drops from a 300ppi grayscale resolution to 150ppi when you view content in color.</p>

<p id="FtGZCG">I’ll be testing both e-readers soon, but so far, they look like small upgrades to Kobo’s existing e-readers. That’s not a bad thing, though! The seven-inch Kobo Libra 2 is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23769068/best-ebook-readers">my favorite e-rea

  <p id="I5KDxJ">You might know the broad strokes of the Joker and Harley Quinn’s twisted romance from <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> and other DC projects. But the first trailer for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/4/23291705/joker-sequel-folie-a-deux-todd-phillips-joaquin-phoenix-october-2024"><em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em></a><em> </em>makes it seem like director Todd Phillips is doing something very different with his musical take on the characters.</p>
<p id="YfxnIB">Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is still locked up in Arkham in <em>Folie à Deux</em>’s new trailer, and it seems as if the events from the previous film have led to his being put under an increased amount of supervision. The Asylum looks like a lonely, bleak place as Arthur’s m

  <p id="IMLe30">Cruise has announced that it’s resuming tests for its fleet of self-driving taxis in Phoenix, Arizona , though not with passengers just yet. The autonomous vehicle maker says it will start with humans behind the wheel, with no passengers and no autonomous driving mechanisms engaged.</p>
