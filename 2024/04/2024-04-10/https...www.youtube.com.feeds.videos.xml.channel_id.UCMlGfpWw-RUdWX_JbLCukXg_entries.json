The data loader aggregates data streams from different sources and of different kinds of data, orders it by timestamp, and feeds it to an offline test harness concurrently and without locking.  \n---\n\nGlenn Philen\n\nToday I work remotely for Invisible AI, a computer vision company, and study Computer Science at Georgia Tech. Prior to this I worked on computer vision projects at Carnegie Mellon and in finance. \n---\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com\nYouTube Channel Managed by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\n---\n\nRegistration for CppCon: https://cppcon.org/registration/\n\n#cppcon #cppprogramming #cpp #dataloader", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsERMD9jUNE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "source_obj__id": 420, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/rsERMD9jUNE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lightning Talk: A Fast, Concurrent Data Loader for Time-Series Data - Glenn Philen - CppCon 2023", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
