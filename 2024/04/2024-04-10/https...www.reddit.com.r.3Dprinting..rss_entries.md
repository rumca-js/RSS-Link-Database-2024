## What to do with an old Gen 1 Ender 3 printer?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like the title says. I've got an old Ender 3 printer just taking up space. It's too old to try and upgrade so I'm looking for ideas on what to do with it besides stripping it down for parts to use on my other Creality printers. Steppers...switches...belts, I can reuse all of that but I'd rather do something creative with it rather than turn it into spare parts because the unit still works fine. It's just old and slow. </p> <p>So if you've got any ideas on a project I can undertake with it, I'd love the input. Not something that'll cost a lot as my basic motive is not to dump a bunch of money into this machine, however I'd love some ideas on ways to upcycle this little robot. I'll mod the hell out of it but I won't spend money on it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/antagonizerz"> /u/antagonizerz </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1c0k8w3/what_to_do_with_an_old_g
