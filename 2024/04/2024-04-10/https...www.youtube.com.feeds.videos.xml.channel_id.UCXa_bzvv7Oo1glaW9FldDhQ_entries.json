Inkbound is from Shiny Shoe and sees players battle against the Blight using different classes known as Aspects.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but allows for moving freely on the battlefield, adjusting for the trajectory of enemy attacks. Vestiges provide passive effects, but you can also break them down to aid in set bonuses. If that weren't enough, there's also online multiplayer, which works seamlessly and lends to rethinking your approach to battles.\n\nInkbound isn't perfect and has minor issues, whether it's the same flow through environments or certain bosses at higher difficulties. However, it's a compelling rogue-like RPG with enough variety and depth to keep you invested.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxsiHkhahl8", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/rxsiHkhahl8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Inkbound Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-10T15:30:19+00:00", "description": "With Summer approaching, news \u2013 official and otherwise \u2013 is beginning to roll in about upcoming showcases and events, and though Sony has yet to officially announce one of its own, recent leaks have suggested that a PlayStation Showcase could be lined up for May. \n\nIf that is indeed what Sony has planned, it needs to ensure that it brings out the big guns.
