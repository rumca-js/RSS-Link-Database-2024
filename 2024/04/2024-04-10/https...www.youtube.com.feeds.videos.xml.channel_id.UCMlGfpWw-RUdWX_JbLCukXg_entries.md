Lightning Talk: A Fast, Concurrent Data Loader for Time-Series Data - Glenn Philen - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

In this talk I briefly share the design of a high performance data loader used to iterating over time series data stored on disk across many individual files. The data loader aggregates data streams from different sources and of different kinds of data, orders it by timestamp, and feeds it to an offline test harness concurrently and without locking.
