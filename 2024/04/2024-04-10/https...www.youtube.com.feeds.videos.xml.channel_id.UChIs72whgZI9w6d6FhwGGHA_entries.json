This video goes deep with acoustics engineering as it relates to thermal design, so we talk about finding and identifying coil whine with lasers, fan blade design and engineering, critical bands and one-third octave bands for data presentation, and tone-to-noise prominence ratio. The discussion also gets into psychoacoustics and the structure of the inner ear.\n\nWatch our engineering interview with Noctua previously! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82LZkglNiQ0\nWatch our video cutting the RTX 4090 cooler in half previously, also ft.
