A report from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation tallying year-end data reported that 112 models of EVs and plug-ins were sold in the U.S. Looking at both new and used vehicle registrations in Washington, the number of low-carbon vehicles has reached more than 173,000, according to recent&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/nearly-1-in-5-new-cars-registered-in-washington-state-last-year-were-evs-or-plug-in-hybrids/">Read More</a>

The company has developed technology that pulls customer data from U.S. utilities to provide real-time information on energy use as well as consumption over time. The data are useful to a variety of businesses, particularly those deploying clean energy products. That includes companies installing heat pumps that need to figure out the right-size device for a space. Or a solar installer who needs to tell a customer how much energy they can expect to put back on the grid. Other businesses need the data to track their own energy&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/this-energy-startup-wants-to-make-utility-data-more-accessible-and-spur-creation-of-new-companies/">Read More</a>
