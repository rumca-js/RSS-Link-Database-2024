<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 10 April 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01851-x">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01851-x</a></p>Soft pressure sensors drift under prolonged high stress because of the creep of soft materials, which causes inaccurate measurements. Now, through molecular-level design, a leakage-free and creep-free polyelectrolyte elastomer is synthesized, and an iontronic sensor using the polyelectrolyte elastomer shows very low signal drift under a high static pressure.
