In this next addition to our engineering deep-dive series, we talk with Malcolm Gutenburg, a thermal engineer at NVIDIA (and formerly Intel). This video goes deep with acoustics engineering as it relates to thermal design, so we talk about finding and identifying coil whine with lasers, fan blade design and engineering, critical bands and one-third octave bands for data presentation, and tone-to-noise prominence ratio. The discussion also gets into psychoacoustics and the structure of the inner ear.
