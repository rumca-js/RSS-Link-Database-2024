Its developer, the Seattle-based studio Mega Crit, made the announcement during Wednesday\u2019s Triple-i Initiative Showcase, a livestreamed event that highlighted multiple new and upcoming indie video game projects. The original Slay the Spire has quietly become one of the most influential computer games of the last decade. It\u2019s a clever fusion between collectible deck-building card games and a \u201croguelike\u201d dungeon crawler, where players explore a randomized dungeon in a dark fantasy world.

New data shows that 19% of new cars registered in Washington in 2023 were electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids &#8212; almost double the U.S. average. That&#8217;s a jump from 13% in 2022 and puts Washington just behind California, whose low-carbon car sales hit nearly 26%. A report from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation tallying year-end data reported that 112 models of EVs and plug-ins were sold in the U.S. Looking at both new and used vehicle registrations in Washington, the number of low-carbon vehicles has reached more than 173,000, according to recent&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/nearly-1-in-5-new-cars-registered-in-washington-state-last-year-were-evs-or-plug-in-hybrids/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/nearly-1-in-5-new-cars-registered-in-washington-state-last-year-were-evs-or-plug-in-hybrids", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Nearly 1 in 5 new cars registered in Washington state last year were EVs or plug-in hybrids", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-10T15:15:10+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/building-a-more-mature-seattle-s-1260x709.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Seattle, with its tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft, has the potential to be a top-tier startup ecosystem.

The 2024 finalists for Sustainable Innovation of the Year at the GeekWire Awards are blasting both pollutants and weeds. They&#8217;re pulling carbon dioxide from the water and putting electrons into car batteries. And they&#8217;re turning trashed crab shells into eco-friendly industrial chemicals. Last year\u2019s Sustainable Innovation of the Year winner was Pure Watercraft, the maker of electric powerboats. \u00a0 Continue reading for details on each finalist.

The company has developed technology that pulls customer data from U.S. utilities to provide real-time information on energy use as well as consumption over time. The data are useful to a variety of businesses, particularly those deploying clean energy products. That includes companies installing heat pumps that need to figure out the right-size device for a space. Or a solar installer who needs to tell a customer how much energy they can expect to put back on the grid. Other businesses need the data to track their own energy&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/this-energy-startup-wants-to-make-utility-data-more-accessible-and-spur-creation-of-new-companies/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/this-energy-startup-wants-to-make-utility-data-more-accessible-and-spur-creation-of-new-companies", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "This energy startup wants to make utility data more accessible \u2014 and spur creation of new companies", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
