Sky: Children of the Light, the acclaimed free-to-play "social adventure" from Journey and Flower developer ThatGameCompany, has - just shy of a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/journey-devs-social-adventure-sky-children-of-the-light-heading-to-pc">being announced for PC</a> - finally <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2325290/Sky_Children_of_the_Light/">launched on Steam</a>, initially as an early access release.
</p><p>
Sky: Children of the Light is far from a new game, of course; it originally launched for iOS all the way back in 2019 before making its way to Android, Switch, and PlayStation in the years since. And now - with over 260m downloads to its name already - PC players will have the opportunity to experience its lovely, if unusual, adventure for themselves.

There's good news if you've been awaiting the next Sims 4 DLC announcement to reassure yourself of the continuing passage of time; EA has revealed two new Kit packs - Urban Homage and Party Essentials - are launching next Thursday, 18th April.
</p><p>
Urban Homage, which has been created in collaboration with The Sims 4 content creator Danielle "Ebonix" Udogaranya, is themed around 90s and Noughties London-inspired fashion trends. There's talk of "lively patterns, vibrant graffiti motifs, and eye-catching accessories", including overalls, butterfly tops, layered jewellery, and "glamorous" nails.
</p><p>
As for the Party Essentials Kit, it's promising "everything you need to make your next celebration the talk of the town". More specifically, it introduces the likes of streamers, a fog machine, a "versatile" bar, and a disco ball. "

Laysara: Summit Kingdom, the promising mountain-themed city builder from developer Quite OK Games and publisher Future Friends Games, has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1823950/Laysara_Summit_Kingdom/">surprise launched on Steam</a>, where it's expected to remain in early access for between six and 12 months.
</p><p>
Laysara - which sets itself apart from other city builders with its focus on mountainous verticality and theme-appropriate hazards, including avalanches - has been popping up here and there for a while now (it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-best-of-the-pc-gaming-show">landed on Eurogamer's radar</a> in June 2022), and was initially expected to launch in 2023.

Tonight marked the first ever Triple-i showcase, a new digital event highlighting a vast number of indie game projects on the way.
</p><p>
The "no nonsense" showcase was initially created by Dead Cells developer Evil Empire, which said the goal was to create a "straight-to-the-point show packed with announcements as a collective of studios, to speak directly to players [with] no hosting segments, no advertisements, no sponsorships, no extra fluff, just games".
</p><p>
We certainly got that, with 45 minutes of trailers, teasers, and announcements. Evil Empire itself revealed its forthcoming The Rogue Prince of Persia, with other headline announcements including Slay the Spire 2, a new Kingdoms mode coming to Darkest Dungeon 2, and Vampire Survivors receiving a PlayStation release and Contra DLC.

And not particularly because of the Prince of Persia bit, if I'm honest. I still love the Prince, but I also appreciate that they feel like Ubisoft's new minister without portfolio at the moment: they're a little unmoored, and they go where they're needed. They're willing to drop into a Metroidvania for The Lost Crown or, in the case of The Rogue, a roguelike or roguelite. The Prince sits around at Ubi HQ, possibly in one of the nicer cubicles, and bounces from one project to another, with no idea of what's next. Probably not a bad life, really.</p><p>No, The Rogue Prince of Persia felt like coming home because it's the new game from Evil Empire. I've had a quick dig through the clippings this morning and from

## Darkest Dungeon 2 reveals new Kingdoms campaign mode

As part of this evening's Triple-i livestream, the developer of Darkest Dungeon 2 has detailed a new campaign mode, Kingdoms.
</p><p>
Coming as part of a free update later this year, Kingdoms will challenge you to save your lands against the clock by locating and defeating one of three new monster factions. 
</p><p>
In keeping with the game's roguelike foundations, you'll gather resources and battle enemies across a grid of encounters, while upgrading your heroes' skill trees and building up a network of inns, used as safe havens.

Deck-building roguelite Slay the Spire is getting a sequel.
</p><p>
It was announced at tonight's Triple-i showcase with a suitably gloomy animated trailer, featuring three characters seemingly from the original game: The Ironclad knight, The Silent huntress, and a new skeletal necromancer character called The Necrobinder.
</p><p>
There's no release date yet, but the game will be released in early access in 2025.

EA is increasing the price of its EA Play subscription service - which provides on-demand access to a selection of the publisher's titles, as well as early access to certain newer games - with the annual price of its standard tier set for a significant increase, up from &pound;19.99 to &pound;35.99.

Since then, prices have remained at &pound;3.99/month or &pound;19.99/year for EA Play, and &pound;14.99/month or &pound;89.99/year for EA Play Pro - which includes access to the publisher's latest games as they launch, alongside other benefits.

## Dead Space 2 remake was reportedly in development, but not any more

Despite the original Dead Space getting the remake treatment, the same isn't happening for its sequel, at least not now. 
</p><p>
According to the ever chatty Jeff Grubb, a Dead Space 2 remake was in the works at EA. However, the studio has since shelved the project "because the first game had lacklustre sales". 
</p><p>
"If you were looking forward to a Dead Space 2, it's bad news. It's straight up is just bad news," Grubb said.

## Hellblade 2 looks like the most visually ambitious Unreal Engine 5 game yet

Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is shaping up to be one of the most visually exciting games of the year. Ninja Theory's cinematic sequel should be making excellent use of Epic's Unreal Engine 5, producing some truly stunning results. At the same time, a lot of early footage for the game has been brief, hard-to-follow, and ridden with compression artefacts - until now. Microsoft released high quality b-roll meaning that we can finally draw some clearer conclusions on the game's visual make-up. So, how do these early shots pan out? Is this the Unreal Engine showcase we've been waiting for? 
</p><p>
In terms of visual features, Hellblade 2 is clearly pushing some really impressive tech. Senua's Metahuman-derived facial rendering is the extreme strong point here, up there with the absolute best in video games. Everything - from the subtly transluce

## Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes developer blames "misinformation" for unexpected shipping costs

A number of Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes Kickstarter backers have been met with unexpected shipping costs, which in some cases have nearly doubled the amount people will pay.
</p><p>
On the game's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rabbitandbearstudios/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes/posts/4072662">Kickstarter page</a>, supporters have called out developer Rabbit and Bear for its "ridiculous" shipping fees. "Mine's $54 to Malaysia (PC Steam). I backed the game for $60...," one supporter said, with another adding: "$14 for shipping a game, (Standard EU Shipping, not even sure there [is] any insurance fee in that), never saw a shipping price like this."

Another questioned the developer's choice to ship to Oceania from Germany rather than Japan. "Why would you quadruple the distance and pr

Ever wondered about those sleepy spores emitted by Grass-type Pok&eacute;mon? Ever thought about rolling up their aromatic leaves, and subjecting them to a Fire-type attack? 
</p><p>
Maybe you haven't, but I'm growing increasingly sure someone at Pok&eacute;mon Go developer Niantic definitely has - as the game is once again cheekily referencing the upcoming 4/20.
</p><p>
Last night, Niantic announced that this month's Community Day - to be held on 4/20, or 20th April - will feature the Grass-type Bellsprout, and that the creature would gain the new attack Magical Leaf. Hmm!

From Tyranny's power-grasping fatebinder in an occupied land, and Harry du Bois's desperate reflection of the ideologies around him in Disco Elysium, Broken Roads' promise of philosophically mapped out moral quandaries in a lawless post-apocalypse looked to fit right in.</p><p>The idea is that your decisions and dialogue fall across a moral compass, being somewhere between utilitarian, humanist, nihilistic or machiavellian, and that these morals can be uniquely tested in the wilds of the post-apocalyptic outback. If the trolley problem happened at London King's Cross, you'd have to factor in a &pound;1000 railway trespass fine - but if it's raiders in the desert that are responsibl

After the mushrooming success of HBO's The Last of Us, screen adaptations of video games have never been hotter or more respectable. Similarly, the lingering impact of Oppenheimer, now forever glowing with Oscar acclaim, means the world has had atomic bombs on the brain since last summer.</p><p>But transferring Fallout's hardscrabble post-nuclear pleasures to the small screen presents a problem similar to Fallout inventory management. With such an abundance of material and only so much capacity, what do you keep and what do you throw away?

</p><p>
"I think we were able to complete the story of Ori. It's a complete arc now; if you play both games, it's a complete story. So it felt like the only way we would come back to Ori 3 is if we have more to say, more story to tell."

Wii U fans have brought the console's online multiplayer functionality back online, after Nintendo officially ended its own server support.
</p><p>
The new connection method has been provided by Pretendo, a fan collective that has previously provided custom Wii U servers for those willing to tinker with their console.

The Call of Duty team has released a new, King Kong-themed glove into the game, and it hasn't exactly gone down well with players. 
</p><p>
This melee weapon is known as the BEAST glove (today I learned, BEAST stands for Bio-Enhanced Anatomech Seismic Thunder), and promises that its wielder will be able to "punch as hard as Kong". Which, on paper, sounds pretty useful. 
</p><p>
However, this glove can only be acquired by purchasing the four other Godzilla x Kong themed bundles. And this is where the chagrin begins.

Fortnite fans are upset over the game's removal of cosmetic item rarities, which graded the game's vast vault of character skins, pickaxes, back blings and so forth with various different 'quality' levels. 
</p><p>
Typically, these tiers have also corresponded to how much cosmetics cost in the game's item shop - with Uncommon (green) skins typically 800 V-Bucks, Rare (blue) typically 1200 V-Bucks, Epic (purple) typically 1500 V-Bucks and Legendary (gold) typically 2000 V-Bucks. 
</p><p>
In a blog <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/new-and-upcoming-fortnite-shop-and-locker-changes?lang=en-US">post</a> yesterday, Fortnite acknowledged the disappearance of item rarities thus: "The Shop has evolved significantly to support multiple types of cosmetics and items across games, so we're retiring the old Battle Royale-inspired system of col

Blizzard games are set to return to China, thanks to a new agreement with publisher NetEase. 
</p><p>
Blizzard and NetEase initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neteases-blizzard-team-disbands-following-collapse-of-14-year-chinese-deal">parted ways in January of last year</a>, ending a publishing deal that allowed games such as World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Overwatch, Diablo and more to be playable in the country. 
</p><p>
At this time, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-blames-netease-for-lack-of-chinese-partnership-extension">Diablo studio blamed NetEase for this dissolution</a>, claiming it offered a six month extension to NetEase to tide the company over while it tried to source a new long-term partner. NetEase felt differently, however - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netease-smashes-u
