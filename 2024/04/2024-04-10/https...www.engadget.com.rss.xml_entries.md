<p>Prince of Persia fans are really feasting this year. We've already seen the release of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-is-a-metroidvania-style-platformer-coming-in-2024-194059046.html"><ins>well-received Metroidvania</ins></a> <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em>, but Ubisoft just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5RIwH6jQUQ"><ins>announced another game</ins></a> in the franchise. <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> is a team-up with Evil Empire, the developers behind the iconic roguelite <em>Dead Cells. </em>It comes to Steam early access on May 14.</p>
<div id="9e4d34385f5540acbce3826ab61d6f93"></div>
<p>It’s a sidescrolling roguelite, just like <em>Dead Cells</em>. As you can see from the trailer, the graphics also recall the widely-acclaimed and highly addictive action-platformer. You play as, wait for it, the Prince of Persia, who has been equipped with a mystical device that allows him to resurrect after death. You try your b

<p>Ever since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/palworld/"><em>Palworld</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>first emerged, it's been described as &quot;Pokémon with guns.&quot; A new mode that's coming to Pocketpair's massively successful game won't do much to get rid of those comparisons. Even based on a 15-second clip, it looks, sounds and smells just like Pokémon's player vs. player experiences.</p>
<p>In the inventively titled Palworld Arena, you'll be able to take on other players with the help of the <del>Pokémon</del> Pals you've captured. Pocketpair says you can train your strongest critters to overcome your rivals.

<p>Two years after E-line Media revealed it was working on <em>Never Alone 2</em>, the first look at gameplay emerged at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-the-triple-i-initiative-indie-game-showcase-at-1pm-et-150048553.html"><ins>Triple-i Initiative indie games showcase</ins></a>. The brief clip shows Nuna and her spirit companion Fox running across ice and encountering a pair of giant creatures. There's not much to the video (it's a teaser, after all), but it gives a sense of the game's look and feel.</p>
<p>You'll venture through the Alaskan wilderness to look for ways to support your home village. Along the way, you'll unravel a mystery that poses a threat to the community. While the 2014 original (which nearly 15 million people have played) married 3D graphics and 2D gameplay, <em>Never Alone 2 </em>is billed as a &quot;3D open-map sequel.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> is preparing to invade a whole new platform. More than two years after breaking through the noise on Steam, Android, iOS and Xbox, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is due to hit PlayStation 4 and PS5 in summer 2024.

<p>Alongside the fresh platform announcement, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is also getting a batch of crossover DLC on May 9. <em>Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns </em>brings Contra characters and weapons into the game with the mission statement, &quot;The President’s cousin’s sister’s dog has been kidnapped by Red Falcon.

<p><em>33 Immortals</em> feels like a game that's going to need a lot of pre-release testing, and thankfully, that's exactly what developers at Thunder Lotus are setting up. Following a smaller alpha test, the closed beta for <em>33 Immortals</em> will kick off on May 24 and run through June 2. Interested players can sign up to participate at the <a href="https://thunderlotusgames.com/33-immortals/">game's official site</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from the <em>Dante's Inferno</em>-inspired landscape and retro-cartoony visuals, the unique draw of <em>33 Immortals</em> is its raid size. The game features 33-player co-op with a cast of seven unique fighters, and each round lasts about 25 minutes. It's all raids, all the time, and felled players are able to be revived if another warrior takes the time to chase down their ghost.</p>

<p>ASUS’ ROG Zephyrus G14 has been one of our favorite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html"><ins>gaming laptops</ins></a> for damn near half a decade. But the 2024 model is on another level. That’s because even without a fresh generation of GPUs from NVIDIA, ASUS went and redesigned the entire thing anyway. And the result is a notebook with a gorgeous aluminum unibody chassis with a more mature design that doesn’t need to throw RGB lighting in your face to get some attention. This edition is also sleeker and lighter while still providing powerful performance. Though ASUS made a few trade-offs when compared to its predecessor, with a starting price of $1,600, the new ROG Zephyrus G14 is not only a better value than almost all of its 14-inch rivals, it’s also simply one of the best pound-for-pound gaming laptops around.</p>

<p>Roku has released a line of TVs <a href="https://go.roku.com/pro-series"><ins>called the Pro Series</ins></a> after first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-high-end-pro-series-tvs-feature-mini-led-screens-164354589.html"><ins>unveiling the collection at this year’s CES</ins></a>. These televisions are packed with tech, with the standout feature being Mini LED backlighting for better brightness and contrast. The 4K TVs also boast QLED panels, HDR10+, Dolby Vision and a responsive refresh rate of 120Hz. The company’s calling them the “ultimate TVs” for streaming.</p>
<p>To that end, the quad-core processor should allow for snappier menu navigation and for apps to launch quickly, so you can spend less time waiting on a load screen and more time binging Hulu’s <em>Shogun</em> while scarfing down a big bowl of popcorn. They're also Wi-Fi 6 capable, which comes in handy when streaming 4K content.</p>

## The best ergonomic keyboards for 2024

<p>It’s tough to give a blanket recommendation for ergonomics, as the term most accurately translates to “what works best for your body” — and all bodies are different. But if you’ve landed here, chances are you’re looking for a keyboard that’s easier on your shoulders, neck and wrists. Traditional keyboards keep your arms close together and force you to splay your hands outward. After a while, that can feel straining. By shifting the orientation of the keys, ergonomic keyboards  can keep your upper body in a more neutral position, preventing you from twisting or over-extending your hands and arms. We’ve broken down the various features that make some boards more body-friendly than others and tested a handful to come up with the best ergonomic keyboards to suit different needs and preferences.</p>
<h2>What to look for in an ergonomic keyboard</h2>
<h3><strong>Alice vs split</strong></h3>
<p>Most ergonomic keyboard layouts fall into two categories: Alice and split. The former is a sing

<p><em>Fallout’s </em>transition to TV starts with a bang (or three depending on how you’re counting). But even after the show emerges from the vault, the hits keep coming. That’s because unlike a lot of other video game adaptations that receive a thin veneer designed to appeal to fans of the source material, the essence of <em>Fallout</em> runs so deep throughout <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0ZhbGxvdXQtU2Vhc29uLTEvZHAvQjBDTjRIVjE2Tj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtdi1kZS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmIwZmUxNTctNjEwOC00MzhkLTlmZjYtNWFiYWRlY2QwNDAyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWEiDUd6QNONUlhJeLeNwB08CY-DN7VkOtGvERRpM1UW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFallout-Season-1%2Fdp%2FB0CN4HV16N">this series</a> it could

In a <a href="https://www.getcruise.com/news/blog/2024/cruise-resumes-manual-driving-as-next-step-in-return-to-driverless-mission/">blog post on its website</a>, the GM subsidiary said it's resuming its manual driving activities in order to gather road information and create maps for its autonomous vehicles.

<p>Hey, you! Yes. you. Do you need some extra motivation to reach your goals or just to get your chores done? Then perhaps you could use some inspiring words from one of the most successful multisport athletes of all time, direct to your foldable telephone.</p>
<p>Boost Mobile will soon offer a limited-edition, Deion Sanders-themed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motorola-razr-2023-review-a-midrange-foldable-that-underwhelms-190025514.html"><ins>Moto Razr</ins></a>. The phone has a black and gold finish (which kind of looks nice?), along with Sanders' "You Gotta Believe" mantra and his signature. If that's not enough to get you chasing after your dreams, you'll also receive weekly motivational messages from Sanders (aka Coach Prime).</p>

## The Morning After: Drones that can charge on power lines

<p>Battery life always limits a drone’s ability to perform tasks and get anywhere. So why not let it <a href="https://engadget.com/drones-that-charge-on-power-lines-may-not-be-the-best-idea-163942109.html">slurp from nearby power lines</a>? (Well, there are reasons.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Southern Denmark attached a gripper system to a Tarot 650 Sport drone, which they customized with an electric quadcopter propulsion system and an autopilot module. An inductive charger pulls current from the power line, enabling it to recharge five times over two hours during tests. The benefit here is that power lines already exist (duh), but there is the real concern that a drone could damage a line and knock out electricity for thousands.</p>

Starting <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/10/tech/fcc-mandatory-nutrition-labels-internet-providers/index.html">today</a>, big ISPs with more than 100,000 subscribers will be <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandlabels">required</a> to display &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-orders-isp-display-broadband-label-054900626.html">nutrition labels</a>&quot; both in store and online under a new FCC rule.

<p>They also have to show whether a particular amount that's being advertised is an introductory or a discounted rate and how long you can enjoy that lower rate. Plus, the labels have to indicate each particular plan's download and upload speeds, as well as any earl

Rivkin said the association is going to work with Congress to establish and enforce a site-blocking legislation in the United States. He added that almost 60 countries use site-blocking as a tool against piracy, &quot;including leading democracies and many of America's closest allies.&quot; The only reason why the US isn't one of them, he continued, is the &quot;lack of political will, paired with outdated understandings of what site-blocking actually is, how it functions, and who it affects.&quot;</p>

<p>Rakuten has a trio of new Kobo ereaders, including the company’s first two with color displays. On Wednesday, the company revealed the $220 Kobo Libra Colour and $150 Clara Colour alongside the monochrome $130 Clara BW. You can preorder them today, ahead of their April 30 launch.</p>
<p>The Kobo Libra Colour has a seven-inch <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Kaleido3">E Ink Kaleido 3</a> display, which should have a noticeable improvement with 16 levels of grayscale, 4,096 colors and 30 percent better color saturation than E Ink’s last-gen tech. The Libra Colour is the only one of Kobo’s new ereaders with stylus support for ebook annotations and highlighting. But you’ll need to add the $70 Kobo Stylus 2 (also compatible with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kobo-takes-on-the-kindle-scribe-with-improved-elipsa-2e-e-ink-tablet-040148388.html">Elipsa 2E</a>) to enjoy that.</p>
