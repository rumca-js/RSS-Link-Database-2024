Take a look at the latest clip for Challengers as an intense and honest conversation ensues in a bedroom about the fate of an upcoming match.

Challengers follows Tashi Duncan (Zendaya), a former tennis prodigy turned coach and a force of nature who makes no apologies for her game on and off the court. Married to a champion on a losing streak (Mike Faist), Tashi’s strategy for her husband’s redemption takes a surprising turn when he must face off against the washed-up Patrick (Josh O’Connor) – his former best friend and Tashi’s former boyfriend. As their pasts and presents collide, and tensions run high, Tashi must ask herself, what will it cost to win?

The film is produced by Amy Pascal, Luca Guadagnino, Zendaya, Rachel O’Connor. Executive producers are Bernard Bellew, Lorenzo Mieli, Kevin Ulrich. Music is by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross.

Directed by Luca Guadagnino, Challengers is in theaters now.
