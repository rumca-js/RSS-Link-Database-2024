<p>Mauricio Pochettino criticised Chelsea’s soft centre after a bruising defeat in midweek but they showed some mettle to bounce back from a two-goal deficit and earn a creditable draw at Aston Villa. Noni Madueke dragged Chelsea back into the contest soon after the hour before Conor Gallagher, seemingly inspired by the captain’s armband, located the top corner with a beautiful strike with nine minutes of normal time to play. Axel Disasi then thought he had scored a stoppage-time winner for Chelsea only for it to be disallowed after a push by Benoît Badiashile on Diego Carlos was referred by the VAR.</p><p>Unai Emery banged the pristine red turf in front of the home dugout after Morgan Rogers scored Villa’s second goal on 42 minutes but his evening ended in frustration.

<p>Battling, brave and somewhat aggrieved, Chelsea’s Champions League dream died in front of a record crowd of 39,398. A first-half goal from the mercurial Aitana Bonmatí, the controversial sending off of Kadeisha Buchanan and a questionable second-half penalty scored by Fridolina Rolfö denied Emma Hayes’s side a place in the final in Bilbao next month, and a dream finish to her time with the&nbsp;Blues.</p><p>There was one change apiece for the showdown at Stamford Bridge. Mayra Ramírez was out of the squad entirely, with Hayes confirming the Colombia international had an injury that forced them to “change direction” and hand Catarina Macario a first Champions League start for the Blues. Meanwhile, Jonatan Giráldez recalled Lucy Bronze for Barcelona, with Mariona Caldentey dropping out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/27/chelsea-v-barcelona-womens-champions-league-semi-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is it over yet? Watching as his side contrived to drop more points with some weird and wasteful finishing at the London Stadium, Jürgen Klopp could at least tell himself that this might be the last time he will ever have to coach in a 12.30pm kick-off. Next season that responsibility will fall to Arne Slot, who will also need to work out how to make Liverpool more ruthless in front of goal.</p><p>This was a game that they could won 10 times over. Luis Díaz could have had a hat-trick but finished with merely an assist to his name. Behind to a header from Jarrod Bowen at half-time, Liverpool should have run away with the points after fighting back to lead 2-1. Conviction, though, is in short supply at both ends of the pitch. West Ham, who are preparing for their own managerial change, were given a route back. David Moyes could be pleased with a point after Michail Antonio’s late equaliser, leaving Liverpool two points off the top.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/202

<p>Scientists hope studies into Boyajian’s star could lead to enhanced techniques for identifying distant planetary civilisations</p><p>It is our galaxy’s strangest star, a flickering globe of light whose sporadic and unpredictable output has baffled astronomers for years. But now the study of Boyajian’s star is being promoted as a research model that could help in one of the most intriguing of all scientific quests: finding intelligent life on other worlds.</p><p>This is the argument that Oxford University astrophysicist Prof Chris Lintott will make at a public lecture – Is it Aliens? The Most Unusual Star in the Galaxy – at a Gresham College lecture in Conway Hall, central London on Monday.

<p>#MeToo’s real legacy may not be ending predators’ impunity so much as highlighting the tenacity of that impunity</p><p>Usually, rape isn’t reported. When it is reported, it is often not charged. And when it is charged, it rarely leads to a conviction. These facts shape both our cultural understanding of sexual violence and women’s sense of their own embodied lives, clarifying something many of us already know – that while sexual violence is technically illegal and officially abhorred, it is also tolerated in practice, with actual arrests and convictions being so rare that most sexual violence is de facto decriminalized.</p><p>Only occasionally does a notable rape conviction come to pass; when it does, its very rarity highlights this dissonance, making plain the gulf between how rape is officially talked about and how it is usually treated. Now, that gulf has come to the fore again, because on Thursday one of the most high-profile rape convictions in American history was overturned.

It isn’t just that the Tories expect to lose the next election – they fear that the coming defeat might be definitive, a result from which they never recover. One recent multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) poll forecasts that the Tories could be reduced to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/30/conservatives-set-for-worst-election-result-yet-research-shows">fewer than 100 seats</a> – their lowest ever haul – with Labour predicted to secure an unprecedented 250-plus seat majority. Tory grandees are consequently gloomy. The former Brexit negotiator David Frost has called it a “desperate situation”.

<p>From manicured, exclusive retreats built on slave money to common ground in which to seed utopian dreams, gardens occupy a fertile space in our lives and imaginations</p><p>I have a dream sometimes. I dream I’m in a house, and discover a door I didn’t know was there. It opens into an unexpected garden, and for a weightless moment I find myself inhabiting new territory, flush with potential. Maybe there are steps down to a pond, or a statue surrounded by fallen leaves. It is never tidy, always beguilingly overgrown. What might grow here, what rare peonies, irises, roses will I find? I wake with the sense that a too-tight joint has loosened, and that everything runs fluent with new life.</p><p>For most of the years that I have had this dream, I didn’t have a garden of my own. I rented until I was 40, and only rarely in flats with outdoor space. The first of these temporary gardens was in Brighton.

<p>A grilled salad of onions and shallots with boiled eggs and tarragon yoghurt, and a hearty chive and challah bread pudding</p><p>It’s the oldest trick in the book: get some onions and garlic on the stove, cook them until they’re smelling lovely, and everyone will assume that dinner is just around the corner. One way to fast-track that process is to make those alliums the stars of the show, rather than just a background note. From shallots to spring onions and chives to calçots, onions and garlic are just two players in the vast and varied allium family. Unlike other vegetables, alliums accumulate energy stores in chains of fructose sugars, rather than starch, and cooking transforms them from harsh to super-soft and sweet. So, instead of making everyone think of supper, think of onions themselves <em>as </em>supper!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/27/grilled-onions-eggs-chive-bread-pudding-yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-for-alliums-onions">Continue reading...</a>

According to Robin Dunbar, professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of Oxford and author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/friends-9781408711736">Friends: Understanding the Power of our Most Important Relationships</a>, we need to spend the equivalent of nine minutes a day to maintain a healthy relationship with our closest network of friends, which he admits is “barely time to raise your coffee cup to each other”, so one meet-up a week is more realistic.

<p>The former Top Gear presenter claims his controversialist persona was just a caricature, and he’s really a reformed character living the good life. But do old habits die hard?</p><p>“Are you happy?” I ask Jeremy Clarkson. A few times on Clarkson’s Farm, you said were happy. His thick eyebrows seem low, like storm clouds gathering. “I said that in season one, episode one,” he replies. “And I meant it then. Lockdown was a blessed relief. You thought: no one’s inviting me out, I don’t have to go anywhere. Lisa would say, ‘Let’s go on holiday again next weekend.’ And I could say, ‘No! We can’t!’ It was brilliant. We were stuck here. So I was very happy at work then.” Didn’t he say he was happy at another point, while building his pigpen or sowing on his tractor? He looks at me, eyebrows locking, lips pursed in thought. He has perfect recall of the entire Clarkson’s Farm archive. He was pleased when he did those things, but it wasn’t a blanket expression of happiness. Pleased? “Well, wh
