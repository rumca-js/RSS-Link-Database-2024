I'm wondering if there's an easy way to add simple foods that don't really need recipes to a meal plan. This week my meals include both rice and mashed cauliflower. Often also use prepared items like salad kits for sides. Curious if there's a good, quick way to add these items to the library of dish options for a menu plan without importing recipes or creating a recipe that's just a title. I love being able to have images to go with each item, but it's a bit of a hassle for simple items that are basically an ingredient eaten by itself. </p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/te9gyjny73xc1.pn

For the past 10+ years, I just created folders for every occasion (e.g. &quot;2022-04 London day trip&quot;) and then just copied photos to that folder. I am now looking for a piece of software that would allow me to carry forward this album folder approach (e.g. by exporting albums to folders) as a simple backup, that is not reliant on a specific piece of software being supported forever. On the other hand, I just tested Immich and I love the face-detection and context aware search of my legacy library. So my questions are</p> <ul> <li>can I set up Immich to automatically backup newly created albums to an album folder structure?</li> <li>or is there another piece of software that would be better for my use case?</li> </ul> <p>For 99% of the photos I'm only interested in JPEG management, only for very few am I interested in editing/storing the RAW files</p> <p>A

My basic understanding is that it queries the root servers, which are above dns providers like <a href="https://1.1.1.1/">1.1.1.1</a> or <a href="https://8.8.8.8/">8.8.8.8</a>, right? I do like the idea of using the root servers and avoiding any providers, but I'm also not sure if that's really worth anything, or if it costs anything in terms of response time.</p> <p>If it matters, this is for a home network with about 60 clients and symmetrical gigabit service.
