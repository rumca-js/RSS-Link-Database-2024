  <p id="nVXXxL">The first race of the <a href="https://a2rl.io/">Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League</a> (A2RL) took place on the Yas Marina Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 track today, and I’m pleased to report that a race both began and ended. But the event was not without strife — far from it. During qualifying time trials, the driverless Dallara Super Formula racers outfitted with cameras and software seemed to struggle mightily to complete a full lap.</p>

  <p id="oWHOPD">I paid a lot of money for the privilege of getting an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">Apple Vision Pro</a> brand-new in February. All-in, with optical inserts and taxes, I financed a little over $3,900 for the 256GB version of the headset. A day or so ago, I made a mistake that I’m sure many early adopters are familiar with: I looked up how much it’s been selling for on eBay. </p>

  <p id="9grSFG"><em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day </em>was — and is, for some — the standard-bearer for bombastic tentpole action films after it was released in 1991, but many of its fans have been less than enthusiastic about its Blu-ray releases. In recent years, though, people who love the movie have been restoring it using 35mm prints, and one of those efforts has been making the rounds over on X. </p>

  <p id="rRGBuC">If the bar for noise-canceling earbuds seems high right now, that’s because Bose and Sony seem to raise it with every addition to their respective lineups. The <strong>QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds </strong>are a great example of just how impressive ANC has become in the last few years, particularly in the earbuds space. And now, thanks to a $50 discount, you can pick them up at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-World-Class-Cancellation/dp/B0CD2FSRDD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank

  <p id="eu9mug">Overnight, many people reported on social media that they were inexplicably logged out of their Apple IDs and then required to reset their passwords when they tried to sign in again, and nobody seems to know why. Some reported needing to enter their iPhone passcode to connect to iCloud again, while others with Stolen Device Protection enabled said they had to wait an hour before being able to log in. </p>
