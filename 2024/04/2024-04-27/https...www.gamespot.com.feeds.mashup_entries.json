Between the buffet of big releases we're now seeing more regular in February and March, to the traditional holiday season rush of tentpole titles, May 2's game release lineup could have provided some much-needed breathing room and a chance to catch up on your backlog. But as it turns out, May 2024 has some fascinating new arrivals to tempt you with.</p><p>From the long-in-development Hellblade 2 to the return of a sci-fi strategy series, there's a month of varied releases to look forward to. Several games are leaving early access on PC, another PlayStation Studios title is headed to that platform, and Nintendo is bringing one of its best Mario games of the GameCube era to Switch.
