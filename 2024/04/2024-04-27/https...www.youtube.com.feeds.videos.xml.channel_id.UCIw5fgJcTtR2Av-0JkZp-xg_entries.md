This video explores the musical usage of Sonicware's Smpltrek vs the Teenage Engineering KO-II or EP-133. Both are decent budget samplers for creatively exploring sampling and both are capacle of creating interesting songs with. I'd like to explore both devices from a musicmaking point of view, rather than just doing a feature-by-feature comparison.
