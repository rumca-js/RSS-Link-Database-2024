After last year's KILLER movie, Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, we predicted movie studios would be doing a lot more horror movies based on Disney characters. Why? Well, remember, copyright on Winnie the Pooh, Bambi, and other intellectual property expire after 100 years. So with Mickey Mouse (Steamboat Willie) and Bambi joining the public domain this year, we wanted to see just _how_ good of a horror movie villain Mickey would be. Will Mickey's Mousetrap be the scariest movie of all time? Or could any of his friends be more terrifying?
