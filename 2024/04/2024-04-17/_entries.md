## Making crops colorful for easier weeding by robots

To make weeding easier, scientists suggest bioengineering crops to be colorful or to have differently shaped leaves so that they can be more easily distinguished from their wild and weedy counterparts. This could involve altering the crops' genomes so that they express pigments that are already produced by many plants, for example, anthocyanins, which make blueberries blue, or carotenoids, which make carrots orange. Then, they say, weeding robots could be trained to remove only the weeds using machine learning.

We all deserve privacy in our communications. Part of that is imposing limits upon the government’s ability to collect and access them. That’s why it’s critical to reform Section 702, the mass surveillance law that creates an end run around our constitutional rights and a back door for the government to query our communications. In the last few weeks, there have been multiple attempts to reauthorize this power with varying levels of reform and compromise. Nearly half of the U.S. House of Representatives supported requiring the government to obtain court approval before accessing Americans’ communications in the government’s Section 702 databases—but at the last minute, the pro-mass surveillance side passed a bill which actually expands, rather than reforms these powers. That’s why we need you to tell the Senate to stop it!
What happened: Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) is set to expire on April 19. The House of Representatives just passed the Reforming
