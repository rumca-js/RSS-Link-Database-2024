The company is shifting away from \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d in its large grocery stores, which uses cameras and sensors to detect what people put in their carts, letting them avoid the checkout line. Instead, it&#8217;s focusing on Dash Carts, which also let shoppers skip the line but currently require scanning or manually entering items as they go.
