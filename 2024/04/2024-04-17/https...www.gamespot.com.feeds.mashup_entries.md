<p>The three Fantastic Four films--four if you count the infamous Roger Corman spectacle--haven't been the most memorable comic book movies. Yeah, the first two starring Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and Chris Evans made some money, but Alba getting a Razzie nomination for Sue Storm wasn't exactly promising. The follow-up reboot in 2015 with Miles Teller and Michael B.

<p>Last year, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania dramatically collapsed at the box office after a strong opening weekend, leaving the future of the franchise in doubt. But there's at least one Quantumania cast member who wanted out of the MCU before the movie debuted: Michael Douglas.</p><p>Via <a href="https://ew.com/michael-douglas-reveals-how-he-wants-hank-pym-death-scene-ant-man-8634184">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Douglas was a guest on The View earlier this week, and he wasn't shy about his desire to see his character, Hank Pym, get killed off in Quantuamania.</p><p>"This actually was my request for the third one," said Douglas "I said I'd like to have a serious [death], with all these great special effects. There's got to be some fantastic way where I can shrink to an ant size and explode, whatever it is. I want to use all those effects. But, that was on the last one. Now, I don't think I'm going to show up."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ant-man-and-the-wasp-star-

<p>The animated series Family Guy debuted in 1999, meaning it celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. But would creator Seth MacFarlane ever consider wrapping it up and moving on? Speaking to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2024-04-16/family-guy-25th-anniversary-oral-history">The Los Angeles Times</a>, MacFarlane--who is no longer working directly on the show--said he has no plans to call it quits.</p><p>"At this point, I don't see a good reason to stop. People still love it. It makes people happy and it funds some good causes," he said. "It's a lot of extraneous cash that you can donate to Rainforest Trust and you can still go out to dinner that night."</p><p>In 2019, MacFarlane <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191204005274/en/Seth-MacFarlane-Gives-1-Million-to-Rainforest-Trust-to-Stop-Deforestation">donated $1 million to the Rainforest Trust</a> to help protect tropical habitats.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/family-gu
