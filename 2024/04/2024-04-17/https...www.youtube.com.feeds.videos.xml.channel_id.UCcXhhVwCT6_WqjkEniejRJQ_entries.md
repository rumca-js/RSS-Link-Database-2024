I’m making a cardboard model of the new Marble Machine, as a quick way to try different design options. I got the idea from the book ”How Big Things get Done” where the Planning Professor Bent Flyvbjerg recommends cardboard modeling as a low-tech, fast and cheap planning tool for complex projects. I never knew planning could be this much fun, I always thought planning was boring and uncreative. Compared to sketching in CAD this was much faster and felt much more real. Scale 1/10 BOOM!
