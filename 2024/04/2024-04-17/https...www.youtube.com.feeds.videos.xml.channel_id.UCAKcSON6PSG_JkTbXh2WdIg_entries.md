It’s easy to think of Arlo Parks as a musician because she is indeed that, but Parks herself thinks of it a bit differently. “It's always been storytelling at the heart of what it is that I want to do,” she says. “So I guess I was writing short stories when I was young … and I started falling in love with poetry, and then made my way into songs.”

Parks’ latest album is My Soft Machine, and the London-based artist visited The Current to play songs from the new album.
