  <p id="k9HiAO">Comcast announced today that it’s expanding its “Now” branding to include two prepaid services: Now Internet and Now Mobile. Of the two, the mobile plan appears to be genuinely new, as it’s a prepaid cellular option that offers unlimited 5G data, talk, and text for $25 a month per line. The mobile plan also has free access to the company’s Xfinity hotspots<em>.</em></p>
<p id="bcOu9t">That seems like a better deal than Xfinity’s current prepaid mobile plans, which <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fmobile%2Flearn%2Fplan%2Fdetails&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F20

  <p id="2eS1ZV">At the premium end of home theater, Sony TVs are about as good as it gets — and have been for several years now. The company is lauded for its image processing and penchant for delivering fantastic picture quality in both its flagship sets and lower-cost options like the X90L. So there’s pressure that comes with every refresh of the lineup. But Sony’s not letting that stop it from taking some bold steps in 2024. </p>
<p id="Jq98kw">This year, the company’s primary focus is on Mini LED. And more specifically, all eyes are on the top-of-the-line Bravia 9. There’s still an OLED in the new roster — that’s the Bravia 8 — and last year’s A95K QD-OLED is also sticking around. But Sony
