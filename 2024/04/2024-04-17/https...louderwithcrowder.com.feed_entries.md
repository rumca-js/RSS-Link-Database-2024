However, this student was actually charged and we can only hope that he will be held accountable for his reprehensible behavior. Although, he has yet to be expelled even though he should never be allowed back on that campus. </p><p>Warning: This video may be upsetting to some people. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
