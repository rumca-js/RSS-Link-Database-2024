		Demand for biometrics to reduce retail crime continues to rise, but the risk of flawed deployments of the technology are also seen in an unfortunate incident and an allegation of mass privacy violations.

The British Retail Consortium is urging authorities to allocate more resources to reducing retail theft as part of its Get Tough on Retail Crime” campaign, <a href="https://www.retail-week.com/legal-and-regulatory/brc-calls-for-tougher-police-action-against-retail-crime/7046007.article" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Retail Week</a> reports. It is not just theft that the BRC is concerned about, noting that abuse and violence against retail staff increased from 870 incidents per day in 2021-2022 to 1,300 UK-wide in 2022-2023.

The call is going out to candidates for the

		The EU’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/ai-act-passes-eu-parliament-arguments-on-implementation-and-implications-heat-up">AI Act</a> is done, and no one is happy. Having been adopted by the European Parliament in March and set to go into effect in May, the Act now faces scrutiny from rights groups, who variously describe it as ineffective, undemocratic, imprecise, and “far from a golden standard for a rights-based AI regulation.”

“While EU policymakers are hailing the AI Act as a global paragon for AI regulation, the legislation fails to take basic human rights principles on board,” says Mher Hakobyan, advocacy advisor on AI for <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/amnesty-wants-end-to-surveillance-infrastructure-in-palestine">Amnesty Inte

		The latest craze sweeping the United States – legislation to protect kids’ data and overall online safety – has its own snappy epithet. The Guardian reports on the so-called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/15/online-child-safety-bills-big-tech">“Kids Code” bills</a> popping up in multiple state legislatures, the latest of which recently passed in Maryland by unanimous vote. The full list of nine states reads like a fellowship of age-appropriate design: Maryland, plus Vermont, Minnesota, Hawaii, Illinois, New Mexico, South Carolina, New Mexico and Nevada.

But every fellowship has its Nazgûl, and in this case the two sides warring for moral control of the internet involve some atypical partnerships. Social media companies are pushing

		A team of fraudsters has been convicted for what was described as “the largest case of benefit fraud in England and Wales.” The technically unsophisticated, mass-scale fraud was carried out with impersonation and forged documents against government systems that did not apply robust document checks or biometrics with presentation attack detection.

Using a combination of legitimate and fake identity documents, the five-member gang had stolen £53.9 million (US$67.1 million) from Universal Credit, the main welfare benefit in the UK. The team pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering offenses after their arrest in May 2021 and is currently awaiting sentencing at London’s Wood Green Crown Court slated for May 28.

		Banks could play a significantly larger role in protecting consumers, businesses and payment systems from fraud, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/intellicheck">Intellicheck</a> CEO Bryan Lewis and a new white paper from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/oneid">OneID</a> both suggest.

In the United States, a social security number and driver’s license are often the only credentials used to validate a transaction, Lewis told <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/fraud-prevention/2024/intellicheck-ceo-envisions-a-bank-consortium-to-fight-id-fraud/">PMYNTS</a> in a recent interview.

People committing fraud are well aware of the templates for different driver’s licenses and ID documents, Lewis explains.

		By the end of 2025, Costa Ricans will have the option to store a digital ID in a digital wallet on their smartphones in place of its physical counterpart, according to the <a href="https://www.costaricantimes.com/costa-rica-leaps-into-the-digital-age-the-dawn-of-the-digital-id/77605">Costa Rican Times</a>.

To obtain a digital ID, users will go to a platform hosted by Costa Rica's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE). The only requirements to sign up are that a user's biometrics are up to date with the TSE and they've received a physical ID at least once. After paying a fee of 2,600 Costa Rican Colones (about US$4), users receive a link to download a digital wallet app where their digital ID can be downloaded and securely stored.

		British tourists traveling to Europe are being warned to prepare themselves for the upcoming Entry/Exit System (EES) which is expected to be implemented across all countries in the Schengen Area in October.

EES was introduced to help identify terrorists, criminals, suspects, and victims of crime by providing a centralized database and enhance cooperation on border management among European Union members. By summer 2025, the bloc also plans to set up the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS).
