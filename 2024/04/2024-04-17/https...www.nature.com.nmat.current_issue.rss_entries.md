<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 17 April 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01875-3">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01875-3</a></p>The turn-off time is generally faster than the turn-on time in accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), but the mechanism is less understood. Here the authors find different transient behaviours of turn-on and turn-off in accumulation mode OECTs, and ion transport is the limiting factor of device kinetics.
