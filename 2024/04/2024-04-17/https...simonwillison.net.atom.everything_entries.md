<p>I gave a talk last month at the <a href="https://biglocalnews.org/content/events/">Story Discovery at Scale</a> data journalism conference hosted at Stanford by Big Local News. My brief was to go deep into the things we can use Large Language Models for right now, illustrated by a flurry of demos to help provide starting points for further conversations at the conference.</p>
<p>I used the talk as an opportunity for some <strong>demo driven development</strong> - I pulled together a bunch of different project strands for the talk, then spent the following weeks turning them into releasable tools.</p>
<p>There are 12 live demos in this talk!</p>
