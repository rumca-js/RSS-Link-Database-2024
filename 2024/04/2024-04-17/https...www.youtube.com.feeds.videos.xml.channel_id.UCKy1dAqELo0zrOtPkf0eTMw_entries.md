Lucky there’s a Family Guy, and it seems it could go on forever. It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV. And Seth MacFarlane wants to make sure #FamilyGuy is added to the equation for years to come. 22 seasons into the animated series, the creator of the show doesn’t see it ending anytime soon. Speaking to the LA Times in celebration of the show’s 25 years since it initially aired on television, he just doesn’t see any good reason to stop production. While the overall perception might be that Family Guy isn’t as popular as it once was, it’s still making Fox money in the animation department. Along with tenured shows like The Simpsons, it's become a staple of Fox’s Animation Domination cartoon block, seasonally rounded out with new animated shows that come and go.

Join star Walton Goggins for a behind-the-scenes look at Fallout and how the actor transforms into The Ghoul from the TV series adaptation of the video game franchise. All episodes of Fallout are now available on Prime Video.

Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there’s almost nothing left to have. Two-hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind—and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them. 

The series comes from Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes. Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner serve as executive producers, writers, and co-showrunners. 

Fallout stars Ella Purnell (Yellowjackets), Aaron Moten (Emancipation) and Walton Goggins (The Hateful Eight). Athena Wickham of Kilter Films also executive pr

On the way to the next clue, the U.S.S. Discovery is sabotaged by a mysterious weapon, leaving Captain Burnham, Rayner, and Stamets as the only crew members who can possibly save the ship in time.

The fifth and final season of STAR TREK: DISCOVERY finds Captain Burnham and the crew of the  U.S.S. Discovery uncovering a mystery that will send them on an epic adventure across the galaxy to find an ancient power whose very existence has been deliberately hidden for centuries. But there are others on the hunt as well … dangerous foes who are desperate to claim the prize for themselves and will stop at nothing to get it.

STAR TREK: DISCOVERY season five cast members include Sonequa Martin-Green (Captain Michael Burnham), Doug Jones (Saru), Anthony Rapp (Paul Stamets), Mary Wiseman (Sylvia Tilly), Wilson Cruz (Dr. Hugh Culber), David Ajala (Cleveland “Book” Booker), Blu del Barrio (Adira) and Callum Keith Rennie (Rayner).
