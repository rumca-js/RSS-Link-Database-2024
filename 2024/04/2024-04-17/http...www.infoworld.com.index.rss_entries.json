The new <code>file_search</code> tool can retrieve as many as 10,000 files per assistant. It connects models with developers' data to assist in building applications relevant to an organization or use case. The tool works with the new vector store objects for automated file parsing, chunking, and embedding. New token controls, tool-choice capabilities, and added support for model configuration parameters offer greater flexibility to individual use cases.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3715263/openais-assistants-api-gets-a-boost.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715263/openais-assistants-api-gets-a-boost.html#tk.rss_all", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "http://www.infoworld.com/index.rss", "source_obj__id": 151, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2024/03/04/20/shutterstock_2091461323-100961752-small.jpg", "title": "OpenAI's Assistants API gets a boost", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-17T12:31:00+00:00", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>In a move that could redefine how <a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html\">generative AI</a> can be used by enterprises sans the present ambiguity over its ability to scale and interoperable across business systems, the LF AI &amp; Data Foundation has <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lf-ai--data-foundation-launches-open-platform-for-enterprise-ai-opea-for-groundbreaking-enterprise-ai-collaboration-302117979.html?s=08\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> the launch of the Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA) in collaboration with several technology companies.</p><p>The objective is to spearhead the development of open, robust, multi-provider, and composable GenAI systems that are flexible, scalable, and enterprise-grade.
