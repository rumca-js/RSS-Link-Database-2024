<p>The News/Media Alliance, formerly the Newspaper Association of America, asked US federal agencies to investigate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-a-197-trillion-company-is-protesting-californias-plan-to-pay-journalists-175706632.html">Google’s removal of links to California news media outlets</a>. Google’s tactic is in response to the proposed California Journalism Preservation Act (CJPA), which would require it and other tech companies to pay for links to California-based publishers’ news content.</p>
<p>The News/Media Alliance, which <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.newsmediaalliance.org/about-us/">represents</a> over 2,200 publishers, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.newsmediaalliance.org/release-news-media-alliance-calls-on-justice-department-california-attorney-general-to-open-investigation-into-googles-blocking-of-news-in-california/">sent letters</a> to the <a href="http://www.newsmediaalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Alliance-Reque

<p>TikTok is ramping up penalties for creators who post potentially “problematic” content and tightening its rules around what can be recommended in the app. The <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-updates-to-help-the-tiktok-community-create-and-share-safely"><ins>updates</ins></a> arrive as TikTok is fighting for its future in the United States and trying to convince lawmakers and regulators that its app is safe for teens.</p>
<p>Under its updated community guidelines, set to take effect in May, TikTok has added <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/fyf-standards?cgversion=2024H1update"><ins>a long list</ins></a> of content that’s not eligible to be recommended in the app’s coveted “For You” feed.

<p>Amazon published a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-just-walk-out-dash-cart-grocery-shopping-checkout-stores">blog post</a> on Wednesday providing an update about its Just Walk Out technology, which it reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-just-walked-out-on-its-self-checkout-technology-191703603.html">pulled from its Fresh grocery stores</a> earlier this month. While extolling Just Walk Out’s virtues as a sales pitch to potential retail partners, the article lists a startlingly minuscule number of (non-Amazon) stores using the tech. There are now “more than 140 third-party locations with Just Walk Out technology in the U.S., UK, Australia, and Canada.”</p>
<p>Mind you, that isn’t the number of companies or retail chains licensing the tech; that’s the total number of locations. Nor is that the tally in one state or even one country. In four countries combined — with a total population of about 465 million —&nbsp;Just Wa

<p>Comedy Central just greenlit a cartoon based on the classic Sega arcade cabinet <em>Golden Axe</em>, further proving we are in something of a gilded age of video game adaptations. The animated show is getting a ten-episode first season and features a voice cast filled with comedic heavy hitters, like Danny Pudi from <em>Community</em> and Carl Tart from <em>Grand Crew</em> (RIP) and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8MBUZjJX7Y">Comedy Bang!

<p>Blaze Entertainment has made a bunch of announcements regarding its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/evercade/">Evercade</a> retro gaming consoles. Among other things, the company has <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/new-hardware-new-lower-price-introducing-evercade-exp-r-and-evercade-vs-r/">revealed</a> refreshed and less expensive hardware.</p>
<p>The Evercade -R range updates the VS and EXP with a new look. Each of the new consoles, which will arrive in July, comes with a bundled cartridge (more on that in a moment). The previous consoles have been discontinued but will be available while stocks last.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Blaze redesigned the handheld Evercade EXP-R with the aim of reducing costs. To that end, Blaze has removed two features: 18 Capcom games that were built into the EXP and the Mini-HDMI out port. On the plus side, that means the latest version of the console is $100 (£100 in the UK and €120 in Europe), <a href="https://www.engadget.co

<p>For as little as $5 in cryptocurrency, Spy Pet lets you access data about specific users, such as which servers they participate in, what messages they’ve sent and when they joined or left voice channels.

<p>How many of you had “sequel to a game from 1982” on your Nintendo Indie World Showcase bingo card? If so, you just won big. <em>Yars Rising</em> is a modern metroidvania take on the Atari 2600 classic <em>Yars’ Revenge</em>, and all it took was 42 short years to reach fruition. By my math, this is the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/video-games-longest-break-between-sequels-list/"><ins>longest break between sequels</ins></a> in gaming history, and it's not even close.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sony just revealed its lineup of new TVs for 2024. While many boast interesting features that we’ll get into later, the biggest change is naming conventions. Sony TVs used to be named confusing strings of numbers and letters, but that’s all gone now. The names here are clean and simple. They all use Bravia, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-2023-bravia-xr-tv-hands-on-bigger-brighter-and-even-better-looking-150030819.html">a long-time Sony moniker for televisions</a>, and a single digit number.</p>
<p>The Bravia 3 is a standard 4K LED TV with dynamic HDR, upscaling technology and a 60Hz refresh rate. This is the most basic box within Sony’s lineup, but it still looks plenty capable. The company promises that it also uses eight percent less power than last year’s equivalent, which is always nice. The TV is available in sizes ranging from 43-inches all the way up to 85-inches, with prices going from $600 to $1,800.</p>

<p>Sony didn't announce any new home theater audio gear at CES, so it was only a matter of time before the company would reveal its latest soundbars and speakers. Today, the company unveiled its new Bravia Theater line, a moniker that the company's soundbars and living room speakers will carry for the foreseeable future. Sony is ditching the HT-XXXX naming scheme, which should be less confusing for all parties. For the initial offering, the company has two new Dolby Atmos soundbars, a four-speaker surround system and a wearable neckband speaker.&nbsp;</p>

Sure enough, one day later, Boston Dynamics has <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://bostondynamics.com/blog/electric-new-era-for-atlas/">unveiled</a> an all-electric model.</p>
<p>Atlas was originally envisioned as a search-and-rescue robot and Boston Dynamics claims the latest model is designed for real-world applications. It calls Atlas "the world’s most dynamic humanoid robot" and it certainly looks limber.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dawn of the 3D-printing age was full of sky-high promises that had no chance of matching the reality of what was possible. Companies like Formlabs have taken the subsequent decade to look for places that the manufacturing process can work, and refining its technology to suit. Today, the company is announcing its Form 4 and Form 4B printers that, it says, offer a substantial improvement on what has gone before. And with maturity comes a shift in focus from just being able to create <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hasbro-formlabs-3d-print-custom-action-figure-heads-130037658.html">custom doodads</a> on the fly toward a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-formlabs-custom-3d-printed-earbuds-smartphone-image-140049178.html">real manufacturing platform</a>.

<p>Over the past two-and-a-half years, a group of students from ETH Zurich have been developing a robot with three spindly legs that was designed to be able to hop like an insect in microgravity. That's right — the curious little machine was built for space, specifically for the exploration of small celestial bodies like asteroids and moons. <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2024/04/using-a-hopping-robot-for-asteroid-exploration.html">SpaceHopper</a>, as the robot is called, could thus provide us more information to advance our understanding of life's origin, of the origin of water on our planet and of asteroids as potential providers of valuable resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has no preferred orientation, so it can go in any direction, and it has nine motors that give it the capability to jump long distances in low-gravity environments. The robot can even self-right after landing, ensuring the safety of any scientific payload it may carry. Since SpaceHopper was ma

<p>Almost 11 years after Boston Dynamics revealed the Atlas humanoid robot, it’s finally being retired. The DARPA-funded robot was designed for search-and-rescue missions, but it rose to fame thanks to videos showing off its dance moves and—let’s be honest—rudimentary parkour skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Atlas is trotting off into the sunset with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boston-dynamics-sends-atlas-to-the-robot-retirement-home-184157729.html">one final YouTube video</a>, thankfully including plenty of bloopers — which are the best parts. Boston Dynamics, of course, has more commercially successful robots in its lineup, including<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/spot/"> Spot</a>.

They’re smaller, more durable and, even if they aren’t exactly the most budget-friendly phones, they’re more affordable now, too.

If you’ve been toying with the idea of switching to a folding phone, or you’re ready to upgrade the foldable you already have, we at Engadget can help with your decision-making process.
