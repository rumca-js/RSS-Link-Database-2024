However, it's now over five years later, and the online action RPG, criticized for its various technical issues and misrepresenting the essence of Fallout, is in a far better state.\n\nFrom more narrative-focused content, starting with Wastelanders and proceeding with the Brotherhood of Steel and revisiting Fallout 3's The Pitt, to new quality-of-life features, it's been quite the journey for Fallout 76. Not every new addition has met abject applause - Fallout 1st and the new Seasons Pass changes, for example - but the community is stronger than ever.\n\nWhat should you know when looking to jump into Fallout 76 after all these years?
