<p>With 72 minutes on the clock, an increasingly fervent Manchester City support announced who they were and promised to fight until the end. Their team was trailing to Rodrygo’s early goal and it was a time for them to show their champion courage, for a hero to emerge; for them to go all the way to the very last.</p><p>All of the above did happen. On a night of the finest margins and the highest tension, Kevin De Bruyne popped up with the equaliser in the 76th minute. The City playmaker always seems to score against Real Madrid and his goal here following a surge and cross from the substitute, Jérémy Doku, and a fluffed clearance by Antonio Rüdiger.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/17/manchester-city-real-madrid-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mike Bubbins stars as a man who awakes in 2024, having been frozen for 50 years, and wonders why everyone is picking up dog poo in little plastic bags</p><p>Mammoth is almost a dad joke writ large. It kicks off with a flashback to a school skiing trip to France in 1979, where medallion-wearing, lady-loving PE teacher Tony Mammoth recklessly launches himself off the side of a mountain. He is soon followed by a catastrophic avalanche. Fifty years later, in a concept that seems to have been concocted just so the in-show newspaper can boast the headline Mammoth No Longer Extinct, Tony is found frozen in the snow and revived. He must now navigate the world of 2024, from the confused perspective of a late-70s unreconstructed male.</p><p>Tony walks through modern-day Cardiff noticing modern-day things, such as hoverboards, men carrying babies and people picking up dog poo with little plastic bags. For a fleeting few months, he is world-famous as “the Ice Man”, but then his moment passes a

<p>It was a night when Bayern Munich lived up to their assertions that, when the Champions League comes around, they are an altogether different beast. Equally it was a triumph for Thomas Tuchel, who may yet rescue a miserable domestic season with another European trophy and remind any suitors that his star has not waned just yet. Bayern’s certainly remains ablaze and ultimately they deserved to beat Arsenal, who seemed to run out of steam after an accomplished first half, through a fine header from Joshua Kimmich.</p><p>Mikel Arteta’s team could not muster a response and must now gather themselves. A run of games that brimmed with promise has not delivered and their season hangs by a thread. When the dust has settled a quarter-final finish will demonstrate clear progress but the swagger with which Bayern expertly shut the tie down shows there is still far to go.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/17/bayern-munich-arsenal-champions-league-quarter-final-second-l

<p>A magical scientific exploration of volcanoes, and how they’ve shaped both nature and human destiny</p><p>Volcanoes are the homes of gods, language tells us – across most of Europe, people who may never have laid eyes on one call them after the smoking forge of Vulcan, Roman god of fire and smithery. (In the tectonic hotspot of Iceland, where people live cheek-by-jowl with 130-odd volcanoes, they are simply “fire mountains”.) Even in our unenchanted modern age, they are capable of inspiring a kind of divine madness in devotees such as the French volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft, who died in an eruption on Japan’s Mount Unzen in 1991. In recent documentaries by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/21/into-the-inferno-review-werner-herzog-peers-into-the-depths-of-the-volcano">Werner Herzog</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/27/fire-of-love-review-romantic-portrait-of-passionate-doomed-volcanologists">Sara Dosa</a>, the Kraffts appear astro

<p>A history of our obsession with the end of days – and the culture it has inspired</p><p>Why do we obsess about the end of the world as we know it? The answer may seem obvious: it’s happening. Covid-19 has killed millions of us, and is still spreading. Month by month, the climate emergency accelerates at terrifying speed. Wars and political instability on every continent threaten our fragile civilisation. Even the greatest technological advances of our time come with built-in existential dread. The unleashing of ever more powerful artificial intelligence, we’re told, runs a non-negligible risk of producing some kind of extinction-level catastrophe – the machines might run amok. No wonder young people are depressed about the state of the planet. Most of the time it can seem like we’re all just helpless bystanders, doomscrolling our way to oblivion.</p><p>Yet, as Dorian Lynskey argues in his clever and voluminous new book, there’s more to it than that. Yes, we live in perilous times.

Nope. The purple creature with a humanish face and body, dressed in a hoodie, wings poking out of its back, is in fact the film’s rendering of a monarch butterfly. The film-makers behind this have really outdone themselves with their tackily revolting anthropomorphic butterflies.
