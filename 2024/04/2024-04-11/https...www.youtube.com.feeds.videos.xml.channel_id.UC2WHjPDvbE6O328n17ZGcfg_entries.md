What the heck is DevOps? Well, it's a continuous loop of plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor, and feedback. It's how the development team and IT operations team automate and integrate the processes between them. And by definition, it's a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy.
Today, we're going to go over the entirety of DevOps, how it works, and the tools used.
