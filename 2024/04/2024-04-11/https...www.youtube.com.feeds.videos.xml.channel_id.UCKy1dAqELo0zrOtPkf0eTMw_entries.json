We know for sure its protagonist Kay Vess cross paths with Jabba The Hutt, as well as the Pykes and Crimson Dawn syndicates, and as much as we\u2019re looking forward to some new characters and adventures, Outlaws taking place during the Original Trilogy gives it plenty of opportunities for cameos from some deeper cut background characters. Specifically, Dengar. Dengar isn\u2019t even that deep cut, they make like half a dozen action figures of him. He was playable in Battlefront 2 and he was in that LEGO Star Wars show a bunch. Simon Pegg played him on The Clone Wars. But basically, we would rather run into Dengar, and Dengar-like characters than have yet another encounter with Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker.
