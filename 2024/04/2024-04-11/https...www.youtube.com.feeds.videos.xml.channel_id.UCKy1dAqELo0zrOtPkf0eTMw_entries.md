Broken Roads reviewed by Malindy Hetfield on PC, also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.

Broken Roads is an ambitious RPG that can’t meet the expectations it sets for itself. It asks you to invest in an intricate morality system only to not end up making good use of it, giving you choices that don’t lead to much. A lot of this could be forgiven if the story held up, but there really isn’t much of a story to begin with, despite the philosophical angle Broken Roads tries very hard to get across. Couple this disappointing journey’s interesting but poorly executed ideas with often busted combat, and Broken Roads lives up to its name in all the wrong ways.

Ubsoft’s upcoming open-world Star Wars Outlaws looks to set itself apart from Respawn’s Jedi series by focusing on a less force-attuned corner of the galaxy, the scoundrels, scum and villainy of the criminal underworld. We know for sure its protagonist Kay Vess cross paths with Jabba The Hutt, as well as the Pykes and Crimson Dawn syndicates, and as much as we’re looking forward to some new characters and adventures, Outlaws taking place during the Original Trilogy gives it plenty of opportunities for cameos from some deeper cut background characters. Specifically, Dengar. Dengar isn’t even that deep cut, they make like half a dozen action figures of him. He was playable in Battlefront 2 and he was in that LEGO Star Wars show a bunch. Simon Pegg played him on The Clone Wars. But basically, we would rather run into Dengar, and Dengar-like characters than have yet another encounter with Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker. Hey, remember Shadows of the Empire? Well, that’s extremely not canon,
