I'm a 20 year old man who doesn't really know what to get a degree for (but am finishing up my sophomore year in college) and I was recommended to join this reddit forum by a buddy of mine that I met on one a vacation here a few days ago. Right now, my end goal would be to learn how to make a self hosted server for my wedding photographer girlfriend to store all of her photos on so she doesn't have to worry about storage on her computer.</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>What are some area's I could start out learning? Or maybe some resources and stuff like that so I can reach my goal?</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>Thanks all!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Maxzpainn\"> /u/Maxzpainn </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c1pzef/new_to_stuff_like_this/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c1pz", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c1pzef/new_to_stuff_like_this", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "New to stuff like this", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-11T20:46:03+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I have a FastAPI project running at home, and for a few months I need to connect to it from a list of outside IPs.</p> <p>I would like a firewall of sorts that will only allow certain IPs to connect. fastapi is running on a windows PC, so I don't want the windows PC directly on the internet, i'd instead rather have something between it.</p> <p>my home router is rather simple and doesn't have any 'per device' IP white listing, I can limit traffic to the device to only the fastapi port, but I wanted to go beyond that.</p> <p>I have an extra raspberry pi that I could use kinda as a middle man between the router and the windows PC (prefered).</p> <p>I shouldn't need a step-by-step guide, if you could just point me to what software to use, I should be able to figure it out from there.</p> <p>I do use wireguard for remote access to my home lan, but in this case I can't install a client on the devices that will be connecting.</p> <p>I've also ", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c1pssm/a_little_help_with_selfhosting_a_fastapi_endpoint", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "a little help with self-hosting a fastapi endpoint (IP whitelist/filtering/firewall)", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-11T20:01:58+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I use cloudflare tunnels because my home internet is behind a CGNAT.

I\u2019m currently overseas and I guess my PC had shut down (either due to power outage/automatic updates). My question is, how do you remotely access your pc and turn it on in the event your pc shut down? Any tips and tricks will be helpful. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Michaelscarn69-\"> /u/Michaelscarn69- </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c1a92t/how_do_you_manage_to_prevent_your_pc_from/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c1a92t/how_do_you_manage_to_prevent_your_pc_from/\">[comments]</a></span>", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c1a92t/how_do_you_manage_to_prevent_your_pc_from", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How do you manage to prevent your PC from shutting down while overseas?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-11T08:29:11+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, I'm trying to set up tabs in my homepage, but It's not working for me, my settings.yaml file has this content:</p> <p>``` settings.yaml: |</p> <p>title: &quot;&quot;</p> <p>startUrl: <a href=\"https://homepage.mydomain.com\">https://homepage.mydomain.com</a></p> <p>background: <a href=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502790671504-542ad42d5189?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2560&amp;q=80\">https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502790671504-542ad42d5189?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2560&amp;q=80</a></p> <p>favicon: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/favicon.ico\">https://www.google.com/favicon.ico</a></p> <p>theme: dark</p> <h1>groupsInitiallyCollapsed: true</h1> <h1>headerStyle: boxedWidgets</h1> <h1>statusStyle: &quot;dot&quot;</h1> <h1>hideErrors: true</h1> <p>fiveColumns: true</p> <p>layout:</p> <p>Media:</p> <p>tab: First</p> <h1>initiallyCollapsed: false</h1> <h1>header: false</h1> <p>Download Clients:</p> <p>tab: Second</p> <p>style: row</p> <p>co", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c19yn7/gethomepagedotdev_and_tabs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "gethomepage(dot)dev and tabs", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-11T08:27:31+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi,</p> <p>before shipping our products, we take photos of them including some specific information (e.g. order number) which can be seen in the photos in the form of an A4 printout.</p> <p>Now when a photo is needed, we can only search approximately with the date.
