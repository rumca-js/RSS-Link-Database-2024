<p>Grant Sanderson publishes animated explainers of mathematical topics on YouTube, to over 6 million subscribers. His latest shows how the attention mechanism in transformers (the algorithm behind most LLMs) works and is by far the clearest explanation I&#x27;ve seen of the topic anywhere.</p>

<p>I was intrigued to find out what tool he used to produce the visualizations. It turns out Grant built his own open source Python animation library, manim, to enable his YouTube work.</p>

<p>Neat, thoroughly documented recipe by Harper Reed using my LLM CLI tool as part of a scheme for if you&#x27;re feeling too lazy to write a commit message - it uses a prepare-commit-msg Git hook which runs any time you commit without a message and pipes your changes to a model along with a custom system prompt.</p>
