**A heavily edited portion of my first plays of Path of Achra**

 Path of Achra, a traditional roguelike with a dark aesthetic and increasingly deep lore. It encourages the player to combine and abuse a variety of artifacts and unique powers to become incredibly powerful.

 I really like this game. Give it a try!
