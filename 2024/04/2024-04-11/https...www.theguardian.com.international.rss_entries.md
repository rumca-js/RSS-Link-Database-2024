<p>Welcome returns at Liverpool, Arsenal and Villa juggle ambitions and Guimarães’s discipline under scrutiny</p><p>Should Bruno Guimarães be booked against Tottenham at St James’ Park the Newcastle and Brazil midfielder faces a dilemma. Given that Guimarães is on nine yellow cards, a 10th would trigger an automatic two-game suspension, depriving Eddie Howe of a key player for forthcoming games at Crystal Palace and at home to Sheffield United. Alternatively, Guimarães could make sure he collected a second yellow card, ideally late in stoppage time, and be sent off. In such a red card scenario, the sanction would merely be a one-game ban. Considering that Guimarães has managed to avoid a booking in 10 games since mid-January the best solution would be to extend that run to 11 matches and then relax in the knowledge that the accumulated bookings slate will be wiped clean after the Premier League’s 32nd game – Tottenham’s visit to Newcastle. Yet if the Brazilian transgresses do not be s

He had an extended feud with Brooks Koepka and publicly berated his own equipment manufacturer in between winning eight times on the PGA Tour.

<p>OJ Simpson, the former American football star, actor and notorious suspected double murderer, has died of cancer at 76.

<p>The fantasy tabletop role-playing game was conceived of by friends at the heart of Wisconsin’s gaming community, and has evolved to become a global phenomenon</p><p>There are 15 of us crammed into a cellar beneath a nondescript house in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. To the uninformed observer, there’s nothing to see down here: just two low rooms, bare breeze-block walls, a ceiling lined with pipes. Yet we’re all looking about the place in hushed awe, like tourists staring up at the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The people I’m with are journalists, bloggers and historians, most of them specialising in table-top games, and we’re here because this is not an ordinary basement. It sits beneath 330 Center Street, the one-time home of Dungeons &amp; Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax. And in February 1973 something happened here that would change the world of gaming, culture and entertainment for ever.</p><p>Across town, at the Grand Geneva Resort &amp; Spa, <a href="https://garycon.com/">Gary Con

<p>A bravura rewriting of Mark Twain’s classic from the enslaved Jim’s point of view</p><p>Percival Everett’s new novel lures the reader in with the brilliant simplicity of its central conceit. James is the retelling of Mark Twain’s 1884 classic, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, from the point of view of Jim, the runaway slave who joins Huck on his journey down&nbsp;the Mississippi river.</p><p>While it would be possible to enjoy James without knowing the original, its power derives from its engagement with Twain’s book. For British readers, it also helps to know something about the centrality of Huckleberry Finn in American literature – and African American discomfort with that centrality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/11/james-by-percival-everett-huckleberry-finn-reimagined">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Franchises have the opportunity to transform their fortunes in the coming weeks. But some need to land their selections more than others</p><p>In theory, the NFL draft is an even playing field. Unlike the Super Bowl, you don’t automatically win the draft because Patrick Mahomes is nestled on your roster. Teams are free to build draft capital or ship it away in lieu of constructing the missing parts of their roster through trades and free agency.</p><p>But the reality in 2024 is that, while a team like the Houston Texans can preen around for a while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/13/houstons-stroud-and-ryans-have-transformed-a-post-deshaun-watson-wasteland">after nailing last year’s draft</a>, the pressure for most other teams is sky high.
