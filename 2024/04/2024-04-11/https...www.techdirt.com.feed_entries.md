I&#8217;ve been watching this story since late last week. A lot of what I saw then showed this was going to end in embarrassment and exoneration for Albuquerque (NM) police chief Harold Medina. But I still held out hope the city might find something to criticize about the chain of events that left city resident [&#8230;]

Elon Musk’s favorite lawyer, Alex Spiro, isn’t having a great week.
