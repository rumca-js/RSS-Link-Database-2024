On Tuesday, May 9, singer-songwriter and piano player extraordinaire Ben Folds gave an unforgettable (and interactive!) Microshow performance at the Turf Club in St. Paul. During an energetic nine-song set that included several selections from his latest album, "What Matters Most" (out now on @NewWestRecords), Folds interspersed his set with rich, personal stories behind the new songs.
