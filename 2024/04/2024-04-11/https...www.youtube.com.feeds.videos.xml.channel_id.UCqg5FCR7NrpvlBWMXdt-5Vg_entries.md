We're currently in the midst of a Godzilla renaissance. With the release of Godzilla Minus One last year and the more recent Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, satisfying your cinematic Godzilla cravings has never been easier. However, amidst discussions comparing these two films, there's a regrettable tendency to dismiss Godzilla x Kong as if it never should have been made, simply because Godzilla Minus One, which won an Oscar, is considered superior â€“ and rightly so. Yet, this doesn't mean there isn't space in our vast cinematic universe for both versions of Godzilla to stomp across our screens.
