<p>X will no longer allow users to hide their blue checks, regardless of whether they paid for premium or not. On Thursday, the app began notifying users that “the hide your checkmark feature of X Premium is going away soon.”</p>

<p>Taylor Swift’s music has returned to TikTok after a ten-week hiatus, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/taylor-swift-songs-return-tiktok-1235967738/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Variety</ins></em></a>.

<p>It’s unclear what kind of deal Swift struck with TikTok to allow her to return to the platform, but we know one thing. The deal did not include provisions for fellow UMG artists, so Billie Eilish, The Weeknd and Drake, among others, are still missing from TikTok. Taylor Swift, being the most popular musician on the planet, likely worked some magic here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instagram’s status update feature, Notes, will soon be more prominent in the app. Up until now, Notes have only been visible from Instagram’s inbox, but the brief updates will soon also be visible directly on users’ profiles.</p>
<p>The change should increase the visibility of the feature and give people a new place to interact with their friends’ updates.

<p>Apple just dropped a trailer for another of its never-ending cavalcade of sci-fi shows. <em>Dark Matter</em> stars Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Connelly. It also happens to be based on a fantastic book by author Blake Crouch, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/holiday-gifts-best-books-movies-music-of-the-year-130030165.html">we recommended in 2021 after publication</a>. The show premieres on May 8 with two episodes.</p>
<div id="50bbe7cd984b4b04bc65189bbb96daca"></div>
<p>I’ve read the book, and love it, but there will be no real spoilers here. <em>Dark Matter</em> follows a physicist as he gets involved with some serious sci-fi shenanigans. The trailer gives a bit of the plot away, enough to understand that these particular sci-fi shenanigans are of the multiversal variety. Again, the book is a rip-roaring page turner, so the show should follow suit. The rest of the cast includes Jimmi Simpson, Alice Braga, Dayo Okeniyi and Oakes Fegley.</p>

You won't need to replace existing hardware with the Yale Approach Lock with Wi-Fi. It's an interior-only smart lock that Yale says takes just 10 minutes or so to install and you'll only need a screwdriver to help you get the job done. It also has a fairly slim profile as it will sit just 1.6 inches off the door.</p>
<p>Once the smart lock is installed, you'll be able to use features like Auto-Lock and Auto-Unlock. If you're away from home and want to let in a friend to water the plants or check on your pets, you can unlock the door remotely via the Yale Access app. What's more, the Yale Approach is renter-friendly. It sits on the back of most standard deadbolts and you (and your landlord) can keep using the same keys. In addition, Yale Ap

<p>Sony just announced a trio of new speakers in a new line of audio products called the ULT Power Series. This is an attempt by the company to reduce some of the clutter involved with its naming conventions, so <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-extra-bass-bluetooth-speakers-2020-180037114.html"><ins>say goodbye to the Extra Bass</ins></a> and XE-Series products. Both lines are being wrapped up into the ULT Power Series branding. To suit this new branding, each of the following speakers include something called the ULT button, which provides a bass boost.</p>
<p>The ULT Field 1 is your standard portable Bluetooth speaker. It’s compact and comes in a variety of colors, including black, white, gray and orange. The battery lasts around 12 hours per charge and the casing is IP67 water resistant, dustproof and shockproof. Like many of these ultra-portable Bluetooth speakers, the design lets users stand it on its end or lay it on its side, to make use of space. There’s also a built-in

<p>Sometimes, you’re in bed and the glow from your smart ring’s optical heart rate sensor creeps into your peripheral vision. It got me thinking about how Samsung (and potentially Apple) will join the smart ring market, and why that’s a terrible idea. You see, these companies want devices that make their presence known in your life, embedding themselves in your routine. But smart rings blend into the background on purpose, which limits how much you can, or will want, to do with them.</p>

It was also less maneuverable than other FPV drones and quite expensive.</p>
<p>Now, the company has released its successor, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=479372ad-6013-4434-bdb7-ebc5486af4cc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=DJI&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kamkuY29tL2F2YXRhLTIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVmNTEzNjBlLTFkYjUtNDBhOS05MjhhLTQxYzlhOTg0NmE4NyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfGt7vfsGU6rZzIPQbSpP1wW1dG1mk8BnkAIsaKoFrri&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2F

<p>Plenty of women who use rideshare services regularly send details of their trips to loved ones and take other precautionary measures, especially at night. Now, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-is-clamping-down-on-users-who-give-bad-ratings-just-to-get-refunds-164045280.html">Uber</a> is putting all its safety tools in one place, making them easier to access and allowing users to customize them so that they'd automatically switch on. In the app's new safety preferences section, passengers can choose to schedule when its safety tools should automatically get activated, whether it's for every ride after 9PM, on the weekends or only for rides that begin within 50 meters of a bar or a restaurant. They can also ensure that Uber's safety features are active for every single ride they take if they want to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the tools passengers can activate in the new portal is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-safety-features-audio-recordings-ridecheck-seat-belt-152849633.htm

<p>Many web browser companies offer VPNs these days, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ones-vpn-will-soon-be-available-to-all-subscribers-170006417.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-vpn-available-us-130025867.html">Mozilla</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opera-vpn-pro-android-beta-194504591.html">Opera</a>.

<p>I’ve found myself at a loss for words when trying to explain <a href="https://www.engadget.com/humanes-ai-pin-costs-699-and-ships-in-early-2024-which-is-about-all-we-know-for-certain-181048809.html">the Humane AI Pin</a> to my friends. The best description so far is that it’s a combination of a wearable Siri button with a camera and built-in projector that beams onto your palm. But each time I start explaining that, I get so caught up in pointing out its problems that I never really get to fully detail what the AI Pin can do. Or is meant to do, anyway.</p>
<p>Yet, words are crucial to the Humane AI experience. Your primary mode of interacting with the pin is through voice, accompanied by touch and gestures. Without speaking, your options are severely limited. The company describes the device as your “second brain,” but the combination of holding out my hand to see the projected screen, waving it around to navigate the interface and tapping my chest and waiting for an answer all jus

## The Morning After: Amazon stops paying bonuses to Alexa developers

<p>Amazon has cut paid perks for Alexa developers. With a bigger focus on generative AI, the voice assistant’s third-party apps (skills) aren’t a priority. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget that the “older programs have simply run their course, so we decided to sunset them.”</p>
<p>Launched in 2017, when Alexa was all the rage, the program paid developers bonuses for skills that resonated with users. It was part of Amazon’s quest to turn Alexa Skills into a booming app store. (Did that happen?)</p>
<p>At the company’s fall 2023 devices event, Amazon previewed its next-gen version of Alexa, with ChatGPT-like generative AI abilities. With AI powers, Alexa appeared versatile enough to address all sorts of queries and requests without creating apps and skills manually. Alexa isn’t going anywhere; Amazon is just making it think for itself.</p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz has released a preview of its <a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/mercedes-benz-eqs-sedan-introduces-extensive-updates-for-2025">2025 EQS electric vehicle</a> model that comes with a new grille design featuring chrome slats against a deep black background along with a standing star on its hood. With just those changes, the upcoming EQS more clearly resembles Benz's S-Class vehicles, its counterpart in the automaker's non-EV lineup, than its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-ev-review-video-150001883.html">predecessor</a> does. In addition to the more traditional Benz look and upgrades that make its seats more comfortable, the 2025 EQS will also come with a larger battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its new battery has a larger usable capacity of 118 kWh, compared to the older model's 108.4 kWh. Of course, the higher the kWh, the longer an EV's range is — the first EQS had an EPA-estimated 350 mile-range, so expect Mercedes to announce a longer range than that. Th

<p>Even though we at Engadget test and review a number of new Windows laptops every year, the cheapest notebooks don’t often make headlines. You won’t find pricey panels on these machines, nor will they include the latest high-powered graphics cards or ultra thin-and-light designs. But they have their place and can do a lot of things well. And it’s worth noting that not everyone needs a pro-level laptop — they just need the best machine that will fit their budget.<br /><br />Companies like Acer, Dell and Lenovo make plenty of cheap Windows laptops that can be great for those who primarily use a computer to check email, shop online and occasionally video chat with friends and family. They can also be great for kids who have no business touching their parents’ pricey daily driver. We’ve tested a number of budget-friendly Windows notebooks — these are our favorites below, and we outline some buying advice for anyone looking for a cheap Windows laptop that balances capability with afforda

<p>In an interview with the channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2116161069"><em>TweakMusicTips</em></a>, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy said that DJ streamers on the platform will have to share their revenue with music labels. As posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/zachbussey/status/1778136765854822475">Zach Bussey on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Clancy said that Twitch is working on a &quot;structure,&quot; wherein DJs and the platform &quot;are gonna have to share money with the labels.&quot; He said he's already talked to some DJs about it. The DJs, of course, realized that they'd rather not share what they earn. But Clancy said that Twitch will pay part of what the labels are owed, while the DJs hand over a portion of their revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clancy's statement was part of his response to the host's question about the copyright situation of music streamers on the platform. The CEO replied that Twitch has been talking to music labels about it in hopes of finding a stable soluti

## Overwatch 2 introduces harsher punishments for players who leave mid-match

<p>Blizzard is taking mid-match leaves on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-players-wont-have-to-pay-or-grind-through-a-battle-pass-to-unlock-new-heroes-183729811.html"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a> more seriously and is <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24061006/">implementing harsher punishments</a> when Season 10 arrives. People playing Unranked games won't be able to join a queue for five minutes after leaving two of their last 20 games. And if they leave at least 10 out of the last 20, they'll be suspended for 48 hours. Players probably want to be even more careful when it comes to leaving Competitive games, though, because doing so 10 times out of 20 will get them banned for the rest of the season. In its announcement, Blizzard said that while it's aware not everyone abandons a game on purpose, these changes &quot;should help curb those players who deliberately choose to leave a match.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
