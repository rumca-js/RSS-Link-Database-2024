Such is his obsession, he pointed out it is eight finals if you count the Super Cups.</p><p>Villa’s quest to win the Europa Conference League remains on after goals from Ollie Watkins and John McGinn earned victory in front of a pair of royals but Bafodé Diakité’s late header dampened their enthusiasm and gives Lille hope for the return leg.

<p>Despite rebellion, approval of £18.7m package opens door to likelihood of US-style executive pay elsewhere</p><p>Is Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, “massively underpaid”, as the chief investment officer of Florida-based GQG Partners, one of the company’s big shareholders, argued this week? Well, of course he’s not. Soriot has been paid £120m over the past decade, which is a helluva sum even for someone who has been brilliantly successful in leading what is now – but wasn’t when he arrived – the UK’s second-largest listed company.</p><p>The history-turning moment in 2014, when AZ and Soriot managed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/26/pfizer-abandons-attempt-astrazeneca-pharmaceutical">see off a bid</a> from Pfizer’s grim number-crunchers, has probably been worth many multiples of £120m to the UK economy. But such a sum for a single employee in an organisation of 90,000 still looks absurd: Soriot doesn’t do all the work himself.</p> <a href

<p>When women write complex characters, filled with desire, anger or self-destructive urges, why are their books touted as ‘sad’ and frivolous – unlike those of inward-looking male authors'?</p><p>What do we mean when we say a novel is a “sad girl novel”? I could list a dozen popular novels published over the last few years that have had this term slapped on them. What do they have in common? Most often a protagonist who is at times miserable and disaffected, who is suffering under capitalism, who is ambivalent about their sexual experiences and their relationships with others. Usually they are highly educated and frequently analyse their own situation. Sometimes they are grieving, often they are bored. By this metric <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/01/karl-ove-knausgaard-wolves-of-eternity-my-struggle-interview">Karl Ove Knausgaard</a> is perhaps our foremost sad girl novelist, a master of the form. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/17/real-life-

<p>The Christina Applegate-led dark comedy from the 90s gets a shrewdly made update that acts as a blueprint for how Hollywood should revisit older material</p><p>Don’t Tell Mom the Babysitter’s Dead is the ultimate ode to the latchkey generation. To watch the 1991 film now is to be reminded of a simpler time when parents barely checked in, house parties were all the rage and Christina Applegate was the ideal girl next door. Given its place in the grand tradition of coming-of-age classics, somewhere between Tom Hanks’s Big and Jennifer Garner’s 13 Going on 30, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood mulled a remake of Applegate’s celluloid breakout. Any update would have to relate to a new generation that, in many ways, has had to grow up even faster than their predecessors.</p><p>The reboot, which comes courtesy of Paramount streamer BET+, doesn’t just understand this assignment; it nails it. The new film echoes the wit and charm of the original with a major twist: now the blac

<p>The radical right is correct that the west is waning. But it’s rampant capitalism and endless wars that are causing its collapse, not ‘wokeness’</p><p>This century has one overarching theme: the fall of the west, that is, the US and its European allies. Every major crisis accelerates the unmistakable trend. The war in Gaza is just the latest manifestation. Western newspapers are now littered with articles full of the panicked realisation that more is buried in the rubble of Gaza than<strong> </strong>just thousands of unidentified bodies. “The damage to Israel’s reputation,” writes Matthew Parris in the<em> </em>Times, “so much less manifest than shattered hospitals in Gaza, is incalculable.” Yes, but it would be an error to believe that it is Israel’s problem alone.

All the other houses, still referred to by the surnames of departed families, have been sold as second homes and holiday lets and rumoured Senedd legislation might force the couple to also sell-up, allowing them the freedom to move closer to bus routes, hospitals and pubs that aren’t only open during the summer season.<br /><br />In several respects, Lucie Lovatt’s play is a provocative and ambitious dramatic proposition. Elaborately plotted and directed at a swift pace by Chelsey Gillard on Elin Steele’s living room set, it refrains from being a polemic even if the outsider characters, Bristolian Max (Gus Gordon) and estate agent Gareth (Jamie Redford) sometimes appear as convenient

<p>This absorbing exploration of nostalgia raises questions about its slippery nature, and shows how it has been chillingly deployed in politics, from the cold war to Trumpism</p><p>In the 1970s there were American press&nbsp;reports of an Iowa man who was&nbsp;tormented by his yearning for&nbsp;the&nbsp;16-year stretch of time that ran&nbsp;from 1752 to 1768. His misery was the&nbsp;result of not being able to find anyone who shared this deep nostalgia for a&nbsp;period when electricity was still a&nbsp;rumour and America was proud to think of itself as British.</p><p>But does this really count as nostalgia? Is it not, actually, a bid for attention, a way for the man from Iowa to signal that, while his body might be&nbsp;tethered to the cornfields, his mind is&nbsp;free to roam in exquisite pastures where gentlemen routinely wear wigs and night-time travel is best reserved for a full moon?

When the diagnosis was delivered in the consultant’s office, her mother fainted, quietly sliding off her chair and on to the floor. After months of gruelling treatment, Crampton was given the all-clear and went to university as planned. But in her first year, she found a lump on her neck that turned&nbsp;out to be a tumour. Crampton had further chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant, which was followed by weeks in an isolation ward and a period of close monitoring. At 22, she was declared cancer-free, and, five years later, had her last check-up. By then, she was told, she had no more chance of getting cancer than the rest of the population.</p><p>What those check-ups didn’t address was the anxiety that had embedded itself in her p

<p>Scottish comedian Richard Gadd’s borderline horror about a female stalker is brilliantly eerie. It’s tense, creepily filmed television that will stay with you for a long time to come</p><p>Never have the words “sent from my iPhone” been so chilling. Baby Reindeer is an adaptation of Richard Gadd’s acclaimed one-man play, which hammered out the horrifying story of his experience of being stalked by a middle-aged woman named Martha, who he meets at the pub where he works. She gets hold of his email address, and starts to message him, incessantly, sometimes coherently, sometimes not, all through the night, every night. The emails end with, “sent from my iPhone”. In the show, Gadd’s alter ego, Donny Dunn, has a realisation: Martha doesn’t have an iPhone. At first, Baby Reindeer is chilling in small instances like this. But as Martha’s behaviour becomes more obsessive, and Donny’s more self-destructive, the two become locked in a terrible downward spiral. This is a self-loathing horror

<p>Ramsay’s brilliant rendering of a child’s experience during the 1975 Glasgow bin-collectors’ strike, spiked with a horrifying twist of fate, remains masterful</p><p>Twenty-five years ago, we saw one of the most impressive debut features in modern British movie history. Ratcatcher, by the 29-year-old Glasgow film-maker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/25/lynne-ramsay-director-you-were-never-really-here-observer-interview">Lynne Ramsay</a>, was a visually haunting, passionate piece of work to compare with Terence Davies or Ken Loach and which set a gold standard of artistry for new social realist cinema – or cinema of any sort – in the UK. I remember how blown away I was when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/nov/12/5">I saw it at the Edinburgh film festival</a>, especially by the rippling, sunlit fields at which a troubled child gazes, framed by the doorway of the half-built council house development outside Glasgow.
