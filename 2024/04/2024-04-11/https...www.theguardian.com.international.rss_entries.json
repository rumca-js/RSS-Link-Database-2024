According to the mainstream media, I\u2019m a free-loading, red-light dodging, unregistered road warrior cruising on expensive cycle paths that would be better redesigned as traffic lanes.</p><p>Yet every day I cycle, people smile at me. Tradies in utes lean out the window and give me the thumbs up. The other day a young woman stopped me and asked if she could take my photo. When I pause for the obligatory coffee midway through my ride, it\u2019s not uncommon for other diners to approach me, their faces beaming. When I share the footpath with pedestrians, they always make room for me after I sound my bell. Most of them grin and wave.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/12/im-a-popular-cyclist-but-only-when-i-bring-my-toy-poodle-along-for-the-ride\">Continue reading...</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/12/im-a-popular-cyclist-but-only-when-i-bring-my-toy-poodle-along-for-the-ride", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "source_obj__id": 341, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4dc7d8dbf04d3c15a8aee5a80c6c3aa4afb9032/0_219_1622_973/master/1622.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9363ad08412f319893008f6b2555f893", "title": "I\u2019m a popular cyclist \u2013 but only when I bring my toy poodle along for the ride | Steven Herrick", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-11T14:43:16+00:00", "description": "<p>Patients were hospitalized after receiving Botox or possibly fake Botox, and showing symptoms that aligned with botulism</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/botulism-botox-fake-us-states-cdc-rcna147275\">reportedly investigating</a> several cases of Botox-related illnesses and will warn doctors across the United States about fake Botox injections after several people have been hospitalized.</p><p>Health officials in Tennessee and Illinois this week said they were investigating cases of botulism-like illnesses that appeared connected to Botox injections received in a non-medical setting.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/11/fake-botox-illness-botulism\">Continue reading...</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/11/fake-botox-illness-botulism", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "source_obj__id": 341, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/319443c6cd3ac77dad78460740f06e7df6baa862/141_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=46b2a5c836ad0bc776cb99ba2854eb58", "title": "CDC reportedly investigating several cases of illnesses from Botox injections", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-11T14:03:52+00:00", "description": "<p>US-backed proposal involves women, children and elderly or sick hostages in Gaza being exchanged for 900 Palestinian prisoners</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/apr/11/middle-east-crisis-live-us-urges-irans-neighbours-to-help-lower-tensions-with-israel-reports\">Middle East crisis \u2013 live updates</a></li></ul><p>The Palestinian militant group Hamas has indicated it does not have 40 captives who are still alive who meet the \u201chumanitarian\u201d criteria for a proposed hostages-for-prisoners ceasefire agreement with Israel.</p><p>A senior Israeli official confirmed claims made at the weekend by Hamas during talks in Cairo that it does not have 40 hostages in Gaza who meet the exchange criteria.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-events/2024/feb/16/guardian-newsroom-the-unfolding-crisis-in-the-middle-east\">Guardian Newsroom: Crisis in the Middle East</a><br />On Tuesday 30 April, 7-8.15pm GMT, join Devika Bhat, Peter Beaumont, Emma Graha", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/11/hamas-says-it-does-not-have-40-hostages-who-fit-criteria-for-deal-with-israel", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "source_obj__id": 341, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43500cc33bf88ddcbee97e6f07432531be476e71/0_367_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=62383e7766bfcba75207d9d01adef230", "title": "Hamas says it does not have 40 hostages who fit criteria for deal with Israel", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-11T14:00:15+00:00", "description": "<p><strong>Morley/Moore<br />Orchid Classics</strong><br />Erin Morley brings artless precision and liquid phrasing to her debut recording</p><p>E<a href=\"https://www.erinmorley.com/\">rin Morley</a> walks straight up into the front rank of high coloratura sopranos with her debut solo recording.
