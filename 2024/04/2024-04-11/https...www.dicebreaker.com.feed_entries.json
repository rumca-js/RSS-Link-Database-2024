Certain completed words will score higher than others depending on which letters have been used, with more uncommonly used letters like Q and V scoring more. Players will also need to place their letter tiles adjacent to ones already placed on the board, thereby utilising existing letters and words to score.</p><p>The new version of Scrabble features a mode for players to collaborate in order to form words and score, called Scrabble Together.
