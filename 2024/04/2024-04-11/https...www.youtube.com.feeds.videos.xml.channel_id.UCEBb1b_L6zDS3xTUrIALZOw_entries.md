Introduces dictionaries, their keys and values, their mutability, and iteration over a dictionary with examples. Dictionaries have entries that map a key to a value. Keys are immutable/hashable and unique objects while values can be any object. Dictionaries can make code efficient implementation-wise and runtime-wise.

An introduction to control flow and iteration through loops. Looping mechanisms include while and for loops. Lots of syntax today, be sure to get lots of practice! While loops loop as long as a condition is true and you need to make sure you don’t enter an infinite loop. For loops can loop over ranges of numbers and elements of a string.

This lecture explains iteration in simple programs like guess-and-check, binaries, and fractions in Python. Loops can iterate over any sequence of values including a range for numbers or a string. Guess-and-check provides a simple algorithm for solving problems. When the set of potential solutions is enumerable, exhaustive enumeration is guaranteed to work (eventually). Binary numbers help us understand how the machine works. Converting to binary will help us understand how decimal numbers are stored
