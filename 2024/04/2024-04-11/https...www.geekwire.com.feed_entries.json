MagicSchool AI, a Denver, Colo.-based company founded last year, also offers separate tools for students designed to enhance learning and teach responsible AI use. SPS will provide MagicSchool software to both teachers and students, and has prepared resources to help introduce the new programs.

That was down 12% from $33.2 million in compensation in 2022. The drop was primarily due to the decline in Amazon\u2019s share price last year (especially earlier in the year, when many of Jassy\u2019s shares vested) and the fact that the Amazon CEO had fewer shares vest in 2023 than in 2022. Those figures are described in Amazon&#8217;s proxy statement Thursday as &#8220;realized compensation,&#8221; which refers&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/exec-pay-new-filing-shows-how-much-amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-made-in-2023/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/exec-pay-new-filing-shows-how-much-amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-made-in-2023", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Exec pay: New filing shows how much Amazon CEO Andy Jassy made in compensation in 2023", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-11T00:16:19+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mitch-gold-1260x840.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Boston-based biotech company Vertex Pharmaceuticals agreed to acquire Seattle-based Alpine Immune Sciences for $65 per share, totaling about $4.9 billion in cash, a 38% premium over Alpine&#8217;s closing price on Wednesday afternoon.
