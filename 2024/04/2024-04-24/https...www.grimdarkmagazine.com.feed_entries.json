The original series, starring Trevor Belmont (voiced by Richard Armitage) and Sypha Belnades (Alejandra Reynos), was a loose adaptation of Castlevania III with Dracula as the main antagonist for the first two seasons. It lasted four seasons and was generally very well received by both fans of the game as well as newcomers. Making a new series with a new cast seemed a reasonable assumption given the video games&#8217; continuing storyline as well as Warren Ellis being terminated from the project for reasons that you can research on your own. Fans of Castlevania: Rondo of Blood will note that this story has very little in common with the video game version of the story. For whatever reason, they chose not to bring back Dracula for this installment of Castlevania and that is going to rub a lot of fans the wrong way. I feel like this was a mistake and ", "language": "en-AU", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-castlevania-nocturne", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 137, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "REVIEW: Castlevania: Nocturne", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
