In fact, you can build a working cloud chamber\u2014a device capable of revealing the cosmic radiation and radon decay events that go on continuously around us\u2014with just a block of dry ice, some rubbing alcohol, and a few objects you probably already have in your kitchen. What\u2019s more, constructing the cloud chamber only takes about an hour, making it an ideal project for an introductory physics class, for intellectually engaged nonscientists, or even for curious kindergartners (with some adult supervision!). In this interview, engineering professor Anne White discusses the pedagogical usefulness of such hands-on activities\u2014and at the other end of the spectrum, she describes her enthusiasm for a much, much larger physics project, the decades-long effort to put nuclear fusion to practical use as a source of clean power for the world. The interview also touches on Prof. White\u2019s experience of mentorship, both as ", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S35LQ2NqB1Q", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCEBb1b_L6zDS3xTUrIALZOw", "source_obj__id": 437, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/S35LQ2NqB1Q/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Kitchen Cloud Chamber with Prof. Anne White", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-24T12:54:22+00:00", "description": "MIT 6.100L Introduction to CS and Programming using Python, Fall 2022\nInstructor: Ana Bell\n\nView the complete course: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/\nYouTube Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP62A-ynp6v6-LGBCzeH3VAQB\n\nThis lecture discusses the simple algorithms of bisection search and Newton-Raphson.

Lists and tuples provide a way to organize data that naturally supports iterative functions. Tuples are useful when you have data that doesn\u2019t need to change, e.g., (latitude, longitude) or (page #, line #). Lists are useful in dynamic situations, e.g., a list of daily top 40 songs or a list of recently watched movies.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\nMore courses at https://ocw.mit.edu\nSupport OCW at http://ow.ly/a1If50zVRlQ\n\nWe encourage constructive comments and discussion on OCW\u2019s YouTube and other social media channels.
