Gentle and uplifting, it follows three British girls and a boy as they prepare for their bat and barmitzvahs, the Jewish rite of passage that will mark their transition at 13 into adulthood.

His rabbi, Miriam, talks him through other texts and commentaries on the story

<p>The two deputies had another chance to trade blows but it was a one-sided contest, as Angela Rayner went in for the kill</p><p>It had come billed as the great set-piece of the parliamentary week. Month even. With Rishi Sunak away in Germany – strange how the prime minister so often finds the only free slot in his diary is a Wednesday – prime minister’s questions was delegated to the two deputies.</p><p>The first time Oliver Dowden and Angela Rayner had had a chance to go head to head since the Daily Mail had taken a voyeuristic interest in the possibility that Labour’s deputy leader had failed to pay capital gains tax on the sale of a home. There are now reportedly 12 police officers investigating the disputed £1.4K. Obviously a terrific use of resources.

<p>A desperate prime minister has given up trying to meaningfully account for the money he is putting into pre-election promises</p><p>According to the myth, Catherine II’s courtier Grigory Potemkin recruited peasants to populate fake villages erected along the Dnipro River, so the Russian empress, passing in her barge, might get a favourable impression of conditions in newly conquered Crimea. Historians doubt that it happened, but the idea of counterfeiting progress to appease the boss was plausible enough for the name “Potemkin village” to have stuck.</p><p>In a democracy, the boss is the electorate, which leads governments to erect Potemkin policies – paper pledges puffed up as substantial measures – to convince voters that all is well.

It’s one line in a very long book full of other very good lines. This was the audiobook of Ian Kershaw’s seminal biography of Adolf Hitler.

I was driving on a bleak day on a country road when I heard it for the first time. I instantly rewound to hear it again, and then again. And then when I got to where I was going I bought the book itself so I could see it as well as hear it. The line torments me still.

## I worry that hugging people could come across as creepy. So, from now on, all you’re getting is a handshake | Adrian Chiles

<p>This seems a better way to say hello than giving a little bow or a wave – but maybe I’m overthinking the whole process</p><p>I gave up hugging people just before Christmas; I thought it was for the best. I’m in my mid-50s, possibly a bit smelly and live in fear of coming over as a bit creepy. I work with a lot of young people, at least half of them women, who are mostly in their 20s, and it was getting harder and harder to pull off a brotherly hug when the hugs were feeling fatherly or even grandfatherly. Or just, you know, a bit creepy.</p><p>Several months on, reviewing this first phase of my post-hugging life, I believe I took the right decision. Put it this way: I really can’t think of anyone I’ve met who I’ve sensed felt short-changed by the absence of a hug from me. I have seen no cloud of disappointment pass over anyone’s face. No one seems to be feeling left out, least of all younger women, who, unsurprisingly I suppose – turn out to be decidedly comfortable with a handshak

The idea that LA is a superficial place arose from each of us being in our own automobile bubble, not having face-to-face interactions. As a photographer, I always felt stifled in the car. I had an itch to be outside. But I was thinking about how I could use the car as part of my work. Eventually I realised it could be a mobile studio, with sunroof, windows, tail and headlights.

How about Most Excellent Keeper of the Belfry? It has a nice ring about it, even if I have done nothing to deserve it.

<p>The 19-year-old climbing protege is backed by dad Tristian, who built a wall in the garden and coached his son to the top</p><p>When climbing’s Tokyo 2020 debut was announced in 2016, 12-year-old Toby Roberts from Surrey was “instantly hooked” by an Olympic dream but he would be too young to compete in Japan. Instead he hatched an eight-year plan targeting the 2024 Games, with non-climber dad Tristian supporting as rope-holder, coach, taxi “and bank” – even building a climbing wall in the garden of the family home. This summer their shared ambition will culminate high on the Olympic walls in Paris.</p><p>Roberts is now 19 and his love for his sport is stronger than ever. He says more than 20 times during this interview that “I love climbing/training/competing/trying hard”. His parents Tristian and Marina couldn’t be prouder. “It’s been a privilege – it’s inspiring to see how hard he works,” Tristian says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/24/toby-the-terminato

From suburban Britain to industrial Germany and parched Arizona, we explore a show celebrating green borders</p><p>Somewhere in the leafy depths of British suburbia, a thick circular hedge sprouts from the top of a grassy hill in the middle of a roundabout. The top of the hedge is carefully trimmed with rectangular crenellations, giving it the look of a motte-and-bailey castle, while a second more threadbare hedge encircles the foot of the mound, like another layer of defence. The surrounding streets are lined with more hedges, some neatly trimmed, some left wild, some poking up behind high brick walls, others climbing even higher than the homes they shield.<br /><br />This single image, taken by photographer <a href="https://garethgardner.com/portfolio/route-book-2">Gareth Gardner</a>, somehow encapsulates all of the anxieties and ambitions of the great British hedge.

<p>The exhilarating story of an art fraudster’s downfall, by his former friend and partner</p><p>In 2020 Inigo Philbrick was arrested by the FBI on the Pacific island of Vanuatu and brought to Manhattan in handcuffs. He was wanted for his part in one of the biggest art frauds in history. Still only in his early 30s, he was accused of duping art investors into parting with around $86m. Lawsuits were piling up, accusing him of forging legal documents, double-dealing priceless artworks and refusing to pay enormous debts to people he still called friends, (although the feeling almost certainly wasn’t mutual). Found guilty and banged up in the jail where Epstein killed himself, he was eventually shipped out to a low security prison to serve seven years. In the end he got out after three, which only goes to show that Philbrick has the luck of the devil.</p><p>In this exhilarating book, Orlando Whitfield tells the story of his former friend’s downfall in thrilling detail.

The entire neighbourhood had been trying, without luck, to look for her.</p><p>And then, one day, when I was looking out of the window, I saw Karma peeking out from the dilapidated shed at the bottom of my garden, just a couple of doors down from her official home.

<p>Every match comprises hundreds of contests between batter and bowler. If statistics are your thing, it’s mesmerising</p><p>Let’s start, as all bad pieces of writing should, with a cliche: cricket is an individual sport dressed as a team game. Every match comprises hundreds or thousands of contests between a batter and a bowler. That unusual gameplay is one of the main reasons why Test cricket, in particular, touches the parts other sports cannot reach. But never mind all that soulful, meaning-of-life stuff; we’re here to talk about the joys of the humble statgasm.</p><p>Ever since doing a statistical preview of the 2002-03 Ashes for Wisden Cricket Monthly, an impossible glamorous commission for a budding anorak hack, The Spin has been fascinated by head-to-head averages, especially in Test cricket.

<p>Today’s pop stars are cramming songs with so much biography they need footnotes – and they’re in danger of alienating all but their hardcore fans</p><p>When Taylor Swift released Reputation in 2017, she self-published an accompanying magazine while avoiding interviews. “When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test,” she wrote in an essay. The sentiment oozed with contempt for playing dot-to-dot with her lyrics – even though, from her debut album to Reputation’s predecessor 1989, Swift left clues in her liner notes that clearly indicated whom certain songs were about.</p><p>Seven years on, and Swift’s new album, The Tortured Poets Department, couldn’t be more transparent about its subjects – typewriters and tattoos lighting a path to the 1975’s Matty Healy, whom she had a fling with last spring; Hampstead Heath and “longsuffering propriety” referri

<p>The alarming rate of racism against people from east and south-east Asian communities is rarely discussed.

This experience was not new and, four years on, it has not gone away.</p><p>During the pandemic, hate crime against the ESEA community rose by almost 70%, underpinned by a xenophobic framing of the virus’ origin.

<p>His uncensored journals disclose a messier, more sexual, complex figure – and reveal much about the process of writing</p><p>In the late summer of 1917, following the first signs of the tuberculosis that would kill him within a decade, Franz Kafka went to stay with his sister in the Bohemian countryside. During this unexpectedly calm period in an otherwise perennially besieged life, he wrote a series of aphorisms. One of them runs: “The true path is along a rope, not a rope suspended way up in the air, but rather only just over the ground. It seems more&nbsp;like a tripwire than a tightrope.”</p><p>He might have been describing the path to the true Kafka, which writers, biographers and academics have been attempting to chart ever since he died. Even Reiner Stach, author of the definitive Kafka biography, chose to&nbsp;end that nearly 2,000-page work on&nbsp;a note of uncertainty, quoting the Prague writer Johannes Urzidil, who said Kafka’s intimates could theorise about what his wo

<p>After years of failed gimmicks and polarisation under the Tories, Britain is ready for a more grown-up approach</p><p>“Look, if people don’t like the mug, they don’t have to get the mug,” Ed Miliband said, exasperated. We were on a train to Manchester for a televised leaders’ debate, a month before polling day in 2015. The mug in question bore the slogan “controls on immigration”.
