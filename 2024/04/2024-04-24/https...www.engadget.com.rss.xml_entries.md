<p>Meta‚Äôs Threads app now has more than 150 million monthly users, an increase of about 20 million new users <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-reality-labs-had-its-best-quarter-but-still-lost-4-billion-231135719.html">since February</a>. Mark Zuckerberg shared the latest user numbers during Meta‚Äô‚Äôs first-quarter earnings call, saying that the app ‚Äúcontinues to be on the trajectory that I hope to see.‚Äù</p>
<p>The update suggests Threads is continuing to grow steadily, though at a slower rate than its initial explosive growth. The app racked up more than 100 million downloads in its first week, but later saw <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-users-are-already-spending-less-time-in-the-app-182738755.html"><ins>a drop-off</ins></a> in engagement.

<p>The EU has effectively vanquished a TikTok feature that Europe‚Äôs digital commissioner described as ‚Äútoxic‚Äù and ‚Äúaddictive as cigarettes.‚Äù Owner ByteDance said on Wednesday that TikTok Lite‚Äôs reward-to-watch feature would be suspended. It‚Äôs been a brutal day for TikTok as President Biden signed a bill (also on Wednesday) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-signs-the-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok-in-the-united-states-154106950.html">forcing ByteDance to sell the platform‚Äôs US operations</a> or face a ban.</p>
<p>TikTok Lite, launched earlier this month in France and Spain, lets users earn rewards by watching and liking videos. They can then exchange their points for real-world perks like Amazon vouchers or in-app ones like TikTok‚Äôs virtual currency, which is used to tip creators. The EU Commission said the ‚Äútask and reward‚Äù feature <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-eu-opens-an-investigation-into-tiktok-lite-citing-addiction-concerns-180025326.html">can

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-20-pubg-early-access-chang-han-kim-interview.html"><em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em></a> is somehow old enough to evoke nostalgia. The pioneering battle royale game, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-17-playerunknowns-battlegrounds-sets-all-time-peak-user-record.html">entered Steam Early Access in 2017</a>, will borrow a page from <em>Fortnite</em>‚Äôs playbook and honor its first map. <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://pubg.com/en-na/news/7282">Erangel Classic</a> will recreate the old-school battlefield from the game‚Äôs inception for a limited two-week run in May and June.</p>

It‚Äôs now called Blueprint and brings several features that should make your next flight just a teensy-bit less grueling. The biggest news here is a watch party feature that lets customers view the same TV show or film with up to five other people.</p>
<p>This is actually pretty cool, as watching stuff with friends and family during a long flight typically requires the finicky ‚Äúpush play at the exact same time and hope nobody has to go to the bathroom‚Äù method. The watch party feature includes functionality that pauses content for all viewers, should one have to take a break to deal with existential panic from being six miles above the ground. It also works no matter where the seats are.</

<p>Threads users may soon have a new way to clean up their timelines. The app is testing a new archive feature that can be used to manually archive individual posts or automatically hide posts after a set period of time, Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C6Jq-r-xVpM"><ins>shared</ins></a>.</p>
<p>As on Instagram, archiving a post on Threads will hide it from public view, though the post will be available to the original author to view or undo. The Instagram head said the feature will be available to a ‚Äúsmall number of people‚Äù to start. Though optional, Mosseri has made no secret that his preference is for all posts on the service to be somewhat ephemeral. ‚ÄúI think we should move to automatically archive posts on Threads after a month or so,‚Äù he wrote in a post back <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C34VDq1OLTR?hl=en"><ins>in February</ins></a>.</p>

<p>Several months after Meta <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-debuts-passkey-logins-on-android-122036260.html">brought WhatsApp passkey logins to Android</a>, it‚Äôs doing the same on iOS. The company is rolling out the feature now, and it will be available to all users in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Passkeys are seen as a more secure login method as (for one thing) it mitigates the risk of scammers convincing users to share their SMS passcode. Instead, you can log in by verifying a passkey using facial recognition, biometrics or a PIN stored on Apple‚Äôs passkey manager. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/passkeys-passwords-authentication-security-133024414.html">Passkeys work</a> by securely storing an authentication credential on your device that pairs with one saved by the service you want to log into.</p>

<p>&quot;Noncompete clauses keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism,&quot; said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan.

<p>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, aka the Gelandewagen (which means &quot;all-terrain vehicle&quot; in German) has been in regular production since 1979. It's changed a lot since then, evolving from a utilitarian off-roader to a desirable luxury icon, but it's never seen a change quite like this.</p>
<p>Meet the Mercedes-Benz G 580 with EQ Technology. That's a long and mild name for a pretty radical reinvention of the classic G. This is the first battery-powered G-Wagen, driven by a whopping four electric motors that draw juice from a 116-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Total output is 580 horsepower.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those four motors enable the electric G to do some amazing things, like a so-called G-Turn, where it spins in place. The idea is to help this big rig get out of some tight off-road situations, but we think it'll be even more effective a

<p>Back in 2022, Mercedes-Benz announced that it was going to release an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-electric-g-class-suv-2024-172226776.html">electric G-Class</a> by the end of 2024. Now, the automaker has formally introduced the electrified version of its iconic luxury vehicle that's known for its exclusivity. The <a href="https://media.mercedes-benz.com/press-kit/e3fb1e08-0558-4228-adb8-534c42940074">Mercedes-Benz G 580 with EQ Technology</a> comes equipped with a 116 kWh lithium-ion battery that gives it enough energy to run for up to 473 kilometers (294 miles) on a single charge. It also has a maximum total output of 432 kW and a maximum torque of 1,164 Nm.</p>
<p>The electric model looks pretty much like the gas-powered G-Class, with its sharp angles and its distinctive door handles, grilles and round headlights. Mercedes offers optional lighting exclusive to the EQ version of the vehicle, though, so you can change its looks and give it a design that's consid

<p>The European Union has adopted a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240419IPR20590/right-to-repair-making-repair-easier-and-more-appealing-to-consumers">right-to-repair directive</a> that will make it easier for consumers to get their devices fixed. The <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6461-2024-INIT/en/pdf">new rules</a> extend a product's guarantee if it breaks under warranty, while obliging manufacturers to repair devices no longer covered. The law still needs to be approved by member nations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devices sold in Europe already offer minimum two-year warranties, but the new rules impose additional requirements. If a device is repaired under warranty, the customer must be given a choice between a replacement or a repair. If they choose the latter, the warranty is to be extended by a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A bill that could ban TikTok is now all but certain to become law. The Senate approved a measure that requires ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a ban, in a vote of 79 - 18. The “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,” will next head to President Joe Biden, who has said he <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-says-he-would-sign-bill-that-would-force-a-sale-or-ban-of-tiktok-232221156.html"><ins>would sign</ins></a> the bill into law.</p>
<p>While it’s far from the first effort to force a ban or divestment of the social media app, the bill managed to draw far more support than previous attempts. The bill was introduced <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/lawmakers-have-a-new-plan-to-force-bytedance-to-sell-tiktok-220408004.html"><ins>in March</ins></a> and sailed through the House of Representatives with <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/house-passes-bill-that-could-ban
