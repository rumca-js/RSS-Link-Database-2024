Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at the big surprise development that has effectively banned TikTok unless it chooses to divest itself or leave one of the biggest countries. It has one year and while I have no doubt Bytedance will put up the biggest legal fights it can, it's scary to think now that whole apps can be banned in one of the most free nations in the world. Thanks for watching!
