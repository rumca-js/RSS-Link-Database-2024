Instead, the device simply said OK and told me it sent the words “Hey Julian, just checking in. How&#x27;s your day going?” to Chokkattu. I&#x27;ve never said anything like that to him in our years of friendship, but I guess technically the AI Pin did do what I asked.</p></blockquote><p class="cite">&mdash; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-humane-ai-pin-is-the-solution-to-none-of-technologys-problems-120002469.html">Cherlynn Low</a>

<p>Apple released something big three hours ago, and I&#x27;m still trying to get my head around exactly what it is.</p>

<p>The parent project is called CoreNet, described as &quot;A library for training deep neural networks&quot;. Part of the release is a new LLM called OpenELM, which includes completely open source training code and a large number of published training checkpoint.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m linking here to the best documentation I&#x27;ve found of that training data: it looks like the bulk of it comes from RefinedWeb, RedPajama, The Pile and Dolma.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.muledesign.com/blog/on-surveys"><p>A bad survey won’t tell you it’s bad. It’s actually really hard to find out that a bad survey is bad — or to tell whether you have written a good or bad set of questions. Bad code will have bugs. A bad interface design will fail a usability test. It’s possible to tell whether you are having a bad user interview right away. Feedback from a bad survey can only come in the form of a second source of information contradicting your analysis of the survey results.<br /><br />Most seductively, surveys yield responses that are easy to count and counting things feels so certain and objective and truthful.<br /><br />Even if you are counting lies.</p></blockquote><p class="cite">&mdash; <a href="https://www.muledesign.com/blog/on-surveys">Erika Hall</a>
