The Walking Dead is arguably one of the most famous zombie IPs (or indeed any IP) of the last 20 years, conceived by the writer who brought us Invincible and many other beloved comics, Robert Kirkman. It was a story like no other &#8211; running for 19 years &#8211; with Kirkman holding the choice to [&#8230;]

I’ve seen comics artist Don Rosa a number of times over the years at Atlanta’s Dragon Con and it always tickles me to see the big hand-written sign that says “THIS IS NOT DUCK TALES” when clearly the pictures of Uncle Scrooge, Donald Duck and of course Huey, Dewey, and Louie suggest otherwise. Mr. Rosa’s [&#8230;]

Hey everyone! The UTC has been reasonably quiet up til this weekend where we had a slew of Killteam events. Which means we’re back with our first stats wrap up since the balance data slate. We’ve seen the decline of the Kommandos, and the rise of the Heirotek circle in the meantime. Melee hordes have [&#8230;]

This may be the biggest Competitive Innovations in the Mortal Realms ever. A total of Seven large events, all over the world and a huge variety of lists to pore over. No use delaying, let&#8217;s go!

The metagame is (presumably) on borrowed time, and this week it&#8217;s the Astra Militarum&#8217;s turn to take a big swing at the Necron menace, with a reasonable degree of success. The Thousand Sons and Sororitas are getting in on the action too, and as a result the robot dominance isn&#8217;t quite as extreme as it [&#8230;]
