However the login is so simplistic and captcha does not seem to be working over cloudflare tunnel.</p> <p>Is there a way to harden the security of filebrowser so I can expose it to the internet? If there is any way I would like to avoid VPNs, I have CGNAT and no public IP. I know about Tailscale, I did use it, I don't prefer VPNs, they feel much more cumbersome. I would prefer some 2FA login window instead I can apply for any docker and monitor login attempts and such, not sure if such thing exists. Oh, and I want to keep the file sharing by link option if there is any way.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/daninet\"> /u/daninet </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1cbtzk8/is_there_any_way_to_harden_the_security_of/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1cbtzk8/is_there_any_way_to_harden_the_security_of", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Is there any way to harden the security of filebrowser?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-24T09:32:49+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>The following is my setup for deploying a NextJS app over https on Google Compute Engine:</p> <p>- NextJS app running inside docker on port 3000</p> <p>- letsencrypt SSL/TLS 1.3 certificates</p> <p>- nginx reverse proxy to redirect http::80 to https::443 and serve the nextjs app with certificates.</p> <p>- Cloudflare domain &amp; DNS pointing to GCE public IP</p> <p>- On GCE ports 80 and 443 are open.</p> <p>Website works fine when accessed by a browser on https://{domain}/ or http://{domain}/ (gets redirected to https)</p> <p>However, most of my clients are using Telstra in Australia, which is blocking the website as it's flagged as malicious.

The one issue I have is with my Jellyfin server which is usually laggy. The CPU is an Intel i5-7200U. Not a workhorse in particular. </p> <p>Now I have a PC which I used to use for gaming. AMD Ryzen 3600, 32GB of RAM, RTX 3060 (which i use for AI). I want to convert this to my new Proxmox server. The issue here is that it's not an Intel CPU so i can't use the iGPU for Jellyfin. </p> <p>I have 2 options. Either get a new CPU, Mobo combo with 12th/13th Gen Intel which will be more expensive, or go with an Intel Arc GPU for the transcoding which will most likely use more power since now I'm running 2 GPUs. </p> <p>Not sure which path I should take or is there any other better suggestion anyone has.
