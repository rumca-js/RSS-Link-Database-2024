Knuckles, reviewed by Ryan Leston. Narrated by Erik Adams.

Knuckles is an absolute riot. Wade Whipple’s over-the-top antics give the stoic echidna a much-needed foil, and the result is a laugh-a-minute road movie that just happens to be a six-part miniseries. It’s bold, creative, and takes some big swings. And there’s some heartwarming payoff, too, as Knuckles and his hapless human sidekick grow ever closer with each passing episode. Knuckles really nails what made Sonic and Sonic 2 so great, but with its own unique style and a bit of ’80s flare.

No Rest for the Wicked Early Access reviewed by Travis Northup on PC. 
No Rest for the Wicked is a compelling and unique action-RPG that blends a whole bunch of great genre ideas into one promising package, even though its incompleteness can be felt throughout the abridged early access version’s story. With lots of loot and inventory shortcomings, some technical issues, and some isometric camera angles that take getting used to, there’s still plenty to tweak in the months of development to come before 1.0. I, for one, hope the balance of inventory management and grinding health items tips back more in favor of getting you into the action of its skill-based combat. But even in this early state – before co-op multiplayer even arrives – I’ve had an absolute blast with the precise and challenging combat, memorable exploration, and art, voice acting, and characters that make me really eager to see more of the story and further explore the high-risk, high-reward roguelike mode. With so much

It seems the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 movie will be taking inspiration from Sonic Adventure 2. This is according to producer Toby Ascher. Speaking to GamesRadar, the producer said, “It’s going to be this giant, fun, incredible movie that obviously takes a lot from Sonic Adventure 2 and some of the games that I know the core Sonic Team grew up loving.” Sonic Adventure 2 is the classic good vs evil story, featuring Knuckles, Doctor Eggman, Tails, Shadow and #SonictheHedgehog. In the game, Eggman finds the Ultimate Lifeform his grandfather, Gerald Robotnik, had been working on - which turns out to be Shadow. This is also where we meet Maria and learn of her connection to Eggman and Shadow. #SonicMovie3 hits theaters December 20th.

The success of Prime Video's Fallout series has not only earned it a second season, but the game franchise saw a significant bump in activity since the show debuted. Overall, 5 million players logged in some time across all the Fallout games, including the original non-Bethesda entries. Fallout 76 in particular saw one million players wandering the Wasteland in a single day. Quite the turnaround for a game that had a very rough launch. In other news, Valve has closed a loophole in their refund policy that  went beyond the 2-hour window Valve normally allows. And we take a look at a hot sauce inspired by everyone's favorite Sith.

Another Crab's Treasure reviewed by Travis Northup on PC, also available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.

Another Crab’s Treasure is one of my favorite soulslikes in quite some time. It borrows a lot from the usual genre playbook, but adds a colorful, irresistibly charming, and wholly unique veneer that makes it all feel brand spanking new. The story is well-written and filled with memorable moments and characters, the shell-swapping mechanic is unique and adorable as heck, and the unrelentingly cheerful mood is like finding land after years adrift in an angsty sea of Bloodborne imitators. Its combat isn’t the deepest ocean around and it has a bit of jank here and there, but Another Crab’s Treasure is so clever and wonderfully ridiculous that it’s absolutely worth your time.

Watch our Sand Land review! Sand Land reviewed by Michael Higham on PS5 (PlayStation 5), also available on PS4 (PlayStation 4), PC, and Xbox.

"I'm happy to see Sand Land get a second wind with an open-world action game, and it can sometimes adapt the series in impressive ways. But while there is the potential of an interesting expansion of the manga here, it doesn’t manage to replicate what Toriyama's panels were able to illustrate so effectively. Beneath some ho-hum dialogue and stilted cutscenes is a fun story with its heart in the right place, and Beelzebub and friends at least have the charisma to carry you through to the end alongside a quirky set of supporting characters and villains. Dialing in on vehicular combat and exploration pays off to both maintain the spirit of the original work and deliver some high points, but the quests themselves fall into repetition. Thus, Sand Land suffers the same fate we’ve seen in many other game adaptations of anime and manga – competent in s

5 years later, the Marvel Avengers Endgame time jump is still its biggest mistake! In 2024, it’s probably safe to say that the MCU is in a very different place than it was in 2019. It can sometimes be a sobering experience to think back on the Infinity Saga, before every entertainment site made a cottage industry of wondering what went wrong with the MCU since. That’s not to say there wasn’t some enjoyment to be found in the likes of Marvel movies and Marvel TV shows like Spider-Man: No Way Home, Guardians Vol. 3, Loki, or other titles, but the quality of Marvel’s output and their overall reputation have suffered drastic shifts over the past five years. 

What was once the most impervious franchise in blockbuster filmmaking has now found itself embattled with too many mediocre projects, all the setup for Kang the Conqueror possibly being derailed, and long overdue conversations about the poor working conditions for VFX artists.
But at least for today, we’re looking back on Avengers: E

Manor Lords Early Access reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC.

"Manor Lords is a gorgeous medieval city-builder that kept me occupied for hours building my perfect, cozy hamlets. But it's not the type of Early Access game that seems like all it needs is some spit and polish to be fully playable. No, it's definitely unfinished in several key, critical ways, notably lacking much of an endgame challenge or any way to put its flashy RTS battles to a real test. It's a great foundation, and I see a lot of promise here. But there was only so much fun I was able to squeeze out of such an incomplete demo. I will definitely be keeping my eye on Manor Lords and eagerly awaiting each new update, but I also wouldn't blame you if you decided to hold off on striking the earth for now. That's not a dig at all. I said the exact same thing about Baldur's Gate 3 when it first released into Early Access, and it eventually came full circle to become one of my favorite games of all time. But I have to be realist

TopSpin 2K25 reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on Xbox Series X|S. Also available on Xbox One, PlayStation, and PC.

"TopSpin 2K25’s chunky career mode may occasionally be marred by periods of grind amidst its Grand Slams, its licensed player roster is a little slight compared to its impressive stable of stadiums, and its implementation of virtual currency attributes bafflingly unrealistic values to goods and services as though they were appraised by a kindergartner with no understanding of money. In spite of these drawbacks, though, TopSpin 2K25 is an absolute blast on court, and one that I’m struggling to put down. Claiming this is the best tennis simulation since Top Spin 4 may be a bit of a backhanded compliment since there haven't exactly been any other genuine serve-and-volley contenders released in recent years, but there’s little doubt that despite its rough edges this is still the most enjoyable way to get a realistic rally going in your own home without building an actual court in

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants reviewed on PlayStation 5, also available on PlayStation 4, PC, Switch, and Xbox.

"How much you enjoy Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants will depend on what you’re looking for in a beat ‘em up. If you just want something easy to play so you can laugh along with friends while you’re all splitting a New York pie on the couch, you’ll likely have a good time for the hour and change it takes to burn through it. But f you’re looking for something more mechanically nuanced, you’ll probably be hungry for more after the credits roll. What’s here feels good, but I wish there was more of it, and the lack of online co-op is a total bummer, dude. It’s like a two-dollar slice of pizza you pick up while walking home in New York City after a night on the town: it hits the spot in the moment, but it’s not gonna fill you up for long."
