GeekWire spotted a new SEC filing today that revealed the fund. Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, the longtime techies and hosts of Acquired, already do personal investing in companies they know from their work on the podcast. Now they&#8217;re creating a more formal mechanism to do so. &#8220;The fund is just a vehicle with a small set of LPs\u00a0that let us fully utilize those allocations when they&#8217;re offered to us,&#8221; Gilbert told GeekWire via email Wednesday.
