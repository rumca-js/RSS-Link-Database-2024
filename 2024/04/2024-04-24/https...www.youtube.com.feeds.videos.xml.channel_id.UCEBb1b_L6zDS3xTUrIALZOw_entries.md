## The Kitchen Cloud Chamber with Prof. Anne White

You don’t need a multibillion-dollar supercollider to detect subatomic particles. In fact, you can build a working cloud chamber—a device capable of revealing the cosmic radiation and radon decay events that go on continuously around us—with just a block of dry ice, some rubbing alcohol, and a few objects you probably already have in your kitchen. What’s more, constructing the cloud chamber only takes about an hour, making it an ideal project for an introductory physics class, for intellectually engaged nonscientists, or even for curious kindergartners (with some adult supervision!). In this interview, engineering professor Anne White discusses the pedagogical usefulness of such hands-on activities—and at the other end of the spectrum, she describes her enthusiasm for a much, much larger physics project, the decades-long effort to put nuclear fusion to practical use as a source of clean power for the world. The interview also touches on Prof. White’s experience of mentorship, both as

This lecture discusses the simple algorithms of bisection search and Newton-Raphson. Bisection search takes advantage of the properties of the problem. Decomposition and abstraction make code easy to create, modify, maintain, and understand.

This lecture explores list operations and mutability: mutation, aliasing, and tricky examples with loops over L. Lists and tuples provide a way to organize data that naturally supports iterative functions. Tuples are useful when you have data that doesn’t need to change, e.g., (latitude, longitude) or (page #, line #). Lists are useful in dynamic situations, e.g., a list of daily top 40 songs or a list of recently watched movies.
