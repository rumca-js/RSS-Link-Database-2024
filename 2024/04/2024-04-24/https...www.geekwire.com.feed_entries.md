GeekWire spotted a new SEC filing today that revealed the fund. Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, the longtime techies and hosts of Acquired, already do personal investing in companies they know from their work on the podcast. Now they&#8217;re creating a more formal mechanism to do so. &#8220;The fund is just a vehicle with a small set of LPs that let us fully utilize those allocations when they&#8217;re offered to us,&#8221; Gilbert told GeekWire via email Wednesday.

That&#8217;s one take from critics of non-compete deals after the FTC announced a new rule Tuesday that prohibits companies from using the clauses in new employment contracts, and invalidates many existing agreements. Companies will need to keep employees &#8220;by giving them the best jobs, and helping them realize their personal aspirations, as well as helping the company realize its aspirations,&#8221; said Brian Hall, a longtime&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/good-riddance-critics-of-non-competes-say-tech-companies-may-ultimately-benefit-from-ftc-ban/">Read More</a>

The Washington EV Instant Rebates Program will provide rebates at the time of purchase for eligible consumers who buy or lease a new or used EV. The deal applies to residents earning up to $45,180 a year for a single person or $93,600 for a family of four. The state&#8217;s Department of Commerce, which is managing the program, estimated potential lease terms for lower-priced EVs, concluding that the new rebates combined with federal government incentives and deals from automakers&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/washington-state-launches-program-to-cut-costs-of-new-and-used-evs-for-low-income-residents/">Read More</a>
