<p>The final Merseyside derby of Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool reign might well prove the final blow to his dream of saying goodbye with the Premier League title. For the first time in 14 long years, Everton emerged victorious against their local rivals at Goodison Park. Victory will taste all the sweeter for Sean Dyche’s team with their top-flight status almost certainly secured at the expense of Liverpool’s title chances.</p><p>“You lost the league at Goodison Park,” sang the home crowd as they rejoiced in a deserved Everton victory, an outstanding Everton performance and the best night of Dyche’s reign. Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored the goals that consigned Liverpool to a hugely damaging defeat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/24/everton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Stuart Attwell back in VAR hot water after Bournemouth sink furious Wolves

<p><strong> </strong>And to think Stuart Attwell was hoping for a quiet week clear of controversy. The referee was again the subject of rage, this time not from a Greek shipping magnate but from Wolves’ irate supporters, after he disallowed Hwang Hee-chan’s second-half equaliser at home to Bournemouth for the meekest of tangles in the buildup. Attwell initially awarded Hwang’s header before the VAR, Darren England, advised him to visit the pitch-side monitor to review a brush between Matheus Cunha and Justin Kluivert. Gary O’Neil placed his hands on his head in disbelief – not for the first time this season –and the fans let Attwell know the rest. “It’s not football any more,” bellowed the South Bank.</p><p>For Bournemouth, a late red card for Milos Kerkez for a crude challenge on Matt Doherty and Hwang’s disallowed strike undoubtedly overshadowed a positive performance and result for Andoni Iraola, who replaced O’Neil last summer. The Wolves captain Maximilian Kilman had a 100th-minu

When he spotted the van parked on the beach, he called the police, who then gave chase as it drove off. After running a few red lights, the joyriders lost control and smashed into a building. The front of the van was crushed in on both sides and the driver’s door was ripped clean off.</p><p>We woke to an email from Ant titled “RIP The Colombian”, detailing the ordeal he’d been through the night before while my husband, Dave, and I slept peacefully in our flat in Bogotá, Colombia.

<p>I’m one of the 2.5 million users of Slovene – and English and German speakers would do well to be curious about us</p><p>A couple of years ago, I received an invitation from a German cultural institution to present my debut short story collection, which was translated into German that year. The terms and conditions were generous: we pay you (<em>a lot</em>, as far as I was concerned), we host you for as long as you wish (I decided on three nights), we will arrange a host who loves your book – and if you need anything else, do tell us!</p><p>There was one diplomatically laid out request, however. The producers wanted me to speak German at the event. They heard me speak it <em>fluently </em>in a video interview and figured I could easily do it again. As a rookie, and the greenest author to have ever walked the Earth, I swallowed my anxiety and agreed to it. I kindly asked them to send me the host’s questions in advance, so I could prepare for this premiere of mine. I didn’t mention t

<p>We don’t have to reflexively use refined sugar to sweeten. Dates often do the trick – in a way that’s healthier for us and the planet</p><p>When I attended pastry school in Paris a couple of years ago, granulated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/sugar">sugar</a> appeared in nearly every tart, cookie or mousse recipe we learned. Only a few desserts used honey or maple syrup in its place.</p><p>That’s no surprise. Granulated sugar is dessert’s chief sweetener and also its secret pinch-hitter. It’s worth being specific: granulated sugar is nearly pure sucrose, and its unique powers have made it the standard for sweetening. It makes baked goods <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/10/05/sugar-adds-more-than-sweetness-to-baked-goods-heres-what-to-know-before-you-cut-it/">moist</a>. It makes cakes and cookies tender. It combines with butter to make frostings fluffy and whips up with egg whites like nobody’s business (hence the cloud-like loft of me

<p><strong>Samuel J Friedman Theatre, New York</strong></p><p>The Oscar nominee is a captivating emotional anchor in this drama about a mother coping with her child’s health problems</p><p>Alex, the two-year-old child at the center of Amy Herzog’s excellent play Mary Jane, is a constant presence on stage, despite never showing his face nor saying a word. Alex can’t, actually, vocalize anything – he was born with a paralyzed vocal cord, his endearingly peppy mother explains, along with other health conditions such as cerebral palsy, requiring round-the-clock care. We hear his machine’s beeps and whirs, see his mountain of stuffed animals on a hospital bed, jolt and hurdle along his journey from medical hiccup to crisis. He can’t communicate his pain or his joy. And yet, as Mary Jane – the titular mother so movingly, hauntingly embodied by Rachel McAdams – insists, he can understand her. She is the conduit, shield, giver.</p><p>Healthcare is a vast ecosystem of treatment, suffering and
