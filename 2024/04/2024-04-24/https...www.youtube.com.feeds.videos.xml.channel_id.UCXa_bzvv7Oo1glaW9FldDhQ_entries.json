You may think it just needs farming and co-op to complete the ensemble of genres. Don't worry - those are on the way in subsequent updates.\n\nAvailable for PC via Steam Early Access, it's a stunning title with a grim medieval fantasy aesthetic and unique premise, not to mention strong characterization and voice acting. The combat response is also something to behold, with a solid weight and heft. It would seem to have all the ingredients for success. And it's getting there. Slowly.\n\nWhat's here may be worth checking out, but No Rest for the Wicked still needs more work with its enemy balancing, scaling, movement, inventory management and performance before it can achieve greatness.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2yyrzd-gtY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/M2yyrzd-gtY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "No Rest for The Wicked Early Access Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-24T17:30:00+00:00", "description": "With the Fallout franchise enjoying a surge of popularity, it's interesting to look back on what could have been. What would be the result if Bethesda had focused on developing and releasing Fallout 5 instead of Starfield?\n\nWhile the latter earned its fair share of acclaim for the studio attempting new things, especially on such a massive scale, it already had a strong base with Fallout 4. It could have devoted the time and resources to the next single-player-focused title in its post-apocalyptic franchise, building on it further and providing something more contemporary for all the newer players to enjoy.\n\nBethesda may have even applied its learnings from Far Harbor and created a more compelling experience for the hardcore.
