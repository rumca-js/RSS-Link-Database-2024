<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 24 April 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01858-4">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01858-4</a></p>By combining nano-spot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, the authors resolve the fine electronic structure of the flat band and remote bands of twisted bilayer graphene as the twist angle varies, revealing a spectral weight transfer between remote bands that is attributed to lattice relaxations.
