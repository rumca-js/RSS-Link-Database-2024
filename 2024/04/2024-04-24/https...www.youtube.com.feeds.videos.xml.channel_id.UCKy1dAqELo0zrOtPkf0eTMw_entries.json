Sand Land reviewed by Michael Higham on PS5 (PlayStation 5), also available on PS4 (PlayStation 4), PC, and Xbox.\n\n\"I'm happy to see Sand Land get a second wind with an open-world action game, and it can sometimes adapt the series in impressive ways. But while there is the potential of an interesting expansion of the manga here, it doesn\u2019t manage to replicate what Toriyama's panels were able to illustrate so effectively. Beneath some ho-hum dialogue and stilted cutscenes is a fun story with its heart in the right place, and Beelzebub and friends at least have the charisma to carry you through to the end alongside a quirky set of supporting characters and villains. Dialing in on vehicular combat and exploration pays off to both maintain the spirit of the original work and deliver some high points, but the quests themselves fall into repetition. Thus, Sand Land suffers the same fate we\u2019ve seen in many other game adaptations of anime and manga \u2013 competent in s", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqck16kwdcE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/Gqck16kwdcE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Sand Land Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-24T15:00:01+00:00", "description": "Say hello to Lost Legions, a new open-world survival crafting game for up to four players that's set, according to developer Tarock Interactive, \"in ancient Rome after the historically accurate events of the Varian disaster in a handcrafted world inspired by the German region of Teutoburg Forest.\" It's due out in the first half of 2025.
