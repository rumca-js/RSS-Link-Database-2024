Welp, sometimes you gotta read Techdirt fast, or you just might miss something. And sometimes it’s because Universal Music is acting to silence creativity yet again. Yesterday, we posted about how Dustin Ballard, the creative genius behind There I Ruined It, who makes very funny parody songs, had posted a lengthy disclaimer on his latest [&#8230;]

Get your dance moves on now, as TikTok may be going away. Okay, it’s not going away that quickly and quite possibly isn’t going away at all, but President Biden signed the bill this morning that requires ByteDance to divest itself from TikTok, or have the app banned from the Apple and Google app stores.

Florida&#8217;s governor, Ron DeSantis, and Florida&#8217;s legislature have combined forces to craft and pass some of the most unconstitutional laws ever written in the United States. A series of bad laws has led to series of injunctions from federal courts, including one that traveled all the way to the Supreme Court just to have the [&#8230;]

This is a frustrating article to write. The FTC has come out with a very good and important policy ruling, but I’m not sure it has the authority to do so. The legal challenge (that was filed basically seconds after the rule came out) could do way more damage not just to some fundamental parts [&#8230;]

We&#8217;ve noted repeatedly how the mass hyperventilation about TikTok is a giant distraction from the country&#8217;s broader failures on consumer privacy; namely our corrupt inability to pass even a baseline privacy law for the internet era, and our absolute refusal to regulate sleazy data brokers. As a result there&#8217;s not a week that goes by [&#8230;]

While it doesn&#8217;t happen nearly as often as I&#8217;d like, it is quite satisfying when a trademark bully is forced to walk back their bullying ways as a result of a public backlash. If you don&#8217;t do a lot of your own cooking, particularly cooking Asian foods, you may not be familiar with chili crisp. [&#8230;]
