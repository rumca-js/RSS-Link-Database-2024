		Identification on the Move (IOTM) is a prototype airport biometrics system that can verify a user without them having to stand still, mitigating stop and go bottlenecks when travelers submit biometric scans to pass through checkpoints, according to an announcement from HTX, Singapore’s Home Team Science &amp; Technology Agency.

The prototype was designed by HTX’s Biometrics and Profiling Centre of Expertise and uses <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/nec">NEC</a>, a company that makes its own <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202401/more-airport-biometric-checks-from-nec-clear-idemia-is">airport kiosks</a>, for biometrics.

		Age assurance technology is becoming a hot topic, prompting observers to weigh in on its effectiveness and potential challenges.

The Open Technology Institute notes in a report published by liberal think tank New America that more than 60 bills involving online age restrictions were introduced in the United States during 2023, and the trend has continued this year. If passed, these laws are likely to be challenged, and in significant number declared unconstitutional, according to the report.

		More than ten human rights groups have signed a letter protesting the European Union’s decision to continue personal data transfers between the bloc and Israel. The call to re-evaluate data flows comes amid Israel’s push to beef up surveillance and give security agencies more power over data – including biometrics.

In January, the European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_161" rel="noopener" target="_blank">concluded</a> its review of adequacy decisions regulating data transfers between 11 jurisdictions, including Israel. The countries were deemed to provide adequate data protection safeguards.

Rights groups, however, argue that the decision may go against European standards. The reasons behind this are n

		A new report suggests that regulatory and governance frameworks that prioritize data privacy can trigger more adoption of eID in countries where interest levels still remain low.

This is one of the major issues highlighted in the 2024 global eID report published this month by Strategy &amp; Part of the PwC Network.

The 26-page benchmarking <a href="https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/de/en/industries/public-sector/global-eid-country-report-2024/strategyand-global-eid-country-report-2024.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report</a> delves into adoption and data privacy of the online identification function in the digitized world of eight countries.
