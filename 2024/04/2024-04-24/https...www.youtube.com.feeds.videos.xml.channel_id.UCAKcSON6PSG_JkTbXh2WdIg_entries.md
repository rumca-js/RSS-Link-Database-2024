Back in April 2011, jeremy messersmith hosted Works for Words, an event at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minn., where messersmith led a night of the best lyrical works in song â€” songs of his own as well as those of others who have influenced his style and ideas, including artists like Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, Prince, Bob Dylan, Sigur Ros, Conor Oberst, Radiohead and others. From that night 10 years ago at the Fitz, here's a performance by messersmith of his song, "Dillinger Eyes," from his 2010 album, "The Reluctant Graveyard."

The Kills â€”Â the rock duo comprising Jamie Hince and Alison Mosshart â€” released their sixth studio album, God Games, in October 2023. The album was produced by Paul Epworth at his home base, The Church Studios, in London. 

While in the Twin Cities for a show at First Avenue in Minneapolis, The Kills visited The Current studio to play stripped-down versions of songs from the latest album. Afterwords, Mosshart and Hince spoke with host Jill Riley about the making of the album â€” including the cross-country driving trips that inspired some of Mosshartâ€™s song ideas.

Watch and listen to their track "103" above.
