Seattle-area tech giants Microsoft and Amazon have set ambitious carbon reduction targets and invested millions to meet those goals. The state is home to a multitude of climate tech startups tackling batteries, nuclear power, green aviation, hydrogen fuel and other clean energy challenges. Elected leaders have vowed to cut the state&#8217;s carbon emissions and passed groundbreaking policies to hit those targets. An initiative on Washington&#8217;s ballot this November threatens those efforts. Initiative 2117 would strike down regulations requiring most of the state&#8217;s largest greenhouse gas emitters to pay for their pollution&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/initiative-to-axe-carbon-emissions-law-could-slam-the-brakes-on-w", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/initiative-to-axe-carbon-emissions-law-could-slam-the-brakes-on-washingtons-climate-tech-sector", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Initiative to axe carbon emissions law could \u2018slam the brakes\u2019 on Washington\u2019s climate tech sector", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-18T05:22:52+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cynthia-Williams-Headshot-2-1-22-1260x840.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />A new SEC filing reveals that Cynthia Williams plans to step down as president at Hasbro-owned game company Wizards of the Coast.

Bruker, a Massachusetts-based publicly traded life sciences research and diagnostic giant founded in 1960, will pay $392.6 million to buy Seattle-based NanoString. The deal is expected to close next month. NanoString said in February that it initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan and was exploring a potential sale following its loss in a patent infringement case against 10X Genomics. The company said Wednesday that it received a &#8220;stalking horse&#8221; bidder in March as part of the bankruptcy process,&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-biotech-company-nanostring-to-be-acquired-by-bruker-for-392m-ending-bankr", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-biotech-company-nanostring-to-be-acquired-by-bruker-for-392m-ending-bankruptcy-process", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Seattle biotech company NanoString to be acquired by Bruker for $392M, ending bankruptcy process", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
