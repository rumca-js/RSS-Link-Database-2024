<p>The bill that could lead to a ban of TikTok in the United States appears to be much closer to becoming law. The legislation <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/house-passes-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok-144805114.html"><ins>sailed through</ins></a> the House of Representatives last month, but faced an uncertain future in the Senate due to opposition from a few prominent lawmakers.</p>
<p>But momentum for the “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act” seems to once again be growing. The House is set to vote on a package of bills <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/us-likely-enact-law-soon-ban-tiktok-nationwide-rcna148391"><ins>this weekend</ins></a>, which includes a slightly revised version of the TikTok bill. In the latest version of the bill, ByteDance would have up to 12 months to divest TikTok, instead of the six-month period stipulated in the original measure.</p>

## Blizzard takes aim at Overwatch 2 console cheaters

<p>Like many other multiplayer games, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/overwatch%202/"><em><ins>Overwatch 2</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>isn't immune from cheaters. And it's not only an issue on PC, where cheaters use tools like aimbots. Some folks use XIM devices so they can play with a keyboard and mouse (KBM) on consoles. This is against Blizzard's rules, as KBM players typically have an aim advantage over those who use a controller, even though the console versions of the game have features like aim assist. While it's taken some time to get the ball rolling, the developer is finally doing something about the XIM problem.</p>
<p>XIM devices trick consoles into believing that KBM users are playing with a controller. However, <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24085457/director-s-take-addressing-unapproved-peripherals-on-consoles/"><ins>in a blog post</ins></a>, Blizzard says it has been able to detect KBM players on consoles over the last few <em>Overwatch 2</em

<p>Amazon appears to have nixed its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-18-amazon-prime-video-is-now-a-standalone-monthly-service.html">Prime Video-only plan</a> in the US and UK. <em>Cord Busters</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cordbusters.co.uk/amazon-axes-prime-video-only-plan/">reports</a> that the little-known subscription, introduced in 2016, is no longer available to new users in either country. Those trying to sign up for the previously $8.99 monthly plan (£5.99 monthly in the UK) are now directed to the landing page for a full Amazon Prime membership.</p>
<p>The Prime Video plan launched eight years ago, priced to undercut Netflix’s (at the time) $9.99-a-month subscription price for standard HD streaming on up to two devices. Although the option stuck around for close to a decade, Amazon increasingly buried it, making it impossible to sign up for on mobile devices. It was also increasingly difficult to find on desktops, where you had to navigate to a

<p><em>Children of the Sun</em> burst onto the indie scene like a muzzle flash on a dark night. Publisher Devolver Digital dropped the game’s first trailer on February 1, showcasing frenzied sniper shots and a radioactive art style. A Steam demo highlighting its initial seven stages went live that same day and became a breakout hit during February’s Steam Next Fest. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/children-of-the-sun-brings-fps-puzzles-to-steam-on-april-9-184030022.html">Two months later</a> it landed in full and to broad acclaim. This explosive reveal and rapid release timeline mirrors the game itself — chaotic but contained, swift and direct, sharp and bright.</p>
<p>Though it feels like <em>Children of the Sun</em> popped into existence over the span of two months, it took solo developer René Rother more than 20 years to get here.</p>

A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000341#sec014">recent study</a> from the University of Cambridge's School of Clinical Medicine found that OpenAI's GPT-4 performed nearly as well in an ophthalmology assessment as experts in the field, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5b7a76be-467c-4074-8fd0-3e297bcd91d7">the <em>Financial Times</em> first reported.</a></p>
<p>In the study, published in <em>PLOS Digital Health</em>, researchers tested the LLM, its predecessor <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-openais-chatgpt-has-changed-the-world-in-just-a-year-140050053.html">GPT-3.5</a>, Google's PaLM 2 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-unleashing-more-than-25-ai-chatbot-personalities-onto-the-world-181428710.html">Meta's LLaMA</a> with 87 multiple choice questions.

<p>There are a frankly ridiculous number of Chromebooks on sale to choose from, but Google's Chromebook Plus initiative that <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-chromebook-plus-initiative-pushes-higher-spec-standards-and-handy-software-tools-130055583.html">launched last fall </a>has gone a long way towards standardizing some key specs for ChromeOS devices. That in turn has made it a little easier to pick ones that'll provide a consistent quality experience without breaking the bank. Acer's latest Chromebook Plus 514, which the company just announced today, is a good example — at first glance, it looks like it checks most of the boxes I'm looking for when <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">recommending a basic Chromebook</a> that'll work for most people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make things confusing, Acer already sells a few Chromebook Plus 514 models; this one is the CB514-4HT and is priced at $399. Loo

<p>We are living in a second golden age for console gaming. Active communities, open developer tools and easy distribution have given new life to many once-dead systems. If there's one company who deserves the most thanks for bringing a love for '80s and '90s cartridge-based console gaming back to the semi-mainstream, it's Analogue.</p>
<p>It started with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-11-26-the-analogue-cmvs-a-649-wooden-neo-geo-for-the-gamer-who-has-e.html"><ins>CMVS</ins></a>, an obsessive (and expensive) wood-grained reboot of the iconic Neo Geo. Then came the Analogue Nt in 2014, which brought easy, high-def NES gaming to our homes . In 2017, the Super Nt did the same for SNES gaming, then the Mega Sg for the Sega Genesis and, most recently, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-review-150056011-150056369.html"><ins>Analogue Pocket</ins></a>, which supports everything from the Game Boy to the Neo Geo Po

<p>The Samsung Galaxy A35 smartphone is officially available for US customers. We knew it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-midrange-galaxy-a55-has-a-bigger-screen-and-new-security-features-170916895.html"><ins>was coming to the US</ins></a>, but we didn't know when. The phone starts at $400 and is available in two colors. It’s already been available in the UK since March.</p>
<p>The Galaxy A35 is squarely a midrange device, so don’t go expecting flagship features. However, this is still a capable smartphone with plenty of bang for your buck. Samsung’s A-series devices tend to be among <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-android-phone-160029327.html"><ins>our favorite low-cost smartphones</ins></a>. This model boasts a 6.6-inch Super AMOLED display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz, just like its cousin the Galaxy A55. The Galaxy A35 also features the company’s Vision Booster software, which automatically adjusts the screen’s tone to suit different ambient li

<p>A keyboard is one of the few pieces of technology you may use for hours every day. Why not make it something that brings you joy? Sure, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/topre-realforce-r2-pfu-keyboard-irl-153030722.html">people who gush</a> over these things can be intense, but the upgraded comfort, durability and customizability that comes with a good mechanical keyboard is a real thing. If you’re looking to make the switch (ahem), we tested a couple dozen mechanical keyboards over the past few months and rounded up our favorites below. We’ve also broken down what to look for when shopping for one.</p>
<h2>What to look for in a mechanical keyboard</h2>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>The first thing to decide with any keyboard is what size and layout you want. Full-size layouts have all the keys you’d ever need — a number pad, a full function row, arrow keys, etc. — but they also have the largest physical footprint. A 96-percent or “1800” keyboard is similar, but crunches the navigation c

<p>The AI <a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/slack-ai-has-arrived">auto-generates channel recaps</a> to give people key highlights of stuff they missed while away from the keyboard or smartphone, for keeping track of important work stuff and office in-jokes.

<p>Panic is celebrating Playdate's second birthday this month, and the party favors include some piping-hot statistics about Catalog game sales.</p>
<p>Playdate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playdate-review-indie-games-crank-170054294.html">hit the market</a> in April 2022 with 24 free games. Its Catalog store went live in March 2023, offering 16 curated games for purchase directly on the device. Panic has added more titles to Catalog on a bi-weekly basis for the past year, and the marketplace today has 181 games and apps. More than 150,000 games have been sold on Catalog, giving developers $544,290 in gross revenue — that's after taxes, processing fees and Panic’s 25 percent cut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carl Pei's Nothing has revealed two new wireless earbuds at an event in Tokyo. It calls the Ear, the more expensive model of the two with prices starting at $149 and £129, a refinement of its older model the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-2-wireless-buds-price-release-date-impressions-153040749.html?_fsig=pFz2WR_dhL6LsmOaykZZWQ--%7EA">Ear (2)</a>. The Ear retains the brand's transparent design and looks very similar to the previous model. But it's powered by a new custom 11 mm dynamic driver and comes with a dual chamber design that allows it to deliver clearer sounds compared to its predecessor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also features a new smart active noise cancellation (ANC) algorithm that can check for noise leakage between the earbuds and the ear canal and then add more noise cancellation accordingly. Plus, it can automatically apply the level of noise cancellation needed — high, medium or low — appropriate for the environment the user is in. Nothing says the model's noi

<p>The European Union doesn't think you should have to choose between giving Meta and other major players your data or your money. In a statement, the <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2024/edpb-consent-or-pay-models-should-offer-real-choice_en">European Data Protection Board</a> (EDPB) stated that &quot;consent or pay&quot; models often don't &quot;comply with the requirements for valid consent&quot; when a person must choose between providing their data for behavioral advertising purposes or pay for privacy.</p>
<p>The EDPB argues that only offering a paid alternative to data collection shouldn't be the default for large online platforms. It doesn't issue a mandate but stresses that these platforms should &quot;give significant consideration&quot; to providing a free option that doesn't involve data processing (or at least not as much). &quot;Controllers should take care at all times to avoid transforming the fundamental right to data protection into a feature that indiv

Supergiant's Creative Director Greg Kasavin and Studio Director Amir Rao demonstrated the abilities of the game's new protagonist, Melinoë. While she's the sister of Zagreus, the first title's protagonist, and <em>Hades II </em>is a direct sequel to the original, Kasavin and Rao said players don't need to have prior knowledge of the first game and of Greek mythology to enjoy it.
