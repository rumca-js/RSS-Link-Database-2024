We&#8217;ve had several posts on the video game sensation that is Palworld in the past.

Cops continue to wonder why people don&#8217;t trust them. Go figure. At the center of this latest &#8220;we&#8217;re better than you&#8221; posturing by law enforcement is the raid of the wrong house by self-proclaimed &#8220;trained and experienced&#8221; officers, who mistook one Arab male for another before rushing into a house and pointing guns at everyone.

What do Fentanyl and TikTok have in common? Well, the real answer is absolutely nothing. Nothing at all. But, if you want to push a nonsense moral panic, apparently, you compare the two. While it’s unclear exactly where Congress currently stands on the push to ban TikTok in the US (or, at the very least, [&#8230;]
