<p>Two big Wembley meetings await in the Cup, while a desperation derby looks to be in store at Goodison Park</p><p>There was a distinct end-of-season vibe at the Gtech Community Stadium following Brentford’s recent win over Sheffield United, with Thomas Frank and his players performing what amounted to a lap of honour as they took plaudits from fans relieved that the spectre of relegation had finally been banished from their small corner of west London. Of course only time will tell if the Bees become the first Premier League team to decamp to the metaphorical beach this season and this weekend’s match against Luton at Kenilworth Road will provide a fair indication. Ravaged by injury with up to 11 players likely to be unavailable, Luton were on a hiding to nothing in their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/13/manchester-city-luton-premier-league-match-report">game against Manchester City</a> but still emerged from the rout with their heads held high having restri

<p>Casual running clubs that give members the chance to exercise and socialise are popping up all over the UK. And each one is developing a style of its own </p><p>At just before 9am on a bright April morning in Greenwich, south-east London, runners gather in the shadow of the Cutty Sark. There are just a few at first, then more and more until the group numbers around 40. It’s a little awkward (for a first-timer like me, at least) as we shiver and make small talk. But soon we coalesce to form a big circle and run through a warm-up before doing a gentle 5km around Blackheath – we’ll be installed in a local cafe by 10am.</p><p>A version of this scene can be found up and down the country every weekend. Running seems to be more popular than ever –<a href="https://www.tcslondonmarathon.com/news-and-media/latest-news/first-world-record-for-2024-tcs-london-marathon-ballot"> almost 580,000 people applied for this weekend’s London Marathon</a>, an increase of 120,000 on the year before – but r

The move from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sebastian-coe">Sebastian Coe</a> broke with 128 years of tradition by becoming the first sport to give athletes prize money if they are victorious in Paris this summer. Champions will come away with $50,000 (£39,360) if they reach the top of the podium. The decision blindsided the International Olympic Committee, which has never awarded money for participating or winning a medal, as it believes that to compete at a Games is reward enough.

First, because the mass slaughter turned out to be the warm-up act for worse in the rest of the 20th century. In many ways, we are still living in the aftermath. Second, because such a repetition would in fact prove the best case scenario; a nuclear inferno that devours human civilisation is a more probable outcome.</p><p>In two newspaper articles last week, Sir Keir Starmer committed Labour to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-13299023/KEIR-STARMER-commitment-UKs-nuclear-deterrent-Unshakeable-Absolute-Total.html">retaining nuclear weapons</a>

About 6.5% of the world’s electricity is now generated by wind, and by 2050 this could rise to more than a third.
