William F. Cody, better known as Buffalo Bill, was an iconic figure of the American West. A bison hunter, scout, and impresario, his life and persona became synonymous with the romanticized image of the frontier. While photographs of the man abound, only a limited amount of moving film footage featuring Buffalo Bill exists. These precious fragments offer tantalizing glimpses into the reality behind the myth, revealing both the man and the showman.
