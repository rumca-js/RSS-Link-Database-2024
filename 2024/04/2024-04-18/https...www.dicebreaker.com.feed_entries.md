Now, it&rsquo;s inspired an upcoming card game that looks to offer a similar compelling combo of eldritch dread and maritime discovery.</p><p>Designer-artist Judson Cowan openly credits Dredge as one of <a href="https://tettixgames.com/pages/deep-regrets">Deep Regrets&rsquo; key touchstones</a>, alongside classic Cthulhu story The Shadow Over Innsmouth, the Hellboy comics, Scooby-Doo cartoons and the 17th-century theory of a hollow Earth - within which another mysterious world exists - posited by comet namesake Edmund Halley.</p><p>The card game uses Halley&rsquo;s concept as a leaping-off po

While its characters - peppy vault dweller Lucy, imposing gunslinger The Ghoul and conflicted Brotherhood of Steel recruit Maximus - are fresh faces exploring uncharted territory, the Fallout TV series is packed full of references and lore straight out of the video games.</p><p>That provides plenty of motivation to dive back into the likes of Fallout 4 and New Vegas, but what about those of us who prefer to unhook from screens for a while and share the horrors of the wasteland with friends around a table? While Fallout hasn&rsquo;t seen as many tabletop spin-offs as you might expect for a franchise approach

Some even grant <em>you</em> the power to exist in many forms. We're not just talking about the 5E spells with the highest damage here, we're also looking at some of the most useful D&amp;D 5E spells around. Standing proud alongside the flashy and devastating damage-dealing spells available across the various 5E spell lists is a mass of utility spells, buff spells, warding and healing spells that will be indispensable to your party in any campaign. Of course, the most helpful D&amp;D 5E spells will change moment-to-moment depending on your situation, and the type of enemy you're fighting, but there are some clear winners for me where the overall best 5E spells are concerned.</p><p>For the most part, the type of caster you choose will decide
