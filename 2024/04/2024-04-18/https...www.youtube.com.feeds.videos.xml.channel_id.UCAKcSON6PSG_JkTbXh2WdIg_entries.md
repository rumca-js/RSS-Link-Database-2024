After Aby Wolf and Eric Mayson had finished their set for the night at the Emerging Artists Showcase event and the crowd had gone home, the two musicians went up to the balcony of the empty Duluth Masonic Temple and gave this acoustic performance of "Permission" to document the first time Mayson had ever sat down behind an organ console. Watch this very special performance, captured on a single camera.
