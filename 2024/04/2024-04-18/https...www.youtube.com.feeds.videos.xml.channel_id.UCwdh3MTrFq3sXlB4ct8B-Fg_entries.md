From cool scenic ruins to battlefield mud or chunks of fallen foes, your Warhammer bases can add some real character to their models – and taken together, they can even tell a story. In this video, we’re going to form a story of our own through basing, demonstrating ideas and techniques that will be super easy to replicate for any army you might collect. Ollie will be adding some flavor to just some of the bases for the paint tutorial team's Tyranid army, so follow along and get inspired to forge your own narrative.

If you're new to painting, our Citadel Colour Painting Essentials playlist hosts an array of beginner-friendly videos to help you get started.
