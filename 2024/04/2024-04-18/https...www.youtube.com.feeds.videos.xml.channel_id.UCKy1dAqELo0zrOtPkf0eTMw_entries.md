Fallout Season 1 has been streaming on Prime Video for nearly a week now, and, from the early reactions, the streaming platform's adaptation of Bethesda's beloved video game franchise is already a hit. We're still awaiting official word from Prime Video on if we'll be getting Fallout Season 2, but we sat down with Todd Howard and Jonathan Nolan to get the scoop on all the Fallout lore tidbits that fans may have missed in Season 1. 

The games, from Fallout 3 to Fallout 4, all the way to Fallout 76 and Fallout New Vegas, obviously play a heavy role in informing the Prime Video Fallout tv show. Amazon Prime Video pulled out all the stops, which we dig into in our exclusive Fallout interview with Fallout creator Todd Howard and executive producer Jonah Nolan. 

We discuss a wide breadth of topics, including Walton Goggins’ The Ghoul and whether or not we’ll see a Fallout mod specifically for him, whether we’ll see Moldaver again, Cooper Howard ultimately inspiring Vault Boy, and more!
