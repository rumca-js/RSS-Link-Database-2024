<p>Meta has launched Meta.ai, an AI-specific site that has a cool hook that its competitors don&rsquo;t offer: It can generate images in real time, and even animate them on demand. </p>



<p>There <em>is</em> a catch, however: Meta would really like to continue improving Meta.ai, and to do so it&rsquo;s only offering image generation if you sign into your Facebook account.</p>



<p>Meta joins other LLMS or AI chatbots like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2170884/ai-battle-continues-google-launches-gemini-to-beat-openai-and-microsofts-gpt-4.html">Google Gemini</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2254709/you-can-now-use-copilots-ai-to-make-sense-of-your-private-files.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s various flavors of Copilot</a>, Anthropic&rsquo;s<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://claude.ai/&amp;xcust=2-1-2308678-1-0-

<p>For years, AMD and especially Intel have dominated the PC industry, even after Qualcomm introduced its first Snapdragon processors for laptops. Now, Microsoft may be giving pride of place to Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon X Elite processor with an upcoming Windows feature &mdash; and leaving AMD and Intel out in the cold.</p>



<p>In May, Microsoft will host its annual Build conference in Seattle. Microsoft will open that conference with a presentation from chief executive Satya Nadella to &ldquo;share our AI vision across hardware and software,&rdquo; according to Microsoft. That presentation is expected to introduce the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2256275/report-surface-pro-10-surface-laptop-6-to-offer-key-upgrades.html">Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 5 for consumers</a>, both featuring Qualcomm&rsquo;s surprisingly powerful <a href="https://www.p

On top of that, the best gaming mice have unique hardware enhancements like highly sensitive sensors and complex button configurations to keep up with fast-paced games. </p>



<p>Deciding on the right mouse is a highly personal decision that needs careful consideration. Factors like the size and shape of your hand, your preferred grip style, the types of games you play, and the number of buttons you need, are all factors in your quest for the best gam

<p>&ldquo;Haha, Razer likes to add RGB lights to stuff.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an easy joke to make for a tech reporter, and I confess that I&rsquo;ve indulged in it more than once. But to tell the truth, Razer&rsquo;s products are generally very stylish and distinctive, and lately they&rsquo;ve been <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2031075/razer-blackwidow-v4-75-review.html">using RGB lighting as subtle accents</a> rather than an up-front selling point. But the Firefly V2 Pro mouse pad is all-RGB, all the time. </p>



<p>Razer has made USB-connected, RGB-infused mousepads before, to the point that you can now find imitators on Amazon <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QFB5KVS/&amp;xcust=2-1-2308193-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">for just a few bucks</a>.

<p>Messages on Discord, a chat service that initially catered to gamers but is gaining popularity across the web, are supposed to be somewhat private. Only members of that Discord server (who are subject to the approval of moderators) can see them. Or so you may have thought. According to a new report, it&rsquo;s startlingly easy for third parties to collate and cross-index those messages&hellip;and sell them to the highest bidder. </p>

<p>If need help cleaning up your humble abode, definitely consider picking up a robot vacuum. I&rsquo;ve got one for pet hair and it&rsquo;s an absolute godsend. Better yet, there&rsquo;s no reason to miss out considering the doozy of a clearance sale I&rsquo;ve spotted today. Walmart&rsquo;s selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/520648419&amp;xcust=2-1-2308029-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ecovacs Deebot U2SE for just $64.43</a>, which is a ridiculously good price for a robot vacuum (especially one that also mops).

<p>The Ecovacs Deebot U2SE has a runtime of up to 110 minutes, a 300mL water tank that covers 2,000 square feet, and a high efficiency air filter.  It works with Amazon Al

<p>After letting Windows apps like Paint and Photos languish, Microsoft has brought them back with a vengeance. And Windows Photos now has one of the better features you could ask for in any app: Generative Erase.</p>



<p>I like features that don&rsquo;t take a lot of explanation, tutorials, or anything else. They should be intuitive and just work. And you know what? Generative Erase does just that &mdash; about as well as Photoshop does, too, and for <em>free</em>. Microsoft is rolling it out to Windows 11 right now, and Windows 10 users should see it, too.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one buzzword that&rsquo;s inescapable in 2024&hellip;well, it&rsquo;s probably &ldquo;Israel&rdquo; or &ldquo;election&rdquo; or &ldquo;Musk.&rdquo; But if there&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s specific to the technology industry, it&rsquo;s AI. Fortunes are being made on that interest, in a way hauntingly reminiscent of the crypto boom and subsequent bust. And absolutely everyone wants to get in on the former and avoid the latter.&nbsp;</p>
