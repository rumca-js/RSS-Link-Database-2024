<p>Jürgen Klopp has taken Liverpool to four European finals, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/tottenham-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report">one Champions League trophy</a> and places that players and fans alike may never have imagined possible but a journey that pulsated and punished is over. There will be no fairytale ending in Dublin after one more feat of escapology proved beyond Klopp’s team against Atalanta.</p><p>The 91st European game of Klopp’s nine-year Liverpool reign was also his last despite a vastly improved display and win against Gian Piero Gasperini’s side. “If we fail, then let’s fail in the most beautiful way,” Klopp had said on the eve of the Europa League quarter-final second leg. Liverpool delivered to a degree. Mohamed Salah struck an early penalty that decided the contest but could not transform the tie, although it looked possible during a first half in which Atalanta creaked and the Egypt international missed an excellent ch

## Leverkusen knock out West Ham as Frimpong’s strike saves unbeaten run

<p>Bayer Leverkusen will be waking up with sore heads again. Their treble hopes remain alive, as does their unbeaten run after Jeremie Frimpong’s late equaliser, but this was uncomfortable. After the beer-stained celebrations that followed their regal charge to the Bundesliga title, Xabi Alonso’s side looked groggy on a pulsating night at the London Stadium and can count themselves lucky to be in a Europa League semi-final against Roma after beating West Ham 3-1 on aggregate.</p><p>West Ham were close to becoming the first side to beat Leverkusen in 44 matches this season. Michail Antonio’s early goal raised hopes of a comeback and there were plenty of near misses during a one-sided first half. It could have been different if one of those chances had gone in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/18/west-ham-bayer-leverkusen-europa-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Martínez the tainted hero as Aston Villa beat Lille in controversial shootout

<p>From the moment Emiliano Martínez was booked for time-wasting 39 minutes into this tempestuous Europa Conference League knockout tie, there was an air of inevitably that the Aston Villa goalkeeper would prove to be the hero. So it proved, with Martínez saving penalties from Nabil Bentaleb and Benjamin André in a shootout after Matty Cash’s late strike prevented Lille advancing and took the game to extra time.</p><p>That, however, is only half of the story. Martínez seemed intent on being the pantomime villain, his every touch jeered from the off, was cautioned again by the referee, Ivan Kruzliak, during the spot-kicks after being warned for gamesmanship – another dollop of shithousery, you could say – but avoided being sent off, leaving Villa without a goalkeeper, because cautions are not carried forward into penalties.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/18/martinez-the-tainted-hero-as-aston-villa-beat-lille-in-controversial-shootout">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Promo images show youngsters looking excited – but possibly more for the task ahead than the clothes they are wearing</p><p>Designing the kits for Olympic and Paralympic athletes to compete in is hardly a simple task. It’s one that takes in the demands of multiple, wildly different sports, as well as comfort, performance and some kind of unifying aesthetic that shows a gymnast, a sprinter and a breakdancer are on the same team. So it’s no surprise that this level of juggling quite often leads to kits <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/18/paris-2024-team-gb-paralympicsgb-official-kit-olympics">like the Adidas one being worn by Team GB for the Paris Olympics</a> – one that feels a little generic, and “designed by committee”.

David Niven sauntered through the role of the globe-circling gent Phileas Fogg and 22-year-old MacLaine was cast in the way Hollywood sometimes saw her in those days … as someone whose feline, gamine looks had something exotic and Asiatic about them. She was the Indian Princess Aouda, widowed after a loveless arranged marriage but rescued from the funeral pyre by the bold Fogg, whom she then joins on his travels for a while. A sweet and likable comic turn.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/18/happy-90th-birthday-shirley-maclaine-her-20-best-films-ranked">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As I learned from managing Michelangelo’s David, visitors can be nudged away from the joyless in-and-out mission for selfies and souvenirs</p><p>Florence is an exquisite city. Because of its history and its cultural heritage as the cradle of the Italian Renaissance, it is unique, precious and very fragile. The historic centre – a Unesco world heritage site – occupies a very small space. The city’s 366,000 inhabitants are joined each year by about 11 million tourists. Maintaining the characteristic dignity of the place and meeting the needs of those who live here permanently while managing this volume of tourism, is a great challenge and responsibility. For most of the year, Florence struggles to do either sustainably.<strong> </strong></p><p>To be clear, tourism is an essential source of income and I am not opposed to tourists. The problem is that many visitors are on a quick in-and-out mission to take selfies in front of a few major sights – Michelangelo’s David, Botticelli’s Prim

<p>When I heard that a boy from my primary school had been convicted of trafficking, I had to find out what had happened to make him fall so far</p><p>When armed police burst through his front door in Tottenham, north London, at 5am in September 2014, Glodi Wabelua knew things looked bad. The house was full of drug paraphernalia, including a hydraulic press, scales and mixing bowls, as well as a mobile phone full of incriminating texts advertising deals for crack cocaine and heroin.</p><p>The case went to trial in February 2016, and Wabelua’s two co-defendants – who, like him, were aged 20 – received 10- and 11-year sentences. Wabelua, who had lodged an early guilty plea a year before, was handed six years for dealing class A drugs. He was not new to the criminal justice system, having already served three years for drug offences in his teens. But soon he would be charged with an even more serious crime.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/ng-interactive/2024/apr/18/county-li

<p>The chilling, visceral, deeply compelling comedy-drama has caused shock waves worldwide since launching last weekend. But what about the experiences that inspired it?</p><p>When Richard Gadd wrote Monkey See Monkey Do for the Edinburgh fringe in 2016, he says, “it was pre-#MeToo; sexual assault wasn’t really in the public consciousness, and male sexual assault particularly wasn’t”. He was 27 and catastrophically anxious, and his flatmates were worried, asking him: “What are you doing? No, like, really what are you doing?”</p><p>The show – you’d struggle to call it standup, though it won the Edinburgh comedy award that year – is a personal and harrowing account of being raped by a manipulative older man he met earlier in his career. It’s extremely painful to watch, as Gadd’s nascent professional hopes and fantasies are traded on and exploited, leaving him isolated and hollowed out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/18/i-was-severely-stalked-and-severely-

Instead, our writer scours the secondhand bins of indie stores and charity shops – and bags a dozen crackers</p><p>Having dipped in and out of Record Store Day over the years, I have always dreamed that one day, while supplementing a collection founded on records I’d nicked from my dad’s garage, I’d track down the one and only 7-inch release by his 1960s band – called Sunny and the Cloudbursts – for a few pennies rather than a big wedge of notes.</p><p>So, to a soundtrack of screeching seagulls, I have come to Brighton, to continue searching for my vinyl holy grail and partake in a warm-up, my own bargain basement alternative to RSD, which falls this Saturday, bringing a dizzying avalanche of picture discs, rarities and Blur zoetrope reissues – albeit at a price.

Ben Quinn reports</p><p>Before 2007, going out on the town in the UK involved inhaling secondhand smoke – on trains, in restaurants, in clubs and in pubs. Even non-smokers would find that a stale tobacco scent could linger after an evening out. The ban on smoking indoors in public places changed things almost overnight.</p><p>Now with smoking rates among the population plummeting, the government is going a step further: it intends to ban the sale of tobacco to anyone born before 2009.
