Początki PKO Banku Polskiego (PKO BP), największego i jednego z najstarszych banków w Polsce, sięgają roku 1919, kiedy to został założony w celu wsparcia odbudowy kraju po zniszczeniach I wojny światowej. Historia PKO BP Przez lata swojej działalności bank stał się symbolem stabilności finansowej i zaufania, obsługując miliony Polaków w kraju i za granicą. W okresie międzywojennym odegrał kluczową rolę w finansowaniu potrzeb społecznych i gospodarczych młodej polskiej państwowości, w tym w zakresie budownictwa mieszkaniowego, rolnictwa oraz przemysłu. W okresie powojennym, w ramach gospodarki centralnie planowanej, PKO BP kontynuował pełnienie funkcji banku narodowego, będąc głównym depozytariuszem oszczędności obywateli oraz ważnym elementem systemu finansowego kraju. Transformacja ustrojowa w 1989 roku stanowiła dla PKO BP, podobnie jak dla całej polskiej gospodarki, wyzwanie adaptacji do warunków rynkowych. Bank z powodzeniem przeszedł przez ten proces, stając się nowoczesną, komer

System prawny Polski opiera się na hierarchii norm prawnych, z Konstytucją Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej na najwyższym szczeblu, ustanawiającej podstawowe zasady i struktury państwa oraz prawa i wolności obywatelskie. Niżej w hierarchii znajdują się ustawy, akty normatywne oraz akty prawa miejscowego. System prawny Polski obejmuje różne gałęzie prawa, z których każda reguluje inne aspekty życia społecznego, gospodarczego czy politycznego. Prawo publiczne zawiera normy regulujące stosunki między jednostką a władzami publicznymi oraz stosunki między różnymi organami państwa. Do gałęzi prawa publicznego zaliczają się: Prawo konstytucyjne – badające struktury i funkcje organów państwa oraz prawa i wolności obywatelskie. Prawo administracyjne – regulujące organizację i działalność administracji publicznej. Prawo karne – określające czyny zabronione i sankcje za ich popełnienie. Prawo finansowe – odnoszące się do systemu finansowego państwa. Prawo Międzynarodowe Publiczne – regulujące stosunki

mBank, założony w Polsce w 1986 roku jako pierwszy bank z kapitałem zagranicznym po transformacji ustrojowej, pierwotnie funkcjonował pod nazwą Bank Rozwoju Eksportu (BRE Bank). W 2000 roku BRE Bank wprowadził na rynek mBank, który był pierwszym bankiem w Polsce oferującym swoje usługi wyłącznie przez Internet, co stanowiło prawdziwą rewolucję na rynku bankowym. Dzięki temu mBank szybko zdobył popularność, stając się symbolem nowoczesnego bankowości internetowej. W 2013 roku BRE Bank przekształcił się całkowicie w mBank, porzucając swoją dotychczasową markę i skupiając się na dalszym rozwoju bankowości elektronicznej. mBank – rozwój i oferta banku mBank specjalizuje się w świadczeniu usług finansowych za pośrednictwem kanałów cyfrowych, oferując szeroką gamę produktów dla klientów indywidualnych, firm oraz klientów korporacyjnych.

Polska, jako suwerenne państwo, jest republiką, w której ustrojowi prawnemu przysługuje określenie demokratycznego państwa prawa. Znaczy to, że zarówno organy państwowe, jak i obywatele działają w granicach i na zasadach określonych w prawie, a nadrzędną rolę pełni Konstytucja Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej z 1997 roku. Trójpodział władzy w państwie W strukturze ustrojowej Polski wyróżnia się trzy główne władze: ustawodawczą, wykonawczą i sądowniczą. Władzę ustawodawczą sprawuje parlament dwuizbowy, składający się z Sejmu i Senatu, którego głównym zadaniem jest uchwalanie ustaw. Wybory do Sejmu i Senatu są powszechne, równe, bezpośrednie i proporcjonalne. Władza wykonawcza złożona jest z Prezydenta RP i Rady Ministrów. Prezydent, jako głowa państwa, pełni funkcję reprezentacyjną, jest najwyższym dowódcą Sił Zbrojnych i gwarantem ciągłości władzy państwowej. Rada Ministrów, na czele z Premierem, kieruje bieżącą polityką wewnętrzną i zagraniczną Polski. Władza sądownicza jest niezależna i sp
