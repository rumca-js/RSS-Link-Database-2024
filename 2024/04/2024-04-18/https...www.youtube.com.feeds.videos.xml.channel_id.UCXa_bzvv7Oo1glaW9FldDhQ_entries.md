From Morrowind to Oblivion to Skyrim and more, Bethesda Game Studios has delivered a number of standout, genre-defining open world RPGs over the years, but the one (or one of the ones) that the masses have collectively turned their attention to right now is 2008’s Fallout 3. 

With Amazon’s Fallout TV series receiving widespread praise and reigniting general interest in the post-apocalyptic franchise, many are going back to Fallout 3 (and other titles in the series) either to experience it for the first time ever or to get another taste of its offerings.

It’s hard to believe that it’s been nearly a decade since Fallout 4 came out, and even harder to believe that it’s probably going to be about as long before Fallout releases. 

Thankfully, series fans haven’t been left entirely in the dust, especially with the recent, widely acclaimed Amazon Prime TV show, while Bethesda is also set to release the game’s long-awaited Next-Gen Update as well. With its upcoming native PS5 and Xbox Series X/S launch, and with the Amazon show having reignited widespread interest in the franchise in general, it’s likely that Fallout 4 will soon be welcoming plenty of entirely new players who’ve never played the game before. 

If you’re in that group, here, we’re going to go over a few core details that you should know about the game itself, as well as what its upcoming update will bring.
