<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, im currently dealing with a issue with my fresh cluster that is driving me insane. I have setup ASM w/ 6 maps. All using uniqe ports and they all installed fine. However, when i start them all up, only one or two remain running without force closing. If i only run one or two, those two work fine but as soon as i go to start another, it crashes. Does anyone have any ideas, this is driving me mad. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/snkthegeek"> /u/snkthegeek </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c6wy0z/cluster_issues/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c6wy0z/cluster_issues/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I'm just a newbie what belongs to Self-Hosting. I've got a question. It already got answered somewhere else here but i want to be sure.</p> <p>I want to self-host some open source apps from my homeserver to the public. To make it secure (without port-forwarding) i need to use tailscale/headscale... right? I <strong>don't</strong> want to use Cloudflare tunnels and a VPS.</p> <p>My plan is to host a privatebin instance, invidious instance, wallabag or a own wordpress website for example. Everything should go through portainer in docker containers using Linux/Ubuntu.</p> <p>I did a research and found frp, ngrok, wireguard, traefik, duckDNS and nginx proxy manager. But what exactly do i need to do? I just want it to be mega-secure. I already have a domain on namecheap. Maybe someone could help me with a good a easy-understandable instruction for a beginner! Thanks in advance.</p> <p>(Sorry for the duplicate post, first one got removed)</p> 

## What admin web panels are there that provide commercial support by not cPanel or Plesk?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>cPanel and Plesk have become very expensive. I have tried some others that are less mainstream but have found that they have other issues like trying to dockerise everything and share little or nothing and use up exorbitant amounts of Ram. We tried that and found that we ended up quadrupling our Ram requirements for the same number of websites. Maybe they didn't do it right but quadruple Ram requirements doesn't work for us.</p> <p>Is there anything else we should be looking at?</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kiwiheretic"> /u/kiwiheretic </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c6vt71/what_admin_web_panels_are_there_that_provide/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1c6vt71/what_admin_web_panels_are_there_that_provide/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks, I’m hoping I can get some advice and opinions from folks smarter than I. I’ve been running a homelab for the past year or so and Im on the verge of upgrading/changing a few things. I figured it was time to reassess my current set up and perhaps find ways to improve. </p> <p>I currently have an unRaid server for everything. I only use unRaid’s docker setup to run a bunch of containers (Plex, *arr, Ombi, Grafana, etc).</p> <p>I’ll admit I didn’t do enough research before committing to unRaid. My primary reason for going with it last year was that I wanted to be able to easily add or replace drives in my array, and the other options sounded like they weren’t quite as straight forward to do this. I’ll also admit I’m likely very wrong here, but that’s what I thought back then.</p> <p>I’ll cut to the chase… I’m slowly working to split this unRaid server into 2 physical servers. One will be all media/Plex/*arr, and the other will be for other conta

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello</p> <p>I want to set up a home server using my old PC (which isn't really old). I intend to host game servers for me and my friends (like Satisfactory and Valheim). Additionally, I plan to run Home Assistant on the server. My plan is to use something like Proxmox and Pterodactyl. I also want to be able to access Home Assistant and possibly Pterodactyl externally.</p> <p>My main concern is security. I've been exploring options like Cloudflare Tunneling for Home Assistant and the Pterodactyl Panel. However, I'll need to have ports open for the game servers. I'm unsure if it's worth using a solution like this, or if I should consider separating the game servers onto their own device, while keeping Home Assistant and any other potential future services on another device.</p> <p>Regardless, the server will be on its own VLAN or on the VLAN with the IoT devices.</p> <p>Do you have any advice?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="
