<p>Building applications at scale is nothing compared to building an operating system like Windows, especially when it comes to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715125/version-control-catches-up-how-vcs-platforms-are-evolving.html">source code control</a>. How do you manage the repository (or repositories) for such a software behemoth, with thousands of developers and testers, and with a complex build pipeline that’s continuously delivering fresh code?</p><p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/bharry/scaling-git-and-some-back-story/" rel="nofollow">history with internal source control systems</a> is convoluted. You might think it used the now discontinued Visual SourceSafe, but that was most appropriate for local file systems and smaller projects. Instead, Microsoft used many different tools over the years, initially an internal fork of the familiar Unix Revision Control System, before standardizing on <a href="https://devbl

<p>Code commonly flows downstream, from an <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3429076/what-is-open-source-software-open-source-and-foss-explained.html">open-source</a> project into an organization’s own products. Upstreaming is the process of reversing that flow—contributing code <em>back</em> to an open-source project. The value proposition of upstreaming includes harnessing the strength of an open-source community to examine code, find and fix problems, and add their own features that make the code more valuable to everyone using it.</p><p>As someone who has been deeply involved with open-source projects for many years—I’ve committed code to <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/" rel="nofollow">the open source FreeBSD operating system project</a> for over a decade now, served on that project’s core team for two terms, contributed to <a href="https://openzfs.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">open source ZFS</a>, and co-written two books about ZF

<p>Java services are the most-impacted by third-party vulnerabilities, according to the <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/state-of-devsecops" rel="nofollow">“State of DevSecOps 2024”</a> report just released by cloud security provider Datadog.</p><p>Released on April 17, the report found that 90% of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3714933/jdk-23-the-new-features-in-java-23.html">Java</a> services were susceptible to one or more critical or high-severity vulnerabilities introduced by a third-party library.
