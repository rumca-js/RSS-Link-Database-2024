They include various types of chisels. There's a few decent sets available on amazon but I would personally call your local crafting and woodworking/hardware stores. I just picked up a set and have yet to try it out. Already have that deburring tool which works well on the edges but doesn't cut it for some jobs.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Therecanonly"> /u/Th
