<p>After nearly 50 years, the Rocky franchise is now nine movies deep. While almost all of them have gotten the 4K treatment over the years, there are still a couple of these films--1990's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rocky-Ultra-Steelbook-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B0CYNRRD65?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Rocky 5</a> and 2006's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYM6VD2G?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Rocky Balboa</a>--that don't yet have 4K Blu-rays for you to put on your shelf. But that won't be the case for much longer, because you can preorder the 4K Blu-ray sets for both Rocky 5 and Rocky Balboa right now.</p><p>These new Rocky Blu-rays include each movie in 4K, standard Blu-ray, and digital download formats, and package it all in collectible steelbook cases featuring iconic shots from the movies on the cover and interior. The Rocky Balboa 4K Blu-ray set includes separate discs for the original theatrical release and the extended director's cut.</p><div class="norewrite" title="Rocky 5 and Rock

<p>The first trailer for M. Night Shyamalan's newest movie, Trap, has arrived--and it's a doozy. The film stars Josh Hartnett as a serial killer who attends a concert with his daughter, only to discover that the whole thing was a set-up, or a trap, if you will, to catch him. Or so that's what the trailer leads us to believe. Shyamalan's movies are known for their twist endings, so while the trailer looks like it gives a lot away in terms of the plot, there is presumably more under the surface.</p><p>Shyamalan said during an event attended by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/trailers/trap-trailer-m-night-shyamalan-josh-hartnett-serial-killer-1235969603/">Variety</a> that he was interested in making a movie "from the vantage point of an unexpected person," and this is Hartnett's character.</p><p>"It kind of led more and more to this dark humor angle that Servant has and The Visit and Split had," he said.

Even the most unwatchable film is a complex combination of light, sound, design, writing, and performance. Not only that, but they're also running on tight schedules with strict budgets. With so many people, roles, and constraints, it's no surprise that movies occasionally overlook important details. Maybe the actor they'd cast for a single scene was suddenly unavailable, or a sharp change in weather forced the crew to shoot on an accelerated timeline. Maybe someone forgot that we only had 45 states at the turn of the 20th century, or didn't remember that one of the props didn't exist in the year the movie is set.</p><p dir="ltr">And so people pretend to sweep or they forget to set down their coffee cup out of fr

<p>Despite poor review scores, Zack Snyder's sci-fi movie series Rebel Moon could stretch to as many as six films. Snyder told <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/movies/scifi/zack-snyder-6-rebel-moon-movies-exclusive-newsupdate/">RadioTimes</a> that he's considering four or six Rebel Moon movies.</p><p>Rebel Moon and Rebel Moon Part Two: The Scargiver were filmed back-to-back (a relatively common Hollywood practice to help save money), and if any sequels are filmed this way as well, Snyder said he could see up to six Rebel Moon films.</p><p>"I guess four makes sense. Four or six movies, depending... I guess it's whether or not every time we make one of these movies we make two, that's the question," he said. "We were talking about it the other day and I was like, would an audience be disappointed if they only got one movie now from Rebel Moon? Would they be like, 'Oh, it's one now? Great.'"</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zack-snyder-has-plans-for-up-to-6-rebel-moon-mov

<p>This long-awaited origin story of how the most iconic characters in Transformers mythos, Orion Pax and D-16, went from brothers-in-arms to sworn enemies as Optimus Prime and Megatron is finally being told on the big screen with Transformers One. Chris Hemsworth and Oscar nominee Brian Tyree Henry join the Transformers universe for the first time as Optimus and Megatron, respectively.</p><p>The most innovative aspect of the trailer was how it premiered--in space. A spacecraft was launched Thursday morning and continued with a live-streamed countdown showing the journey into space. After one hour, the craft peaked at 125,000 feet above the Earth, revealing the trailer. The event was simultaneously streamed from the Transformers <a href="https://twitter.com/transformers">Twitter account</a>, the Paramount Pictures <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@paramountpictures">YouTube channel</a>, and co-streamed by Chris Hemsworth on Instagram.</p><div>          </div><p> </p><a href="https://w

<p>A new survey of working game developers has revealed that a large number of devs have concerns about the sustainability of the live-service game model, even as some major publishers continue to redouble efforts in that area.</p><p>The survey was undertaken by the Game Developer Collective, a panel of over 600 developers created in a collaboration between <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/70-percent-of-devs-wary-of-live-service-games-being-sustainable">Game Developer</a>, analyst firm Omdia, and GDC. Of those surveyed, 39% indicated they were "somewhat concerned" about live-service business models, while 31% were "very concerned." Only 29% answered that they either had no concern or weren't sure.</p><p>When the developers who indicated mild or moderate concern were questioned further about their specific worries about the business model, 63% said they were worried about players losing interest in the game, while 62% were concerned about competition from other games.

This isn't a normal adaptation, though, but rather a new entry in the franchise set in 2296, which is the furthest we've ever gone in the timeline. In other words, all the Fallout games took place in the show's past. That's pretty neat! And it means that, on top of the many fun surface-level Easter eggs and other nods to the games, we've also got some big and meaningful story connections to sort through. Whether you're a longtime fan of the games or a newb just getting started with Fallout, there's a lot you can glean about where this show is headed based on these references and connections. So let's dive in.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>But be warned: This art
