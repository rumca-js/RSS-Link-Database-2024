In fairness, I'm assuming he identifies as LatinX since he's an actor, he's from New York City, and this segment was to entertain progressive white urbanites who get their news from <em>The Daily Show</em>. Outside of NYC, Hispanics are struggling with the economy and crime under Joe Biden, same as Americans of all nationalities across the rest of the country.</p><p>Leguizamo was so outraged that he took out his frustration on a pinata.</p><div class="r

I'd make it so that when my family was asked what my last words were, they remembered a killer zinger, possibly with a niece squirting Sprite out of her nose laughing. One awesome Canadian grandma had the opportunity, and she took it with one parting shot at our favorite pile of soy and hair goop, Justin "I Feel Pretty" Trudeau.</p><p>Our condolences to this lovely woman's family, and thank you for remembering to do it for the content ev
