https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

Introverts often shy away from speaking at conferences, while conferences need all the speakers they can find. This talk will show introverts that speaking is a natural role for them.

Rudyard Merriam

Rud Merriam is a retired software developer, having lived through the spaghetti, structured programming, and object-oriented development paradigms. He's trying to figure out functional programming and keep up with the latest C++ standards.

Rud wrote his first FORTRAN IV in 1968 and his first C++ in 1990 with Borland's Turbo C++. During his career, he worked mainly with embedded systems, with one system measuring the flow in real pipelines. Since retirement, he has used C++ with multiple NASA Centennial Challenges of robotics on Mars and the Moon. He sporadically writes about C++ on Medium.com.
