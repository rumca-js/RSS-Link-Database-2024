<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-08-31-pounding-beats-and-dragons-in-crypt-of-the-necrodancer.html"><em>Crypt of the Necrodancer</em></a> just won’t die — and that’s a good thing. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-09-gdca-2015-finalists-led-by-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor.html">nearly decade-old roguelike rhythm game</a> received new content on Thursday, bringing virtual pop star Hatsune Miku into the fold as a playable character.</p>
<p>Developer Brace Yourself Games says Hatsune Miku is one of the more challenging characters in the game. She can move in all eight directions and takes out foes by boogying her way through groups of enemies. The developer’s press release explains, “She doesn’t have a shovel like most characters, so she must use her dance-like dash attack to break through walls instead.” Hell yeah.</p>

<p>Disney just pulled a fast one. Star Wars movies and shows are typically announced years before being released, but the company <a href="http://./">just revealed a new TV program</a> that premieres next month. <em>Tales of the Empire</em> is an animated show produced by Dave Filoni, the man who cut his teeth on cartoons like <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em> and <em>Star Wars Rebels</em> before moving onto <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ahsoka-review-star-wars-disney-193023619.html">live action stuff like <em>Ahsoka</em></a>.</p>
<div id="3c1f438d81fd437dbcc7040f634095ea"></div>
<p>As the name suggests, this is something of a companion piece to 2022’s <em>Tales of the Jedi</em>. It’s an anthology series that spotlights different characters within the empire as they, uh, heroically try to defeat the nefarious rebels and bring order to the galaxy. You can expect appearances by many of your dark side faves, including Grand Admiral Thrawn, General Grievous and the Grand Inquisitor.<

<p>The multiview experience will let you watch up to four stages simultaneously, letting you pick which one to hear: exactly how multiview works for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/march-madness-live-brings-multiview-streaming-to-the-web-for-up-to-four-games-160010247.html">March Madness</a>, NFL games or any other sporting event.

The car was supposed to come out next year but has now been delayed until 2027, with the company suggesting it will use the extra time to “take advantage of emerging battery technology.” Ford says it’ll be making moves to “mitigate the impact the launch delay will have on” the Canadian workforce.</p>
<p>The next-generation electric pickup, codenamed “T3,” is also being delayed from late 2025 to 2026. It’s being built at the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center assembly plant at the company’s BlueOval City complex, though Ford says it's just now installing stamping equipment that will produce the sheet metal for the truck.</p>

<p>If you're in the Metro Phoenix area — and don't mind walking out of your place to get your food delivery — your Uber Eats order may just get delivered by one of Waymo's self-driving cars. The companies have <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2024/04/phoenix-residents-can-now-experience-uber-eats-delivery-with-the-waymo/">officially launched</a> the next part of their ongoing multi-year partnership, which also includes offering robotaxi rides to the ride-hailing service's customers in the area. When you place an order on Uber Eats, you'll get a prompt that says "autonomous vehicles may deliver your order."&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be notified if a Waymo car does pick up your order, and you'll have to take your phone with you when you meet it so that you can open its trunk and get your food. Don't worry, you can opt out during the checkout process in case you're not feeling up to going out and getting your order and would rather have someone deliver food to your door.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">Robot vacuums</a> are handy little devices that can help folks save a ton of time and energy. However, some of the more well-known options are often a bit pricey, especially when a mopping function comes into the mix. As it happens, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/irobot/">iRobot</a> has revealed a relatively budget-friendly 2-in-1 robot vacuum and mop. It says the $275 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/roomba/">Roomba</a> Combo Essential actually outperforms the Roomba 600 Series thanks to 20 times more suction power, and the addition of a mop and smart navigation.</p>
<p>According to iRobot, this model offers 25 percent better performance at picking up dirt from hard floors than the Roomba 600 Series. It's also said to have a longer battery life at up to 120 minutes, the ability to clean in neat rows, customizable suction and liquid settings, Clean Map reports and intelligent settings such as suggested

Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC) will establish an official time reference to help guide future lunar missions. The US, China, Japan, India and Russia have space missions to the Moon planned or completed.</p>
<p>NASA (and the White House) aren’t the only ones trying. The European Space Agency is also trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moon-own-time-zone-esa-113547009.html">make a time zone</a> outside of Earth’s… zone.</p>
