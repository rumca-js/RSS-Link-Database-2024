No, Senua\u2019s relationship with her psychosis has shifted, actress Melina Juergens has put in some hard work to deliver as convincing a performance as possible for Senua\u2019s expanded combat skillset, and the signature binaural audio of the first game returns with greater focus on more than just the haunting voices in Senua\u2019s head.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVT-HP17O4U", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/FVT-HP17O4U/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why Hellblade 2 Will Be One of the BIGGEST GAMES OF THE YEAR", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-04T09:45:02+00:00", "description": "Shift Up's Stellar Blade's gameplay looks interesting ever since its showing during Sony's State of Play in January. Coupled with the recent demo and the lack of big first-party PS5 titles for the rest of the year, its gameplay is shaping up well.\n\nHowever, there's a lot more to the hack-and-slash action-adventure.
