This talk will show introverts that speaking is a natural role for them.\n---\n\nRudyard Merriam\n\nRud Merriam is a retired software developer, having lived through the spaghetti, structured programming, and object-oriented development paradigms. He's trying to figure out functional programming and keep up with the latest C++ standards.\n\nRud wrote his first FORTRAN IV in 1968 and his first C++ in 1990 with Borland's Turbo C++. During his career, he worked mainly with embedded systems, with one system measuring the flow in real pipelines.
