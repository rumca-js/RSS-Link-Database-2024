<p>Everton’s Sean Dyche badly needs a win while Liverpool and Manchester United renew their historic rivalry</p><p>Michael Olise’s anticipated return from injury for Crystal Palace against Manchester City could not be more timely for Oliver Glasner’s struggling side. The France Under-21 international has been in sensational form this season on the rare occasions he has made it on to the pitch – Olise has played only 755 minutes so far in just 11 appearances, but in that time has scored six goals and provided three assists. City are believed to be one of several clubs who have been monitoring his progress and will be wary of the threat he poses to their title ambitions, especially if he can adapt quickly to Glasner’s favoured 3-4-2-1 formation. Like Palace, who are still not quite safe given their testing run-in that only features games against sides above them, Eberechi Eze has not been in his best form so far under the Austrian. But could the return of Olise help the England midfield

<p>Chelsea took advantage on a wild night when the visitors lost composure and shape – and the match – in stoppage time</p><p>At first there was no hint of panic from Manchester United. They played it well after this bewilderingly ragged game ticked into eight minutes of added time. They seemed to be in control of the situation, Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount calmly running down the clock by guarding possession on the left flank, Chelsea’s frustration building as they edged closer towards a 3-2 defeat that would have been entirely of their own making.</p><p>Ultimately, though, there is nothing secure about Erik ten Hag’s United. The initial composure faded, the shape disappearing, Noni Madueke given one last chance to run at Diogo Dalot on the right. A slip, a tumble, a blow of the referee’s whistle and suddenly the mood changed. Cole Palmer, nerveless from the spot, made it 3-3 with his second penalty of the evening. United were going to have to settle for a point.</p> <a href="http

Thousands more followed in small boats, anything they could find: dinghies, tugs, canoes. The photos are astonishing and they are <em>everywhere</em> in the city. They are also 40 years old; just the word <em>gabarra</em> (barge) has something mythical about it, instantly understood and loaded with nostalgia.</p><p>Longing too.

<p>The transfer fee was substantial and he had a shaky start but the 22-year-old has become a vital threat in the Spurs attack </p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/BenMcAleer1">Ben McAleer</a> for <a href="http://www.whoscored.com/">WhoScored</a></p><p>Brennan Johnson had a mixed start at Tottenham. The Wales forward joined the club from Nottingham Forest on deadline day in September for £47m, a hefty fee for a player whose first campaign in the Premier League had been solid, not spectacular. Johnson scored eight goals in 38 league appearances for Forest last season, a decent contribution but perhaps not enough to justify his substantial price tag. Nevertheless, Spurs needed a direct and versatile winger who would boost their homegrown quota.</p><p>Ange Postecoglou wants his wide players to hog the touchline and either make darting runs behind defences or get to the byline and put back the ball into the box. In that sense, Johnson was an ideal acquisition. But Spurs fans were unconv

With a heavily symbolic fairytale scenario by the author of the Bluebeard libretto, Béla Balázs, it requires the largest orchestra that Bartók ever used: quadruple woodwind and six percussionists. Perhaps that accounts in part for its rarity in the concert hall, even though some conductors, notably Pierre Boulez, programmed it regularly. But the music is curiously uneven. Some of the score seems to look back to earlier Bartók and to the roots of his style, the opening, for instance, inescap

It will make the labour market less flexible. For those with long enough memories, the push back against Labour’s plans for a new deal for workers has a familiar ring to it.

On screen, his long-lost great aunt Marcelle oozes sly wit and elegance. You can tell they would both be a delight at a dinner party.</p><p>But this hour in their company is an uneven one, and The Death and Life of All of Us still feels like a work in progress. In Esses’ sincere performance, which asks what narratives we tell of ourselves, he traces the roots of his own identity through Marcelle’s extraordinary journey from Lebanon to Italy. But where the beginnings of stories and encounters are offered, the middles and ends are too often left out, no momentum pushing us on. The disparate threads remain so, and this story of connection never quite connects.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/apr/04/the-death-and-life-of-all-of-us-review

<p>The Norwegian theatremaker talks about succeeding Ivo van Hove as artistic director of one of the influential Internationaal Theater Amsterdam and staging classic plays as rock concerts</p><p>When Eline Arbo informed her mother at a young age that she wanted to be a theatre director, her mother told her that it would take more than talent and hard work to become a truly great artist – you had to be respectful and caring, too. She remembers her mother telling her that “a lot of great artists are terrible people, and a lot of lovely people are mediocre artists. The hardest thing is to combine the two.”</p><p>Today the 38-year-old Norwegian is still striving to meet the high bar set by her mother at no less exposed a workplace than one of the best-known theatres in Europe. Having made a name for herself in her native country and the Netherlands with productions that wedded style and playfulness, Arbo has been the artistic director of Internationaal Theater Amsterdam (ITA) since last S

<p>I don’t want to be cynical or pessimistic, but it’s difficult in such gloomy times. Can I find a way to tap into my playful side?</p><p>We live in interesting times, but interesting times are not good times. The world, like the weather, is permanently unsettled. The government of the UK has retreated to its panic room, and the electorate of the US appears to have gone insane. While real wars are waged abroad, we fight culture wars of such resounding stupidity that it’s embarrassing to hold an opinion. However cynical we may be about the future, every day brings new information that obliges us to revise our forecasts downwards.</p><p>Persistent cynicism may be wholly appropriate in such a climate, but it’s not good for you – being cynical is associated with a range of disastrous health outcomes. If we are to leave cynicism behind, we must re-acquaint ourselves with wonder. But how can we do this? Is it possible to find joy again? To learn to see the world as children do? That, at le

After almost a decade and a half of ploughing what must at times have been a lonely and exhausting furrow as Britain’s first and so far only Green MP, she is standing down at the next election to focus solely on climate and nature. Her parting shot, however, is a&nbsp;book with a much broader and more ambitious aim, sketching out an alternative vision of England to the jingoistic and aggressive one conjured up by culture war squabbles over flags or singing Land of Hope and Glory at the Proms.</p><p>Though the idea that there are other ways to be English than getting misty-eyed about the white cliffs of Dover or nostalgic for the days of empire is obviously not a new one, in the current climate of increasingly belligerent nationalism it certainly bears repeating.
