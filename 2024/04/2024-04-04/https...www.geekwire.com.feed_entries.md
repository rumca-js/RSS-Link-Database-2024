It also marked the ninth straight quarter of negative net office absorption, which is calculated by the total amount of space leased minus the total space vacated in a given quarter. &#8220;Looking forward, tepid office demand coupled with historically high availability rates and negative net absorption present concern,&#8221; the report noted. Before the pandemic, vacancy rates in the Seattle region were around 6%.

Now he&#8217;s in line to travel to space with Jeff Bezos&#8217; Blue Origin space venture. Blue Origin listed the 90-year-old Dwight among six people who&#8217;ll be on its New Shepard suborbital rocket ship when it resumes crewed flights, on a date yet to be announced. Crewed flights were suspended after an uncrewed research mission went awry in 2022, but a repeat of that uncrewed mission went off without a hitch last&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/blue-origin-black-astronaut-ed-dwight/">Read More</a>
