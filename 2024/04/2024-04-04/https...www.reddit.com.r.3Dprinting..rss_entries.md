<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I manage a resin 3d printer fleet of Carbons and HeyGears at an independent dental lab and I’ve been looking at washing/drying units. Our current setup uses an orbital shaker and the typical 2-stage bath, but I feel that this is a largely inefficient use of alcohol. We blow through a 55gal drum in about 2 weeks. I’ve been looking at the SprintRay Pro Wash/Dry, but something like this seems marked up because it’s made for “dental.” </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bladeblade-8"> /u/bladeblade-8 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1bvzlpn/dental_lab_looking_to_optimize_alcohol_consumption/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1bvzlpn/dental_lab_looking_to_optimize_alcohol_consumption/">[comments]</a></span>
