<p>For a fraught second-half spell at Anfield Sheffield United were level and Liverpool were in peril of a most unexpected slip-up. Step forward Alexis Mac Allister. The World Cup winner restored Jürgen Klopp’s team to the Premier League summit with an exquisite strike as Liverpool yet again held their nerve and their slender command of the title race.</p><p>With Gary McAllister appropriately looking on, the Liverpool midfielder settled Anfield’s anxieties after a Conor Bradley own goal had cancelled out Darwin Núñez’s first-half fluke and given Arsenal and Manchester City hope of a shock point for Chris Wilder’s battling side. Mac&nbsp;Allister has now been involved in a Liverpool goal in the last six matches, scoring three and delivering four assists as he steps up to the pressure of winning a Premier League title. Cody Gakpo provided the comfort of a third in the final minute – the 80th goal that United have conceded this season – but this was far from the cruise that many anticipa

<p>This 70s-set prelude to the classic satanic horror has flair but struggles with the weight and familiarity of what came before</p><p>We didn’t need a prequel to landmark 1976 horror The Omen but we’d have been foolish not to expect one. The major genre films of that era – Halloween, The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Alien, Suspiria – have all seen a new round of remakes, reboots and remixes in the last few years – some tolerable, most not – and so another Damien chapter is as inevitable as the rise of Damien himself.</p><p>It’s not the first time anyone has tried either. After the series sputtered out in 1991 with the cheapo gender-swapped TV movie Omen IV: The Awakening, the films went the way of most horror during that decade and it took until 2006, a time of anything-goes, mostly gutter-level remakes, for the sixes to align once again. It was a slickly made yet utterly soulless retread (released on 6 June of course) and it took another decade for the obvious small-scree

<p>His student band was a catastrophe but the Turner prize-winning artist decided to release his music after Frank Ocean appropriated one of his experimental songs. So is his uplifting new album pop – or art?</p><p>Wolfgang Tillmans never had any intention of releasing music and certainly no intention of playing it live. This is an intriguing thing for the noted German photographer to say given that he’s on a Zoom call from his Berlin home to discuss his second album, Build from Here, which moreover includes a track called Grüne Linien that was recorded live on stage with his band Fragile, at a festival in Fire Island in 2018. Equally, you can see why Tillmans’ musical history may give him pause about, as he puts it, making music “with a direct public intent”. His head was turned by encountering the new romantic scene while on a trip to the UK to improve his English. “British pop music at the time offered such a kaleidoscope,” he enthuses, “combining things that didn’t belong together

<p>Lovers, fighters … and gangsters? On the centenary of the actor’s birth, we pick out his greatest roles</p><p>A minor picture with curiosity value: Charlie Chaplin’s final film as a director, starring Brando and Sophia Loren, a comedy in the style of the Hollywood Golden Age, based on the tall tales of a real-life Russian singer and in fact originally conceived by Chaplin in the 30s for Paulette Goddard. Brando plays an American diplomat who is astonished to find that the Russian countess (Loren) he was charmed by in Hong Kong has stowed away in his cabin on the voyage home. Brando does his best and this method legend was sufficiently in awe of Chaplin to submit to his old-fashioned way of working: acting out for Brando the required line-readings and movements. (Oh, to have had fly-on-the-wall location footage of these moments.) Certainly, Brando would never again be so submissive with a director.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/04/more-than-a-contender-marlo

<p>This Dickensian yarn of a celebrity writer heading for a fall combines the bling of an airport bestseller with an insider’s grasp on high culture</p><p></p><p>The city itself is the star of all great London novels, and plays whatever role is required by the tale or the times. It was a semi-sentient organism in Dickens’s Bleak House, wrapped in fog and thick with mud. It was rancorous and&nbsp;gone to seed in Patrick Hamilton’s Hangover Square; gauche and adventurous in Colin MacInnes’s Absolute Beginners and Zadie Smith’s White Teeth. John Wyndham’s The Day of the Triffids cast it as a city of the blind, prowled by carnivorous walking plants. That probably remains fictional London’s lowest ebb. But at times, for dark stretches, Andrew O’Hagan’s seventh novel runs it close.</p><p>This is in no way to suggest that Caledonian Road is a drag. Quite the opposite: it’s an addictively enjoyable yarn; a state-of-the-nation social novel with the swagger and bling of an airport bestseller an

To many, the idea that choosing a fifth Tory prime minister in as many years might be the solution to internal party turmoil, or that ditching Sunak a few months before a general election would reanimate the electorate, will feel utterly delusional. To a significant group of Conservative MPs and activists, however, it is a primrose path that beckons irresistibly.</p><p>These critics never supported Sunak in the first place.
