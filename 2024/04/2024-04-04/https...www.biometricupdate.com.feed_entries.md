		Explosive growth in air travel numbers, from 4 billion travelers in 2019 to 8 billion in 2040, according to the latest forecast by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), necessitates the adoption of face and fingerprint biometrics to keep people moving. This is the chief argument of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/sita">SITA</a>’s new “<a href="https://www.sita.aero/lp/face-the-future/">Face the Future</a>” white paper on biometrics in air travel.

Legacy processes and manual passenger processing infrastructure are already failing to facilitate fast and convenient travel journeys, prompting initiatives like <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202209/star-alliance-expects-biometrics-use-by-more-member-airlines-idemia-upd

		Six out of ten property managers said they faced rental fraud in the past two years, according to <a href="https://www.transunion.com/lp/multifamily-fraud-report-2023">research</a> from TransUnion’s Multifamily Report. Almost 40 percent didn't identify the fraud until after the tenant moved in.

It's significantly harder to stop fraud after someone becomes a resident. “Delinquencies and evictions are expensive and take significant time and effort to enact. In the meantime, the other residents are at risk with fraudsters nearby,” says Maitri Johnson, vice president of TransUnion’s tenant and employment screening business. Fraud created a rise in evictions for 43 percent of proper
