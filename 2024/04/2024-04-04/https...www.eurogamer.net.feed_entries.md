Amazon has announced the 12 games it'll be giving away to all Prime Gaming subscribers in April, with this month's offerings including Fallout 76 - whose arrival is perfectly timed to coincide with Amazon's new Fallout TV series.
</p><p>
April's subscriber freebies arrive across four weekly drops starting today, 4th April, with medieval multiplayer hack-and-slasher Chivalry 2, fantasy MMO Black Desert, and casual puzzler Faraway 2: Jungle Escape.
</p><p>
The full month ahead includes the likes of Fallout 76 - the online-focused take on Bethesda's much-loved post-apocalyptic series, which arrives 11th April alongside Amazon's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-series-latest-trailer-reveals-a-familiar-bethesda-post-apocalypse">live-action Fallout TV adaptation</a> - and acclaimed pinball-meets-shoot-'em'-up D

With the Epic Games Store's latest weekly freebie offers now live, Epic has turned its gaze to the far-flung future of seven days time, confirming acclaimed cyberpunk action-parkour adventure Ghostrunner will be its next free title from Thursday, 11th April.
</p><p>
Ghostrunner, which launched to much acclaim back in October 2020, cast players as protagonist Jack as they scale the dystopian Dharma Tower - humanity's last shelter following a cataclysmic event - on a quest to topple the tyrannical Keymaster and take their revenge.
</p><p>
What follows is some brutally difficult first-person parkour action, as players leap and bound their way across neon-smeared levels, eliminating enemies in bouts of breathlessly balletic katana swinging. Unless they're terrible at it like me, in which

Four years after Nuclear Throne and Ridiculous Fishing developer Vlambeer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/luftrausers-studio-vlambeer-closes-doors-on-10th-birthday">announced it was shutting its doors</a>, the highly regarded indie studio is back in the news, with co-founder Jan Willem Nijman now its full owner following Rami Ismail's decision to sell his shares.
</p><p>
Vlambeer was founded by Nijman and Ismail back in 2010, and the studio - after releasing a succession of acclaimed titles, including the likes of Super Crate Box and Luftrausers, alongside the aforementioned Nuclear Throne and Ridiculous Fishing - celebrated its tenth by winding down. "We had a beautiful run, made incredible games, and worked with amazing people, but it is time for new things," the pair wrote at the time. "So we're announcing the end of Vlambeer

C-Smash VRS - last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-full-body-psvr2-game-c-smash-vrs-a-smash-or-a-pass">well-recieved</a> PSVR2 update of Sega's cult 2001 arcade and Dreamcast sci-fi sports game Cosmic Smash - is wiggling out of its headset to get a non-VR edition on PlayStation 5, also available to existing owners, later this year.
</p><p>
The original Cosmic Smash offered something like a futuristic blend of Breakout and squash, taking players on a sci-fi subway ride between stages challenging them to clear blocks at the end of a long room using a ball and racquet, all within a time limit.

Last year's PSVR2 reimagining from developer Wolf &amp; Wood - which is making its way to Meta Quest 2/3/Pro and Pico 4 headsets from today, 4th April - adapted the formula to support first-person, motion-trac

## Dragon's Dogma 2 patch analysis: more options are nice - but key issues remain

Dragon's Dogma 2 is a technically advanced title that is often quite stunning, packing some of the best lighting I've seen this generation - while the gameplay mechanics have attracted multiple plaudits. However, on the flipside, there's no doubt that it's also saddled with performance issues and configuration problems, producing an occasionally unsatisfactory experience on both PC and console platforms. Thankfully, developer Capcom has been quick to deploy the game's first patch on consoles, which promises fixes for the game's variable frame-rate and always-on motion blur, alongside a toggle to disable its ray tracing effects entirely. Has the game been comprehensively improved? Or is this just one small step towards the more polished, performant game we would have liked to have seen at launch?

Square Enix has launched a new merchandise shop for pets in Japan, featuring designs based on Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Kingdom Hearts.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/goods/pets/">Squex Pets</a>, as it's known, even has Tetsuya Nomura on side to supervise item creation, following his work on Final Fantasy 7 and the Kingdom Hearts series.
</p><p>
Products so far include themed leashes and bandanas, plus a pet bed in the shape of an iconic Dragon Quest slime. I'm particularly fond of the Buster Sword toy, even if its shape isn't exactly sword-like.

High street second hand games giant CEX is launching a console repair service, in partnership with established company Tech Centre. 
</p><p>
The idea is you'll be able to leave your broken Xbox or smashed-up Switch at any of CEX's 380 UK stores, with the aim of it being returned to you, all fixed up, within seven days. 
</p><p>
In reality, CEX is simply aiming to act as a drop-off hub for your broken tech, with devices then collected by Tech Centre to be looked at by their "cutting edge tech repair geeks". And it's at this point that the seven-day aim then kicks in.

Hellblade 2: Senua's Saga will only run at 30fps on Xbox Series X/S.
</p><p>
The forthcoming game from Ninja Theory has been built exclusively for Xbox and PC using Unreal Engine 5, truly showing the power of the engine.
</p><p>
However, this comes at a cost. As German outlet <a href="https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-preview,3411190.html">GamePro</a> has confirmed, the game only runs at 30fps on console with a dynamic resolution. There are no graphics modes, although frame rate can be increased if played on PC.

Geralt's dwarf friend Zoltan Chivay will appear in the next season of Netflix's The Witcher, played by actor Danny Woodburn.

A long-term ally of Geralt throughout CD Projekt's Witcher trilogy, Zoltan will make his debut in the TV series' upcoming fourth season, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/witcher-season-4-cast-sharlto-copley-james-purefoy-danny-woodburn-1235954863/">Variety</a> reported, as Liam Hemsworth takes on the title role. 
</p><p>
Woodburn is a veteran actor with a track record of appearing in numerous fantasy series, such as the Conan the Adventurer, Charmed and Willow. If you're Seinfeld fan, however, you likely know him best as the recurring character Mickey Abbott.
