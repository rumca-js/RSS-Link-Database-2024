The district thought the proper punishment was to suspend the alleged rapists for one whole day - without the involvement of law enforcement. Subsequently, the school not only failed to protect the child but decided not to fulfill its fiduciary duty in reporting child sex abuse to authorities. </p><p>Subsequently, the family filed a $9 million lawsuit against Portland Public Schools. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
