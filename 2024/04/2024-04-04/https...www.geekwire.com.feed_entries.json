It also marked the ninth straight quarter of negative net office absorption, which is calculated by the total amount of space leased minus the total space vacated in a given quarter. &#8220;Looking forward, tepid office demand coupled with historically high availability rates and negative net absorption present concern,&#8221; the report noted. Before the pandemic, vacancy rates in the Seattle region were around 6%.
