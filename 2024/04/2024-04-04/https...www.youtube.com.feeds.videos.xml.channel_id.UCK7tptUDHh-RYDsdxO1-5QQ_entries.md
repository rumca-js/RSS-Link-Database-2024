A new WSJ poll found that former president Donald Trump has taken the lead over President Joe Biden in half a dozen key battleground states including Michigan, Georgia and Arizona. The lead for the 2020 rematch is propelled in part by broad voter dissatisfaction with the national economy and doubts about Biden’s capabilities and job performance.

Wall Street Journal editor Aaron Zitner explains what the latest numbers tell us about America’s approaching 2024 presidential election.
