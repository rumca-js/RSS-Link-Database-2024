Today HP is closing out <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/victus-by-hp-gaming-laptop-pc-15t-fa100-156-771t0av-1&amp;xcust=2-1-2288333-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">one model in its Victus sub-brand for $699.99</a>, $300 off its regular price. While a 13th-gen Core i5 and an Nvidia RTX 3050 aren&rsquo;t going to plow through the latest high-end games, it should be able to play the vast majority of titles at medium settings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HP Victus 1550fa-100 (just rolls off the tongue, doesn&rsquo;t it?) packs a 15.6-inch, 1080p display with an IPS panel, which won&rsquo;t win any speed awards, but is more color-accurate than your usual gaming display.
