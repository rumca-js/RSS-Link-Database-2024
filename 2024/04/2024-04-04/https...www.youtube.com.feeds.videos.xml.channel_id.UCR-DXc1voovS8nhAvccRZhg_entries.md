Radxa's Penta SATA HAT fits nicely atop the Raspberry Pi 5. Can I use it to build the ultimate Pi 5 NAS? Or will we run into issues?

This video is not sponsored, neither Open Sauce nor Radxa paid anything, nor did they have any input into this videoâ€”however I did recieve the Radxa Penta SATA HAT featured in this video for review, as well as the Pineberry Pi boards.
