In a bizarre turn of events over the past few weeks, Spain&#8217;s high court ordered a ban on Telegram because some users (gasp!) used the tool to share copyright-protected content. The judge then suspended his own order a few days later after receiving a lot of criticism. Then, the judge asked the police to investigate [&#8230;]

Last week we noted how AT&#38;T was being rather cagey about the leak of the personal data of 73 million AT&#38;T customers to the open web. The data, which includes customer social security addresses, names, phone numbers, and email addresses, first popped up back in 2021 after a hacker somehow obtained the data, encrypted it, [&#8230;]

Remember Nick Sandmann? He was the dude who became something of a Rorschach Test for how much your political beliefs (in any direction) influence your views of a short video, when EVERYONE HAD OPINIONS on his MAGA-hat wearing encounter with a Native American demonstrator, Nathan Phillips. Also, everyone magically became experts in reading body language [&#8230;]

Just recently, we covered a case involving a bogus raid of someone&#8217;s home based on nothing more than a ping from Apple&#8217;s &#8216;find my device&#8217; feature. The Denver (CO) PD&#8217;s SWAT team raided the home of 77-year-old Ruby Johnson, destroying her garage door and some ceiling panels (?) in the process. The raid was predicated [&#8230;]

It’s been a few years since I last did a “Let me rewrite that for you” post. This idea was first suggested by the brilliant press critic Dan Froomkin. Basically, when he finds a bit of journalistic malpractice, he rewrites it the way a good journalist would, to show why the original was so wrong. [&#8230;]

The FCC has announced that it will vote to restore the net neutrality rules stripped away by the Trump administration during an agency meeting on April 25. A reminder: net neutrality rules prevent giant telecoms from abusing their market power to disadvantage competitors and consumers alike. Either by degrading the performance of a service that [&#8230;]

I&#8217;m going to kick this post off by stipulating to a couple of facts. First, the primary subject of this post is YouTuber Andrew Callaghan. Callaghan has both something of a checkered past as a YouTuber, having had his most recent channel briefly taken down over claims of spreading COVID-19 misinformation, but in which he&#8217;s [&#8230;]
