The First Omen, reviewed by Eric Goldman. Narrated by Erik Adams.

The First Omen manages to serve as a well made prequel as well as an unsettling and creepy horror film in its own right. It takes awhile to get going, and the very end bends backwards pretty far to create setup for potential follow-ups, but the brunt of the movie is very strong, with lead Nell Tiger Free and director Arkasha Stevenson both cementing themselves as stars on the rise.

Seven years ago, Star Trek: Discovery debuted as the seventh Star Trek series in the illustrious and long-running science fiction franchise. Discovery, or Disco as it is affectionately known, was also the first Trek anything to debut on a streaming service. Its success made episodic Star Trek viable again after a 12-year dry spell, and now fans have a robust lineup of all kinds of Trek series on Paramount+ as a result. 

But all starship missions eventually come to an end. So with Season 5 of Discovery, Captain Michael Burnham and her USS Discovery crew embark on their final adventure. We spoke to some of the creative team, including Sonequa Martin-Green, Doug Jones, David Ajala, Wilson Cruz, Mary Wiseman, and Blu del Barrio, about what’s coming for Burnham, Book, Saru and more.
