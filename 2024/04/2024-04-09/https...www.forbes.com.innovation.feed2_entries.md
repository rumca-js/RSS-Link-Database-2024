Vladimir Danila developed the idea for Linearity's graphic design platform, formerly called Vectornator, when he was just 17. Frustrated with the intricacies of Adobe Illustrator and other design platforms, Danila created a mobile-first app--after enough people asked where they could buy it, too--and it blew up overnight, he says. With no marketing, the app made $40,000 in sales almost immediately. He knew the product was worth something, but Danila says his lack of experience, at 17, made the beginnings complicated. "If you founded a company later on [in your career], you've seen at least how another organization looks from the inside," he says. "And if you're completely blank, then it's a lot of figuring out and asking people for advice."

Qualifying for the PDC World Championships at the age of 16 was itself an accomplishment, but for British darts phenom Luke Littler, it was only the beginning. During an improbable two-week run through the tournament, "Luke the Nuke" became a sensation across Europe, appearing on TV talk shows and seeing his Instagram following grow from 4,000 to more than 1.2 million fans. His championship match was the most viewed non-football sporting event in Sky Sports history with 3.7 million viewers. Endorsements with Škoda, boohooMAN, Target Darts and Prestige Building Supplies soon followed, and Littler believes he's at the forefront of an explosion in darts popularity. "The world's gone mad [for darts]," he says. "It's one of 'em sports where you're standing there throwing some tungsten into a board and you're winning yourself some money and you creating yourself some legacy."

Fernride, launched in 2019 in Germany, aims to tackle the driver shortage and environmental impact of transportation by introducing autonomous and electric trucking. Their innovative approach allows drivers to remotely control trucks from an office, effectively operating vehicles across great distances, such as from Munich to the U.K. This method separates the driver's location from the truck's, enhancing logistic and production efficiency. Fernride has raised $59 million to date and coins Volkswagen and DB Schenker as clients. Founded by Hendrik Kramer, who pivoted from selling dressage horses online to dropping out of his Master's at the Technical University of Munich, Fernride is pioneering the use of human teleoperators to oversee a fleet of up to ten trucks in geo-fenced locations and private yards, aiming for higher productivity and sustainability.
