Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at what appears to be a growing trend of speculation about the total solar eclipse that just happened yesterday. This day was a rare experience for many to witness a phenomenon that rarely occurs and for a vocal few it was a call to tell people the world was coming to it's completion. This clearly never turned out to be true so let's sit back, relax and have a good laugh. Thanks for watching!
