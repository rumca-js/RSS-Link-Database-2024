<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever used Microsoft&rsquo;s own Clipchamp video editor, Google would like you to know that you now have another alternative: Google Vids, which will leverage Google&rsquo;s powers of AI with your own documents to create short videos.</p>



<p>Google thinks highly enough of Vids that it will elevate it into the pantheon of other Google Workspace apps, including Docs, Slides, and Sheets, the company said.</p>



<p>For whatever reason, Google isn&rsquo;t directly challenging <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/708192/how-to-use-clipchamp-microsofts-video-editor.html">Clipchamp, Microsoft&rsquo;s rather delightful video editor</a>, or Canva, another video and graphic content-creation tool that has emerged as a popular alternative and with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1665426/cant-wait-for-microsofts-ai-powerpoint-switch-to-canva-ins

<p>Razer has launched the Razer Blade 18 laptop with what the company says are two firsts: an optional 18-inch, 200Hz 4K panel and Thunderbolt 5 capabilities.</p>



<p>Pricing on the updated, New Razer Blade 18 is apparently somewhat variable: it&rsquo;s listed as starting at $2,899.99, but Razer is apparently selling it for $2,699.99. However, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-18/select-model&amp;xcust=2-1-2291525-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Razer&rsquo;s buying page</a> says that the Razer Blade 18 pricing begins at $3,099.99.</p>



<p>Razer is positioning the Blade 18 as a creator-class laptop, pre-installing Nvidia&rsquo;s content-aligned Nvidia Studio drivers rather than its Game Ready drivers. But make no bones about it: This is a<a href="https://w

<p>Acer makes some of the best-selling gaming laptops on the market, out of a combination of low starting prices and ubiquitous availability. Its Nitro series, for example, is almost constantly the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2215435/2215435.html">best-selling gaming model on Amazon</a>. Today, the company is updating two Nitro laptops with the latest CPUs and GPUs, and introducing a new, smaller Predator Helios Neo. </p>



<p>All three new models are fairly standard for Acer designs, boasting new &ldquo;AI&rdquo; tech&hellip;that doesn&rsquo;t seem to actually add much that you haven&rsquo;t seen elsewhere like filtering out microphone background noise.

<p>Hey, Samsung owners, I know you&rsquo;re confused AF about which GAN charger to buy for your shiny new Galaxy S24 Ultra or Galaxy S23 Ultra flagship phone. Luckily, I&rsquo;ve also been in pursuit of the same goal of fast charging my Galaxy, and here&rsquo;s what I learned.</p>



<p><strong>I miss included chargers</strong></p>



<p>Remember when you paid for a phone and received the best charger in the box? Those days are unfortunately long gone to &ldquo;save the environment,&rdquo; but that also means that most consumers who don&rsquo;t have a modern charger are left alone wandering through <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1915376/best-laptop-usb-c-pd-chargers.html">a forest of hundreds of confusing charger choices</a>.</p>

<p>Windows is generally flexible about tweaks to its system&mdash;and advanced users have long taken advantage of registry tweaks to make the OS behave. But recently, Microsoft has quietly barred access to one setting in Windows 10 and Windows 11, making a switch of your default browser only possible through the Windows settings app.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking to pick up a new laptop for office work or day-to-day tasks, you&rsquo;ve landed on the right spot, as we&rsquo;ve unearthed a phenomenal deal on a feature-packed machine. The Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 is an affordable 2-in-1 with a vibrant AMOLED touchscreen and, luckily for you, it&rsquo;s on sale for <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book2-pro-360-2-in-1-15-6-amoled-touch-screen-laptop-intel-12th-gen-evo-core-i7-16gb-ddr5-memory-1tb-ssd-silver%2F6501593.p%3FskuId%3D6501593&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=2-1-2290645-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">$849.99 at Best Buy</a>.

<p>Hanging on to older hardware comes with risk, and not just that it&rsquo;ll eventually wear out. Security holes can be found years after launch, leaving devices at risk if the manufacturer no longer supports them. And, unfortunately, some owners of older D-Link network-attached storage (NAS) units are now in this exact position&mdash;two newly uncovered vulnerabilities allow attackers to remotely take over affected NAS models, then download and install malware on them.</p>

<p>When putting together a PC system, many components are obviously more important than the housing: processors, graphics cards, and memory modules usually receive the most attention. However, the case is more than just an aesthetic shell. It has a decisive influence on the cooling performance, the organization of the components, and the expandability of the system. </p>



<p>Smaller cases may seem attractive at first glance because they take up less space and are often cheaper. However, depending on the configuration, the challenge comes shortly after purchase when the expansion options for RAM, SSDs, and PCIe expansion cards are very limited. </p>

<p>Handhelds fall into two categories, those from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that rely on their own software like the Steam Deck, and other third-party handhelds like the ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go that use Windows as their operating system.</p>



<p>While the former aren&rsquo;t free of issues, there has been tons more criticism recently about the latter category as gamers grapple with a handful of different problems they encounter. The main cause? Windows just isn&rsquo;t optimized for these devices.</p>
