The agreement will establish research partnerships between the University of Washington in Seattle and the University of Tsukuba in Japan, as well as between Carnegie Mellon University and Keio University. NVIDIA and Amazon are each putting $25 million behind the new collaboration. Other backers include Arm, Microsoft, and nine Japanese companies. The College of Engineering at the UW will lead an interdisciplinary team that will focus on AI-related research, entrepreneurship, workforce development, and social implementation.

But unlike e-commerce or cloud computing, the tech giant hasn&#8217;t figured out how to disrupt this industry. That&#8217;s our takeaway after trying three different approaches to shopping this week inside an Amazon Fresh grocery store in Seattle. We went through the store three times, with the same 10-item shopping list, to test the &#8220;Just Walk Out&#8221; cashierless technology, the Amazon Dash Cart, and the old-fashioned checkout line. The goal was to determine which method was fastest and most seamless.

The Seattle-based company recently raised $650,000 to fund the effort from investors including Urban Innovation Group, Trust Ventures and Cubit Capital. Total funding to date is $7.85 million. To broaden its services, PairTree is bringing professionals onto the platform who can facilitate the adoption process. That includes adoption lawyers and agencies, as well as state-licensed workers who conduct required home studies to screen and approve families looking to adopt.

Not that we need much of a reminder: The challenges of climate change, ranging from floods to wildfires, and the problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic amply show the limits of humanity&#8217;s control over nature. But chasing totality is a more benign example showing just how hard it is to predict which paths Mother Nature will take, and how technology may or may not catch up.
