In today's Daily Fix:
Ubisoft's Star Wars Outlaws finally has a release date to go along with a slick new story trailer. The game will be out August 30th, right after Black Myth Wukong on August 20th, and STALKER 2 on September 5th. Star Wars Outlaws takes place during the Rebellion Era, sandwiched between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, and judging by the trailer, expect a cameo or two from some familiar Original Trilogy faces. In other news, Call of Duty's latest weapon could cost more than the game itself. The B.E.A.S.T. Glove is a melee weapon designed after Kong's new power glove from the Godzilla x Kong movie. Players will need to unlock the 'Titan Collection' set, which will cost 9600 total COD Points, and you'll get the glove as a reward. That much in COD points equals about $80 USD. Yikes. And speaking of shooters, Battlefield 2042's Season 7 will be its last. The game will still be supported via maintenance updates, in-game challenges, events, and more, but i

Gabe Amatangelo, Game Director of the acclaimed Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty expansion, shares his unique perspective on leading a team during the turbulent period that accompanies a studio-wide transformation.

As CD PROJEKT RED reconfigured its development policies and production framework, Gabe was tasked with juggling simultaneous tasks: reconfiguring teams to a new, Agile methodology while supporting Cyberpunk 2077, developing the expansion, and most critically, overhauling virtually all of the base game’s systems and releasing Update 2.0 ahead of Phantom Liberty.

Gabe highlights the most important focus areas and successes that allowed CD PROJEKT RED to literally change the game and inject both Cyberpunk 2077 and the studio with fresh energy and momentum.

Key takeaways include common pain points that can come up during such a comprehensive overhaul and how to successfully tackle them; how to create buy-in from employees; how studios and companies can leverage past challenge

## Children of the Sun Review

Children of the Sun reviewed by Luke Reilly on PC.

"Strip essentially everything out of the Sniper Elite series except the bullets – then make the bullets magic and capable of steering, stopping, and speeding up – and you’re maybe four-fifths of the way to understanding what Children of the Sun is. Either way, puzzle-shooter is probably too broad a term to adequately describe it, which makes it a rare commodity. That is, it’s weird, and it’s different, and it’s not really like anything I’ve played before. However, while this slickly-packaged and shrewd supernatural sniping game is packed with satisfying spatial problems to solve (and shoot), once you’ve had success on a map there’s not a great deal to glean from trying it again."

Infection Free Zone is a post-apocalyptic strategy game that can be described as a city rebuilder, directly tied to the necessity of building upon the remaining ruins, from what's left. Humanity was completely unprepared for this sudden and brutal attack, and the remaining survivors lack all resources. Adapting to the new reality will force commanders to make firm and precise decisions, such as constructing shelters and factories in abandoned buildings, building farms, or establishing defenses with walls, gates, and towers. Gathering resources from what's left will significantly increase the chances of survival, but it must be remembered that the infected are not the only threat.

The location of the Infection Free Zone depends entirely on players. You will
