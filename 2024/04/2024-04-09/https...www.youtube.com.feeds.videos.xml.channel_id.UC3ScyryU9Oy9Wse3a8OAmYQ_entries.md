While making this 2016 documentary in Benghazi, reporter Feras Kilani gained rare access to Libyan forces fighting for control of the city against ISIS and other extremist groups. By that point, the battle had been going on for over 18 months, with more than 100,000 residents displaced by the fighting, and Libya was ISIS’ biggest base outside Syria and Iraq. In “Benghazi in Crisis,” Kilani followed Libyan fighters battling for a central point in the city, filmed the stories of displaced civilians and offered a rare and grim look inside a city in turmoil.
