The best place to be the sort of cop who thinks it&#8217;s a good idea to associate yourself with the Punisher remains the Fifth Circuit. Cops in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana are blessed with the most forgiving appellate court in the land &#8212; one even capable of irritating the same Supreme Court that has spent [&#8230;]

One very important thing to understand in the conversation about online speech is that there are many different kinds of online communities, big and small, and they all have their own needs when it comes to rules and governance. This fact is a key element of a new book, Governable Spaces: Democratic Design for Online [&#8230;]

Being treated like barely sentient meat deserving of any abuse perpetrated by guards or other inmates just isn&#8217;t enough oppression, apparently. This country talks a big game about rehabilitation and &#8220;paying your debt to society,&#8221; but when it comes to the day-to-day business of incarcerating people at a [&#8230;]

Over the last few years, Elon Musk has repeatedly said that his definition of free speech means “that which matches the law.” He says this whenever anyone calls out that he’s not actually the free speech absolutist he claims to be. He regularly and expeditiously caves in to censorship demands, without any protest, from authoritarian [&#8230;]

In all of the posts we have done on the topic of video game preservation, I have often made the point that it&#8217;s probably long past time that there be some sort of political action to address the real or potential disappearance of cultural output that is occurring.
