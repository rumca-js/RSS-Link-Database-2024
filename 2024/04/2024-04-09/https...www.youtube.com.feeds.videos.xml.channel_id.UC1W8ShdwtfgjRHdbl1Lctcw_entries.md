I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of California 1940s, we can see a panoramic street scenes near downtown Los Angeles, West 2nd Street and 123 South Figueroa Street to to Clift Hotel and more, we also have scenes around Balboa Newport

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
