<p>The face-off of dreams between England’s No 10s failed to materialise but champions’ attacker made decisive impact</p><p>This was a strange, giddy, tipsy kind of game, played out beneath the humid conservatory roof of the Santiago Bernabéu. Brilliant things kept happening, in between periods of not much happening at all. There were long spells of grinding gears. For most of the night the meeting of England’s No&nbsp;10s, the Foden-Bellingham face-off of your dreams, refused stubbornly to materialise.</p><p>And yet as the night wore on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/09/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report">the quality of the six goals</a> was increasingly reminiscent of a Kendall Roy birthday party music policy, all bangers all the time.

<p>The extreme, terrifying practices laid bare in this four-part documentary about an abusive sect lets victims tell their staggering tales – even if it does nothing new for the genre</p><p>It’s coming to something when the hellfire-preaching, daughter-beating, cancer-faking, longtime con artist and self-styled prophetess turns out to have been the restraining force in a relationship. But such, in essence, is the story of the four-part documentary Ministry of Evil: The Twisted Cult of Tony Alamo. His wife Susan – their meet-cute was in a bar in the 60s, when they both tried to scam each other – was a talented preacher who used her skills first to cheat churches (she would testify to her success converting heathens all over the US and Mexico, when, as her daughter Christhiaon says in the film, they barely left town, and live off the subsequent donation money until the family coffers needed filling again).</p><p>Her faith, however perverted its expression, seems to have been in some sen

<p>Arsenal had waited seven years to prove they could meet Bayern Munich as equals and, after a riveting night’s work that leaves this quarter-final tantalisingly poised, they made their point. This second-half salvage job was all the more impressive given they had squandered an early lead and, for a time, summoned visions of the 5-1 routs inflicted in their last three meetings.</p><p>Serge Gnabry and a Harry Kane penalty had overturned Bukayo Saka’s strike but Mikel Arteta’s players showed guts to avoid any repeat against previously off-form opponents who had turned up resoundingly. They were rewarded when the substitute Leandro Trossard, with a marvellous piece of execution, equalised 14 minutes from time. For the next week at least, it answered those pondering which iteration of Bayern would arrive for this tie.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/09/arsenal-bayern-munich-champons-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

In the white corner, the most successful club in the history of European competition. In the light-blue corner, the leading club in the world at the moment. This is their seventh meeting in five years, every one in the Champions League knock-out stages.</p><p>Real Madrid may have 14 European Cups, but last time they ran into Manchester City, in a CL semi-final last May, they lost 4-0. And City are scoring freely again now, with four apiece in their last two games after a stodgy spell. But Pep Guardiola has been doing his best to play down the chances of a repeat. “Beating Real Madrid twice in a row is impossible,” he said yesterday, with his usual understatement. “They have learned and will want revenge. They have pride.”</p>

<p>A musical seeker since childhood, the 73-year-old’s journeys have taken him  from lessons with Cecil Taylor to a formative tour of Africa and now work with the Outkast star. He explains why he’s still chasing the next chapter</p><p>The greatest music by spiritual jazz maestro and acclaimed saxophonist Idris Ackamoor suggests a swirling symbiosis between the living and the dead. Take his 2020 song When Will I See You Again?, in which his unfeigned croak of the words “we’ll all be fine” suggests that the “freak storms” of sudden loss will ultimately be replaced by rainbows. Or there’s the more chaotic and wordless Sheba’s Dance Part 2 from 1973.

It makes sense that the first instrument the 73-year-old musician ever learned to play was something that carried a link to his ancestors.</p><p>“My grandma Mary used to do the laun

<p>We look at a club playing 195 miles from home, the rebirth of two former Premier League players and a title race for the ages</p><p>There are less than two weeks to go in National League South’s regular season, with many players having one eye on their summer holidays. Truro City, however, are in the midst nine games in 17 days, thanks to the weather. This week they have matches on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. Their home games are taking place 195 miles from Truro at Gloucester City’s ground because Truro’s shared pitch at Plymouth Parkway (a mere 54 miles from Truro) cannot accommodate them after heavy recent rainfall. This prompted an earlier move to Taunton’s Wordsworth Drive but constant deluges caused problems there, too, and their rivals still have six games to play themselves. It also rains up north, leaving the North West Counties Premier Division side Colne with 10 games in 19 days. Three of their home games will be hosted by other clubs, but the good news is

<p>Although fans thought the shared success would never end, the DFB can use the new Nike deal money to benefit the grassroots</p><p>The partnership between Adidas and German football has been a commercial and sporting success for both sides for decades. It is a shared history of advancement. In 1954, the country recognised itself in the national team, and in Adidas too. Back then, Adolf “Adi” Dassler was the equipment manager; his screw-in studs were innovative and gave Fritz Walter, Max Morlock and Helmut Rahn a foothold in the rain of Berne.</p><p>Later, Dassler built up a world-class company. Today, clubs such as Arsenal and Ajax regularly take up residence in a small town that doesn’t even have a railway station. The national team will also be preparing for the European Championship in Herzogenaurach. Dassler is the German version of rags to riches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2024/apr/09/germany-adidas-nike-dfb-philipp-lahm">Continue reading...</a>

And will George Grundy stop being grumpy about TikTok?</p><p>The agony of Alistair Lloyd, veterinary surgeon and secret admirer of Denise, veterinary nurse, is over. Sort of. After months of painful attraction, after a nearly-kiss at Christmas, after hours of workplace longing and frustrated desire over the scalpels, swabs and sutures, it’s out there. He has told her he loves her. She has reciprocated. They have kissed (no sound effects, thankfully – a merciful edit). They have kissed again, and again – passionate bouts of snogging in the medical supplies cupboard, almost discovered by Denise’s son and colleague Paul, the practice’s other vet nurse. The course of this true love is not going to run smooth. As it is, Alistair has already threatened twice to leave the practice – once when he thought his adoration was unrequited, and once when he mistakenly unde

On this show, it is empty, after the sudden death of Mellor at the age of 71 in 2022. Her absence would be poignant anyway, but it’s even more so as Faye is Mellor’s daughter.

<p>A brisk and engaging biography of Baruch Spinoza, the man who inspired many secular Jewish thinkers, is least convincing when it offers him as an example of ‘cancel culture’</p><p>In December 2021, the philosopher Yitzhak Melamed posted on social media a letter that he had received from the rabbi of the Portuguese synagogue in Amsterdam. Melamed had written requesting permission to film there for a documentary on the philosopher Baruch Spinoza, who had been emphatically expelled by the 17th-century Jewish community. The rabbi sternly explained that the elders of that community had “excommunicated Spinoza and his writings with the severest possible ban, a ban that remains in force for all time and cannot be rescinded”. Furthermore, not only was the ban – known as a <em>cherem</em><em> </em>– still apparently in full force, but it was contagious: because Melamed has “devoted his life to the study of Spinoza’s banned works”, he too was now declared “persona non grata in the Portuguese

<p>Railway nostalgia, the world’s oldest football, fenland skies and a little-known bard are among the highlights of Crewe, Stirling, Boston and Barnstaple</p><p>These oft-bypassed towns have all been, at some period in history, influential if not necessarily powerful; wealth-creating though hardly opulent; and vital to the nation’s wealth and security while never fully rewarded for it. Communications and trade once gave some urban centres the edge over others. Churches and marketplaces were social magnets. Today a brand-name art gallery, celebrity residents, or media chatter are most likely to generate appeal, however specious. What if estate agents sold houses using poetry, memories, polyglotism, ruins and rust?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/09/where-tourists-seldom-tread-part-9-crewe-boston-barnstaple-stirling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How can you change your life for the better today? Learn not just to appreciate happiness – but to anticipate it</p><p>Be honest: there are times when you have felt schadenfreude, or “delight in another’s misfortunes”. But what about v<em>orfreude</em><em>? </em>I recently came across this lovely word, which my German-speaking friend translated as “the anticipation of joy”. It struck me as such a hopeful concept – surely we could all do with less schadenfreude and more <em>vorfreude</em>. So what exactly is anticipatory joy, how do we cultivate it and will it make us happier?</p><p>“The idea is to find joy in the lead-up to an event,” says <a href="https://drsoph.com/">Sophie Mort</a>, a clinical psychologist and mental health expert at the meditation and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">mindfulness app Headspace</a>. “For example, we often feel joy and excitement when planning a trip, thinking about going on a date or anticipating a special meal.” It’s easy to look forward to
