<p>No, you haven't clicked on an old blog post from 2003, I really have painted a couple of 21 year old sculpts. It is a shame I had to pay 2024 prices and not 2003 prices, I guess the Liche Priest and Mounted Liche Priest deserve 2024 paint jobs then. In today's post I share my experience and tips with working with metal models. </p>
