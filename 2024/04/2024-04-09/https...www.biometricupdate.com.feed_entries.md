		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a> has announced the addition of data privacy protection features, apparently in response to allegations that minors’ biometrics had been collected <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/portugal-orders-worldcoin-to-stop-collecting-iris-biometrics-for-90-days">in Portugal</a>. The company continues to face privacy challenges, meanwhile.

		Several municipalities in the Netherlands want to use biometric identity verification to prevent fraud, but it's unclear whether this conflicts with privacy legislation, according to <a href="https://nos.nl/">Nos</a>.

For identity verification, a person submits a face scan which is then compared to the photo on their passport or license to confirm their identity. The identity document is also checked for authenticity.

The verification process is already being used for checking in at airports, but cities like Almere and Utrechtse Heuvelrug, among others, are considering implementing the system for applying for a passport or driving license in light of increasing rates of fraud. The use of face image morphing on identity documents is currently a <a href="https://

		Federal lawmakers in the U.S. have proposed bipartisan legislation that, for the first time, “sets clear, national data privacy rights and protections for Americans,” according to <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/us-lawmakers-unveil-plan-americans-140117596.html">CNN</a>. The American Privacy Rights Act would enshrine digital privacy as a basic, enforceable right and aim to give citizens’ more control over their biometric data and overall digital identity.

Much like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the law would bring the U.S.’s current approach to data privacy – what a government release calls “the existing patchwork of state comprehensive <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/privacy-group-says-data-protections-by-us-s

		Age assurance processes like facial age estimation do not require the isolation and processing of personal identifiers, unlike biometric identification. This means that facial age estimation does not necessarily involve “<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/takeaways-from-the-icos-draft-guidance-on-biometric-data">special category data</a>” under GDPR, panelists argued during a presentation at the Global Age Assurance Standards Summit.

The Summit is being held in Manchester, England, and brings together regulators, policy-makers, age verification and estimation providers, businesses offering age-restricted goods and services, and advocates for privacy, child protection and several other related interests.

		There’ve been mixed reactions in Nigeria after the federal government unveiled plans to introduce a new multi-purpose national digital ID card, with some describing it as a duplicative effort and a waste of resources.

In a statement issued Friday April 5, the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), said the new ID card, whose launch is supported by the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Nigeria Inter-bank Settlement System, will have payments and social service delivery functions, and will facilitate access to other services including travel, health insurance information, microloans, agriculture, food stamps, transport, and energy subsidies, just to mention a few.

The agency added that among other features, the credential, to be powered by a national ID card schem

		The volume of lawsuits alleging biometric data privacy violations under Illinois law in federal court have declined, with the first quarter of 2024 marking the fewest since 2019.

There were 13 BIPA lawsuits filed in federal court in the past quarter, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/analysis-federal-bipa-complaints-in-q1-drop-to-four-year-low-1">Bloomberg Law</a> reports, compared to more than two dozen in the first quarter of 2023.

Bloomberg data indicates there were nearly 90 BIPA lawsuits filed in 2020, about 75 in 2021, nearly the same number in 2022, and around 80 last year. In the year before the 2008 statute began attracting major attention from attorneys, there were less than 40 lawsuits filed in federal court under the most litigious biometrics r

		Cigarette smokers in the Netherlands will now have the option to buy tobacco products with age verification technology.

Around a hundred tobacco vending machines equipped with AI-powered face scanners have been installed across the country. Built by transaction and check-out system company <a href="http://www.hand-ebs.com/">H@nd</a>, the NIX18 machines were designed in cooperation with the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) and privacy organizations.

Theo Snijders, CEO of H@nd, says that the process of building them took two years. The devices estimate customers' faces, giving a green light to salesclerk if they are over 25 years of age. Buyers under 25 can verify their identity by scanning their ID, passport or driver's license w
