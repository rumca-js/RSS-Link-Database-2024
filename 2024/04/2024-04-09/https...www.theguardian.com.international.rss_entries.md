<p>Real Madrid produced another of those implausible European comebacks but this time so did Manchester City. So then Madrid went and did it again. The last two European champions gave us another wild night to remember. Carlo Ancelotti had called for courage and personality and there was plenty of that, plenty of talent too, and six goals at the Santiago Bernabéu to set up what should be a superb second leg at the Etihad next week. If it is half as good as this it will be fun: it will also be on edge to the very end.</p><p>One up after 95 seconds through Bernardo Silva, 2-1 down to two goals in 114 seconds from Eduardo Camavinga and Rodrygo, Manchester City came back to lead with two wonderful strikes in four second-half minutes, Phil Foden and Josep Gvardiol belting the ball into the net to leave Pep Guardiola dancing on the touchline. And then just when it seemed a comeback of their own was complete, Madrid did it again, Fede Valverde rounding off a noisy, tense and emotional night

<p>Sam Taylor-Johnson’s best film to date is more interested in romance and creativity than demons or blame</p><p>The last time Sam Taylor-Johnson directed a movie about drugs it was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/30/a-million-little-pieces-review">A Million Little Pieces</a> in 2019, based on James Frey’s notoriously inauthentic memoir of addiction – and the last time she made a film about a music legend it was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/17/nowhere-boy-review">Nowhere Boy</a> in 2009, about John Lennon.</p><p>Now she brings the two together in what’s easily her best work so far: an urgent, warm, heartfelt dramatisation, scripted by Matt Greenhalgh, of the life of Amy Winehouse, the brilliant London soul singer who died of alcohol poisoning at 27 in 2011.

<p>The poet’s uncompromising second collection, about her husband’s addiction to crystal meth, is fascinating and troubling</p><p>There is always the temptation to tell it like it wasn’t when a subject is painful. Words can tinker therapeutically, be balm, re-dress – and redress. What impresses most about Ellen Cranitch’s courageous second collection, <em>Crystal</em>, on the subject of her husband’s addiction to crystal meth and its devastations, is her steady rigour in not compromising, not ranting or taking flight, as in her poem Trust, which is claustrophobically reduced to an exchange of glances and a lack of boundaries. There is, throughout, a – crystal – clarity.</p><p>Her unexpected starting point is three lyrical poems about Pierre Bonnard’s paintings of his model Renée, who killed herself when he married Marthe, and who is painted in an increasingly abstracted way in the works she is considering. “It is a terrible feeling, to be becoming less distinct,” she observes.

It’s also very simple to bash together at home, as is this embellished version with prawns and peanuts.

Rules which had previously never led any club to receive a sporting sanction have seen two docked points this season.

<p>Mount Etna has blown volcanic vortex rings into the Sicilian skyline after the recent formation of a near-perfectly circled mouth. Although the rare natural phenomenon looks like smoke rings, they are actually made up of steam and gases.
