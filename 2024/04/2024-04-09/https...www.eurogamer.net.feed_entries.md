World of Warcraft Classic, the nostalgia-tweaking old-school version of Blizzard's long-running MMORPG, is set to move into the next era of history next month, with World of Warcraft Cataclysm Classic now confirmed to be launching on 20th May.
</p><p>
"You've toppled the undead armies of the Lich King and ended Arthas' reign," Blizzard enthuses in its announcement post. "Now, Deathwing, The Worldbreaker, bursts from the heart of the Maelstrom, unleashing his rage. All will burn beneath the shadow of his wings."
</p><p>
Cataclysm Classic, which arrives around a year and a half after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king-classic-officially-coming-this-september">launch of Wrath of the Lich King Classic</a>, will be preceded by a pre-launch patch on 30th April.

Mortal Kombat 1's upcoming playable DLC character, Ermac, has been given an airing in developer NetherRealm's latest gameplay trailer, ahead of his arrival later this month.
</p><p>
Ermac is a bit of a series regular, having made his debut in 1995's Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. He's not new to Mortal Kombat 1 either, having already appeared in its Story Mode, but his upcoming DLC release marks the first time he's been playable in-game.
</p><p>
"Ermac," Warner Bros. helpfully explains in the press release accompanying today's trailer, "is a collection of souls bound together by Quan Chi's dark magic that are intended to function as a group mind. But that spell is temporarily undone when Ermac is defeated by Mileena and the mind of King Jerrod, deceased ruler of Outworld and one of the souls in Ermac&rsquo;s collection, takes con

As the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-the-final-shape-delay-announced-by-bungie">delayed</a> June launch of Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion inches ever-closer, developer Bungie has aired a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPQG1jw4fPg">fresh gameplay showcase</a>, this time offering a closer look at the new Prismatic subclass, new Exotic class items, and the new Dread enemy faction.
</p><p>
The Final Shape - which Bungie is describing as a the "culmination of a 10-year journey [but] not the end of Destiny 2 and...definitely not the end of destiny" - takes players into the Traveller for a confrontation with major antagonist The Witness.
</p><p>
As part of this journey, players can take advantage of The Final Shape's new Prismatic subclass, enabling them to combine certain class abilities f

The company's various Area Managers - exempt from the change - held the calls yesterday, with local employees instructed to join. Multiple staff in the calls have told Eurogamer the meetings were brief, with the Area Managers reading from a script, and no oppurtunity given to ask questions.

Palworld developer Pocketpair has warned players on Xbox not to load up their multiplayer saves following reports that doing so will result in all current progress being lost.
</p><p>
Palworld's latest patch - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-patch-adds-first-raid-boss-bellanoir">adds a new raid</a> against a powerful evil entity known as Bellanoir - launched for Steam last week, and arrived on Xbox earlier today. Soon after its console debut, Pocketpair confirmed the update was preventing players from placing their eggs inside an incubator - but it's now clear the update has launched with considerably more dramatic issues.
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1777694970310455380">post on social media</a>, Pocketpair acknowledged an issue where "multiplayer player save data is not being load

Ubisoft has revealed a new Star Wars Outlaws story trailer - and with it, confirmation of the game's release date. 
</p><p>
Happily, the blockbuster Star Wars adventure will launch sooner than many had expected: on 30th August 2024. Stump up some more credits for the game's Gold or Ultimate Editions, or subscribe to Ubisoft+, and you'll get three days' early access.
</p><p>
Today's trailer shows a cantina-full of Star Wars aliens and settings. Fans will recognise groups such as Crimson Dawn and the Hutt Clan, Twi'leks, Mon Calamari and Quarren, and battles against TIE-Fighters and AT-STs.

After forty years of gaming, I know my preferred ones, and they're typically shadowy and unsettling worlds that ooze blood and bullets. How strange it is, then, to have gone this long without a game that not only blends several of these together, but does it in such a stylish and provocative way, too.</p><p>If the name Children of the Sun summons immediate thoughts of Joseph Seed and dodgy cults&hellip; well, congrats. You've guessed correctly, my friend. Whilst little is revealed explicitly - some of what we learn about Children of the Sun's story is via its animated shorts; some comes via subtle in-game clues - here's what I can tell you: you're The Girl, and The Girl is <em>apoplectic</em>.

Did you really think Helldivers 2 players had wiped out the Automatons for good? Nope.

Just days later and the Automatons have returned. I'm sure you're all very surprised to hear that.

Get it wrong and you'll end up with a shrivelled botanic tragedy glaring accusingly at you from the windowsill before it wilts its last wilt out of pure spite; do it right and you'll have a beautiful bit of nature in your home to enjoy and admire for years to come.</p><p>Botany Manor taps perfectly into this endlessly rewar

Now Noita Epilogue 2 Update is available, however old save games won't survive the update. Instead, players will need to use a Steam beta branch to finish any runs with the old version of the game.

Amazon's upcoming Fallout TV adaptation has had a surprise release date change. 
</p><p>
Originally, the series was set to make its debut on 12th April. This was then moved to 11th. Now, the date has been bumped forward yet another day, and will be available on the streaming service from 10th April, 6pm PT. That's 2am on the 11th for those of us here in the UK. 
</p><p>
In a short video featuring Walton Goggins - who plays The Ghoul in Fallout - the actor said this was a thank you to fans of the series. In addition, the Amazon Prime Fallout account released a 'sick note' of sorts, asking employers to excuse their staff from work that day for an "important personal matter" which had nothing to do with this timing change. No, sir.

Pok&eacute;mon Go teased a big new addition the game as the moment of totality hit during yesterday's solar eclipse.
