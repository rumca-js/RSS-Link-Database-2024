<p>The Pretendo Network, an open-source Nintendo Network alternative, no longer requires a hacked <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-26-the-wii-u-revisited-looking-back-on-a-forward-thinking-console.html">Wii U console</a>. With Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendos-online-servers-for-wii-u-and-3ds-shut-down-today-183513670.html">servers for the obsolete console shutting down</a> on Monday, the Pretendo Network shared a new workaround that provides (limited) access to its homebrew servers without jailbreaking your dusty old console.</p>

The Wii U’s SSL exploit (branded as “SSSL”), discovered by the Pretendo Network’s <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/shutterbug20002"><em>shutterbug</em></a>, lets you connect to the network with only a simple DNS change, which you can do on the stock firmware. “We’ve been holding on to this exploit f

<p>Arturia just released a new standalone synthesizer <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/hardware-synths/astrolab-61/overview">called the AstroLab</a>. This 61-key stage keyboard is basically the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-releases-new-free-version-of-analog-lab-synth-instrument-172045988.html"><ins>company’s Analog Lab software</ins></a> in hardware form, which makes it perfect for live performances. The synth boasts ten dedicated sound engines and access to 35 virtual instruments, including the vast majority of the emulations found with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-v-collection-x-is-its-biggest-upgrade-in-years-160015345.html"><ins>the iconic V Collection</ins></a>.

<p>Two months after I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-review-beta-testing-the-future-201430272.html">started using the Apple Vision Pro</a>, it hasn't transformed the way I live. It hasn't replaced my TV, and it doesn't make me want to give up my powerful desktop or slim laptops. It's just another tool in my gadget arsenal — one I can don to catch up on <em>X-Men '97</em> in bed, or to help me dive deep into research while I'm away from my office. The Vision Pro becomes normal so quickly, it's almost easy to forget how groundbreaking it actually is. Its screens are still absolutely stunning, and the combination of eye tracking and Apple's gesture controls makes for the most intuitive AR/VR interface I've seen yet.</p>
<p>While the Vision Pro still isn't something most people should consider buying, Apple has thrown out a few bones to early adopters. There are more games popping up on the App Store and Arcade every week, and there are also <a href="https://twitter.co

On Tuesday, the company unveiled a pair of new 14-inch entries alongside two refreshes of existing 16-inch models. The Intel-powered Predator Helios Neo 14 and Nitro 16 will join the AMD-fueled Nitro 14 and Nitro 16, launching globally later this spring.</p>
<p>As is often the case with pre-launch laptop announcements, Acer only reveals the devices’ minimum pricing rather than a full specs-to-cost breakdown (Acer says they aren’t yet finalized), making it impossible to gauge their overall value. You can expect that info closer to their respective launches in May and June.</p

<p>In a year packed with rad fishing sims, <a href="https://www.dredge.game/"><em>Dredge</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>was arguably the best. It came out in March 2023 and filled the wet, eldritch-horror-shaped hole in the year's gaming catalogue — and now, it's going to be a movie. Developer Black Salt Games and media company <a href="https://www.story-kitchen.com/projects">Story Kitchen</a> are partnering to turn <em>Dredge</em> into a live-action feature film. The project's logline is, &quot;Think <em>The Sixth Sense</em> on the water. A grounded atmospheric cosmic horror blend of HP Lovecraft and Ernest Hemingway.&quot; That's not <em>not </em>a description of <em>Dredge</em> as a video game, so it looks like we're off to a fine start.</p>
<p>As a film, <em>Dredge</em> will probably focus less on inventory management, boat upgrades and incessant seafloor dragging, and more on the game's Lovecraftian water monsters and moody, foggy atmosphere. Story Kitchen is the production company behin

<p>According to Google, Axion performs 30 percent better than its fastest general purpose Arm-based tools in the cloud and 50 percent better than the most recent, comparable x86-based VMs. They also claim it's 60 percent more energy efficient than those same x86-based VMs. Google is already using Axion in services like BigTable and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-will-use-ai-and-satellite-imagery-to-monitor-methane-leaks-130051724.html">Google Earth Engine</a>, expanding to more in the future.</p>

<p>For most of us, creating documents, spreadsheets and slide decks is an inescapable part of work life in 2024. What's not is creating videos. That’s something Google would like to change. On Tuesday, the company announced Google Vids, a video creation app for work that the company says can make everyone a “great storyteller” using the power of AI.</p>
<p>Vids uses <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-rebrands-its-bard-ai-chatbot-as-gemini-which-now-has-its-own-android-app-151303210.html">Gemini</a>, Google’s latest AI model, to quickly create videos for the workplace. Type in a prompt, feed in some documents, pictures, and videos, and sit back and relax as Vids generates an entire storyboard, script, music and voiceover. "As a storytelling medium, video has become ubiquitous for its immediacy and ability to ‘cut through the noise,’ but it can be daunting to know where to start," said Aparna Pappu, a Google vice president, in a <a class="no-affiliate-lin

<p>Back in 2019, the family of Apple engineer Wei Lun Huang (aka Walter Huang) sued Tesla a year after he was killed when his Model X crashed while Autopilot was engaged. The automaker has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-settles-lawsuit-over-fatal-model-x-crash-that-killed-an-apple-engineer-054710845.html">settled the lawsuit</a> — on the very day jury selection was supposed to take place. Tesla’s lawyers asked the court to seal the settlement agreement so the payout amount wouldn’t be made public.</p>
<p>Tesla confirmed shortly after the accident that Autopilot was on at the time of the crash, but it also insisted Huang had time to react and had an unobstructed view of the divider. In a statement to the press, the company insisted the driver was at fault, and the only way for the accident to have occurred was if Huang “was not paying attention to the road.”</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found Huang running a mobile game but couldn’t conf

<p>X has <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/04/09/x-launches-passkey-support-for-ios-app-users-worldwide">expanded</a> its support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/passkeys-passwords-authentication-security-133024414.html?_fsig=ILFszvVbrb7HAMqr5wgDvg--%7EA">passkey</a> logins and has made the option available to users around the world, as long as they're accessing the app on an iPhone. The social media company formerly known as Twitter originally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/x-now-supports-passkeys-on-ios-in-the-us-211233864.html">launched passkey support</a> for iOS users in the US back in January. Now, the X Safety account has confirmed its global rollout, giving more people the choice to use the login alternative.</p>
<p>Passkeys are considered more secure than passwords, because they're not vulnerable to phishing or social engineering schemes and are resistant to login theft. When users activate and set up a passkey login, they're creating a key pair that will

<p>True wireless earbuds are flimsy, easily lost and prone to battery failure. Given their size and cost, companies would rather you throw them out when they succumb to the inevitable. Fairphone, however, has built a pair of buds with easily replaceable batteries, as well as a swappable cell in the charging case. And, look, if the engineers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-06-ethical-smartphone-conscious-consumption.html">working at this tiny Dutch company</a> can work this out, then the army of designers in Apple and Samsung’s steel-and-glass cathedrals have no excuse.</p>
<p>Fairbuds are a pair of true wireless earbuds that look like Samsung’s Galaxy Buds, with the outermost surface on both sides being a controller. Fairphone promises six hours of battery life on a charge with an extra 20 hours nestled inside the case. The buds are packing the usual feature list, including ANC, multipoint connectivity as well as an IP54 rating for sweat and water resistance. As usual, the c
