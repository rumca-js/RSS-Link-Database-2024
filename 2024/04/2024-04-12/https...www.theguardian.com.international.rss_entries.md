<p>After a week of debate, Congress on Friday reauthorized section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</p><p>Congress spent the past week in a fractious debate over a major government surveillance program that gives US authorities the ability to monitor vast swaths of emails, text messages and phone calls without a warrant. In a vote on Friday, lawmakers ultimately decided to keep that warrantless surveillance intact and passed a two-year reauthorization of the law, known as section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or Fisa.</p><p>The law has long been contentious among both progressives and libertarian-leaning conservatives who view it as a violation of privacy rights and civil liberties. Donald Trump has likewise lambasted it out of personal grievance. Its defenders, which include intelligence agencies and Joe Biden’s administration, argue that it is an important tool in stopping terrorist attacks, cybercrime and the international drug trade.</p> <a href

<p><strong>Bernard B Jacobs Theatre, New York</strong></p><p>SE Hinton’s novel, which was adapted by Francis Ford Coppola for film, makes for a competent yet forgettable stage show</p><p>If Broadway must, for the same risk-averse pressures as Hollywood, keep rummaging through the library for more and more past touchstones to adapt, it could do worse than The Outsiders. SE Hinton’s seminal young adult novel has been a staple of middle and high school English classes for more than half a century for a reason. Though its once cutting-edge content, controversial for 1967 – violence, addiction, depression, realist descriptions of socio-economic struggle, endless cigarettes – no longer feel risqué in 2024, the novel bottled a certain timeless teenage angst. Hinton’s book, written when she was just 16 and published when she was a freshman in college, has long connected with young audiences also feeling disenfranchised, ostracized, doubted or just lost in a churn of emotion.</p><p>The Broadwa
