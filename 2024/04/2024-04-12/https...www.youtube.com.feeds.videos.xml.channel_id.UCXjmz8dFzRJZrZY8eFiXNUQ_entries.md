During the time of it's premiere, MadTV was set up to be the perfect replacement for a struggling Saturday Night Live.  With a fresh cast of talent, and the history of Mad Magazine behind it, MadTV started strong, but quickly lost favor among it's core audience when SNL began it's resurgence.

Or was Saturday Night Live just too big to go up against?
