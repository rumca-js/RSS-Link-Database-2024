In the early morning of March 26, 2024, a Singapore-registered cargo ship, "Dali," hit the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. The collision killed six people and paralyzed the entire Port of Baltimore, affecting traffic between the north and south on the east coast of the US. Relevant departments and major media in the US quickly announced that the accident wasnâ€™t a terrorist attack. However, many rumors and speculations abound online.
