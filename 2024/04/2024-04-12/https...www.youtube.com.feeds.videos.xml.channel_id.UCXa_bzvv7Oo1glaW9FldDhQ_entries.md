Last year's Dead Space remake was pivotal for the franchise, signaling a revival of one of the best horror IPs and an outstanding title in its own right. The next project for Motive Studio would surely be a Dead Space 2 remake, right?

When the announcement came of it working on Battlefield, alongside the previously announced Marvel's Iron Man, there was reasonable concern from fans. Does this mean the Dead Space 2 remake isn't happening? Motive iterated that it's a two-project studio and nothing more.

However, reports emerged that the studio was in mind for something Dead Space-related, though it's not quite what you think. As for the lack of information about a potential follow-up, even after the first game's remake received so much critical acclaim, there's a reason for that.

Join us as we unravel the whole (alleged) story behind the (purported) Dead Space 2 remake.

Grand Theft Auto 6 is one of the most hotly anticipated games of all time, if not the most. Its modern-day Vice City setting, dual protagonists, gorgeous visuals and sheer detail have already elevated the reveal trailer to almost 200 million viewers.

Yet, as popular as the franchise can be, it's impossible to please everyone. That could be due to lacking some features or doing things, be it driving or combat, slightly different from what fans expect. Maybe the scale won't be supermassive, as past reports have indicated.

Perhaps it won't offer a 60 FPS mode for current-gen consoles.
Whatever the case, as enjoyable as Grand Theft Auto 6 could be, some may still be disappointed. Let's delve deeper into why.
