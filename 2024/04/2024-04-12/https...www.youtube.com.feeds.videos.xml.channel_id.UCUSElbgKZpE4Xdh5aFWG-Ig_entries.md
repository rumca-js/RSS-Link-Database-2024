The Church of the Intercession on the Nerl was built in 1165 near the Bogolyubovo settlement. It is considered to be the greatest monument of Russian architecture. 

In 1992, the church was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the White-stone Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal.

The Church of the Intercession is based on a man-made hill at the confluence of the Nerl and Klyazma rivers.
 
Each spring the rivers flood the banks. During the most harsh overflows the water floods the Bogolyubovo meadow and reaches the walls of the Church. For some time, the temple finds itself trapped on an island.
