		Introducing age verification to protect children online remains a hot topic across the globe: Canada is debating the Online Harms Act, the European Union experimenting with an online age assurance project while India is potentially opening the path towards age verification with the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act.
<h2>Canada grapples with pornography</h2>
The perils of porn may be less dangerous than the surveillance that age verification could bring to Canada, argues Maggie MacDonald, an advisory board member with Ethical Capital Partners, which manages the world’s most famous porn site Pornhub through its parent company Aylo.

MacDonald says that the Online Harms Act, which made <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/canada-makes-another-move-towards-

		America’s single-sign on system for government benefits and services, Login.gov, is getting a face biometrics option for enhanced identity verification for a May pilot.

The U.S. General Service Administration announced the pilot, which is intended to bring Login.gov up to Identity Assurance Level 2, as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Digital Identity Guidelines (SP800-63-3). The pilot will begin next month in partnership with a handful of agencies, the GSA says.

Login.gov was briefly <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/gsas-login-gov-not-ready-for-authentication-volume-irs-needs">adopted by the IRS</a> last year for identity verification, but subsequently deprecated in favor of ID.me because it did not meet I

		The advent of AI-powered generators such as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/onlyfake">OnlyFake</a>, which creates realistic-looking photos of fake IDs for only US$15, has stirred up the ID verification and authentication industry. The availability of cheap and convincing fake documents brings real dangers – not just of fraud but also to national borders – and is prompting experts working in the field to come up with solutions.

“Looking at documents to see if they are real in a remote setting, I would say that's impossible and our tests show that as well,” says Wil Janssen, co-founder of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/inverid">Inverid</a>, the company behind identity verification solution ReadID. “It's very easy to get through man

		Biometrics, and fingerprints in particular, have long been one of the pillars of forensics work performed by police and crime scene investigators. Livescan technology has emerged as a tool enabling law enforcement to capture biometrics both more quickly and with higher quality than legacy approaches.

		Debates continue among British lawmakers on the legality of police deployment of live facial recognition.

After the UK Parliament’s Justice and Home Affairs Committee (JHAC) <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202401/live-facial-recognition-law-and-regulatory-framework-needed-uk-committee">questioned the legal basis</a> of UK police use of the technology and recommended the establishment of a new legislative framework, the government responded with the familiar argument – the use of live facial recognition is already covered by existing laws.

“There is a comprehensive legal framework governing police use of LFR,” the government wrote in its <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/44140/documents/219214/default/">reply</a> to JHAC’s letter publis

		In the UK, HM Treasury has published a consultation on improving AML regulations. The CEO of Credas spoke on improving AML on Today’s Conveyancer Podcast.
