Working alongside “very clever, seasoned journalists who were writing about New Labour and Chechnya”, she said she “felt stupid writing about calories and alcohol units and why it takes three hours between waking up and leaving the house in the morning. Then we started getting letters praising the column, I started boasting, ‘It’s by me, meeeee!’ and things snowballed from there.”</p><p>They certainly did.

<p>Netflix hit series based on Patricia Highsmith novel brings prospect of surge in visitors to Atrani area of Amalfi coast</p><p>When Andrew Scott’s eponymous character in the hit new Netflix series Ripley travels from Naples to the village of Atrani, the rickety bus has the road almost to itself; a solitary Vespa passes going the other way. When he tracks down Dickie Greenleaf at the beach, the rich American and his girlfriend are the only people sunbathing on the pristine sands.</p><p>Visitors to the Amalfi coast today will note the contrast. Unlike in 1961, the road between Positano and Salerno is now known as much for its traffic jams as for the views. Atrani may be less busy than its neighbour Amalfi, but in summer its beach is taken over by rows of umbrellas and sunbeds. A small area, perhaps a fifth of the space, is public <em>spiaggia libera</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/12/netflix-series-ripley-italian-village-atrani-amalfi-coast-tourism-visit

A novice US correspondent for this newspaper, I was hunched over a primitive laptop, ready to press send on the piece that I had already drafted, confidently explaining to UK readers why the jurors had convicted an American sporting legend of double murder and the likely impact of their decision.

<p><strong>Hampstead theatre, London</strong><br />Richard’s Nelson’s elegiac monologue feels like Paul Jesson is live-reading a novel and results in a sense of stagnation</p><p>Richard’s Nelson’s monologue, written for Paul Jesson to perform, is a meditation on life and death, the theatre and what it means to be an actor. Beginning at Waterloo train station, he takes us with him on a romantic train journey to the West Country to visit an old friend for the weekend, but also through his life’s memories.</p><p>Alone onstage, the Actor (Jesson) shares his past with us, as if we were his old friends. He talks of his career, illness, ageing, his partner Michael – a fellow thespian who recently passed away – and the experience of living with overwhelming grief. The play is packed with reflections and feels like a gentle stream of consciousness. But, though Nelson’s writing includes countless references to drama, Shakespeare and the stage, his play feels more like a live reading of a novel.

<p>Powerful Harlequins prop faces a stern test against Bordeaux in the Champions Cup and has his sights on England’s summer tour</p><p>In the salons of Bordeaux this week relatively little attention has been paid to Fin Baxter. Harlequins have starrier names in their match-day squad and anyway it is their attacking prowess that hogs the headlines. If the massive local props are considering their 22-year-old opponent, it will be as a quick <em>amuse-bouche</em> before they tuck into something more substantial.</p><p>They will not be the first to make that misjudgment. Never mind that Baxter looks even younger than his years and has the cherubic appearance of a choirboy awaiting evensong. He could be England’s next big thing, if you listen to his captain, Stephan Lewies: “He’s a future international prop in my opinion. He’s ridiculous for a 22-year-old and he’ll just get better with time. He’s a future leader of&nbsp;the club if he keeps his head down and keeps working. Which I&nbsp;thi

<p>Italians tend to serve fresher, more restrained and lower-abv whites with their food, not least so as not to overpower it</p><p>I don’t know how many of you buy wine specifically to drink with food, but the Italians do and we could learn a few lessons from them. If you taste wines such as soave and pinot grigio on their own, you might think they’re a bit bland and boring, but sip a glass with a plate of antipasti or spaghetti carbonara, say, and they spring into life. Italians by and large don’t want wines with overt fruit flavours, too much oak or overly high levels of alcohol, because they overwhelm their fundamentally simple food, which tends to respect both the raw ingredient and the season in which you’re serving it.</p><p>Interestingly, I often find that people who are new to wine enjoy pinot grigio for that very reason – it doesn’t have too much flavour. It’s easy to be sniffy about that, and there are some cynically made commercial examples to be sure, but it can also be an

When you dive deep into the West Yorkshire DJ, producer and singer’s discography, you might assume she was around during the genre’s mid-90s golden era. But being born in 1999 hasn’t stopped her from being nostalgic for an era before her own. “I love making the beats. I love making the drums. I’ve always loved the chaos of jungle,” she says. The 24-year-old’s recent rise has largely been down to the way in which her songs capture the energy and euphoria of the genre without being considered derivative or pastiches. It’s&nbsp;why drum’n’bass great Goldie refers to her as “one of our own”.</p><p>Si

<p>I flew down the corridor screaming at everyone: ‘Do you have my baby?’</p><p>In September 2014, I gave birth to my third daughter, Nadine, in Auckland, New Zealand. It had been a dramatic delivery. Three epidurals had left me with a stiff neck and an excruciating headache. So a few days after her birth, I was back for tests, bringing her along with me as she needed feeding.</p><p>It was the last place I wanted to be. Despite the exhaustion, I didn’t want to let Nadine out of my arms. But I was desperate for a shower. The hospital had given me an en suite bedroom, but I still paused before I stepped into the bathroom, watching Nadine sleeping in her cot. Should I wheel her in with me? I decided not to. She was safe and settled, and I’d only be a few feet away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/12/experience-my-newborn-baby-was-kidnapped-from-hospital">Continue reading...</a>

You or I would no more have done our weekly shop without a hat than we would have done it barefoot. Now the opposite is true. Hats, which used to be a badge of duty and propriety, have become the opposite – a bold sartorial choice that marks you out as&nbsp;a&nbsp;flamboyant dresser.</p><p>There are exceptions. Some hats are so normalised we barely register them. A beanie on a wintry walk, a baseball cap on a sunny beach. And there are still occasions – weddings, Ascot – where hats are part of the ritual. But beyond these narrow guardrails, hats have become an eccentricity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/apr/12/from-a-chic-pillbox-to-a-feathered-cap-the-personality-hat-is-back">Continue reading...</a>

Although she became Tory leader almost half a century ago and was sacked by her party in 1990, since when this country has changed hugely, Margaret Thatcher still obsesses the Tories. Rishi Sunak says he is a Thatcherite, and so do almost all those jostling to replace him: Kemi Badenoch, Penny Mordaunt, Priti Patel, James Cleverly, Grant Shapps and Suella Braverman.</p><p>Most other Conservative MPs remain Thatcherite in their basic assumptions: about the need to deregulate markets, regulate the lives of the poor, pursue aggressively nationalistic policies abroad and fight domestic culture wars.

They’ve chosen to make an eight-part miniseries out of the towering intellectual-slash-action figure of Benjamin Franklin – the son of a Boston candlemaker, who ran away to Philadelphia at 17 and rose to become one of the US’s founding fathers, via polymathic stints as a printer, publisher, inventor, writer and scientist. And they’ve based it on what was surely one of the least televisual accomplishments of his entire storied career.</p><p>Franklin (whose eponymous hero is played by Michael Douglas) is adapted from the historian Stacy Schiff’s 2005 book A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France and the Birth of America.
