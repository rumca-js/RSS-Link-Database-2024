Before this release, Rust\u2019s standard library did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files with the<code> bat</code> and <code>cmd</code> extensions on Windows using the <code>Command</code> API. An attacker who controlled arguments passed to a spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escape.
