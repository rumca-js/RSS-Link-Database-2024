The next project for Motive Studio would surely be a Dead Space 2 remake, right?\n\nWhen the announcement came of it working on Battlefield, alongside the previously announced Marvel's Iron Man, there was reasonable concern from fans. Does this mean the Dead Space 2 remake isn't happening? Motive iterated that it's a two-project studio and nothing more.\n\nHowever, reports emerged that the studio was in mind for something Dead Space-related, though it's not quite what you think. As for the lack of information about a potential follow-up, even after the first game's remake received so much critical acclaim, there's a reason for that.\n\nJoin us as we unravel the whole (alleged) story behind the (purported) Dead Space 2 remake.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVsEFZYtddU", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/mVsEFZYtddU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dead Space 2 Remake - What The Heck Is Going On?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-12T13:30:17+00:00", "description": "It\u2019s a bit hard to believe that there\u2019s never been a true open world Star Wars game, but that\u2019s about to change in just a few short months.

That could be due to lacking some features or doing things, be it driving or combat, slightly different from what fans expect. Maybe the scale won't be supermassive, as past reports have indicated.\n\nPerhaps it won't offer a 60 FPS mode for current-gen consoles.\nWhatever the case, as enjoyable as Grand Theft Auto 6 could be, some may still be disappointed.
