Disney definitely came with the heat, showing off new footage of Deadpool & Wolverine, Captain America: Brave New World, Alien: Romulus, Inside Out 2, and more. In related news, a new logo was shown off for Marvel's Thunderbolts* which featured an asterisk in the title. Fans have been speculating what that asterisk means, and MCU mastermind Kevin Feige only confirmed that it isn't some kind of typo. And finally, a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie has been announced, and this one will be a live-action adaptation of the popular The Last Ronin storyline.
