<p>Microsoft released 149 updates in this month’s Patch Tuesday release, though there were no reports of public disclosures or other zero-days for the Microsoft ecosystem (Windows, Office, .NET). This update is very large, complex and will require some testing time, especially for the OLE, ODBC and SQL focused updates and their impact on complex applications. </p>

<p>The UK’s antitrust regulator has put tech giants on notice after expressing concern that developments in the AI market could stifle innovation.</p>

<p>Consider this: Apple has been working with artificial intelligence (AI) in specific domains for many years. Then OpenAI’s ChatGPT emerged and made Apple look bad. Today as <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2075117/wwdc-2024-yes-we-live-in-interesting-times.html">WWDC approaches</a>, the company is expected to <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2077742/when-the-going-gets-tough-apples-siri-goes-pro.html">deliver souped-up AI across all its devices</a> — and as competitors struggle to catch up in processor design, we expect fresh M4 Macs to appear this fall.</p>



<p>What this means is that Apple may soon offer computationally advanced mass market computers in a range of

<p>The desktop/laptop market has been pretty quiet for several years. Windows carved out its dominant space, and despite repeated claims that it would happen, Linux never really emerged as a challenger on the desktop. The Apple Mac proved to be a solid if pricier alternative, popular in certain markets and industries and seeing a surge of interest in recent years with the introduction of powerful <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1640004/apples-macs-glide-into-the-fast-lane-with-m1-apple-silicon.html">M-series Apple processors</a>, which boosted <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/218089/global-market-share-of-windows-7/#:~:text=Microsoft%27s%20Windows%20was%20the%20dominant%2

<p>Now that you’re used to seeing co-workers, family, and strangers at coffee shops, offices, and planes using the oblong USB-C connector, it’s time to see just what this promising standard can do today and tomorrow. As we approach its 10th birthday, the USB-C plug is now part and parcel of just about every new laptop, phone, and tablet made. Even MacBooks, iPads, iPhones, and Chromebooks now have USB-C ports, at least living up to the first part of its full name: Universal Serial Bus.</p>



<p>In other words, the older rectangular USB Type-A plugs we are so used to are slowly going the way of the dinosaur. This evolution is happening faster in some arenas than others. For example, the latest Mac
