In today's Fix of entertainment news:
This week was the yearly gathering of studio and movie theater execs as Hollywood showcases what the upcoming year or so has to offer. Disney definitely came with the heat, showing off new footage of Deadpool & Wolverine, Captain America: Brave New World, Alien: Romulus, Inside Out 2, and more. In related news, a new logo was shown off for Marvel's Thunderbolts* which featured an asterisk in the title. Fans have been speculating what that asterisk means, and MCU mastermind Kevin Feige only confirmed that it isn't some kind of typo. And finally, a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie has been announced, and this one will be a live-action adaptation of the popular The Last Ronin storyline. Oh, and it will be the first Turtles movie to be rated 'R.'

In today's Daily Fix:
Grand Theft Auto 6 only dropped one trailer so far, but that hasn't stopped fans from making their own. A creative group of YouTubers got together to recreate the trailer IRL, and using actual Miami as the setting. It's pretty impressive, and accurate, even having actors portray the game's leads. In other crime-related news, a man in Japan was arrested for tampering with and selling Pokémon save data. He said he did it to make a living, which is probably the most honest excuse you could give. And finally, some new games are coming to Switch Online, and by 'new,' we mean retro titles that have never officially come to the U.S. before.

Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch. This week Daemon is joined by Max Scoville of Podcast Beyond, and Jada Griffin, IGN's Community Lead. The topic: will the next generation of consoles actually fulfill the promises made by this gen? Both the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 tout features like 8K, but most games barely support 4K/60, let along anything at twice that resolution. And are fancy features like haptic feedback and 3D audio really being used by developers and gamers?

Adapting a video game into a TV show is a pretty daunting task, but Fallout is a more difficult beast than most. A series of six massive RPGs, four of which are huge open worlds filled to bursting with companies, creations, and creatures, there’s a hell of a lot to address in order to get the world just right in live action. And yet that’s just what the Prime Video show does - it’s a series teeming with game-accurate props, ideas, and locations. 
Season 1 of the Fallout TV show features a megaton of details and easter eggs taken straight from the games, and we've rounded up 111 of them.
