<p>Really interesting deep dive by Luca Casonato into the engineering behind the new JSR alternative JavaScript package registry launched recently by Deno.</p>

<p>The backend uses PostgreSQL and a Rust API server hosted on Google Cloud Run.</p>

<p>The frontend uses Fresh, Deno&#x27;s own server-side JavaScript framework which leans heavily in the concept of &quot;islands&quot; - a progressive enhancement technique where pages are rendered on the server and small islands of interactivity are added once the page has loaded.</p>

[...] our phones are constant feedback machines ‚Äî colored buttons telling us what to tap, instant activity every time we touch or pinch or scroll. You can see your options and what happens when you pick one. With AI, you don‚Äôt get any of that. Using the AI Pin feels like wishing on a star: you just close your eyes and hope for the best. Most of the time, nothing happens.</p></blockquote><p class="cite">&mdash; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review">David Pierce</a>
