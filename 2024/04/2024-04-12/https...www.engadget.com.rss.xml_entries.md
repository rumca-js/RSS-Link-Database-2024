<p>On Friday, people around the web <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@pranavdesigns/post/C5pdA7OiYHE">noticed</a> a new addition to their Instagram: Meta AI, the company’s general-purpose, AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions, write poetry and generate images with a simple text prompt. The move isn’t surprising. Meta <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-unleashing-more-than-25-ai-chatbot-personalities-onto-the-world-181428710.html">revealed</a> Meta AI in September 2023 and has spent the last few months adding the chatbot to products like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, so adding it to Instagram seems like a no-brainer.&nbsp;</p>

## Tesla halves the price of its Full Self Driving (Supervised) subscription to $99 per month

<p>The price of a monthly subscription to Tesla's (kind-of) self-driving software has just been cut in half. Tesla's Full Self Driving (Supervised) subscription now costs $99 per month, a reduction from the previous standard of $199.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tesla instituted the $199 monthly upgrade fee in 2021, back when its self-driving system was still in beta. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fsd-price-increase-12000-002847392-002847345.html">costs $12,000</a> to add Full Self Driving (Supervised) — full name, every time — to a Tesla outright, so at the current rate, it'll take 10 years for the subscription to lose its value. As far as installment plans go, this one seems like a solid deal. To be fair, so was the $199 rate, which gave (self-)drivers five years before hitting $12,000 in fees.</p>

## Meta is testing messaging capabilities for Threads, but don’t call them DMs

<p>As Threads has grown to more than 130 million users, one of the major remaining “missing” features users often complain about is the lack of direct messaging abilities. But those missing out on DMs may soon have a new option to message other Threads users.</p>
<p>Meta is starting <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@lucaspuskaric/post/C5q7TXHLnHe"><ins>to test</ins></a> messaging features that rely on Instagram’s inbox but allow new messages to be initiated from the Threads app. The feature has begun <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@chris/post/C5rCYl_P8hL"><ins>to appear</ins></a> for some Threads users, who report seeing a “message” button atop other users’ profiles where the “mention” feature used to be. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the change, saying the company was “testing the ability to send a message from Threads to Instagram.”</p>

<p>Back in December, Epic Games <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jury-sides-with-epic-games-in-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-032341810.html">won an antitrust case against Google</a>. A jury found that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/">Google</a> held an illegal monopoly on in-app billing and app distribution on Android devices, and that it engaged in anticompetitive practices with certain gaming companies and device manufacturers.</p>
<p>At the time, it was unclear what <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/epic/">Epic</a> actually won as the remedies had not been determined. The <em>Fortnite </em>maker has now submitted a proposed permanent injunction against Google detailing what it wants. In short, Epic wants the Play Store to be almost wide open.</p>

<p><a href="https://possibility.co/">Possibility Space</a>, an independent game studio with employees distributed across the globe, was abruptly shut down today by its CEO Jeff Strain, former employees <a href="https://twitter.com/GraczykMatt/status/1778827370943893643">revealed on Twitter</a>. The studio launched in 2021 with the goal of creating a AAA title, and it had also hired industry notables like Waypoint's Austin Walker and Ubisoft designer Liz England. Its closure follows the shutdown of Crop Circle Games last month, another studio owned by Strain's Prytania Media, which he co-founded with his wife Annie Delisi Strain.</p>

<p>Ubisoft’s online-only racing game <em>The Crew</em> stopped being operable on April 1. Some users are reporting, however, that things have gone a bit further. They say that the company actually reached into Ubisoft Connect accounts and revoked the license to access the game, <a href="https://gamerant.com/the-crew-ubisoft-connect-revoke-access/"><ins>according to reports by </ins><em><ins>Game Rant</ins></em></a> and others.</p>
<p>Some of these users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/ubisoft_is_revoking_licenses_for_the_crew/"><ins>liken this move to theft</ins></a>, as they had purchased the game with their own money and received no warning that Ubisoft would be deleting the license. When attempting to launch the game, these players say they received a message stating that access was no longer possible.</p>

<p>Playdate, otherwise known as The Only Handheld That Actually Fits In My Tiny Hands, is almost perfect. It's a small yellow machine with a black-and-white screen and a crank on one side, and it's the home of fantastic, outlandish video games. The Playdate Catalog has <a href="https://play.date/games/">more than 100 titles</a> and there are hundreds more on sites like <a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate">itch.io</a>, created by new developers and established indies like Bennett Foddy, Lucas Pope and Keita Takahashi. Two years after its launch, Playdate is thriving. Panic, the company behind the device, said it's sold more than 70,000 units.</p>
<p>The one thing Playdate is missing is the <a href="https://play.date/stereo-dock/">Stereo Dock</a>, a device that Panic announced back in 2021 and has been &quot;coming soon&quot; ever since. The Stereo Dock is a charging station, Bluetooth speaker, pen holder and stand for Playdate, and it looks like an adorable little tube TV when

<p>Sometimes even the most die-hard coffee enthusiasts just want a quick cup of joe. Unfortunately, that often leaves people with sipping less-than-satisfactory java from traditional drip brewers. But now after years of customer requests, Fellow is finally releasing a machine that it claims can deliver a pour-over experience at the touch of a button. And after seeing it in action, there’s a lot to like.</p>
<p>Starting at $365, the Aiden certainly isn’t cheap. That said, compared to the $500 grinders and <a href="https://weberworkshops.com/products/moonraker"><ins>pricey accessories</ins></a> that so many aficionados lust after, this might seem like a bargain to some. But the big difference between the Aiden and traditional coffee machines is that unlike a typical drip-based brewer, it features an adjustable showerhead that mimics the process of a traditional pour-over.

<p>OpenTable's restaurant pages still feature a lot of reviews left by anonymous diners at the moment, but that will not be the case starting next month. The online restaurant reservation service is changing its policy around reviews so that they're not as anonymous — and it's even applying the new rule retroactively. As <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/opentable-is-adding-your-first-name-to-previously-anonymous-reviews/"><em>BleepingComputer</em></a> reports, it told users in an email that starting on May 22, it &quot;will begin displaying diner first names and profile photos on all diner reviews.&quot; Further, &quot;this update will also apply to past reviews.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We've heard from you, our diners, that trust and transparency are important when looking at reviews,&quot; the company also said in its letter, insinuating that it's changing the way reviews work based on user feedback. As <em>BleepingComputer</em> says, it'll be easy to match a ba

This week, Cherlynn and Devindra are joined by Michael Fisher (AKA MrMobile) and Wired Reviews Editor Julian Chokkattu to chat about the AI Pin and the many ways it fails. It’s often inaccurate, it takes crummy photos, and it gets way too hot. Not so great for something you’re supposed to wear all day! Is there any hope for AI-dependent gadgets? Also, Washington Post columnist Christopher Velazco joins to discuss <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/11/apple-repaired-used-parts-pairing/">Apple’s approval of used iPhone components for repairs</a>.</p>
