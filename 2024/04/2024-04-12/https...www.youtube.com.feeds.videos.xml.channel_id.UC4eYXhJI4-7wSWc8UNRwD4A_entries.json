The production crew double-checked equipment settings and made small adjustments to the lighting. Another worker added a few more posters to the tall white file cabinets. Cameras were set and microphones were ready because Fujii Kaze and his band had just rehearsed the night before. Everyone in the room \u2014 including a few of us from NPR that were there to help \u2014 was eager and excited because the very first performance for Tiny Desk Concerts JAPAN was about to start.\n\nPopular around the world, the talented Fujii Kaze is a Japanese singer and pianist known for his sultry R&amp;B grooves and catchy songwriting. His adventurous spirit was strong as he settled into the Tiny Desk way \u2014 a concert that's intimate, mostly acoustic and recorded without reverb, effects, in-ear monitors or wedges.
