Quarterly deal value hit the lowest level since 2018, according to the PitchBook-NVCA Venture Monitor released Thursday. Higher interest rates and persistent inflation, among other market factors, caused venture capitalists to put the brakes on investing throughout 2023, following record levels of startup fundraising in years prior. &#8220;The venture capital business cycle effectively reset in recent years, and as of early 2024, it still appears to be searching for its level,&#8221; NVCA CEO Bobby Franklin&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/top-10-funding-deals-in-q1-for-seattle-area-startups/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/top-10-funding-deals-in-q1-for-seattle-area-startups", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Top 10 funding deals in Q1 for Pacific Northwest startups", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-12T03:16:22+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Bill-Gates-fills-a-pothole-with-Modern-Hydrogen.jpg\" width=\"800\" /><br />Bill Gates grabbed a wheelbarrow and shovel on Wednesday to fill a parking lot pothole with a new carbon trapping asphalt.

Eventually, Project Kuiper aims to provide satellite broadband service to hundreds of millions of people around the world who are currently underserved when it comes to connectivity. Such a service would compete with SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink satellite network, which already has more than 2.6 million customers. Amazon is investing more than $10 billion to get Kuiper off the ground.
