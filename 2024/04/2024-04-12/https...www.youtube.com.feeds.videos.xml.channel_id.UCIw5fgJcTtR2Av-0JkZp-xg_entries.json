I love those OP-1 sounds, and they've been a source of inspiration for many a track. So I thought, why not combine the workflow of the Circuit Tracks (which I love) and the sounds of the OP-1? This little idea became an obsession, and after many months of detailed work and refinement, this pack was born. I own the OG OP-1 and listening to the newer OP-1 Field examples, I felt like the crunchy and lofi quality of the sounds were more apparent on the OP-1 compared to the Field. The Field has this smoother hi-fi sound, not to my preference. Anyway, the sounds that inspired a legion of artists and musicmakers were from the OG, so that's what I modeled my sounds after.\n\nMy Patreon Edition (PE) Pack contain", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9iXEQMAZpY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCIw5fgJcTtR2Av-0JkZp-xg", "source_obj__id": 405, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/E9iXEQMAZpY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Can a $400 Circuit Tracks sound like a $1400 OP-1?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-12T12:00:45+00:00", "description": "OPERATION_1 Circuit Pack: https://isotonikstudios.com/product/operation_1-by-yuri-wong/\nJoin my Patreon for the FREE OPERATION_1 Patreon Edition Pack: https://patreon.com/yuriwong\n\nThe OP-1 has long been a device of creative inspiration, and now those sounds can be accessed directly on the Circuit Tracks, in a set of 128 patches emulating 8 of the OP-1\u2019s iconic engines:\n\nCluster, Digital, DNA, Dr Wave, DSynth, String, FM, Phase & Pulse\n\nThe goal while creating OPERATION_1 was to get maximum musical expressiveness for the patches, with the original sounds as the starting point. Each Circuit sound was crafted to be as close to the OP-1 patch as musically possible. For movements or textures where the Circuit Tracks engine couldn\u2019t emulate, effort was made to make it come as close as the Circuit engine would allow, yet still maintain the usefulness of the sound i.e. to make it as functional and creatively inspiring as possible for music creation.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s in OPERATION_1:\n\n- 128 OP-1", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol1WZKQkABE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCIw5fgJcTtR2Av-0JkZp-xg", "source_obj__id": 405, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/ol1WZKQkABE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "OPERATION_1 Circuit Pack (Full Demo)", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
