<p>The <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3218074/what-is-rust-safe-fast-and-easy-software-development.html">Rust language</a> team has published a point release of Rust to fix a <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/04/09/cve-2024-24576.html" rel="nofollow">critical vulnerability</a> to the standard library that could benefit an attacker when using Windows.</p><p><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/04/09/Rust-1.77.2.html" rel="nofollow">Rust 1.77.2</a>, published on April 9, includes a fix for <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24576" rel="nofollow">CVE-2024-24576</a>. Before this release, Rust’s standard library did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files with the<code> bat</code> and <code>cmd</code> extensions on Windows using the <code>Command</code> API. An attacker who controlled arguments passed to a spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escape. This vulnerabilit

<p>A high-quality application must be stable, performant, scalable, and reliable. The reliability of an application depends on many factors, but one of the most important is resiliency, or the ability to withstand failures or faults during run time. In this article, we’ll see how we can bring resiliency to database connections in ASP.NET Core using Entity Framework Core.</p><p>EF Core has a feature called connection resiliency that automatically retries failed database commands to maintain connectivity during transient errors or network instability. By encapsulating the logic for identifying failures and retrying commands, this feature allows us to devise execution plans for different database failure situations.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715280/how-to-implement-database-connection-resiliency-in-aspnet-core.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>“The cloud has tremendous business value!” That’s the battle cry chanted by cloud providers and their allies at every cloud computing conference.</p><p>You will never hear me say that “the cloud” is always the right solution or, for that matter, the wrong solution. In my 20-plus years as a cloud expert, I’ve never blindly followed the lead of cloud computing pioneers or adopters. Like any other technology trend and category, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2683784/what-is-cloud-computing.html">cloud computing</a> should be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>This balanced approach may have cost me some friends and perhaps some jobs, but I believe this will remain the right way to think about cloud deployments in 2024.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715300/the-cloud-is-benefiting-it-but-not-business.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
