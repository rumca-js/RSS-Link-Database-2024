Whether it's their epic stories, cinematic combat, number-crunching min-maxing or dynamic worlds, RPGs are still some of the most well-regarded titles.\n\nThey aren't without their issues, however. Lovable characters can turn sour and decide to leave the party. Decisions can ultimately lead to nothing or have little bearing on the plot.
