<ul><li>Gloucester 17-38 Exeter</li><li>Playoff chasers score five tries in bonus-point win</li></ul><p>A glance at the team sheet suggested this might be a difficult afternoon for Gloucester and so it proved. Exeter’s international contingent, led by Wales’s Dafydd Jenkins and spearheaded by virtuoso displays by England internationals Immanuel Feyi-Waboso and Henry Slade, kept their playoff hopes alive with a fluent bonus-point victory.</p><p>Slade kicked 13 points – a perfect six out of six – and stylishly contributed to a fluid attacking display from Rob Baxter’s men, who scored five tries.

<p>While a cast of literary heavyweights grace Laing’s account of her garden restoration, the real joys lie in her detailed description of the pruning and the planting and the soothing effect on her state of mind</p><p>Olivia Laing’s new book, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-garden-against-time-9781529066678">The Garden Against Time</a></em>, is as fragrantly replete as a long border at its peak. The word that comes to mind is spumy: a blossomy, brimful excess that’s almost too much at times. Here are hundreds of plants, exquisitely described; here is colour, energy and expertise. In a way, it’s akin to a garden itself; a place, almost a park, in which the reader never quite knows what’s around the next corner. But while this is invigorating – my imagination whirred across the verdant expanses of its pages like some crazy, old-fashioned lawnmower – it’s also tiring. Dizzy on its pollen, I often had to put it down. I began to think of the chapter breaks as conveniently pl

<p>Often misused by politicians, nostalgia is a positive emotion that could do with a makeover</p><p>I have always been prone to homesickness. As a child, I didn’t really enjoy holidays, I dreaded going away on school trips and I hated sleepovers. At the beginning of 2021, when I first started thinking about the history of nostalgia, and in the midst of the pandemic, I moved across the Atlantic from London to Montreal, Canada, for work. Far from home and away from my family and friends, I felt a kind of grief whenever I thought about the life I’d left behind. There was so much to love about my new life but I felt anxious, worrying constantly about the safety and wellbeing of my parents, siblings and friends. What if, due to the time difference, I missed an urgent call or woke up to terrible news? These fears were, of course, unfounded, and they were also ridiculous, childish even. Grownups – married 30-year-olds with mortgages and full-time jobs – shouldn’t miss their mums.</p><p>I al

While the Italian success was in part due to the profile of director, star and national treasure Paola Cortellesi, who plays put-upon mum of three Delia, the film’s emotional heft, bittersweet comedy and tone of hard-bitten romance could appeal to UK fans of Elena Ferrante’s sagas.</p><p>Cortellesi, who cut her teeth as a sketch show comedian, finds humour in tragedy: domestic abuse, poverty, disappointment.

<p><strong>Brighton Dome</strong><br />Ranganathan’s Hustle delivers laughs, but not the shock of the new. It is at its best when we glimpse something meaningful beneath the standard-issue curmudgeonliness</p><p>‘I’ll be honest with you: I’m getting sick of me too.” His TV ubiquity now the stuff of other comedians’ – and his own – punchlines, how can Romesh Ranganathan justify another evening in his company? Tonight, he starts by flattering the locals: a native of nearby Crawley, he waxes nostalgic about cutting his standup teeth on the Brighton scene. But mostly he’s an everyman, not just a Sussex man, a midlife misanthrope withdrawing from hard work, self-improvement and the prospect of ever making any new friends. Forty five years is enough, Romesh is here to tell us: no additional effort will now be made.</p><p>The authenticity of this pose we might question, not least given that slimline Ranganathan ran the London marathon last weekend.

In the movies, however, they’re eternally renewable. Take <em>Challengers</em>, Luca Guadagnino’s sleek, sexy, sweat-drenched new film, which hits every metaphor you might expect in its story of three tennis pros locked in a tense love triangle: games are won and lost, points scored, doubles partners swapped, and so on. Shot and paced with the ricocheting energy of a great tennis match, it’s a sports movie that, like many a classic of the genre, understands the parallels between sport and cinema as two great crowd-pleasing pastimes.</p><p>The sports movie is pre

Allegedly, the boy was secretly baptised as a Christian by a former maid. Now, according to Catholic law, he is a Christian for eternity and cannot be raised in a Jewish household. Gaunt with grief, his parents petition for his return but meet the immovable wall of Catholic dogma and the will of an embattled, intractable Pius IX. With stately restraint,

The speed and scale of my colon’s fury has fascinated doctors. I imagine them in their morning meetings, poring over my colonoscopy with the mystification usually reserved for the Voynich manuscript. But time is up. Unless they “disconnect” me, my bowel will perforate and I will die.</p><p>Disconnection, explains the doctor, involves whipping the whole colon out – here he mimes pulling a rabbit from a hat – and diverting my digestion through a hole in my abdomen called a stoma.

<p>Pots of slime, pig heads, sexy dolls… we were only looking for a present for my son’s fourth birthday</p><p>This week I found myself in a large toy shop in a retail park off London’s North Circular. We were looking, in a pleasant panic, for a present for my son’s fourth birthday. His birthdays always hit me in an odd way, a bit like those slaps round the face they have in films to stop the woman screaming. Because: he was born at the beginning of the pandemic and, just as his early developmental stages like sitting up or eating solids worked as a marker of time having passed, of us having survived, so do his birthdays. It is four years, this means, since those tight, hot days of the first Covid lockdown, of sanitiser-cracked hands and the brisk hell of home schooling, and every time the anniversary comes round I find myself having to sit down, take a breath.</p><p>Anyway, this toy shop, good God. Do you have any ideas what toys are today? I was not prepared. There are the board gam

It’s time to show some restraint</p><p>Climbing Everest used to be an even more dangerous pursuit than it is today, requiring huge bravery, endurance and skill. Even then the mountain could kill. A century ago, it claimed the lives of two of Britain’s finest climbers, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/28/heroism-sacrifice-noble-defeat-enduring-mystery-of-george-mallorys-final-everest-attempt">George Mallory and Sandy Irvine</a>.</p><p>The world’s highest mountain eventually succumbed to human challenge when, almost three decades later, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay carried the flags of Britain, the UN, and Nepal to its summit on 29 May 1953.

It costs £10. I ask our waiter what it is. “Exactly what it sounds like,” Tom says, cheerily. “The staff food is so much better here than I’m used to. Usually, it’s chicken nuggets. Not here. Today it was a pea risotto. We’ve had leek and bacon pie, and a cottage pie. It’s great.” They just happen to make enough to sell a few portions to the punters, too, though today they’ve already run out. No worries. There are other things worth ordering.</p> <a href="https://www.theguard

That’s the secret to the intensely savoury appeal of dry fino and manzanilla sherry. If that sounds like a&nbsp;boneheadedly simplistic statement of the bleeding obvious given that of course, yeast – specifically the strain <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> – plays an essential role in all wine as the agent of fermentation turning sugar into alcohol, please bear with me.
