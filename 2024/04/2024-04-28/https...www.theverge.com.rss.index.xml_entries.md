  <p id="B4VC4W">I don’t know about you, but when I have a nasty case of the hot phone, I have to get rid of that heat <em>this instant</em>. Just kidding, I usually just put it down for a while or restart it when it’s being especially stubborn. But there are companies out there marketing a different solution: little stick-on phone-cooling fans that purport to draw all that heat away.

  <p id="7ZBaZx">I’ve been making more of an effort to keep up with movies lately and even managed the rare feat of seeing one in an actual movie theater. I saw Guy Ritchie’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24055597/the-ministry-of-ungentlemanly-warfare-trailer"><em>The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare</em></a><em>, </em>which stars Henry Cavill, Alan Ritchson, Alex Pettyfer, Elza González, Babs Olusanmokun, and others in what I interpreted as a goofy spaghetti western / spy / heist film. </p>
<p id="TNu3pb">I suppose it’s also a war movie, being based (very loosely) on a true story about a collection of unstoppable guys set on an unsanctioned secret miss

  <p id="5lsxvO">It was Valentine’s Day when Meta’s ad platform started going off the rails. RC Williams, the co-founder of the Philadelphia-based marketing agency 1-800-D2C, had set one of Meta’s automated ad tools to run campaigns for two separate clients. But when he checked the platform that day, he found that Meta had blown through roughly 75 percent of the daily ad budgets for both clients in under a couple of hours.</p>
<p id="YCgI1M">Williams told <em>The Verge</em> that the ads’ CPMs, or cost per impressions, were roughly 10 times higher than normal.<strong> </strong>A usual CPM of under $28 had inflated to roughly $250, way above the <a
