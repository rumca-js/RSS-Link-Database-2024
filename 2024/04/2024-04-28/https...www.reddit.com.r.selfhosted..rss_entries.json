So I bought a domain and a contabo vps in the last days and I want to have my domain names for me and my web Laravel. My first idea was to use a self-hosted email provider in my server but I'm not sure about how to create them with no sick of lost data or security vulnerabilities. Another idea was to buy Cpanel is easy to use but was a bit expensive. Or maybe I can use another host provider with low prices. If anyone can give advice me I will thank you.Uncertain regarding email domain hosting.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Worlie24\"> /u/Worlie24 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ceyp1k/uncertain_regarding_email_domain_hosting/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ceyp1k/uncertain_regarding_email_domain_hosting/\">[comments]</a></span>", "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ceyp1k/uncertain_regarding_email_domain_hosting", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Uncertain regarding email domain hosting", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-04-28T03:07:06+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have a server running OMV and want to set up an offsite backup at a relative\u2019s house.
