<p>World No 2 basically auditioning for acceptance to return to policy board is faintly ludicrous in increasingly fractured sport</p><p>The most unpalatable and unlikely scenario could be a necessary one. Rory McIlroy to LIV has been rumoured, slapped down, rumoured and slapped down. Yet as the PGA Tour procrastinates over completion of a deal with the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, and even the formal involvement of McIlroy himself, one wonders if <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/16/rory-mcilroy-denies-reports-he-will-join-liv-golf-for-850m">it may take something nuclear</a> to allow golf to wake up to the haplessness of its present, fractured state. Should McIlroy sign for golf’s rebel tour the establishment would be sent into a level of frenzy so serious that collaboration between the PGA Tour, LIV and the PIF would surely transpire in a heartbeat.</p><p>There is no suggestion this will happen. Still, Greg Norman knew precisely what he was doing in recent

She and her partner, campaigner Julie Bindel, embarked on a three-month sabbatical tour visiting Canada, South Korea, Cambodia and Vietnam, during which Wistrich developed the idea of a legal charity that would “tackle state accountability for all types of violence against women by undertaking the litigation specifically aimed at system reform through legal action”. In short, she would set out to remodel parts of the law so that it offered justice not just to men, as it has done for generations, but also to women who, all too often, have been a
