This is a game in which a heroic character from a children's fantasy book can leap from the pages and rove around the bedroom desk on which the book was being read. It's a game in which you can move back and forth, from 2D illustration to chunky, squishy 3D in the name of adventure.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-plucky-squire-review-the-power-of-imagination">Read more</a></p>

## PS5 Pro vs PC value comparisons are less important than a potentially bleak future for console pricing

Last week, my X/Twitter timeline was packed with value comparisons presented with an increasing level of mania. Is the latest Sony console so overpriced that a PC may actually offer more for your money? From my perspective, there are a couple of ways you can look at this. Firstly, are the costs of console gaming rising so much that a gaming PC is no longer such an expensive alternative? That's a legitimate concern and worth some discussion. However, the actual argument seems to be that potential Pro buyers should opt for a PC <em>instead</em> and for me, that's a less plausible idea. Both formats play games, but fundamentally they are very different things - and believe it or not, potential Pro users may already own a gaming PC and still want a Pro... or simply don't want a PC at all!</p>

Nvidia boss Jensen Huang has discussed the advantages of AI, and said it was now a key component for the advancement of graphical capabilities.
</p><p>
"We can't do computer graphics anymore without artificial intelligence," Huang said, speaking recently at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference (via <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4720501-nvidia-corporation-nvda-ceo-jensen-huang-presents-goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology">SeekingAlpha</a>). 
</p><p>
"We compute one pixel, we infer the other 32. I mean, it's incredible," Huang continued. "And so we hallucinate, if you will, the other 32, and it looks temporally stable, it looks photorealistic, and the image quality is incredible, the performance is incredible."
