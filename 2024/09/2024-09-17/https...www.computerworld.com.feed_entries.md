<p>Has Apple’s <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2086660/yes-apples-vision-pro-is-an-enterprise-product.html">love affair with AR cooled</a>? Not on your life, and while it is true that visionOS didn’t get much time during the company’s big reveals at WWDC and last week’s iPhone launch, the company has delivered a handful of valuable improvements to the OS — hinting at future product plans as it did.</p>

<p>Kendall McDaniel felt like a nomad worker, wandering from job to job, never making enough money, never feeling fulfilled. He worked entry-level jobs in construction, in healthcare and at multiple fast-food joints.</p>



<p>In those fast-food jobs, McDaniel said, “You could be bleeding out of your ears and you’d still be expected to come into work.”</p>



<p>With an associate’s degree in theater, McDaniel at the time felt there were no long-term career options ahead for him. Then, two years ago, his cousin — an electrician — told him about a manufacturing company he’d worked at. He liked how they treated him, and that tip convinced McDaniel to apply for another entry-level position; this time,

<p>In his resignation letter, which the Frenchman posted on X, Breton justified his move by saying that von der Leyen had asked the French government a few days ago to remove his name from the list of candidates, allegedly in exchange for another more influential portfolio.</p>
