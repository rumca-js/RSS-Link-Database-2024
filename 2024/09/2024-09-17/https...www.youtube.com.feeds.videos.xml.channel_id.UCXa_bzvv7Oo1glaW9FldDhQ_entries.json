The tale of Jot and his friends, Violet and Thrash, plays out like your typical fantasy stories, with the evil sorcerer Humgrump foiled again. However, things quickly take a turn when the latter discovers the truth behind their story and removes Jot.\n\nThus begins a different adventure, one where our hero must leverage the real world of Sam's desk to stop Humgrump. However, The Plucky Squire is more than just a hybrid 2D/3D action adventure with platforming, top-down hack-and-slash combat, and sequences that delve into other genres like shoot 'em ups and turn-based RPGs.\n\nIt's also a tale about stories and how they impact people's lives. If the atmosphere doesn't evoke memories of a bygone time, aided by stunning visuals and presentation, then the gameplay delivers a tight experience with plenty of variety.", "id": 1163028, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcY_MmWk5GU", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zcY_MmWk5GU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Plucky Squire Review - A MUST-PLAY 3D Platformer", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-17T15:00:57+00:00", "description": "From a nearly-forgotten IP after the underwhelming Dead Rising 4 to an incredible resurrection with its remaster, the Dead Rising franchise looks better than ever.

There's even a new Standard control scheme for easier execution of techniques and moving while aiming (though Classic controls are still available).\n\nThat's not even delving into the visuals, which benefit from improved textures, facial expressions, and more on top of 4K/60 FPS support.
