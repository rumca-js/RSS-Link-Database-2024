A few years later, after my brother and his friend had gone off to college, I tried to find the game, without luck, until it consumed my every thought. I went to video game stores. I asked other people. I even asked my brother&#39;s friend&#39;s mom if he had left it behind. I was like 15 and she ignored me. But after like 10 years, I was walking around a thrift shop while on vacation in South Carolina and I saw some old computer games in a locked glass case. I asked the employee to unlock it and wouldn&#39;t you know it? There it was. On the bottom of a stack of jewel-cased PC games in a glass case in a thrift store in South Carolina. I would have paid any price for it. I never wanted to end a vacation early so badly before.
