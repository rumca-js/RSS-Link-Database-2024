<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! I am hosting my first murder-mystery party this year for my birthday (eeeeek!). I’ve been lurking on this subreddit and landed on this party kit: <a href="https://mischiefgames.co/products/y2killer?srsltid=AfmBOorsNcAQlGFO82a3Gkhf6Fj75MnCojKFcsa4wSjOOJYKQnhxplVA">https://mischiefgames.co/products/y2killer?srsltid=AfmBOorsNcAQlGFO82a3Gkhf6Fj75MnCojKFcsa4wSjOOJYKQnhxplVA</a> </p> <p>I am planning on inviting around 25ish people, around 5 of which are plus ones. The kit only serves 20 characters max and I want to find a way to involve the plus ones (or people that don’t wish to participate). Do you all have any suggestions on ways you have done this or would do this? </p> <p>I was thinking of having those that opt-out be “journalists”, trying to gather the story to report on it, or make it their mission to find out the gossip. What do you all think? TIA! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/y0fiz

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A lot of us probably think of backgammon as the game our parents or grandparents played. Despite having a long history that goes back centuries, backgammon is still associated with the 1970s in the popular consciousness. I remember finding my parents&#39; leatherette briefcase set as a kid, it was missing a white checker that had been replaced with a white coat button. I never learned to play backgammon as a kid, but my sister and I played Acey-Duecy on the board.</p> <p>Fast forward a few decades and I had gotten into modern board games before finally returning to backgammon. Now I&#39;m here to tell you that backgammon is one of the best 2 player games of all time and you should try it if you&#39;ve never played it.</p> <p>Backgammon is a game in which each player has 15 checkers on a board. Players roll dice to move their checkers, trying to get them to the end and remove them from the board before their opponents. Along the way you hit your oppone

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been listening to the SUSD podcast for years, but lately, I just can&#39;t seem to enjoy it anymore.</p> <p>These days, Tom and his cohost (usually Emily) discuss 3-4 games.

Personally, I find audio reviews the weakest compared to written and video ones because it&#39;s difficult to convey rules and mechanics without visuals, but that&#39;s not a dealbreaker for me.</p> <p>My issue is that often only one person has played the game, while it&#39;s the first time the other has even heard of it. As a result, the other person has nothing to contribute, and the conversation quickly devolves into random chit-chat, with the hosts going off on tangents. While I enjoy their humor and casual chit-chat, lately it feels a bit excessive.</p> <p>There used to be more discussion, with the hosts building on each other&#39;s points and adding more depth to their explanations, wh

I&#39;m not affiliated with them in any way, just a big fan. </p> <p>A few years ago, I happened upon the kickstarter for March of the Ants. Now, I don&#39;t kickstart very often, but it has turned out to be the best thing I&#39;ve ever backed! Cole Wehrle (maybe you&#39;ve heard of him) calls it &quot;one of the most underrated 4x designs out there... distills the best parts of the genre without any of the baggage&quot;, and while I didn&#39;t love Oath, I totally agree here. (Quote pulled from the kickstarter page). I think it&#39;s at least as good as Eclipse, and in fact I think &quot;Eclipse lite with ants&quot; is not a bad way to characterize it. It&#39;s maybe 75% the weight, and has a &quot;more territory, more upkeep&quot; system that feels kind of similar. It&#39;s got hexes, it&#39;s got upgrades. </p> <p>The first edition had some issues. The cards

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Is this game worth owning to only play co-op?</strong> I have concerns about randomness being a strong factor in competitive games, and more importantly, I don&#39;t think my group would like this as a competitive experience. </p> <p><strong>Is there a lot of replayability and asymmetry in terms of co-op?</strong> Could it rival something like Spirit Island? It has way fewer asymmetrical factions and cards, but it does have an exploration mechanic. </p> <p><strong>Does it handle 3-4 players reasonably well with little downtime?</strong> Are turns simultaneous? My main concern is with the battles. When you get in a fight you have to resolve this whole thing on a sideboard. That&#39;s fine in a two player game if you&#39;re fighting an opponent, but if the other players can&#39;t do anything while you spend 3-5 minutes resolving a battle, that seems bad.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kaned

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Everyone!</p> <p>I lived in a unit that had a built-in cabinet that handled all of our board game needs for a long time. My family and I have moved out of that unit and have had to purchase our own storage solution for our board game collection. Our collection isn&#39;t toooo big. We have 40+ standard sized boxes, around 5 larger boxes, and then around 10-15 smaller boxes. A 4x4 kallax would probably suit our needs, but the problem is that we have small children and need to have doors on the storage unit.</p> <p>Edit: Forgot to add the prompt.

I found that idea really interesting as a theme, and the game play also sounds fairly light, and also interesting.</p> <p>Maybe this interests me because, I was there. I was there 30 years ago ... when Marvel inserted the foil cards. I was there the day the comic book industry of men failed. I led my friends into the heart of the comic shop, where the pour marketing techniques were forged, the one place they could be destroyed! It should have ended that day, but the shop kept my money. The fads would return. The comic industry was broken. There&#39;s no strength left in the world of Comics.

At the end of the month is my birthday and I will be having a barbecue at my house with 10 of my closest friends and my husband, so we will be 12 adults. I have room for a table and chairs, but the reality is that everyone will be moving around because it is already spring in my country and the weather is warm, so while my husband will be at the grill, the others might be on the balcony or having a drink in the kitchen. Now that I have explained myself, and I think I have been too specific, I would like you to recommend games that can be played in an unstructured way. If someone misses a turn, or the game is interrupted, or we don&#39;t want to sit at the table... what can we do? I can think of Dont Get Got, but there is nothing like that in my country, and I have not found an online version to try to translate on my own. I have dice and cards, but keep in mind that many of the games available through amazon do not arrive in my country.

PLEASE HELP. thanks :))</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NoValue9183"> /u/NoValue9183 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1filpvz/cryptid_board_game_please_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1filpvz/cryptid_board_game_please_help/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. As the title says, I&#39;m looking for great engine builders that don&#39;t take more than 1 hour and a half at most, since me and my friends enjoy the living hell out of engine builders or games with some elements of engine building like Terra Mystica, Arnak, Terraforming Mars, Through the Ages etc, but don&#39;t have enough time to finish 1 all the way through. Currently Saint Petersburg and It&#39;s a Wonderful World are our go-to&#39;s for this much time, but we&#39;re looking to expand our collection.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/InsurgentTatsumi"> /u/InsurgentTatsumi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fil0ky/best_engine_builders_in_under_1_hour_30/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fil0ky/best_engine_builders_in_under_1_hour_30/">[comments]</a></span>
