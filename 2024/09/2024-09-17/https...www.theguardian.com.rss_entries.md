When podcasts, TV shows and documentaries first fell over themselves to cover them, these groups’ leaders’ powers of persuasion and charisma seemed near supernatural; they must be charming geniuses able to take normal people and convince them of madcap ideas. But the more cult content you ingest, the more often you learn that the person at the top is just … some guy. What makes Jamali Maddix: Follow the Leader special is that it goes further.

So, how are your nerves?</p><p>Pretty solid, as it turned out.

An insider takes up the story: “It was loosely worded, but it stated that if the big stars didn’t show up the BBC had the right to claw back some of its fee. But it was never used as once we had Dina Asher-Smith and Adam Peaty, the concerns went away.”</p><p>That vignette says a lot about the reduced status of the Commonwealth Games.

Election denialism has become a feature, not a bug, of a major political party for nearly four years. The fact that Trump, when given the opportunity by ABC moderators to distance himself from efforts to discredit the 2020 election during this month’s presidential debate, still refused to acknowledge Joe Biden’s legitimate victory is no longer surprising, though we are also inured to shock.</p><p>But a new HBO documentary argues, through forensic chronological detail and, perhaps ironically, the testimony of Republican election officials and former m

Now it’s one of his biggest assets.</p><p>Dr Weiner is a urologist, and he says the name has been a huge help in working with patients. “When men come and see me for the first time, they’re typically pretty nervous,” he says. “And let me tell you, having a last name like Weiner in this field is one of the best icebreakers.” Patients routinely come in with a name-related joke, and the tension dissolves. “I don’t mind it one bit,” Weiner says. The name has also helped him achieve prominence in his field. “Researchers, other faculty, other institutions, they tend to remember the urologist named Dr Weiner.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/sep/17/aptronym-job-normative-determinism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>MachineGames’ long-awaited tie-in looks set to deliver the most authentic Indy adventure yet. And with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg on board, hold on to your hats for an unforgettable ride</p><p>It’s the spring of 1977, and George Lucas is petrified. Having just wrapped work on his third feature film, Star Wars, he retreats to Hawaii, unable to face the early reviews. Yet as he frets in a five-star resort, Lucas bumps into another Hollywood hideaway – Steven Spielberg. Making sandcastles together under the Maui sun, Lucas pitches Spielberg a story that riffs on the simpler era of 1950s’ serials, an action-packed spectacular about a James Bond-esque archaeologist. This crypt-robbing Casanova’s name? Indiana … Smith.</p><p>The hero’s moniker certainly benefited from some finessing, and the action-packed Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) raked in $354m at the box office. Yet as great as Indy’s influence was on cinema, it might have had an even bigger one on video games. It inspired

<p>ITV’s political editor has helped explain our national crises, from the 2008 financial crash onwards. Could he also help solve them?<br></p><p>Two seconds earlier, it had been sheet rain and squally winds at the street festival in north London, but as Robert Peston took the stage with his band, Centrist Dad, the weather suddenly swerved back to sunshine, which gave the whole thing a surreal edge. What did these men (including Peston on vocals, John Wilson from Front Row on bass and Ed Balls from New Labour on drums) do, to get blessed by Zeus? What dense thicket of influences informs Peston’s performance, which is a little bit Bowie, a little bit Carly Rae Jepsen, a little bit Ross-from-Friends-in-a-school-musical? The broadcaster, author, journalist and fabulously idiosyncratic emphasiser of words is, of course, well connected (Ed Miliband and Yvette Cooper are also here), but he doesn’t strut like a well-connected person. He struts like a guy who really likes being in a band.</p>

<p><strong>Royal Academy, London<br></strong>His early conceptual work inspired the likes of Damien Hirst, but the RA has inexplicably focused on his cool and clinical representations of the ordinary stuff of modern life</p><p>It’s an achievement to stretch a single idea as thinly as this retrospective of Michael Craig-Martin does. You start by laughing with him, in his clever classics of 1970s conceptual art. You end by laughing at him and the Royal Academy for thinking that his later, gapingly empty paintings and videos can really fill up the main galleries at Burlington House with their re-workings of the same exhausted theme.</p><p>That theme is objects. Craig-Martin has spent decades drawing and painting things, the more modern and ordinary the better: safety pins, forks, iPhones, wheelie suitcases. He depicts them with a designer’s precise perspective in a cool, clinical style with clear lines and neon-bright colours.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/se

The Conservative party may not have provided a great government for Britain, but it was the source of a never-ending supply of scandals, which gave journalists something to write about and provided some confirmation-bias entertainment to people who like that sort of thing.

At the weekend the Sunday Times gave us “frockgate” (not their term) – the revelation that gifts of clothing to Keir Starmer’s wife had not originally been disclosed in the register of members’ interest.

Customise at will …</p><p>While corn on the cob is an autumn staple in our house (my girls love finding new flavours to roll the cobs in), I also love charring it and tossing it through salads. If you have a barbecue going, you can, of course, char the cobs first, then cut off the kernels, but otherwise I find this method easier. As it stands, this recipe is a proper hit – the flavours and textures go together so well – and it’s really versatile, too: add thin wedges of little gems or quartered soft-boiled eggs, or sprinkle over feta or sliced green jalapeños. Have a play and make it your own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/sep/17/charred-corn-chorizo-and-avocado-recipe-georgina-hayden">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A bead maker barely ages in 500 years in a subtle novel that wrestles with historic events while showing how much remains unchanged</p><p>Towards the end of Tracy Chevalier’s sparkling new book, heroine Orsola Rosso, a Venetian glassmaker, considers the rearing horse figurines her fellow artisans churn out for tourists. “Why reach for the familiar?” she chides, before acknowledging that she, too, is occasionally guilty of replicating old work rather than creating something wholly fresh. “More and more this was the case as she grew older and more jaded.”</p><p>It’s not inconceivable that Chevalier herself, now in her 60s, might have experienced similar misgivings. Certainly, it would account for an altogether unexpected element to this, her 11th novel. <em>The Glassmaker</em> shares much with its predecessors, whose crafty female protagonists – among them embroiders and quilt makers, weavers and printers – are called upon to wrestle with societal constraints at various points in his

As a new film, The Substance, considers our obsession with youth and good looks, writers reflect on how this has shaped their lives</p><p>This Friday, one of the most shocking films of the year opens – a blood-drenched body horror with an unusual theme for the genre: Hollywood’s impossible beauty standards. The Substance stars Demi Moore as 50-year-old actor who tries a mysterious procedure that claims to “unlock your DNA and a younger version of yourself”. Literally.
