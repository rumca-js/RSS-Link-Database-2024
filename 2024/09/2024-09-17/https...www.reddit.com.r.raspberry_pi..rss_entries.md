<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve installed every package I could find trying to get thumbnails to show up in file manager in Raspberry Pi OS. (Yes, I have gone into view, show thumbnails, etc). The problem isn’t that I can’t figure out how to display them, rather that it won’t show them. It would certainly be nice when looking through IMG_*.jpeg or *mp4 files. So I didn’t have to open every. Single. One. Just to find one thing. What am I missing? Should I just get a different file manager? I’ve installed ffmpeg thumbnailer packages, libthumbnailer packages, libmediascan packages, the Qt/C++ thumbnailer packages, tumbler packages, all the D-Bus thumbnailing service packages… Still no thumbnails in file manager. Can anyone help me get this sorted out? It’s a lot of work to do what seemingly should be one of the easiest things you can do.</p> <p>Thank you in advance for any help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooConfections9

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to make an auto clicker for my raspberry pi 4 with xdotool that will auto click the &#39;o&#39; key for a program.
