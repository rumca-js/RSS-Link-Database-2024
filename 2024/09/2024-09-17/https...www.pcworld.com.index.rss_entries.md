<p>One of the more annoying things about Windows 11 is that the operating system displays ads in the Start menu for promoted apps and services from the Microsoft Store. The good news is, you can turn this off.</p>



<p>To do this, all you have to do is open the Start menu, search for <strong>Settings</strong>, select <strong>Personalization</strong> in the left navigation, then scroll down to <strong>Start</strong> and click into it. Here, look for the setting labeled <strong>Show recommendations for tips, shortcuts, new apps, and more</strong> and toggle the button next to it to <strong>Off</strong>.</p>

They can even record while your car is parked, helping you keep tabs on your car while you’re away.</p>



<p>When choosing the best dash cam for your needs you should first consider if you want a front, front/interior, or front/rear model. Additionally, you’ll want to decide on how wide a viewing angle you’ll need. Then there are special features to take into account, such as voice control or parking assist.
