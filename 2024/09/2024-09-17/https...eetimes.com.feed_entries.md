						<p>Introduction  Powering field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) represents a challenge for power engineers due to their increasing number of logic cells, which increases complexity. In addition, these semiconductor devices are highly configurable, allowing designers to define the clock and phase-locked loop (PLL) frequencies, as well as configure the logic elements within them. Furthermore, defining the power [&#8230;]</p>
