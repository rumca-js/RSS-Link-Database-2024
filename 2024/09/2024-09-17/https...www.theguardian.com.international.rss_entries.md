<p>Unusually high turnout expected in what is also first vote since Indian PM stripped region of statehood five years ago</p><p>For the first time in almost 40 years, Bashir Ahmad Thokar, a 75-year-old apple farmer, cannot wait to cast his vote. In the Himalayan valleys and mountains of the Indian region of Kashmir, elections have long been deemed a tainted affair, marred by rigging, boycotts and violence. But as Kashmiris go to the polls on Wednesday to vote for their first regional assembly in a decade, this time there has been a palpable buzz.</p><p>“This is the first time since 1987 that the people of Kashmir are excited about the elections,” says Thokar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/18/kashmir-election-modi-india">Continue reading...</a>

The conversation was one of the few interviews Harris has done since becoming the Democratic nominee, and it served as an opportunity for her to reaffirm policies.</p><p>When asked about “where [she] sees the line in terms of aggression and defense” in regards to the war, she said that she supported the Biden administration’s one-time pause on the delivery of 2,000lb bombs to Israel as “leverage” that they “have had and used”, but that achieving a deal was the real means to ending the war.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/17/harris-n

<p>“We can’t crap our pants,” Deniz Undav had insisted and Stuttgart did not but nor did they win. Because if the German striker was right to say that “if you fear Real Madrid because it’s Real Madrid, you needn’t even fly”, if he had his moment here, heading in the goal that brought promise of a memorable night, and if he and his team mates were far from overawed on their return to this competition fifteen years later, actually emerging victorious against the club that consider it their own is another matter.</p><p>For much an enjoyable night of 37 shots and wide open spaces, Stuttgart were as good as their illustrious opponents, perhaps better. They went to the most emblematic arena of all and went behind to Kylian Mbappé’s first European goal for Madrid. But Undav had equalised, they had gone in search of more and they might have got it too. In the end, though, Real Madrid are, well, Real Madrid and so it was that with seven minutes left Antonio Rüdiger’s header from a corner tilte

<p>Ryan Murphy’s TV empire gets a new strand with a sharp look at the sad story of the NFL superstar turned murderer</p><p>Aaron Hernandez was football’s shooting star – the big, fast and tough receiver you couldn’t take your eyes off. Deployed as a tight end, the name for the double duty players on offense who block as well as catch passes, Hernandez quickly emerged as the nation’s best while winning a college championship at the University of Florida in 2009. After joining the NFL the following year at the tender age of 20, Hernandez helped evolve the tight end position from complementary to headlining role on the way to reaching the Super Bowl and signing a $40m contract extension. Ultimately, though, his penchant for self-destruction proved greater than his knack for wrecking game plans. In 2017 Hernandez was found dead at age 27 while serving life in prison for fatally shooting a close friend who played semi-pro ball. His spectacular fall from grace became the biggest media scand

<p>Marvin Harrison Jr recovered from a bumpy start in his second NFL game, while missed field goals have become a rarity</p><p>It is always satisfying to see shaky NFL narratives proven false shortly after they bubble up, especially when it concerns a first-round draft pick. The knives were out for Arizona’s rookie wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr fafter his one-catch debut against the Buffalo Bills in week one. Some assessments were unkind to say the least: “shockingly slow and uncertain” was one of the more gentle ones on social media. But some grace for a difficult debut was due considering how a fierce Bills defense limited his impact. On Sunday, he put in a redo for the record books as he torched the LA Rams with two touchdowns and 130 yards in the opening quarter, more than his father gained in any quarter in his Hall of Fame career.
