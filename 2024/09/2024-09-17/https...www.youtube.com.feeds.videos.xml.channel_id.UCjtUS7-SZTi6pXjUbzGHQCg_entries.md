Just one gigawatt is enough energy to power between 750,000 to a million US homes. Here in the United States, our largest wind farm is the Alta Wind Energy Center in California, which has been able to produce 1.5GW. But even the Alta facility is dwarfed by the Gansu Wind Farm in China: a 20 GW colossus and the biggest wind farm in the world. So how did it become home to the world’s biggest wind farm? Can we replicate this achievement elsewhere? And most importantly, why is a wind farm large enough to power an entire country sitting mostly idle?
