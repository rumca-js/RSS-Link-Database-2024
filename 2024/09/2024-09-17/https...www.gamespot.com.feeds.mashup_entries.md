Several visits and two years later, I'd saved up enough money to buy myself the console, no longer willing to be only a part-time player of the game I'd wanted: Capcom's Dead Rising. Nearly 20 years since then, it's been entertaining to discover that it still holds up as an endearing, open-world zombie game tha

<p>In Frostpunk 2, I was responsible for a growing population of desperate people, trying to forge a new life in a world that had frozen over. One of the city's factions pleaded that I, the steward, repeal a law that would require citizens to rotate relationships in order to increase childbirth, and instead enact a law that forced mandatory marriage. By my personal morals, neither law was the right one, but I was at the mercy of my people, the communities they had built, and the radical factions that had formed from extreme ideologies. This is what <em>they </em>wanted. Still, my doubt outweighed their request and I denied. In turn, that faction conducted a protest that would erupt into a civil war. Chaos ran rampant, tension rose, and the trust I had forged with my people diminished. I <em>knew</em> this would happen. After all, it's the fragile society I built, whether I liked it or not. After 30 hours in Frostpunk 2, to me, it was just another day as a steward attempting to mitigat

<p dir="ltr">The Plucky Squire is a game that will rightly receive a lot of attention for its eye-catching visual gimmick, which merges the worlds of 2D and 3D art around a clever story hook. But more than just its whizbang artistry, The Plucky Squire is a game that takes full advantage of its premise--telling a kid-friendly and heartfelt story, filling its well-realized world with lovable characters, and delivering constant surprises. It is a reminder, appropriately, to never judge a book by its cover.</p><p dir="ltr">You play as Jot, the titular "Plucky Squire" in a series of children's books of the same name. The series of picture books is popular enough to have inspired a large fan base and merch, which is absolutely believable given how playful and inviting it is. While Jot himself is the classic silent protagonist, the surrounding cast of characters are exuberant and frequently funny, and the world of Mojo itself, which the characters occupy, is colorful and imaginative.</p><p d

But so far the game has not invited Maleficent to join the competition, and we all know how she feels about being snubbed. Gameloft has announced Maleficent will join with a Limited-Time Event during Season 9, Part 2, and we have a first look at the trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">Maleficent is a Trickster racer, meaning her class specializes in disrupting other racers and has an enhanced speed boost ability. Her unique ability, Mistress of Evil, has two applications. The standard attack has her raise her staff to call down lightning on the track in front of her, and successful hits will gain her a flame. Under the charged version, collecting six flames will activate her Dragon form, transforming Maleficent and her kart into a dragon that flies (in autopilot) at increased speed, and takes out any racers in he

<p>HBO's The Last of Us Season 2 is set for release in 2025, but when during the year can fans expect the sophomore season? HBO programming boss Casey Bloys said in an interview that The Last of Us will return at some point in the first half of 2025.</p><p>Bloys <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/casey-bloys-hacks-emmy-win-harry-potter-series-euphoria-1236090121/">told Deadline</a> he expects The Last of Us Season 2 to be "in the Emmy window," which means at least six episodes of the season must be released by the assumed cutoff date of May 31, 2025 for consideration at the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards. Given the expectation by Bloys for The Last of Us Season 2 to be in the Emmy window, fans can expect it to be released before then.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_fSOMJxgVk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="93">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7_fSOMJxgVk?start=93" height="100%" width="100%
