<p>I was a graphic designer in a former life, and I still do a lot of photography for keyboard reviews. So, despite being a PC gamer, I prefer color-accurate IPS panels over speedier VA panels.</p>



<p>But today you can get the best of both worlds for cheap. Dell is currently selling a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-27-gaming-monitor-g2724d/apd/210-bhxc/monitors-monitor-accessories">fast 27-inch IPS gaming monitor for just $170</a>. (That’s over 40 percent off its MSRP of $300!)</p>



<p>We’ve featured the Dell G2724HD monitor before — in fact, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1965138/dell-g2724d-review.html">it scored an Editors’ Choice in our review</a>. With a 27-inch 2560×1440 screen that refreshes at an impressive 165Hz, it’s great for showing off extra detail in new 3D games without breaking the bank.</p>

<p>Whether it’s YouTube, Netflix, or Hulu, why stream video content on your phone when you can watch on your much bigger TV? With a Fire TV Stick, you can turn <em>any</em> TV into one that can stream movies and TV shows.</p>



<p>And right now, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-with-3rd-gen-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B08C1W5N87/">the Fire TV Stick is on sale for $25 at Amazon</a>, which is a real bargain compared to its normal $40 price.</p>



<p>Amazon’s Fire TV Stick is nothing more than a tiny little device that looks like a flash drive. You plug it into your TV’s HDMI port, then power it by connecting to a power outlet using the included USB cable. Then, connect it to your Wi-Fi network. Done!</p>

<p>Kensington’s first Thunderbolt 5 dock, the future of PC I/O, is here! Unfortunately, it’s just one part of the equation.</p>



<p>The Kensington SD5000T5 EQ Thunderbolt 5 Triple 4K Docking Station is the first Thunderbolt 5 dock I’ve seen inside PCWorld’s lab. Kensington will begin selling the dock today on Amazon for $399.99, a substantial premium to the majority of Thunderbolt 4 docks already on the market. (One exception is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2252127/kensington-sd5800t-thunderbolt-4-dock-review.html">Kingston’s SD5800T</a>, a premium Thunderbolt 4 dock).</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/office-ltsc-2024-is-now-available/ba-p/4244953">Microsoft announced</a> the release of the final version of Microsoft Office LTSC 2024, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneDrive, OneNote, and Microsoft Access.</p>



<p>LTSC stands for Long-Term Servicing Channel and it denotes a version that doesn’t receive feature updates for a long while. As described by Microsoft, it’s a “locked-in-time” version that gets <em>some</em> of the features that were released since the last LTSC release, and it gets five years of support from the time it’s released.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2410373/secure-boot-is-busted-on-pcs-from-dell-acer-intel-and-others.html">we reported on the PKfail vulnerability</a> in Secure Boot — a security issue that stems from hardware manufacturers shipping devices with known compromised software.</p>



<p>After digging deeper, the original security researchers have discovered that it’s a much bigger problem than even they had initially guessed.</p>



<p>In case you missed the original story, here’s a quick summary: The code that gets you past Secure Boot encryption (so you can load up software in a pre-boot environment) was leaked on an open repository back in 2022. Despite that being a known issue, manufacturers continued to ship devices with compromised security. In fact, many of them shipped with pre-production warnings like “DO NOT TRUST” st

<p>Overall, it’s a beneficial update for many users, one that brings several improvements and even a performance boost in some cases. But for some other unfortunate users, the update has brought issues and headaches, including serious problems like crashes.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of Ring security cameras and video doorbells is determined by more than their image quality; it’s also about how well they detect and respond to motion. Properly configured motion settings can make the difference between a system that enhances your peace of mind and one that overwhelms you with alerts; or worse, fails to notify you of critical events.</p>



<p>Ring’s motion settings are at the heart of this process, determining when, how, and how often you’re notified about activities around your home. Used strategically, they enable you to tailor your security system to your specific needs so that you get the most relevant alerts while minimizing unnecessary disruptions.</p>



<p>While the Ring app makes it easy to enable and disable motion detection and alerts on your Ring device, most other motion settings require a little digging to

<p>If Windows 11 no longer works properly, you can reset the operating system, download the installation files from the Microsoft cloud, and reinstall Windows 11. You can also restore your data in the process. </p>



<p>However, this requires a fast internet connection, as the operating system downloads all the required data from the internet. The advantages of this method are that you do not need an installation medium and can restore your data from the cloud. </p>

<p>Laptops powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon processors are clocking in at about 20 hours of battery life. Ditto for notebooks powered by Intel’s “Lunar Lake” chip. But isn’t that number way, way more than what the average user actually needs?</p>



<p>No. On the contrary, it’s probably one of the most significant advancements in laptop technology in years, and one that will likely save you money by extending the lifespan of your laptop well beyond what it was a few years ago — as well as just letting you work where you want.</p>
