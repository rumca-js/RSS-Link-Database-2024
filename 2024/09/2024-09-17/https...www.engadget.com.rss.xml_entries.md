<p>Discord is rolling out new end-to-end encryption for both audio and video calls on its platform. The tech will be applied to calls from DMs, group DMs, voice channels and Go Live streams. Discord detailed the tech and its goals for the end-to-end encryption (E2EE) in a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://discord.com/blog/meet-dave-e2ee-for-audio-video" data-original-link="https://discord.com/blog/meet-dave-e2ee-for-audio-video"><ins>blog post</ins></a>. Desktop and mobile clients already support the new upgrade, and the rest of the clients should be getting the feature next year.</p>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) alleges that SpaceX committed three safety violations by failing to follow its license requirements during two of its space launches in 2023. If the full fines are imposed, SpaceX faces a bill of $633,009, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-proposes-633009-civil-penalties-against-spacex">an FAA statement</a>.</p>
<p>The license violations are related to two separate SpaceX’s launches. The first two happened on June 18, 2023 as part of the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=psn-satria">PSN Satria Mission</a> that launched from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.

<p>The internet is so core to how modern life operates that it's easy to forget how much of the technology that went into building the world wide web has patent protections. And some of those patents are still being enforced today. Zynga may be learning that the hard way, as a court ruled last week that the gaming company infringed on IBM patents dating back to the pre-internet telecom platform <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_(online_service)" data-original-link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_(online_service)"><ins>Prodigy</ins></a> from the 1980s. As a result, Zynga could be facing damages of $44.9 million. IBM's "Method for presenting advertising in an interactive service" patent from 1993 accounts for $40 million of the recommended damages.</p>
<p>For anyone still playing the once-ubiquitous Zynga games, this decision shouldn't interrupt your game time. The company said in

<p>Cockle introduces the clip with an enthusiastic tease of the merpeople Geralt will battle in the film. “That’s right — he’s gonna cross swords with merpeople of all things!” Cockle exclaims in the clip. “Amazing stuff, it’s gonna be so cool.” Hey, can’t blame a voice actor for hyping their project.</p>

<p>Amazon is facing a class-action lawsuit that accuses the company of misleading pricing practices. The suit alleges that Amazon deceived shoppers by showing inflated list prices for Fire TVs, thus making discounts seem more significant than they actually were.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington and claims that the company regularly adopted this practice, calling it a &quot;persistent and uniform scheme.&quot; The suit alleges that Amazon created &quot;fake list prices&quot; for its own Fire TVs, making the apparent &quot;discounts&quot; deceptive.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It goes on to accuse the company of tricking its customers into buying Fire TVs by omitting &quot;critical information&quot; concerning the length of the sale and when the list price was actually in use.

<p>Logitech is revealing plenty of new gaming accessories and gear at Logi Play 2024, which is happening right now. Of the many new offerings from Logitech, two keyboards and two mice caught our eye.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the G Pro X TKL Rapid Wired Gaming Keyboard, a keyboard featuring magnetic analog switches, a first for the G Pro line. These switches have adjustable actuation points, rapid trigger functionality and key priority. In short, the keyboard lets you customize how hard presses need to be, has speedy key press recognition and the ability to prioritize certain keys when pressing two at once.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can also use the multi-point feature in the G Hub keyboard customization software to assign more than one command to a key depending on how far it’s pressed down. As the name suggests, this is a tenkeyless model (no number pad), and you can get it for $170 in November. The three available colors are black, white and pink.</p>

<p>It’s an unusual strategy, but Snap says it’s taking that approach because developers are, for now, best positioned to understand the capabilities and limitations of augmented reality hardware.

<p>Donald Trump, who previously <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162667/bitcoin-scams-donald-trump">called Bitcoin a scam</a>, has launched a new cryptocurrency venture called World Liberty Financial. &quot;Crypto is one of those things we have to do,&quot; he said in an interview on X. &quot;Whether we like it or not, I have to do it.&quot; The news comes just a day after a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/16/us/trump-shooting-news?smid=url-share#heres-the-latest-on-the-investigation">likely assassination attempt</a> against Trump at his Florida golf course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Apple Watch has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-09-iwatch-hands-on.html">been around for ten years</a>. Looking at pictures of the device then, it might not seem like much has changed — even the apps drawer seems identical. But subtly and quietly, the Apple Watch – the company’s first new product line of the post-Steve Jobs era – has evolved to become capable of so much more today. Over the last few years, there have been some big leaps forward for the Apple Watch’s featureset, up to and including wrist-based ECG and heart-rate readings that were once the purview of science fiction. We’ve heard many testimonials, mostly from Apple at its events, about how the Apple Watch has saved lives — whether it be by detection of a fall or atrial fibrillation. Smartwatches as a category have matured and found their place, it seems, and the Apple Watch has carved out a comfy spot within the space.</p>

<p>After years of scrutiny over its handling of teen safety on its platform, Meta is introducing a new type of account that will soon be required for all teens under 16 on Instagram. The new “teen accounts” add more parental supervision tools and automatically opt teens into stricter privacy settings that can only be adjusted with parental approval.</p>
<p>The changes are unlikely to satisfy Meta’s toughest critics, who have argued that the company puts its own profits ahead of teens’ safety and wellbeing.  But the changes will be significant for the app’s legions of younger users who will face new restrictions on how they use the app.</p>

<p>Apple expanded its AirPod family with two new models last week. We’ve now tested out the AirPods 4 — and a second version with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) — and <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html">we have some thoughts</a>. Improved sound quality and some advanced features are the key additions, but you’re more likely to notice the redesigned shape for keeping the buds more firmly (and comfortably) lodged in ears.</p>

<p>Intel is turning its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies, into an independent subsidiary. The company has revealed its plan in a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1710/a-message-from-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-to-employees">note to employees</a> from its CEO Pat Gelsinger, published over a month after Intel disclosed that it&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-will-cut-over-15000-jobs-in-a-sweeping-cost-cutting-effort-220951016.html">cutting 15 percent of its workforce</a>. Intel is laying off more than 15,000 people as part of its $10 billion cost-reduction plan to regain financial stability following a second-quarter net loss of $1.6 billion. Gelsinger explained in his new memo that turning the foundry into a subsidiary &quot;will unlock important benefits,&quot; particularly the ability to evaluate and take external funding directly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since 2022, Amazon has held a second <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Prime Day</a> of sorts in October and that sale event is coming back this year, too. Prime Big Deal Days returns on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-big-deal-days-dates-announced-the-fall-prime-day-sale-returns-on-october-8-and-9-050356195.html">October 8 and 9</a>, but we’re already starting to see some decent deals pop up across Amazon’s site. As per usual, most of the deals we expected to see on October Prime Day will be exclusively for Prime members — and some of the early Prime Day deals we’re seeing now have followed suit.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a Prime membership, don’t fret too much — there are always a few discounts available for all shoppers. However, if you pay the $139 annual fee for Prime, now’s the time to put it to even better use. These are the best October Prime day tech deals we’ve found ahead of Prime Bi
