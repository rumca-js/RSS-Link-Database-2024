All Possible Futures' The Plucky Squire is unassuming at first. The tale of Jot and his friends, Violet and Thrash, plays out like your typical fantasy stories, with the evil sorcerer Humgrump foiled again. However, things quickly take a turn when the latter discovers the truth behind their story and removes Jot.

Thus begins a different adventure, one where our hero must leverage the real world of Sam's desk to stop Humgrump. However, The Plucky Squire is more than just a hybrid 2D/3D action adventure with platforming, top-down hack-and-slash combat, and sequences that delve into other genres like shoot 'em ups and turn-based RPGs.

It's also a tale about stories and how they impact people's lives. If the atmosphere doesn't evoke memories of a bygone time, aided by stunning visuals and presentation, then the gameplay delivers a tight experience with plenty of variety.

From a nearly-forgotten IP after the underwhelming Dead Rising 4 to an incredible resurrection with its remaster, the Dead Rising franchise looks better than ever. Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster isn't quite a remake and goes beyond being a simple remaster, but offers some significant leaps over the original.

These include quality-of-life features like phone calls from Otis no longer being interrupted, full voice acting (with nine languages supported), auto-save, and a fast-forward function. There's even a new Standard control scheme for easier execution of techniques and moving while aiming (though Classic controls are still available).

That's not even delving into the visuals, which benefit from improved textures, facial expressions, and more on top of 4K/60 FPS support. Here are 15 of the biggest differences between Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster and the 2006 original. The former is out on September 19th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.

Given the effort that the developer has put into Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, one has to wonder (or hope) if the franchise may finally have a future again- and if this remaster is any indication, it absolutely should. 

The beloved 2006 classic has aged gracefully, as evidenced by this enhanced re-release, and though its many quality-of-life changes do blunt some of its edges, it is, ultimately, also an undeniably captivating gameplay experience. At the end of the day, it's just spectacular to have Dead Rising back among the living again.
