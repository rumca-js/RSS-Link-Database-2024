Everyone knows, big TVs are EXPENSIVE. At least, that's what Samsung and LG and Sony want you to think. According to TCL, big TV's don't have to be expensive. We got this 98" TV open box from Best Buy for less than $1500 bucks. But what's the catch? Is it OLED? Is it VA? Is it made out of several smaller TV's that no one wants? Would you be better off with a smaller, but more luxurious TV? You think we're gonna tell you that here? Of course not, you gotta watch the video!
