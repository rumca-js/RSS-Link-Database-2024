As a high schooler in 2006, I spent many months and what little money I had renting screen time with an Xbox 360 in a mall store that had dozens of TVs and consoles available for use at hourly rates. Several visits and two years later, I'd saved up enough money to buy myself the console, no longer willing to be only a part-time player of the game I'd wanted: Capcom's Dead Rising. Nearly 20 years since then, it's been entertaining to discover that it still holds up as an endearing, open-world zombie game that undoubtedly has its flaws. Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster isn't a new entry in the series I hope we one day get, but it's a fun return to the roots of a series that has a unique voice and, for better and worse, strange design choices.

Grab your henchmen or assemble your team for Fortnite's new Limited time mode. Up to 32 players. You'll either be assigned Doom’s Henchmen or Allies of the Avengers.

Doom’s Henchmen: your goal is to collect all six Arcane Artifacts. Once you’ve collected them all, your adversaries will no longer be able to respawn. Eliminate every hero and you’ll emerge victorious!

Avengers: your goal is to take down Doom’s forces before they collect the Artifacts. Doom’s Henchmen have a large number of respawns altogether — reach victory once you + your fellow Avengers have depleted all their reinforcements.

It's the Day of Doom.
