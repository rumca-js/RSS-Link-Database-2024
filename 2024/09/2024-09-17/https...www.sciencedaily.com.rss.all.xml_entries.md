Fruit flies use vision to head toward interesting things, but also to stay steady during flight. To accomplish this, the eyes need to fixate on the visual background while noticing objects that might indicate food or danger. Using a device that lets flies interact with a virtual environment, biologists have discovered that Mojave Desert fruit flies fixate on an object for balance and stability while also orienting toward it as an interesting resource, while common urban flies fixate on the background but move toward the object using rapid glances. Fruit flies are often used in experiments probing visual perception and processing. The finding that not all species of fruit fly navigate their environment the same way expands the possibilities for what scientists can learn.

The process of food intake appears to be organized at the cellular level like a relay race: during eating, the baton is passed between different teams of neurons until we have consumed the appropriate amount of energy. Through this complex mechanism, the brain likely ensures that we neither eat too little nor too much. Malfunctions of this process may lead to eating disorders such as anorexia or binge eating.

Van Gogh's brushstrokes in 'The Starry Night' create an illusion of sky movement so convincing it led researchers to wonder how closely it aligns with the physics of real skies. Marine sciences and fluid dynamics specialists analyzed the painting to uncover what they call the hidden turbulence in the artwork. They used brushstrokes to examine the shape, energy, and scaling of atmospheric characteristics of the otherwise invisible atmosphere and used the relative brightness of the varying paint colors as a stand-in for the kinetic energy of physical movement.

## Getting to the root of the problem: Intensive diabetes treatment reduces gum disease inflammation

A recent study reveals that intensive diabetes treatment can improve periodontal disease inflammation. Researchers found that two weeks of intensive diabetes treatment under hospitalization for patients with type 2 diabetes significantly improved not only blood sugar control but also PISA, an indicator of gum disease inflammation. Furthermore, the improvement in PISA was related to factors such as insulin secretion capacity and the severity of diabetes complications and comorbidities before diabetes treatment. These findings suggest that early intervention in diabetes is crucial for improving gum disease in diabetic patients.
