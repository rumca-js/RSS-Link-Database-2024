"I would say family and part of that 'first-gen experience' [shaped me]...It shaped me to be a hard worker and to aspire to large things because not only was it my goal at this point, but it was also my parents' aspiration." â€“ Zaida Hernandez, Engineer, Lunar Architecture Team, NASA's Johnson Space Center
