(Yes, I have gone into view, show thumbnails, etc). The problem isn\u2019t that I can\u2019t figure out how to display them, rather that it won\u2019t show them. It would certainly be nice when looking through IMG_*.jpeg or *mp4 files. So I didn\u2019t have to open every. Single. One. Just to find one thing. What am I missing? Should I just get a different file manager? I\u2019ve installed ffmpeg thumbnailer packages, libthumbnailer packages, libmediascan packages, the Qt/C++ thumbnailer packages, tumbler packages, all the D-Bus thumbnailing service packages\u2026 Still no thumbnails in file manager. Can anyone help me get this sorted out? It\u2019s a lot of work to do what seemingly should be one of the easiest things you can do.</p> <p>Thank you in advance for any help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooConfections9", "id": 1164363, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fjarsu/thumbnails_for_multimedia_files_how", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "source_obj__id": 470, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Thumbnails.
