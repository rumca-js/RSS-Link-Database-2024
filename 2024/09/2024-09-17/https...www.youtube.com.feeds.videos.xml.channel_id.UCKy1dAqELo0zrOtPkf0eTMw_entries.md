Frostpunk 2 reviewed by Dan Stapleton on PC.
Building up multiple colonies, researching technologies, and passing laws in Frostpunk 2 is quite the act of plate-spinning. Just about anything you do is bound to make one of your city’s factions angry at you, and a powerful storm can literally and figuratively freeze your whole economy. This is a city-building sequel that might have lost some of the intimacy of the original by thinking bigger, but what it’s gained through its ambitious philosophy of reinvention rather than iteration means you can play it immediately after the original and not feel like you’ve done most of this before.

## The Penguin Spoiler-Free Review

The Penguin, reviewed by Erik Adams.

It’s tempting to pat The Penguin on the back for at least trying something. But that’s the type of patronizing gesture that would cause Colin Farrell to sneer through the layers of prosthetics that transform him into Oswald “Oz” Cobb. A highlight in small doses in The Batman, Oz withers in the spotlight of The Penguin – when he’s not overshadowed by ally-turned-enemy-turned-ally-turned-enemy-again Sofia Falcone, played to the hilt by Cristin Milioti. The limited series worships at the altars of The Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface, The Sopranos, and Breaking Bad, but Sofia’s family are no Corleones, Oz is no Tony, and in these eight episodes, they’re not given the time or space to get anywhere close to those crime-drama landmarks. The Batman was overstuffed, too, but at least it had a solid, straightforward mystery at its core for everyone to orbit. The mob drama being built around Oz requires something grander and more operatic to succeed. Unfortu

The Plucky Squire reviewed by Logan Plant on PlayStation 5, also available on Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

At its heights, The Plucky Squire is a beautiful Zelda-inspired adventure filled with brilliant wordplay-packed puzzles. Jot’s ability to manipulate his own storybook from both the outside and within result in clever dimension-hopping mechanics and solutions that make each problem a joy to unpack. While genuinely funny at times, its wordy script often gets in the way of the action and occasionally spoils a puzzle’s solution before it even begins. It also drags in its drawn-out final act, as the adventure continues a couple hours after it’s already used up all its best ideas. But prior to that late stumble, The Plucky Squire is full of surprises, breaking up its puzzles with cute minigame homages to classic video game genres and fun sections that take Jot outside of the pages of his story.

Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown reviewed by Luke Reilly on PC. Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.


"Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is far and away the most ambitious driving game that developer KT Racing has ever put together, but it’s plagued with problems. Forced online requirements that feel needlessly punitive towards solo players, inconsistent and non-adjustable AI difficulty levels, a stale car list, and chore-like progression all conspire to undermine an otherwise robust driving model and eye-catching open world. The former home of the WRC series has come out swinging with Solar Crown, but unfortunately the studio may have flown a little too close to the sun."

Enotria: The Last Song reviewed by Jarrett Green on PC, also available on PlayStation 5.

Aside from the fundamentals of combat, Enotria: The Last Song really tries to step outside of the box when it comes to dressing up the standard soulslike. The sun-drenched environments and wild, Italian folklore-inspired character designs are a real breath of fresh air straight from Italy’s Alps. Combat is fun, even when the difficulty spikes unexpectedly and despite the bloat of many, many systems that govern all of the more nuanced abilities and stats. The unapproachability of its RPG systems, and the wonky performance when a smooth frame rate matters the most are what really prevent Enotria from taking center stage.
