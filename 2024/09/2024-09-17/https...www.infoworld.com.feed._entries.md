<p>Concerns about C++ memory safety soon could be in the past. The <a href="https://cppalliance.org/#mission">C++ Alliance</a>, a charity whose mission is to make the C++ language accessible and useful, is working to add memory safety features to C++, through its <a href="https://safecpp.org/draft.html">Safe C++ Extensions proposal</a>. </p>



<p>The alliance intends to submit the Safe C++ Extensions proposal to the ISO for inclusion in the C++ standard.</p>



<p>Partnering with engineer Sean Baxter, the C++ Alliance describes its plan as a “revolutionary” proposal. “This collaboration marks a significant milestone in the C++ ecosystem, as the need for safe code has never been more pressing,” all

<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">Generative AI</a> depends on data to build responses to user queries. Training <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709489/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs) uses huge volumes of data—for example, OpenAI’s GPT-3 used the <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/overview">CommonCrawl</a> data set, which stood at 570 gigabytes and 400 billion tokens. But these data sets, while massive, are snapshots in time that cannot respond to queries around events happening today. AI responses can also include hallucinations, where informa
