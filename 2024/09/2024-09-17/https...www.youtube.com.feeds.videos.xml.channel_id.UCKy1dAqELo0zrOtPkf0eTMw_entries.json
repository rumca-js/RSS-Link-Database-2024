They must then eliminate every hero to emerge victorious. \n\nAvengers' goal is to take down Doom's forces before they collect the Artifacts, achieving victory once Doom's reinforcements are eliminated.\n\n#Fortnite #Marvel #Gaming", "id": 1160895, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELqBtOJ87A", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/oELqBtOJ87A/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Fortnite x Marvel - Official Day of Doom LTM Trailer", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-17T13:12:16+00:00", "description": "Check out the final Transformers One trailer for the upcoming CG-animated film featuring the voice talents of Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Steve Buscemi with Laurence Fishburne and Jon Hamm.\n\nTransformers One is the untold origin story of Optimus Prime and Megatron, better known as sworn enemies, but once were friends bonded like brothers who changed the fate of Cybertron forever.\n\nTransformers One, directed by Josh Cooley, opens in theaters on September 20, 2024.\n\n#Transformers #Movies #IGN", "id": 1160896, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ghKIovlT1w", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/0ghKIovlT1w/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Transformers One - Official Final Trailer (2024) Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-17T13:00:52+00:00", "description": "Here's your look at the announcement trailer for Lord of Nazarick, an upcoming mobile turn-based RPG based on the Overlord anime.
