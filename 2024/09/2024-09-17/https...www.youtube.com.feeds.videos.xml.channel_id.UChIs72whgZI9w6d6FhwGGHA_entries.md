Hardware news for the past week or two talks Sony PlayStation 5 Pro (PS5 Pro) pricing issues and spec basics, Noctua's NH-D15 G2 'rattle' fix and excellent customer service, rumors of Intel Arrow Lake, and more. We also cover CHIPS Act funding for Intel potentially getting delayed and Microsoft layoffs. In positive news, this past week we posted two reviews of cases we found to be of great quality and thermal performance. Those are linked below.
