I\u2019m a huge fan of card games and board games, but a lot of my group has moved away, so I mainly play solo games or with my GF. I\u2019m usually not a fan of games that require too much set up, a board and a couple decks of cards are my max as I typically only have an hour or 2 to play.</p> <p>Games I love are Marvel Champions, Arkham LCG, Cascadia, Pandemic: Fall of Rome, Dune: imperium </p> <p>I love deck construction and deck building, and definitely strategy. She\u2019s a fan of streamlined games, loves cascadia because of the animal theming and the type of strategy it requires. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gillsinmymouth\"> /u/Gillsinmymouth </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fj0xch/easy_games_to_get_to_the_table/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fj0xch/easy", "id": 1161380, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fj0xch/easy_games_to_get_to_the_table", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Easy games to get to the table?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-17T13:41:57+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fizkwn/archaeologists_believe_this_bronze_age_board_game/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/Y0aBwInokC2QMXkNhvtRpREgl-0x1B5iDa9_w8vqfI0.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=982e5291aa97c415cf60d6f153f198c8c81aa490\" alt=\"Archaeologists believe this Bronze Age board game is the oldest yet found\" title=\"Archaeologists believe this Bronze Age board game is the oldest yet found\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/13curseyoukhan\"> /u/13curseyoukhan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/archaeologists-believe-this-bronze-age-board-game-is-the-oldest-yet-found/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fizkwn/archaeologists_believe_this_bronze_age_board_game/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 1161004, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fizkwn/archaeologists_believe_this_bronze_age_board_game", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Y0aBwInokC2QMXkNhvtRpREgl-0x1B5iDa9_w8vqfI0.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=982e5291aa97c415cf60d6f153f198c8c81aa490", "title": "Archaeologists believe this Bronze Age board game is the oldest yet found", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-17T13:04:06+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My group (somewhat) recently has been getting into, exploring, and really enjoying the world of 18xx games and all its various permutations.

As the title says, I&#39;m looking for great engine builders that don&#39;t take more than 1 hour and a half at most, since me and my friends enjoy the living hell out of engine builders or games with some elements of engine building like Terra Mystica, Arnak, Terraforming Mars, Through the Ages etc, but don&#39;t have enough time to finish 1 all the way through. Currently Saint Petersburg and It&#39;s a Wonderful World are our go-to&#39;s for this much time, but we&#39;re looking to expand our collection.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/InsurgentTatsumi\"> /u/InsurgentTatsumi </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fil0ky/best_engine_builders_in_under_1_hour_30/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fil0ky/best_engine_builders_in_under_1_hour_30/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1157629, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fil0ky/best_engine_builders_in_under_1_hour_30", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Best engine builders in under 1 hour 30?", "vote": 0}]
