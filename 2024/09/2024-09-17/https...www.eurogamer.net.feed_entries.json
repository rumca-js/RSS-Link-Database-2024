Last week, my X/Twitter timeline was packed with value comparisons presented with an increasing level of mania. Is the latest Sony console so overpriced that a PC may actually offer more for your money? From my perspective, there are a couple of ways you can look at this. Firstly, are the costs of console gaming rising so much that a gaming PC is no longer such an expensive alternative? That's a legitimate concern and worth some discussion. However, the actual argument seems to be that potential Pro buyers should opt for a PC <em>instead</em> and for me, that's a less plausible idea. Both formats play games, but fundamentally they are very different things - and believe it or not, potential Pro users may already own a gaming PC and still want a Pro... or simply don't want a PC at all!</p> ", "id": 1161267, "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-vs-pc-value-comparisons-are-hard-to-take-seriously-but-the-future-of-console-pricing-is-another-matter", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/a53e4f9390533d7070704a70a9940df8cc329e6d-topaz-cgi-4x-copy.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "PS5 Pro vs PC value comparisons are less important than a potentially bleak future for console pricing", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-17T13:26:06+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/frostpunk-2-cinematic-opening-screenshot-showing-elderly-gentleman.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>Microsoft has revealed the second wave of Xbox Game Pass titles for September.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-september\">Read more</a></p>", "id": 1160906, "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-september", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/frostpunk-2-cinematic-opening-screenshot-showing-elderly-gentleman.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Here's our next batch of Xbox Game Pass titles for September", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-17T13:00:00+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Evershine_KV_Final.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>The next game from the My Time At Portia developer is a confirmed <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know\">Switch 2</a> release.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-gets-first-confirmed-release-in-my-time-at-portia-sequel\">Read more</a></p>", "id": 1160438, "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-gets-first-confirmed-release-in-my-time-at-portia-sequel", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Evershine_KV_Final.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Switch 2 gets first confirmed release in My Time At Portia sequel", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-17T12:42:59+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/The-Remarkable-Life-of-Ibelin-trailer-screenshot-showing-Steens-character-recieving-a-kiss-in-game.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>Sundance audience award-winning documentary The Remarkable Life of Ibelin - which tells the story of quadriplegic <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft\">World of Warcraft</a> player Mats Steen - is set to debut on <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix\">Netflix</a> next month.</p><p>Norwegian gamer Steen battled the degenerative disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and passed away in 2014 aged 25.
