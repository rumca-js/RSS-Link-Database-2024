Several visits and two years later, I'd saved up enough money to buy myself the console, no longer willing to be only a part-time player of the game I'd wanted: Capcom's Dead Rising. Nearly 20 years since then, it's been entertaining to discover that it still holds up as an endearing, open-world zombie game that undoubtedly has its flaws. Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster isn't a new entry in the series I hope we one day get, but it's a fun return to the roots of a series that has a unique voice and, for better and worse, strange design choices.\n\n#gaming #DeadRising #gamespot", "id": 1164425, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zT5T97gXDc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "source_obj__id": 127, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/0zT5T97gXDc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Review", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-17T20:30:10+00:00", "description": "Tune in for the fifth annual Games Devs of Color Direct at 1PM PT on September 18th, which is packed with new announcements from dozens of amazing games by creators of color.
