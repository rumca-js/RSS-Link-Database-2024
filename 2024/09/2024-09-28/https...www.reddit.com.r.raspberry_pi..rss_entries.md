<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;m not really that proficient with Linux and I just don&#39;t know what the issue is. I&#39;m using my Raspberry Pi for a NAS, so I have two hard drives connected and I manage them using OpenMediaVault. The setup is quite easy and I&#39;ve already done it twice because of a critical issue I couldn&#39;t resolve. After setting it up, I just let it do its thing. Sometimes I update things or run commands when I get a notification to do so. Recently, I couldn&#39;t access my drives anymore, so I logged in to OpenMediaVault and there was a configuration change that I had to accept. But it didn&#39;t work and showed me a very long error, something like a 500 - internal server error. I thought, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s run sudo apt-get upgrade and update. Maybe there&#39;s an issue.&quot; Here comes the real issue, I guess, because I got: E: Method http has died unexpectedly! E: Sub-process http received signal 4.</p> <p>I tried to resolve this issue u

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not familiar with GUIs and could use some guidance on where to start.</p> <p>I have this project idea to make an ISS tracker. For the first part of the project, I want to create a GUI using python. It needs to show the ISS livestream in the background while also having a menu button in the corner for adjusting certain settings for the device. (the tracking part will be some motors that point an arm towards where the ISS is relative to your location. The settings will be to switch between targets, or between livestreams)</p> <p>After trying to learn some stuff from youtube videos and chatGPT, predictably, chatGPT just keeps hallucinating when i run into errors.</p> <p>So far i&#39;ve tried using the pyQT and webbrowser libraries, which technically works, as I can open the browser with a youtube link. But since the browser and the GUI made by pyQT are in separate windows, this doesn&#39;t really do what I need, since the device will only have a
