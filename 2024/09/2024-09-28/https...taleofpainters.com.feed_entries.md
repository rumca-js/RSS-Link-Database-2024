<p>A while ago, Squidmar and Andy Wardle from Cult of Paint sat down and uncovered changes in the current Citadel Colour range Games Workshop didn’t tell us about. And it’s not just them, I've ALSO noticed that the Citadel paints I've bought recently seem different from before. In this video, I'll investigate and tell you what you need to know now if you have Citadel paints in your collection. Is it a change for the better or worse, we’ll find out together in this video.</p>
