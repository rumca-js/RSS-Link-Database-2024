Ever since we launched <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-dysons-non-weird-headphones-and-lenovos-thinkpad-x1-carbon-140049529.html">the first of these roundups</a> last month, companies have relentlessly launched new hardware each week, contributing to a growing pile of products for our team to review.

<p>X only has to pay one last fine in Brazil to get its services reinstated, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-27/brazil-court-says-musk-must-pay-1-9-million-to-lift-ban-on-x"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/27/elon-musks-x-expected-back-online-in-brazil-ahead-of-elections.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. Supreme Court R has ordered the company to pay 10 million Reais, or around $1.9 million, for its non-compliance with Brazil&#39;s court order for two days.
