<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Full disclaimer, it&#39;s entirely possible I&#39;m just dumb and missing something obvious. I recently bought Terraforming Mars and it comes with three decks of cards, but I&#39;m not sure how exactly I&#39;m supposed to store those decks. There&#39;s no box or tray for the cards. The game comes with two extra empty plastic bags. Are those for the cards? Even then, that&#39;s only two bags for three decks. How are you intended to store the cards? I can&#39;t imagine you&#39;re just intended to have them sliding around freely.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JustSayLOL"> /u/JustSayLOL </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1frppyn/storing_cards_for_terraforming_mars/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1frppyn/storing_cards_for_terraforming_mars/">[comments]</a></span>

My blue action token would now flip over from a package to a die symbol..

Maybe we&#39;re getting rules wrong, but we&#39;ve read through and it seems like we&#39;re doing it right. Can anyone give me some strategy tips please?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Lately a few of my less than great performances have been due to this:</p> <p>In 7 Wonders Architects, everyone would be stocking up blues and greens or winning wars while I improve on stuff related to building and vice versa. </p> <p>In Splendor (which I have been starting to get the hang of), while I try to get the big fish, everyone else start to look at nobles. Again, vice versa.</p> <p>It&#39;s like I&#39;m so stuck on this strategy that seems to be the meta (at least from what I read), only to be beaten down by quickly emerging counter strategies. I could use some way to achieve this flexibility (which I can see an enticing real life skill as well). </p> <p>I can start by looking at every single opponent per turn, but that would mean taking in so much info. Plus, I may not have all the experience to perfectly counter everything. The best I can do is to maximize from my own strategy, but that may not have been enough.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3

There&#39;s a day and night cycle, and you need to build a campfire and be near it for the night cycle or get some sort of penalty.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!! Yesterday, I played a round of libertalia with my friends at school and when I got home I realised 37 Wind Nymph was missing from my automata deck so I went back to school to find it but it wasn&#39;t there.</p> <p>Is the Automata Deck (the purple and orange cards with the token symbols at the back of the card) not supposed to have a wind nymph card in the first place? Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Xazhariel"> /u/Xazhariel </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fr3fl6/libertalia_missing_cards/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fr3fl6/libertalia_missing_cards/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I invited some people over to play a very specific board game. The theme isn’t for everyone. In fact, some might even say it is very problematic. But hey I love it and think it’s a blast. </p> <p>I invited someone from work. They then say they are coming with their wife (who was not invited). I would typically be okay with this but wife brings us over the player count and I am 100% positive that she is going to HATE the game and judge me for it. So now I’m thinking I should not have invited a work person to play this controversial game with me. </p> <p>I made up an excuse and told the person we have to play another time because something came up. I’m still playing with others who I know will love the game and we will have a good time.</p> <p>Am I in the wrong?</p> <p>Game is Spartacus: blood and treachery. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lastchancefancydance"> /u/Lastchancefancydance </a> <br/> <
