  <p id="ckUeIq">Former news anchor Brian Williams is in talks to host an Amazon Prime election night special, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/amazon-brian-williams-election-night-special-streaming-1236158601/">reports <em>Variety</em></a><em>. </em>The show would apparently be a “non-partisan discussion” as election night news comes in and could include multiple guests.</p>
<p id="t2s2zt">Williams has been out of the news game for a while. He lost his role as anchor of NBC’s<em> Nightly News</em> after some of his reporting was <a href="https://www.theve

  <p id="bCvUgO">Meta is restricting links on Threads, Instagram, and Facebook that lead to Ken Klippenstein’s <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/read-the-jd-vance-dossier">newsletter containing a JD Vance dossier</a> that was allegedly nabbed in an Iranian hack of the Trump campaign. The company has apparently removed posts containing the link and is seemingly blocking links to PDFs of the dossier being hosted elsewhere. </p>

  <p id="W8Q0h7">This week, I’ve been slowly catching up on <em>Dark Matter;</em> I’m about 20 hours into <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> on the Switch; and I’m still trying to work a trip to the movie theater into my schedule to see <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. </em></p>

  <p id="3RLPEv">Apple, the most valuable company in the world, will have to work this weekend to meet a legal deadline on Monday. That’s after Magistrate Judge Thomas S.

  <p id="5BaWP4">The portability of a laptop is nice and all, but oftentimes, the tradeoff is a smaller screen that can feel cramped if you’ve got a lot of tabs open. Thankfully, there are laptops like <strong>Samsung’s Galaxy Book4 Edge</strong>, which offers a 16-inch display in a thin and lightweight package. It typically starts at $1,499.99, but right now, Best Buy is selling it with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for just <a href="https://howl.me/cnbqQ4ONPK3">$999.99 ($450 off</a

  <p id="tb4Vxk">Now that <em>Balatro</em> is out on mobile, I wanted to see what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">all the fuss</a> was about. And while it’s a great game, its tutorial doesn’t do the best job of setting you up for the kind of success necessary to hook you. In my first few hours, though I was completing the objectives laid out, it felt like I was stumbling my way to success instead of achieving it through strategy. Onboarding was a bit too abrupt, focused on the barebones of how to play instead of blending that with tips on how to play <em>effectively. </em>With t

  <p id="nsqNol">All around Meta’s Menlo Park campus, cameras stared at me. I’m not talking about security cameras or my fellow reporters’ DSLRs. I’m not even talking about smartphones. I mean Ray-Ban and Meta’s smart glasses, which Meta hopes we’ll all — one day, in some form — wear.</p>
<p id="45J8mo">I visited Meta for this year’s Connect conference, where just about every hardware product involved cameras.
