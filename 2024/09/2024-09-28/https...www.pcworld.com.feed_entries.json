This type of malware encrypts files on your PC so that you can\u2019t access them\u2014unless you pay the attacker to unlock the data. In other words, your files are held hostage until you cough up the demanded ransom, unless you\u2019re able to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2256644/how-to-prevent-or-survive-a-ransomware-attack.html\">survive the ransomware attack</a> using other means. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>CBS News recently ran a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scattered-spider-blackcat-hackers-ransomware-team-up-60-minutes/\">cautionary segment on the Scattered Spider ransomware group</a>, underscoring just how much damage ransomware can do\u2014so it pays to be prepared.
