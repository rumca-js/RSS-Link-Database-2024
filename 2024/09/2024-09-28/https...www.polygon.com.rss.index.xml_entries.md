<p class="has-text-align-none">After being left feeling deflated by the first episode of <em>Nier: Automata Ver1.1a, </em>an adaptation of the outstanding video game from Yoko Taro and PlatinumGames,<em> </em>I didn’t think I’d return to it.<strong> </strong>It played like what a cynic would expect: an almost one-to-one recreation but with uglier 3D animation; it felt like it was missing something. It didn’t get much of a chance to make a case for itself; even with its sparks of promise, the first half of the show was plagued by <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-0

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Train to Busan</em>, <em>The Wailing</em>, <em>A Tale of Two Sisters</em>, <em>I Saw the Devil </em>— the Korean horror movies that have crossed over and popped in the States have been <em>intense</em>, often sprawling films that teeter on the edge of thriller. Their nightmares linger.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So <em>Sleep</em>, now in U.S. theaters, was an immediate surprise, simply by being a Korean horror movie with a playful rhythm. Think the heightened naturalism of Bong Joon-ho’s <em>Parasite </em>or <em>The Host</em>… but weirder. The feature debut of

From the floating vantage point, you can see the ongoings of neighbors as they start their days. The view of the camera helps set the scene for the movie, but its voyeuristic gaze into the lives of its characters is unsettling. I’m worried that playing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/the-sims-4/12679"><em>The Sims 4</em></a> warped me into the kind of person who looked at my neighbors like that.&nbsp;</p>
