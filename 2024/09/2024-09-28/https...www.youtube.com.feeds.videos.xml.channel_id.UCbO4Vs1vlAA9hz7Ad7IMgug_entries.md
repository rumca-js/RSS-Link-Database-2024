One of the oldest Blood Bowl squads is getting a 2024 update as the Chaos Dwarfs come marching onto the pitches of the Old World with two new Positional players and a new Star Player! I'm joined by BKBBL Veteran Mike to break down what's new and different with this Squad of fire-breathing, backstabbing, bull-centauring psychopaths. 

Thanks to Games Workshop for the complimentary advance copy of the Boxes to review.
