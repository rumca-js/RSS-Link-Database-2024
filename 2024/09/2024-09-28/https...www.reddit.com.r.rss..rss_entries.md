## Anyone using the scrolling news text app for TICKR? Why do some RSS feeds (like the New York Times) let you hover over the title and see a preview of the the article, but rss feeds like reddit (that have self texts) don't?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have tried a lot of Chrome extensions that claim to search the current page for available RSS feeds. But the massive majority of them are not really &quot;searching&quot; at all, they just look for the &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; tag. Hardly worthwhile since basically any extension can find that.</p> <p>What I&#39;ve had a lot of luck and sastisfaction with is a userscript:</p> <p><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/373252-rss-show-site-all-rss">https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/373252-rss-show-site-all-rss</a></p> <p>This thing has identified functional RSS feeds on all sorts of sites that no other extension could. I think it&#39;s parsing various common (and not so common) URL forms to find working feeds. Thus it can identify functional feeds for the site that are not coded into the current page itself. Really useful!</p> <p>Now my concern is with the method of operation. I&#39;m not a javascript
