My issue is that I cannot access it from the same network using publicip:8096. I&#39;m not sure why.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I&#39;m a <strong>developer</strong> exploring whether to go all-in with <strong>Medusa.js</strong> or stick with <strong>Shopify</strong> for an ecommerce project. While Medusa.js gives me complete flexibility and control, I&#39;m concerned about whether the <strong>costs of hosting, infrastructure, and maintenance</strong> might end up being higher than just paying for Shopify’s monthly fees.</p> <p>I’ve also noticed that setting up a proper <strong>testing environment</strong> and handling <strong>local development</strong> with Medusa is more complex compared to Shopify’s built-in tools. So, for those of you who&#39;ve used <strong>both platforms</strong>, I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts. Is managing all the infrastructure for Medusa worth it, or does Shopify’s convenience (with themes, testing, hosting, etc.) justify the price?</p> <p>Any insights would be great, especially from people who have dealt with <strong>hosting Medusa</

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! As an avid self-hoster and sysadmin, one of my biggest fears is a server blowing up while I&#39;m away from home, or my ZFS pool losing more than one disk without me knowing about it. While there are tons of ways to send yourself notifications like good ol&#39; email, notify, gotify, etc., I never really found one that integrated well with my iPhone aside from sending myself Telegram notifications through the bot API. However, I&#39;ve recently decided to move away from using Telegram as a messenger, so I was again looking for a new solution to getting notifications from my servers.</p> <p>Recently I read up on <a href="https://pushover.net">pushover</a> and thought I&#39;d give their 30 day trial a shot before making the one-time $5 purchase for using their mobile app. One of it&#39;s shining features is their super simple API, which makes pushing messages as easy as using an HTTP library available in your favorite programming language.

I can&#39;t use VNC services with it too. Media streaming is against their tos, which previously we could I think. So it was a very drastic downgrade for me not because of the service they offer but my lack of understanding on what limitations they had and would have in future.</p> <p>I don&#39;t wish to make a similar wrong decision while selecting these services this time.

I have a backlog of thousands I need to go through. Lightroom Classic is about the only option but it&#39;s not compatible with other software like Windows Explorer or Everything Search. It tags photos in a way that doesn&#39;t appear in the properties tags in windows and so can&#39;t be indexed by everything. It also tags the capture date/time in a way that isn&#39;t found either. I&#39;ve tried at least a dozen apps, and while they can handle tagging they don&#39;t do it in any bulk capacity like LRC. I need to be able to click on a button and add a tag. I need suggested keywords appearing and a list of recent/most used keywords. I don&#39;t mind occasionally manually entering a keyword but if it requires me to manually enter each keyword then it isn&#39;t useful to me. And if requires a remote desktop like

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Currently I have three Lenovo sff systems, a i5-4000 series, i7-6000 series, and recently added a i5-8000 that was being scrapped from a friend. These are all being used to run a bunch of docker containers on each; swag, homepage, change detection, adsb servers, some of the arr stack, you get the idea. My question is, should I move everything over to the newest system and then use the older ones for something else or does it really matter? Or should I go crazy and setup something like kuberentes and get a cluster type thing going? I might be able to get one or two more of the i5-8000 series in the next month or two so I&#39;d probably phase the oldest system out anyways. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/diremonk"> /u/diremonk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fr5oas/combine_systems_or_keep_separate/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently set up a media server using <a href="https://github.com/Schaka/media-server-guide">this guide</a>. It’s the same basic setup, though I didn’t include all the services, and I’ve added some of my own, such as Nginx and Organizer. I’ve been using OMV, but I’m considering switching to something else and have been looking at Unraid, Rockstor, and other possible alternatives.</p> <p>I’m fairly new to Linux and don’t have much experience with the CLI, so I would prefer something that’s relatively beginner-friendly. One of the main things I’m looking for is the ability to easily transfer my current setup/configuration to a new system without having to set everything back up again from scratch. I would also like to expand beyond just a media server at some point, adding services for home automation, game servers, password management, etc.</p> <p>If anyone has experience with Unraid or Rockstor, I’d love to hear your thoughts on which might be better
