<p>Lions had to overcome pain of grand final defeat last year and go the long way through this finals series to claim a first premiership under coach Chris Fagan</p><p>Sometimes you walk into the rooms of a losing grand finalist and wonder whether that team, or those players, will ever recover. There was devastation in Brisbane’s room’s last year but there was a certain pride and optimism too. They’d made Collingwood go deep down the well. So many non-MCG tenants have turned up their toes on grand final day. But no one left the MCG with anything but admiration for the Lions. A slip there, an incorrect advantage call there, and it was snatched away from them.</p><p>Twenty minutes after that game, Chris Fagan was remarkably calm and magnanimous. He rued late goals in the opening and second terms, and the extent to which they were beaten on both wings. But he was already selling a message of optimism to his players. “There’s lots of teams that have lost close grand finals that have gone

<p>After beating Argentina to seal the title, the world champions will look to sweep England, Wales and Scotland</p><p>Two World Cups, a British &amp; Irish Lions series and now the Rugby Championship. South Africa are in possession of every major trophy available to a southern-hemisphere team. Does this put them on par with the all-conquering All Blacks of Richie McCaw and Dan Carter? It is a question best unpacked over a second pint in the pub. That it is worth asking, though, is a testament to the evolution of this team under Rassie Erasmus and the potential heights they may yet reach.</p><p>This 48-7 win over Argentina included all the familiar notes of a Springboks classic. Their scrum consumed the Pumas pack with Ox Nché – a man who famously joked that “salads don’t win scrums” – feasting in the set piece, winning a string of first-half penalties seemingly on his own. Eben Etzebeth, now with a record 128 caps for his country, began the day with tears in his eyes and was totemic

<p>Cole Palmer FC may take some stopping if they can keep this up. While these days it’s doing the rest of Enzo Maresca’s side a disservice to suggest this is a one-man team, another irresistible performance from the England forward that saw him become the first player in Premier League history to score four times before half-time made it four wins on the trot for Chelsea.</p><p>Palmer was the centre of attention after his hat-trick in the space of just 10 minutes inspired a sensational response, Chelsea having fallen behind to Georginio Rutter’s early opener following Robert Sánchez’s mistake against his former club. The Chelsea goalkeeper will be mightily relieved that another mistake to allow Carlos Baleba to pull one back did not cause greater damage as Palmer made sure of the points with another brilliant finish before half-time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/28/chelsea-brighton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Australia is not the only country facing a housing crisis. <strong>Alan Kohler</strong> takes us on a whistle-stop tour of five governments trying to make homes more affordable</p><p>Although Australians are naturally focused on their own housing misery, the truth is that the crisis is global. Much of the developed world has a dire housing shortage and prices are rapidly becoming unaffordable everywhere, or already are. Leo Tolstoy’s maxim “Happy families are all alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”<em> </em>applies to each country’s problems with housing.</p><p>Leaving aside the migration and refugee flows that are causing extreme housing shortages in some countries, the number of houses being built in the world is simply falling short of population growth, even though that growth is declining. UN-­Habitat says the world needs to build 96,000 affordable homes every day to house the 3 billion people who will need adequate housing by 2030.</p> <a href="https://www.t
