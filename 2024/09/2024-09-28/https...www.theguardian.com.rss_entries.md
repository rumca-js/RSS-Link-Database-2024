<p>For Arsenal, it had to be from a corner and, after the week that had gone, it had to be Leandro Trossard who made the difference. The fallout from last Sunday’s explosive 2-2 draw at Manchester City had raged, a prominent talking point being the moment that shaped Arsenal’s darkly impressive rearguard action, namely Trossard’s second yellow card, for kicking the ball away. Here, he rescued his team.</p><p>It looked like being a story of Arsenal throwing away two points from a winning position for the third time this season. That, and a sensational second-half goalscoring cameo by the Leicester right-back, James Justin, plus the defiance of the goalkeeper, Mads Hermansen. Having made it 2-1 with a deflected header, Justin produced a volley of irresistible sweetness to equalise. Hermansen made 13 saves – the most in a Premier League game since David de Gea here against Arsenal in 2017.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/28/arsenal-leicester-premier-league-matc

<p>Timing is everything, and at the end of a week that brought fresh hope of a takeover at Everton, Sean Dyche finally tasted his first Premier League victory of the season. A fresh start does not have to be confined to the boardroom.</p><p>Everton claimed their first three points courtesy of a superb double from Dwight McNeil plus a second-half transformation. Defeat was truly galling for Crystal Palace and their manager Oliver Glasner. The visitors were vastly superior before the interval and deservedly led through Marc Guéhi’s poacher’s finish. But they had no answer to McNeil’s excellence or solutions to Everton’s improved organisation after the break.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/28/everton-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Many people say they’re living to 100-plus years. But research lauded with an Ig Nobel prize shows some claims are spurious</p><p>Earlier this month, an unusual prize ceremony got under way.

<p>From Piet Mondrian’s plain white smudge to the vivid flourishes of Egon Schiele, the palettes artists use to create their masterpieces are mysterious, vibrant creations in their own right (Picasso’s palette from 1961 recently fetched £56,250 at auction despite being made of cardboard). Fifty of these small artworks, smeared with their owners’ personalised spectrum of paint, have now been collected in a new book, many of them for the first time. “A palette is both a timeless blank canvas and the ultimate abstract work of art,” says the book’s author, Alexandra Loske, curator of the Royal Pavilion in Brighton. “It is the most intimate and personal of tools, and perhaps the closest we will ever come to connecting with a long-dead artist.”</p><ul><li><em><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-artist-s-palette-alexandra-loske/7646510">The Artist’s Palette</a></em> (Thames &amp; Hudson, £35) is out on 3 October</li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/202

For half a century, the magazine has been the go-to place for reports of the wildest conspiracy theories, of UFO sightings and poltergeists and frogs falling from the sky. Created by Bob Rickard, a British disciple of Charles Fort, the American investigator of the paranormal, the magazine has always been perfectly pitched somewhere between <em>The X-Files</em> and a parish council newsletter. I enjoyed a subscription for a while, but&nbsp;haven’t read the magazine for a few years.</p><p>Returning to it is a curious experience.

<p>Twenty-five years after his bestselling debut, the author has updated it for ‘a more anxious age’. So which of his theories stood the test of time – and what does he find ‘embarrassing’ to read now?<br>• <a href="https://composer.gutools.co.uk/content/66dedc018f08a07a6f4cecb1">Read an exclusive extract from his new book here</a></p><p>When Malcolm Gladwell’s good friend Jacob Weisberg sug­gested he update his best­selling first book, The Tipping Point, a quarter of a century after its publication, Gladwell was sceptical. “It seemed like the sort of thing you would do at the end of your life – like when a rock band puts out the greatest hits album, or the acoustic version,” he says, laughing. The analogy is apt. Gladwell has come as close as any writer could to rock stardom. He’s the rare journalist famous enough to be recognised on the street. He has a look. He’s the small skinny guy with the big hair, and at 61, he has retained a certain boyishness, evident when he speaks to me on

<p>Her stage work in the 1970s in Canada gave her a chance to reinvent herself and reach wonderful levels of performance</p><p>Maggie Smith was an actor of legendary wit and style who, even off stage, seemed to have the capacity to deliver a one-line zinger. There’s a lovely moment in Roger Michell’s TV film Nothing Like a Dame in which the assembled quartet (including Judi Dench and Eileen Atkins) are asked to talk about the difficulty of living with a title. Joan Plowright says it’s worse for her because she not only has the handle of a Dame but that of a Lady through her marriage to Laurence Olivier. With exquisite timing and hitting the perfect verb, Maggie looks at her old friend and says: “Joan, darling, you’ll just have to grapple with it.”</p><p>Smith’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/27/maggie-smith-cinematic-superstar">achievements on stage and screen</a> are well documented, but I was lucky to witness a less well-known side of her work: her seasons at the

That’s why today’s two recipes are as much about the crunchy toppings and fillings, from poppadoms to potato sticks, as they are about the gravy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/sep/28/yotam-ottolenghi-curries-recipes-squash-poppadom-chickpea-mango-bombay-mix">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Netanyahu has his own reasons for prolonging the conflict, but many Israelis still want to see Hamas and Hezbollah neutralised</p><ul><li>Sir John Jenkins is an associate fellow in the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House and a former British diplomat</li></ul><p>We cannot say we couldn’t see this latest escalation between Israel and Hezbollah coming. There has been a standoff conflict between Israel, Hezbollah, Iran and the Iraq Shia paramilitaries since at least 2015. The proximate cause was Iran’s efforts to extend its physical presence and that of its allies throughout Syria as well as Lebanon, as far as the Golan Heights.</p><p>The Israeli air force has consistently sought to cut off Iranian supplies of missiles and other munitions from Iraq through Syria to Hezbollah in particular. There have been successes. But none of them have stopped Hezbollah becoming stronger, as it acquired more sophisticated and accurate missiles and significant combat experience fi

<p>Icons, rock stars – and divas behaving badly: these photographs of musicians struck a chord around the world</p><p>It’s unclear which artist first uttered the phrase, “It’s all about the music” – a quick Google search reveals it being deployed by indie bands, techno DJs, heavy metallers and, winningly, the Icelandic entrant in the 2024 Eurovision song contest – but whoever it was was lying. Pop music in its multifarious forms is never all about the music, nor has it ever been. It was always inexorably linked with visual imagery (in the 1920s, country star Jimmie Rodgers underlined his working-man authenticity by being photographed in his brakeman’s overalls years after he quit working on the railroads; the mystique of Billie Holiday or Charlie Parker was at least partly defined by <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/jazz-photography-of-william-p-gottlieb/articles-and-essays/gottlieb-in-his-own-words/">William Gottlieb’s photographs</a> in jazz magazine DownBeat), but there’s n
