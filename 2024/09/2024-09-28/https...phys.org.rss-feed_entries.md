The goal of sustainable chemistry has motivated chemists to use renewable energy in chemical reactions, minimizing hazardous waste, and maximizing atom economy. Nature provides a blueprint with photosynthesis, in which carbohydrates are produced from carbon dioxide and water under sunlight irradiation.

Just up the road from Oakland and Berkeley, the city of Richmond is a minority and low-income community of 115,500 people—mainly Latino, Black and Asian American—with a major Chevron refinery whose pollution has been an ongoing source of conflict (the city just reached a $550 million settlement with Chevron to mitigate health and lifestyle effects of the refinery). It's also home to an active port and soon—finally—a world-class park.

Small plastic particles are everywhere: in the soil where our food is grown, in the water we drink and in the air we breathe. They got there from the plastic we throw away, which ends up in landfill sites, rivers and seas. There the plastic waste slowly breaks down, releasing tiny particles called microplastics and even tinier nanoplastics into the environment.

Using the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), astronomers from Italy and Spain have carried out high-temporal-resolution optical spectroscopic observations of a transitional millisecond pulsar designated PSR J1023+0038. Results of the observational campaign, published September 19 on the pre-print server arXiv, yield essential information regarding the nature of this pulsar.

Since the first sighting of the first-discovered and largest asteroid in our solar system was made in 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi, astronomers and planetary scientists have pondered the make-up of this asteroid/dwarf planet. Its heavily battered and dimpled surface is covered in impact craters. Scientists have long argued that visible craters on the surface meant that Ceres could not be very icy.

## Geologists discover mysterious subduction zone beneath Pacific, reshaping understanding of Earth's interior

University of Maryland scientists uncovered evidence of an ancient seafloor that sank deep into Earth during the age of dinosaurs, challenging existing theories about Earth's interior structure. Located in the East Pacific Rise (a tectonic plate boundary on the floor of the southeastern Pacific Ocean), this previously unstudied patch of seafloor sheds new light on the inner workings of our planet and how its surface has changed over millions of years. The team's findings were published in the journal Science Advances on September 27, 2024.
