They’re dedicated to curing childhood cancer and helping families affected by it. Since 2019 they’ve raised over $3 million, and their best-ever single month was just north of $775,000.</p>

<p>This year they’re already at $925,000, within earshot of a cool million, with three days to go in the month. <a href="https://relay.experience.stjude.org/">Let’s make that happen</a>.</p>

  <p>We put the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/apple-iphone-16-pro-review">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and
the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> through the Tom’s Guide battery
test, which involves surfing the web over 5G at 150 nits of screen
brightness. The iPhone 16 Pro Max and iPhone 16 Plus have risen to
the top with some incredibly impressive results — making our
<a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/smartphones-best-battery-life,review-2857.html">best phone battery life</a> list in the process. Here’s how
the new iPhone 16 models’ battery life stacks up against their
iPhone 15 counterparts, and rival flagships.</p>

<p>Tom Dotan and Berber Jin, reporting late last night for The Wall Street Journal (<a href="https://apple.news/AmJIdIPVSQ-yMfxa1QKImaQ">News+</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is no longer in talks to participate in an OpenAI funding
round expected to raise as much as $6.5 billion, an 11th hour end
to what would have been a rare investment by the iPhone maker in
another major Silicon Valley company. Apple recently fell out of
the talks to join the round, which is slated to close next week,
according to a knowledgeable person.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/26/murati-openai">just observed the other day</a> that the tumultuous (to say the least) leadership situation at OpenAI seems incongruous with Apple’s.</p>
