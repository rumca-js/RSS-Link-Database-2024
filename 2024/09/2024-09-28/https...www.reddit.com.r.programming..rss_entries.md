<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all, I’ve been in the fine-dining industry for a decade now in a major city and recently went back to school in order to pursue a BS in CS with a focus on Software Engineering. </p> <p>I have a minor electrical engineering background but have become very familiar with the in’s and outs of what’s needed for a restaurant POS to be effective and efficient. </p> <p>I’ve been told many times that a great way to learn programming is to have a side project you’re working on to better relate any and all new concepts you’re learning in class towards something tangible so you’re not just completing assignments but getting real world application value. I would love for this project to be designing a restaurant POS. Obviously it won’t be a stellar product right away but nonetheless I’m wondering where to begin. </p> <p>I’m predominantly learning Python. What languages and skill sets should I be efficient in if this is what I want to design and maintain. Whe
