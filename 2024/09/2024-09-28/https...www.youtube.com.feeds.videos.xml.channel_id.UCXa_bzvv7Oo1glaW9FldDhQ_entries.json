Once again, all of these can be fixed with time. It's the more deep-rooted issues with the visuals, combat, UI, and polish which will take longer to address.\n\nWhether fans are willing to give it that much time is unknown, especially when there are many other compelling RPGs to experience. Maybe it'll surprise me down the line and hone in on all those aspects that shine while ensuring its fundamentals are more polished and enjoyable.
