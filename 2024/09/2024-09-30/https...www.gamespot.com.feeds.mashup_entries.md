For example, when the latest Spider-Man game was pulled up at the GameSpot office, the ad that came up was for a roundtable video featuring the creative team of Spider-Man 2 and and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.

<p>A film based on Minecraft has been in various stages of development for more than a decade, but it's finally happening and now set for release in 2025. The film is live-action, and many wondered why the filmmakers chose to go that route instead of making it animated like The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Torfi Frans Olafsson, the creative director for entertainment at Minecraft studio Mojang, explained the decision to use live-action during Minecraft Live recently.</p><p>"We thought a lot about what kind of movie to do, and we chose live-action because it's not something that's been seen before on this scale," Olafsson said.</p><p>Director Jared Hess, meanwhile, said, "This is a chance for us, doing a film, to do something different." Hess mentioned how the dedicated and creative Miencraft fan community already came up with tons of stories and short films based on Minecraft using an animated format.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-director-explains-why-it

So far, that's proven untrue in the US and UK.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1840358330742505507">On X</a>, Verge senior editor Tom Warren pointed out PS5 Pro is still available to buy on PlayStation Direct after a weekend on sale. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorder-guide-price-release-date-amazon-best-buy-walmart/1100-6526406/">PS5 Pro preorders started</a> on the site on September 26 and will open at other retailers like Best Buy and Amazon on October 10.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6465223" data-src="/videos/the-ps5-pro-surprised-us-in-our-hands-on/2300-6465223/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="0">          <iframe height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allo

On the other hand, there's also always a lengthy list of shows canceled each year that simply did not find their audience. Last year, with the Hollywood strikes and contraction in the TV industry, the number of shows canceled in 2023 swelled to over 140.</p><p dir="ltr">In all honesty, chances are that 2024 will be the same. As the various streaming services raise prices and add in commercials to their plans in an attempt to become profitable, it will make financial sense to cut the shows that don't have a big enough audience to justify their existence. Likewise, as beloved shows get older, they get more expensive. Even The Walking Dead, one of the biggest juggernauts on TV, ultimately stopped mak

"My intention and expectation for the game was mostly for the enjoyment of skateboarders. I had no idea it would transcend a niche market to become a massive success and--as some have argued--change the course of skateboarding's popularity (and possibly even skate trick evolution)."</p><p>Pro Skater's popularity helped usher in a slew of similar titles for different sports like snowboarding with the SSX series, and pro

<p>During the early '90s, Ken Kutaragi and Sony attempted to collaborate with Nintendo on an early version of PlayStation, which was intended as a CD drive for the SNES. When that partnership faltered, Kutaragi and Sony moved forward with the original PlayStation in 1994. Although that system ultimately changed the entire video game industry, Kutaragi still recalls the doubters both inside and outside of Sony 25 years later.</p><p>"We wanted to share the passion," said Kuturagi at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5799/">Tokyo Games Show</a> via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ken-kutaragi-claims-everyone-at-sony-thought-the-playstation-would-fail/">VGC</a>.
