The process was much more delightful thanks to my foldable keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having acquired a foldable phone (Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold5) last year, it seemed fitting to buy a foldable keyboard to go with it. So far, it\u2019s been a great addition to my gadget arsenal, allowing me to get some quick writing or emailing done without firing up my laptop. It also stows away more easily than regular Bluetooth keyboards, with a case that doesn\u2019t look out of place on a coffee table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re like me and find yourself tiring of touchscreen typing, then here\u2019s what you need to know about foldable keyboards and why you should consider getting one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story fir", "id": 1238096, "language": null, "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2470342/why-you-might-want-a-foldable-keyboard-and-how-to-pick-one.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 246, "source_url": "https://www.pcworld.com/feed", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Why a foldable keyboard can be an absolute game-changer", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-30T08:00:00+00:00", "description": "\n<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<body><section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> For $34.99, get $50 in <a href=\"https://shop.pcworld.com/sales/alosim-traveler-s-mobile-data-plan-pay-34-99-for-50-credit?utm_source=pcworld.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=alosim-traveler-s-mobile-data-plan-pay-34-99-for-50-credit&utm_term=scsf-605727&utm_content=a0xRn000002JmuDIAS&scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mobile data credit</a> with aloSIM, so you can stay online from anywhere in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re working remotely while traveling the globe, you already know the struggle of finding reliable Wi-Fi.
