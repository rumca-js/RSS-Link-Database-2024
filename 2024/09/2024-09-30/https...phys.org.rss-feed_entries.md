Most CubeSats weigh less than a bowling ball, and some are small enough to hold in your hand. But the impact these instruments are having on space exploration is gigantic. CubeSats—miniature, agile and cheap satellites—are revolutionizing how scientists study the cosmos.

They were said to come from outer space, and there were even claims that they were actually bacteria and that they undermined the very definition of viruses. Giant viruses, nicknamed "giruses," contain enormous quantities of genetic material—up to 100 times more than other viruses—and some are larger than certain bacteria.

## Inland waters crucial for accurate climate assessments, research suggests

Inland waters release substantial amounts of greenhouse gases, but this is rarely included in climate assessments. New research from Umeå University shows that not accounting for carbon fluxes between land and water systems leads to incorrect assessments of climate impact and feedback on the carbon cycle.

An international team of astronomers has employed the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to perform spectroscopic observations of a luminous quasar known as J1007+2115. They detected a fast outflow originating from the quasar's host galaxy. The finding was reported in a paper published September 20 on the pre-print server arXiv.

English is the dominant language for communicating research and discoveries in scientific journals. The same is true for science communication outlets such as news articles, multimedia, and press releases. However, sharing this information only in English excludes large audiences, which can be particularly dangerous when it comes to Earth and space science topics.

Lead researcher Dr. Sarah Nason, from Bangor University's School of History, Law and Social Sciences explained, "Debt, benefits, special educational needs, health care issues, these are everyday problems that many of us face, and it's only natural to turn to people you know and trust for help and advice. However, we found that having to talk to more people or support services was an indicator that the problem was more complex and difficult to resolve."
