								<p><strong>MTG Commander precon decks</strong> (short for preconstructed decks) are a great place to turn when you’re just starting out in the Commander format, still learning the ropes. There are tons of different options available, and for a fairly affordable price you’re guaranteed a well-balanced deck with a strong strategy that you can just sit down and play with right away - although you should sleeve your cards first if you don’t want to attract horrified glances.</p>

								<p>This colossal monowheel warmachine is the work of long-time <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> player Michael De Lucci. Since he started kitbashing models he’s found himself using more and more plasticard and fewer and fewer parts from official model kits, eventually leading into a total scratch build made with scrap cardboard, pins, and mechanical genius befitting an Ork.</p>

								<p>The Commander bans last week made a lot of <b>MTG</b> players very angry, and seemed to invoke a tirade of abuse from a subsection of fans - much of it flung at people who had no part to play in the decision or were actively positioned against it. Now, Magic: The Gathering’s head designer has asked the game’s community to “be better” in a blogpost about the impact of angry online messages.</p>
