<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Found this <a href="https://github.com/SymbioticEDA/riscv-formal">repository</a>. Seems to be unmaintained. I wanted to ask if there is an official specification like this one from riscv.org, for formal verification of RISC-V DUTs, as this is from another organization. It could help in standardizing verification for RISC-V DUTs for all extensions (the linked repository does not cater RVV1.0 and some other extensions).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rai_volt"> /u/rai_volt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1fsvcvd/riscv_formal_interface/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1fsvcvd/riscv_formal_interface/">[comments]</a></span>

## Are there any existing affordable boards that uses a chip designed anywhere other than China?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Nothing against China but given the current trade war and geopolitics of the industry I want to know if there are any RISC-V boards that use chips designed and sold by companies outside of China that are actually affordable.</p> <p>SiFive&#39;s dev boards are very expensive and require you to buy a whole case and power supply since they&#39;re in motherboard form factor which is pretty inconvenient for hobby or open source developers though not a problem for companies, I assume.</p> <p>It would be kind of problematic to develop stuff for a device and then not be able to order the device or its components because of sanctions and trade restrictions from either side.</p> <p>Edit: I mean chips that aren&#39;t microcontrollers and can run a rich OS. Sorry I forgot to specify this at first.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lead999x"> /u/lead999x </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/c
