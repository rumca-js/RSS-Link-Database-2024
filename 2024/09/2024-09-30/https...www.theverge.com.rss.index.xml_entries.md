  <p id="LjDYnB">An apparent bug was causing game art backgrounds to be replaced by promotional messages and news posts on the PlayStation 5 dashboard for some people on Monday. The images they saw featured promotions for long-expired discounts and ads for new games. </p>

  <p id="r5W9s0">YouTube has reached a deal with the music licensing organization SESAC that will bring back songs that were removed over the weekend.
