They can then choose to force the player to Exchange (capitalized in the rules). &quot;Exchange&quot; for both the Inquisitor and the Ambassador (not used in this variant) means the player draws one (or two) new card(s) and picks which they want to keep, returning the same number as drawn to the Court deck. </p> <p>Our question is if an Inquisitor forces the target player to &quot;Exchange,&quot; do they draw and decide? Or is it played like winning a challenge where they add the examined card back to the Court deck and then draw a replacement? The latter makes way more sense to me, but we were a little confused by the rules referring specif

Then we take all the suggestions and make them into a public Spotify playlist for everyone to enjoy (or not enjoy, as is possibly the case with the novelty songs playlist we did a couple of weeks ago).</p> <p>With it being the week of Essen we decided that it was time to bite the bullet and choose the inevitable theme of “Songs that have something to do with tabletop games”.

I don’t understand how it’s a gaming sin to forfeit and walk away from a game, but taking 10 min turns isn’t.

Watching Hai recent Essen hype list, he is criticizing Black Forest&#39;s 2 player mode when he says &quot;I&#39;ll only ever play it with two&quot; (saying that he probably won&#39;t ever play it since he doesn&#39;t like it at two). </p> <p>This got me thinking, does he ONLY play games with his wife? Again, I&#39;m not a regular watcher, but I don&#39;t really recall him provide caviates in his reviews that his opinions are based solely on the two player game, which is often really different from 3+ player modes (often the intended design). Would you consider this as a massive editorial oversight? Especially considering how many games he covers, the size of his audience, etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! My boyfriend and I have been together for (almost) 9 years and for our anniversary, I wanted to make a custom board game. But I could use some help. </p> <p>He wants the classic 30 Seconds, and I thought of making our own version with things on the cards that refer to inside jokes or vacations we&#39;ve had, but then I realised.. 1) This is not a two player game and no-one is gonna wanna play this personalized version with us lol. 2) This would be too damn easy! We&#39;re already too strong a team in regular 30 Seconds, let alone if it&#39;s on our expertise - our own lives haha.</p> <p>So now I&#39;m thinking maybe Pictionairy: would be harder and more fun with other people too. But I&#39;m not sure.</p> <p>Other games he likes: Pandemic, Dixit, Mysterium, Hitster, Cartographers.. </p> <p>Can anyone advise me on a good game to make a personalized version of? :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The game has cards that are worth different points from 1-7. There are more lower ranked cards and as the point number goes up there are less cards like that. For example, there are like ten rank 1 cards and only one rank 7 card. Everyone takes turns drawing and playing cards and each card has a different action, similar to the action cards in exploding kittens. Each round, the objective is to end up with the highest point card. The first person to win a certain number of rounds wins the game. Also the cards are yellowish if that helps.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Beneficial-Mud4541"> /u/Beneficial-Mud4541 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fsohbh/im_looking_for_the_name_of_a_card_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fsohbh/im_looking_for_the_name_of_a_card_game/">[comments]</a></span>

Dune Imperium seems to be quite popular, and I know there’s the rerelease of the board game based on the Avalon Hill classic (which seems to have new expansions). But what about Dune: War for Arrakis (first board game I’ve seen to go for over $100) or Dune: House Secrets? Any thoughts or reviews? The latter two seem like completely distinct and different games. It’s all getting a bit confusing.</p> <p>(I’m newish to board gaming and am particularly interested in solo play, FYI.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NoMeatNoMushrooms"> /u/NoMeatNoMushrooms </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fskpip/thoughts_on_the_various_dune_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fskpip/thoughts_on_the_various_dune_games/">[comments]</a></span>
