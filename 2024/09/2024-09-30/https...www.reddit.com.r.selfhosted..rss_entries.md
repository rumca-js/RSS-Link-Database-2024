Currently, that port is exposed to both my Security VLAN and main VLAN, meaning anyone on the LAN has access to modify the configuration without any authentication.</p> <p>Since Home Assistant and Frigate are both on the main <em>and</em> Security VLANs, I would like to restrict port 5000 to only be accessible on the Security VLAN, so nobody on the main VLAN can make changes. I have Frigate, running as a Podman container, in a privileged LXC container, on a Proxmox host. I am very unfamiliar with Podman, as this is my first time using it. I know a bit about UFW (and would be willing to use it), but do not know how to set specific ports to only be accessible on specific interfaces (each VLAN has its own). I also know Proxmox has a built-in firewall option, but I am al

Even when I choose Vienna as the server location, I&#39;ve noticed that traffic from places like Bratislava to Vienna every time routes through Frankfurt, and sometimes through Nuremberg and Frankfurt. This adds unnecessary latency and slows down my sites.</p> <p>When using other providers, like OVH and others with servers in Warsaw or Vienna, the traffic seems to take more direct routes between countries, without going through Germany.</p> <p>I&#39;m wondering why this happens. Is there something about German hosts that causes traffic to route through Frankfurt, even when there are seemingly more direct paths available? Could this be a case of traffic monitoring or a network policy prioritizing certain routes over others?</p> <p>This situation is making my websites unnecessarily slow, and I&#39;m curious if anyone else has

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve setup <a href="https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser">Filebrowser</a> on my web server under the domain.tld/cloud path. However, I always enjoy having layers of security, so I&#39;ve added nginx <code>basic_auth</code> for that directory. However, I&#39;ve also set the /cloud/api/public and /cloud/share subdirectories to not require auth as those are meant for safe, public use. The issue is that while this all works, I&#39;ve tried many ways to arrange my site config and I always end up with the same issue: nginx doesn&#39;t prompt for <code>basic_auth</code> when opening /cloud/login by following a link to it from /cloud/share/something... This seems to be an nginx issue as I can recreate it with a very basic test webpage. How do I prevent this? The service is accessed with a reverse proxy if that matters. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FleefieFoppie"> /u/FleefieFoppie </a> <br/>

I know self-hosting databases can be a good solution depending on the use case, but what about storage (e.g., for images, files, etc.)? Is it something you self-host, or do you prefer using third-party services? How do you typically handle storage for your projects? I’d love to hear your experiences and opinions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LieSuspicious8719"> /u/LieSuspicious8719 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fsubb9/do_you_selfhost_storage/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fsubb9/do_you_selfhost_storage/">[comments]</a></span>

What I want, is to make a separate server in my brothers house for photo backup, and for him to have a similar setup at my place. I was thinking a Raspberry Pi or similar SBC with an external HDD for this, but I&#39;m not sure about the software to choose. Obviously Syncthing is good and easy for backups, but I would also like to have remote access to a simple web based photo browser and perhaps even a web based file browser. The photo viewer will not be my primary way to watch my photos, just a way of accessing them. Some sort of security/login, so that even the content on the remote location isn&#39;t easily accessible to him and others. I know he could unplug the drive and connect it to a PC, but I&#39;m not that paranoid. I&#39;m rather happy that he can access it if something happens to me at any point.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I am an IT administrator for a company that develops its own software. We have a fairly extensive database of technical documentation and manuals that our developers use on a regular basis. Recently, I&#39;ve noticed that some of the team has started using tools like ChatGPT to support their work. While I realize the value that such tools can bring, I&#39;m starting to worry about security issues, especially the possibility of unknowingly sharing company data with outside parties.</p> <p>My question is: have any of you had to deal with a similar challenge? How have you resolved data protection issues when using language-based models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT? Or do you have experience with implementing self-hosted LLMs that could handle several users simultaneously (in our case, we&#39;re talking about 4-5 simultaneous sessions)? The development team is about 50 people, but I don&#39;t foresee everyone using the tool at the same time.</p>

This directory does not exist on the host.</p> <p>So I can&#39;t modify files directly from the host-side directory.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read in the documentation that it&#39;s recommended to use docker volumes directly rather than directory mapping.</p> <p>It says that if I use this method I have to map the files one by one. I don&#39;t understand why because the other containers I use don&#39;t need this.</p> <p>If possible, I&#39;d like to continue using folder mapping as I use it for all my other containers.</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p
