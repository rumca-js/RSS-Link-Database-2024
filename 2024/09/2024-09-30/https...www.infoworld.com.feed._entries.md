<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have a serious “package hallucination” problem that could lead to a wave of maliciously-coded packages in the supply chain, researchers have discovered in one of the largest and <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10279v2#S5">most in-depth ever studies</a> to investigate the problem.</p>



<p>It’s so bad, in fact, that across 30 different tests, the researchers found that 440,445 (19.7%) of 2.23 million code samples they generated experimentally in two of the most popular programming languages, Python and JavaScript, using 16 different LLM models for Python and 14 models for JavaScript, contained references to packages that were hallucinated.</p>

<p>Salesforce’s recently launched Agentforce suite of low-code tools is betting on a human-like reasoning engine called Atlas that could be a game-changer in building AI agents.</p>



<p>What that essentially means is that this engine makes the AI agents created via <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3518646/salesforce-unveils-agentforce-to-help-create-autonomous-ai-bots.html">Agentforce</a> autonomous or in other words allows them to think like human beings and take actions on their own compared to the previous generation of Salesforce agents which had to be configured with workflows to be able to take actions.</p>

<p>There’s money in AI, but not where you think. Sure, Nvidia and the clouds are <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2517120/are-we-thinking-too-small-about-genai.html">cleaning up</a>, but they’re primarily selling to enterprises that are <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2510294/ai-is-in-the-tire-kicking-phase.html">mostly kicking tires</a>, not running mission-critical AI applications. Others, like the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a9a192e3-bfbc-461e-a4f3-112e63d0bb33"> Financial Times, suggest</a> that AI startups are cleaning up but, again, this could simply be a matter of reselling GPUs, as <a href="https://x.com/cgaunerd/status/1839829388101025903">Chris Gaun points out

<p>The goal of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3681097/what-is-devsecops-securing-devops-pipelines.html">devsecops</a> is to integrate security throughout the software development life cycle. To do this, the security team can’t focus on just the most obvious software development vulnerabilities or just the processes that are the easiest to secure. Instead, every step of the end-to-end development life cycle needs to be understood and properly secured. Automation can help. </p>

<p>Fabric, released in May 2023, brings together six “workloads”: Data Factory, Data Engineering, Data Warehouse, Data Science, Real-Time Intelligence, and Power BI that Microsoft says will help enterprises reduce IT integration overhead, complexity, and cost.</p>
