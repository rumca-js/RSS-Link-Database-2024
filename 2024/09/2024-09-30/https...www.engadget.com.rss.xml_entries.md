There will be no way for multiple subreddits to go private at once without Reddit having its hand on the lever.</p>
<p>The company put a little note on the support page that reads “if you’re changing your community type after community creation, you’ll need to submit a request.” This page doesn&#39;t offer any reasoning behind the decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/verizon/">Verizon</a> mobile customers reported widespread outages across the US on Monday. Starting at around 9:30AM ET, hundreds of thousands of people flagged issues with their mobile service on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/" data-original-link="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/">Downdetector</a>, which tracks user-submitted outage reports. The volume of reports spiked at almost 105,000 at 11:20AM, but were still reaching almost 59,000 at 12:52PM.</p>
<p>Many folks claimed they were unable to make or receive calls or exchange text messages. Those with an iPhone may be seeing "SOS" instead of the usual connection bars on the top right of their screen. That's a common sight when there's limited service or none at all. However, affected iPhone users can still make emergency calls via other networks.</p>

In this case, it's the Core Ultra 7 258V, a processor that sits in the mid-range of the company's "Lunar Lake" lineup. While Intel touts these chips as its most efficient ever, I've been curious about what that means for raw performance, especially since they top out with just eight cores.</p> 
<p>Based on my testing, I can confirm that the Zenbook S14 delivers the best battery life we've ever seen from an Intel laptop. It reached 16 hours and eight minutes in the PCMark 10 battery benchmark. In comparison, the Zenbook S16 powered by AMD's new Ryzen AI 9 365 chip only hit 12 hours and 47 minutes.

The AI Camera is compatible with all of Raspberry Pi’s single-board computers.</p>
<p>The approximately 12.3-megapixel AI Camera is intended for vision-based AI projects, and it’s based on SSS’ IMX500 image sensor. The integrated RP2040 microcontroller manages the neural network firmware, allowing the camera to perform onboard AI image processing and freeing up the Raspberry Pi for other processes. Thus, users who want to integrate AI into their Raspberry Pi projects are no longer limited to the Raspberry P

The free <em>Dawn of Equinox</em>, which adds a co-op mode, new combat and other features, arrives on November 12 on all platforms.</p>
<p>Announced in March, <em>Dawn of Equinox</em> adds new game modes and mechanics for our favorite lunar-solar heroes, Valere and Zale. It includes a new local co-op mode that lets you and up to two friends play the entire game together. Each player has independent movement when traversing the world (as long as you stay within the screen’s confines), and there’s a new co-op Timed Hits feature that turns one of the core game’s mechanics into a group effort.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ford/">Ford</a> is looking to take some of the sting out of EV charging by offering a free home charger. The automaker will even send out a technician to install it at no cost to you if you buy or lease a retail Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning or E-Transit between October 1 and January 2. However, Ford may opt to extend the program if it proves successful. (Ford Pro fleet customers will get a commercial charging cash incentive instead.)</p>

This should save Ford EV buyers and lessees a pretty penny, since the Ford Charge Station Pro costs $1,310 and the company typically charges $2,000 for installation.

<p>Remember those rumors of an Apple smart display suspended on a robot arm? According to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman, Apple is planning to debut the first device <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/apples-rumored-smart-display-may-arrive-in-2025-running-new-homeos-212401853.html">as soon as 2025</a>, alongside a new operating system called homeOS.</p>
<p>It could be a device with a robotic arm or a simpler HomePod-with-screen affair. Gurman elaborated on this, claiming two versions are in the works: a low-end display for the basics, like FaceTime and smart home controls, and a high-end robotic variant that’ll cost upwards of $1,000. According to the report, Apple Intelligence will be a key part of the experience for both devices. I’m intrigued to see how Apple’s flavor of AI can help me run my home. I literally have no idea how it would.</p>

<p>The built-in speakers in most TVs aren’t enough to fill your living room with immersive sound that adequately showcases the finer details of movies and TV shows. Thankfully, you don't have to splurge for a five-speaker (or more) <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-build-a-budget-home-theater-setup-140010399.html">surround-sound system</a> to improve your audio experience.

To assist with your home theater shopping, I’ve compiled a list of the best soundbars in premium, mid-range and budget price ranges, along with a summary of what sets them apart from the competition. Just know going in that the more you pay, the more you’re going to get — both in terms of additional features and performance.</p>

<p>I wasn’t even a minute into <em>Harlequin</em> before I had the realization, <em>Oh, I am going to become so annoying in my love for this.</em> Unfortunately for everyone in my life (and doubly so because I’m singing along), I’ve had it blasting all weekend since the surprise drop on Friday.<em>&nbsp;</em>Gaga is a powerhouse, and as much as I adore her take on pop, I’m always blown away when I hear her do jazz. And <em>Harlequin</em> is brimming with it.&nbsp;</p>
