<p>Arteta’s explanation baffles, Palmer exposes Hürzeler’s tactics and how long before a big club pounces for Mbeumo?</p><p>Has the curse of the Manchester United contract struck for the second year in succession? After Marcus Rashford agreed a bumper new deal a year ago, he promptly endured a miserable 2023-24 season. This summer, it was Bruno Fernandes’ turn to sign a lucrative extension – one that few could grumble with at the time. Yet the Portuguese, usually a beacon of consistency for United through all their ups and downs, has started the campaign in scruffy and sluggish fashion. He has yet to score this season, has only one assist in six Premier League matches and is increasingly cutting a frustrated figure. That frustration came pouring out in his callow kick at James Maddison, which left United – struggling enough when it was 11 v 11 – down and out with 10 men. Fernandes deserves credit for fronting up after the game but that interview was his most significant contribution o

<p>Paralympics and football must work out how to harness innovations for the greater good of athletes and players</p><p>Like many others, I was captivated by the Paralympics in Paris. I particularly enjoyed discovering new sports (boccia, anyone?), witnessing seemingly impossible feats such as Matt Stutzman’s fourth gold medal and Paralympic record in archery, achieved without arms, or Sarah Storey’s astounding 19th gold medal. The athletes’ personal stories were deeply moving, and I was especially fascinated by the technological adaptations that enable world-class levels of performance. We are undeniably witnessing a tremendous leap forward in our understanding and treatment of disabilities, alongside technological innovations that will not only transform sports but affect us all.</p><p>In my lifetime, attitudes towards disability in the UK have transformed remarkably. The Paralympics, bolstered by Channel 4’s superb coverage, has shone a light on the achievements of athletes who dem

<p>Got a beauty dilemma? Our expert is here to offer advice. This week, Aneesah wants to know how to deal with eczema-prone skin</p><p>A couple of years ago the eczema on my face got so bad even putting on moisturiser hurt, which made me curious about what was causing the irritation.

<p>The powerful story of how Mary Husted was forced to give her 10-day-old son up for adoption inspired her art and its viewers, while in Guatemala women with disabilities finally get a voice</p><p>In 1962, when the artist Mary Husted was 17, she fell pregnant with her son, Luke. She wasn’t married to the father and, because it wasn’t considered socially acceptable for her to raise the child on her own, she was forced to give him up for adoption just 10 days after his birth. To hold on to his memory, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/28/mary-husted-son-adoption">she sketched him every day</a>: capturing every eyelash and wisp of his hair; how he slept and imprinted his head on to his pillow. “They were all I would have of him,” she told me.</p><p>Nearly 30 years later, Husted – by now twice married and with a grown-up family of her own – returned to the drawings to inspire her 1991 painting, Dreams, Oracles, Icons, a golden collage of a newborn in the foetal p
