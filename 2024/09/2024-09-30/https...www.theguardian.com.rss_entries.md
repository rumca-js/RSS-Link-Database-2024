<p>He licks his wounds. He mocks Holly Willoughby. And he seems to view himself as a folk hero. But when the disgraced presenter actually gets down to the business of survival, it makes for tremendous TV</p><p>It’s hard to remember a show as salivatingly anticipated by certain quarters as Cast Away. Thanks to a careful drip-feed of details in the press, the show has promised nothing less than poor old cancelled, curdled Phillip Schofield going full Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? on a desert island.</p><p>Believe the hype and you’d think that the show, a three-part special in which Schofield has to film himself marooned on a remote island for 10 days, was going to be nothing but Schofield naming names and burning everything down because he has nothing else to lose. But while that may still come to pass – twice the show’s sizzle reel shows Schofield wild-eyed and unshaven, declaring himself to be ‘thrown under a bus’ – in truth the opening episode feels like two completely different sh

<p>Munya Chawawa pits his trademark raps and skits against interviews with a man denounced as ‘human scum’ – and a defector who ended up in a detention centre for decades. What emerges, against the odds, is witty and very well done</p><p>When he was 11, Munya Chawawa and his family fled Robert Mugabe’s tyrannical regime in Zimbabwe and settled in Norfolk. That story was told in the comedian-actor-rapper’s 2022 documentary How to Survive a Dictator. It mixed satirical sketches into a series of interviews with Mugabe’s family members and victims; a former friend who finally dissociated himself from the&nbsp;dictator after Mugabe oversaw the massacre of 20,000 civilians; and even one of Mugabe’s&nbsp;most feared henchmen.</p><p>Against the odds, the format worked. Could it do so again without the personal element anchoring and protecting the presenter against accusations of&nbsp;flippancy or insensitivity?

<p>Gunners manager prepares for a glamour Champions League tie, facing the club where he broke through on loan in 2001-02</p><p>Mikel Arteta fun fact: when the Arsenal manager was a young player at Paris Saint-Germain, his roommate on hotel stays was Ronaldinho.

<p>The discrimination some solo male gig-goers experienced this weekend was undeserved. But these encounters remain dismally normal for women and minorities</p><p>Imagine going to a gig, festival or club and being quizzed on how well you know the performers’ music. Imagine being condescended to and treated as if you don’t deserve to be there. Imagine feeling sick from being intimidated, isolated and subject to suspicion about your intentions at the event. Imagine feeling physically unsafe when you’ve gone to watch your favourite artist.</p><p>Every person of colour, every woman, transgender, non-binary and queer person, knows exactly what this is like: the assumption that because you’re not the default white male fan, you must be some sort of cultural interloper at a music event.

<p>The UK’s counter-extremism strategy isn’t working – and prison sentences won’t change that</p><p>There have been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c9d18449ye4t">at least 1,400 arrests</a> and more than 850 charges linked to the riots that swept England in August, with more in the pipeline. So far about 250 people have been jailed for their role in violent disorder fuelled by far-right activists, most of it aimed at asylum seekers and Muslims. The nature of these attacks, which included an attempt to set fire to a hotel, the desecration of graves and destruction of a Citizens Advice centre, meant custodial sentences were inevitable. The public, and particularly the targeted communities, needed to know that such brazen and racist aggression would be punished.</p><p>But nine weeks after the fatal stabbings of three children in Stockport – which were the catalyst for the riots – it is possible to take a step back and think about the longer-term causes and effects of what happene

<p>Car manufacturers have stopped including CD players as most drivers use streaming – but with greater choice, are we losing something too?</p><p>Every time I get in my car and plug my phone in, an interstitial from Rosalía’s 2022 album Motomami starts playing. “A de alfa, altura, alien,” she recites on Abcdefg. “B de bandida, C de coqueta” – I can’t turn it off fast enough. I love Rosalía but the Apple Music app defaults to the first song in the alphabet in my catalogue whenever it’s connected to the car, and Abcdefg is it. Her cute little ABC drives me nuts. Obviously it doesn’t take long to switch to something else – the MP3s I still transfer on to my phone, like the inveterate iPod user I was, or pretty much all the music in the world ever on Spotify or the apps of NTS or Bandcamp. Rosalía sometimes appears further down the alphabet, though, when I sit in the driver’s seat – categorically the best place to listen to music alone – struggling to think of what to put on amid the end

<p><strong>Soho theatre, London<br></strong>The Drag Race UK winner draws inspiration from a human cannonball in an unsubtle hour of daredevil feats and jokes about flatulence</p><p>Some shows win new fans; some just please existing ones. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/10/drag-race-is-essential-educational-viewing">UK Drag Race</a> champ Ginger Johnson’s latest may fall into the latter category. If you thrilled to that telly success, this knockabout comedy show/spoof magic act might suffice as a close-quarters hit of the real thing. It has less to offer the rest of us. Yes, Ginger displays a raucous charm as she sings triumphal songs (“How does it feel to be in the presence of a big shot?”), gets amongst her crowd, and performs daredevil feats inspired by the human cannonball she saw as a child. But, while any one of those acts might fly in a cabaret context, in an hour-long solo show at Soho theatre, they feel over-exposed.</p><p>It needn’t be too big a problem

<p>Clinton looks real deal at Manchester United, Roord makes bright return after 249 days and Chelsea need to tighten up</p><p>The England midfielder Grace Clinton’s return to her former club Everton was a happy one as she scored her second goal in as many games for Manchester United and again looked integral to the way Marc Skinner’s side want to play. Aside from her goal, the 21-year-old from Merseyside showed good strength on the ball and a physicality that added industry and purposefulness to United’s midfield, and it was her off-the-ball work that Skinner admired the most. He said: “You always get the glory when you go down as the goalscorer but I thought her pressing was really good today. She’s in a good space but I’ve got to keep pushing her – that’s my job.” Clinton spent last season developing on loan at Tottenham. “I always knew we were bringing her home,” Skinner added. “I gave her the No 8 shirt for a reason. We wanted her to go to Tottenham and learn the defensive side.

<p>A murderer is tormented by the ghosts of his victims in this frustrating story that doesn’t have the storytelling heft its premise deserves</p><p>Here is a horror film with a decent premise. Karter (Venkat Sai Gunda) is an artistic sort – specifically, a photographer, apparently of some renown. He’s also mute. And a serial killer. He’s depressed; he feels trapped by his crimes, but he can’t stop killing, he doesn’t want to go to prison and he can’t quite face suicide. One day, he begins to feel he isn’t alone in his house. It seems the vengeful ghosts of his victims are resting uneasily and have set out to torment him.</p><p>But there’s something here that just falls short. It’s a shame that the film-makers were working with such an evidently small budget: the vengeful ghosts are giving Halloween at Alton Towers vibe, which blunts the spook factor somewhat. You can detect delicious whiffs of classics like Peeping Tom, Carnival of Souls and Psycho in the air as the film begins, but

<p>Our research suggests that it’s not sadness per se that leads to poor mental health, but shutting down input from the body. ‘Sense foraging’ offers a way out of the trap</p><p>Modern life seems designed to stop us from being alone with our thoughts and feelings. Our days are built from the bricks of work and play, mortared by media and intoxicants. It’s understandable: glimpses behind the curtain can be deeply uncomfortable. When we pause for a second, the mind too often gravitates towards our greatest sources of stress – be they troubled relationships or our own critical stories about ourselves.</p><p>Scientists have even <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1250830">found</a> that quite a few of us would rather give ourselves painful electrical shocks than wait in a distraction-free room for 15 minutes.

<p>An estranged brother and sister reunite while hiding from the police in a remote barn that holds a secret procedure to transport people into the future</p><p>Writer-director Michael Felker makes his feature debut with this trudgingly downbeat sci-fi, an uncanny-realist time travel movie about a couple of criminals hiding out in the future; it’s a little in the style of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/aug/19/1">Shane Carruth’s Primer</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/27/looper-review">Rian Johnson’s Looper</a> – though without the thrills, and without the cerebral frissons and ingenious plot contrivances where those thrills would otherwise go.

<p>Illuminating documentary examines the tensions between indigenous pastoralists and commercial ranchers as resources become more scarce during a brutal drought</p><p>At the turn of the 20th century, Laikipia in Kenya saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Africa_Protectorate">an influx of British settlers</a> who were allowed to claim ownership of uninhabited and uncultivated territory. Much of the local population were stripped of their own land and forced to work as hired hands; many were killed. While more than 60 years have passed since the end of British rule, the stark racial inequality in Kenya remains. Shot during a period of severe drought, which heightens the tension between indigenous pastoralists and commercial ranchers, Peter Murimi and Daphne Matziaraki’s illuminating documentary illustrates the symbiotic relationship between land rights and climate justice.</p><p>As the lack of rainfall wreaks havoc on plant life, the film focuses on the Samburu people – a no

<p>Key moments in an actor’s life over seven decades are illuminated with skill and quiet power in this languid and stately novel </p><p>There’s an Alice Munro story, Train, which leaps through decades, as if the logic of time works quite differently in the world of her tale. Munro was a master of time, allowing us to linger on moments, objects and landscapes, and then to jump forward, asking the reader to fill in the blank spaces. Alan Hollinghurst does something like this in <em>Our Evenings</em>, a stately, elegiac novel that seems to turn upon a symbolic sundial in the garden of a characteristically Hollinghurstian country house. On the dial is a line from Cicero: “SESEM SINE SENSU” (without noticing, we grow old).</p><p><em>Our Evenings </em>is the story of Dave Win, an Anglo-Burmese actor born in the late 1940s. The novel unfolds across seven decades, moving from the 1960s to the pandemic, tracing the quiet, formative moments of Dave’s life with unhurried grace. There is an unmi

<p>Inspired by the documentary Seven Up! and based on real data, this important book exposes the extent of inequality in the UK and what it means for our poorest children</p><p>One of the first social rules children learn is the painful necessity of sharing. After the shock of encountering other wants and needs as strong as their own, a child who hands over stickers and sweets to their peers is praised. Yet for adults in the UK, sharing and caring, a glib rhyme that packages an important truth, is no longer a priority. “Compassion is an unstable emotion. It needs to be translated into action, or it withers,” writes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/29/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries">Susan Sontag</a> in her essay on observing others’ suffering, and Britain has tolerated inaction about inequality for so long that a shared responsibility for one another’s wellbeing has eroded.

<p>From British private school outcast to anaconda-wrestling cowboy to philanthropist, Paul Michael Angell’s documentary is of a life less ordinary</p><p>As unbelievable life trajectories go, British private school outcast to South American cowboy to US primetime TV naturalist to American healthcare saviour must be up there with the weirder ones.

<p>A vast swathe of the rugged Kerry coast and its Atlantic isles is now a protected haven for wildlife, and the occasional Jedi knight</p><p>I’m crouching in a windowless stone cell, peering at a ball of fluff stuffed into a crack in the floor. The cell is a beehive hut, or <em>clochán</em>; 1,400 years ago, it offered sleeping quarters to monks. The fluff is a baby seabird – to be precise, the chick of a European storm petrel. As my eyes adjust, I make out the glint of a tiny eye. After dark, the parents will return with food. For now, the chick sits tight.</p><p>Storm petrels nest only on remote, uninhabited islands, so seeing a chick is a rare privilege. I give the bird its privacy and crawl back outside – gasping anew at my surroundings. I’m high on a vertiginous rock outcrop in the Atlantic, just south-west of Ireland’s south-west corner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/sep/30/tour-of-irelands-first-marine-park-kerry">Continue reading...</a>

 Is Kim Jong-un about to start a third world war? The comedian Munya Chawawa may not seem to be the most obvious candidate for this investigation, but he has been fascinated by dictators ever since his family fled Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe. Having made a documentary about the country where he grew up, he has now turned his attention to the notorious hermit kingdom. It is fascinating and funny, mixing on-brand sketches and rare interviews with people who were imprisoned in North Korea. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/30/tv-tonight-dictator-obsessive-munya-chawawa-takes-aim-at-north-korea">Continue reading...</a>
