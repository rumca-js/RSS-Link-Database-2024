<p>External USB/Thunderbolt drives (aka direct-attached storage, or DAS) are a super-convenient way to quickly back up your important files, as well as store any data that you don’t need on your computer’s fast internal storage. They’re also extremely handy for transporting data between locations and devices.</p>



<p>While auxiliary storage and transport are great reasons to buy an external drive — backup is the primary reason your setup isn’t complete without one. To augment that, you’ll also want to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">store important data off-site in the cloud</a> if possible.

<p>Oh, how time flies! The 2024 gaming year is almost over and we’ve seen numerous exciting releases already, but there’s still a lot to come in the final months ahead. It is, after all, the holiday quarter and publishers will be going all out as we head into December.</p>



<p>Here are some of the most interesting and most important games still to come. Not only might they achieve decent sales, but they might even end up being gaming highlights — so keep an eye on them!</p>

<p>Printers suck. And since I used to work in a print shop, that’s not just an attention-grabbing opening line, it’s a professional opinion. Inexpensive inkjet printers are almost universally reviled for being pricey to refill and quick to break down. But if you absolutely need a printer for your home office, get a cheap Brother laser printer. Like this one, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPL7HRQN?th=1">which is just $90 on Amazon today</a>. </p>



<p>I’ve <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2270476/my-favorite-brother-laser-printer-is-just-99-at-walmart-today.html">sung the praises of my Brother HL-L2315DW before</a>, and this HL-L2405 looks like it’s almost identical. It’s a super-basic black-and-white printer that uses laser toner (the powdered stuff instead of the liquid-filled cartridges), which is both relatively cheap and lasts for-freakin-

<p>Raspberry Pi, in collaboration with Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-ai-camera-on-sale-now/">just launched an AI-powered camera module</a> called the <strong>Raspberry Pi AI Camera</strong>.</p>



<p>The module is based on Sony’s IMX500 image sensor with an integrated AI accelerator, which means it can do AI-based image processing directly on a Raspberry Pi device without any external processors.</p>



<p>The IMX500 image sensor is capable of 12MP images and has two modes: a larger 4056×3040 resolution at 10 FPS and a smaller 2028×1520 resolution at 30 FPS. The camera itself has a 78-degree field of view with a manually adjustable focus.</p>



<p>The Raspberry Pi AI Camera module is compatible with all Raspberry Pi models (including the Raspberry Pi Zero) via Raspberry Pi’s camera ribbon ca

<p>The term “AI” is inescapable right now, spreading its way across every facet of every market, whether it actually makes sense or not. And as it turns out, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is as sick of all this AI-related branding as everyone else.</p>



<p>A recent regulatory push dubbed “Operation AI Comply” now has the FTC cracking down on some of the more notable AI implementations, including at least three alleged scams.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-crackdown-deceptive-ai-claims-schemes">press release from last week</a> detailed five new cases that the FTC is taking on, specifically targeting firms that sprinkle AI-related claims into their businesses.

<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2470337/new-start-menu-taskbar-and-lock-screen-features-in-windows-11-update.html">Microsoft released an optional Windows 11 update</a> that brought some new features to the Start menu, taskbar, and lock screen. Unfortunately, that update is wreaking havoc for some users.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2024/09/30/windows-11-kb5043145-bsods-pcs-breaks-mouse-keyboard-wsl-2-wifi/">reported by Windows Latest</a>, after installing Windows update KB5043145, you may not be able to restart your PC as you’ll be hit with the infamous Blue Screen of Death or the less common Green Screen of Death. In some cases, BitLocker recovery may also be triggered.</p>

<p>A new monitor might be just what you need to take your gaming setup to the next level — and now’s a good time to make that upgrade because <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Odyssey-FreeSync-Ultrawide-DisplayPort/dp/B09ZH3WM47/">Samsung’s fast Odyssey Neo G8 monitor is on sale for $800 on Amazon right now</a>, a $500 drop from its $1,300 MSRP.</p>



<p>This 32-inch monitor is sleek and stylish so it’s going to look great no matter what desk you have, but it’s also powered by impressive tech. The 1000R curved screen wraps the screen around your field of vision for maximum immersion, bringing the 4K (2160p) resolution to life. The distraction-free matte screen is also great for focus.</p>



<p>But the real clincher here is that the Odyssey Neo G8 is built for gamers. It delivers an impressively fast 240Hz refresh rate and 1ms (GtG) response time for s

<p>What does a good gaming laptop need? A speedy processor, a great graphics card, plenty of RAM, and decent storage space. And wouldn’t you know it… I just spotted that exact combination in <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/msi-cyborg-14-144hz-gaming-laptop-fhd--intel-core-i7-13620h-with-16gb-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-with-8g-512gb-ssd-translucent-black/6574953.p?skuId=6574953">this MSI Cyborg laptop that’s on sale at Best Buy for $900</a>.</p>



<p>Running on an Intel Core i7-13620H processor that can handle pretty much any game or app you throw its way, plus 16GB of RAM, you can rest assured that this MSI laptop is more than enough to do whatever you want, from playing your favorite games to multitasking work. (If that’s not enough for you, you can later upgrade the RAM to 64GB.)</p>



<p>Then there’s the graphics card. This MSI Cyborg model features a

<p>I’ve been covering PC monitors for years, and there’s one thing that I’ve found to be a constant. No matter how advanced or interesting new monitors get, some of them will come with speakers built-in. And these speakers will, invariably, suck. They’ll suck so, so hard. The ones in the photo I took above came out of a Dell Optiplex 9030, and they’re only four watts each. </p>



<p>This is my plea for you, reader, to stop using these horrible little disappointment discs. You’ll get better sound out of the set of crusty white headphones that came free with your iPod Nano (and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/418660/the-best-gaming-headsets.html">gaming headsets are a <em>huge</em> upgrade</a>). But even more than that, I’d like monitor manufacturers to stop putting these horrible little speakers in monitors in the first place. They’re just wasting a

<p>Everyone needs a flash drive in their pocket (or purse, or backpack, or desk drawer…) because having a reliable data storage solution on hand is essential when you have to move documents, photos, and videos without relying on the cloud or email services.</p>



<p>And for that, you can’t go wrong with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-MUF-128AB-AM-Plus-128GB/dp/B07D7PDLXC/">Samsung’s tiny Fit Plus flash drive with 128GB capacity on sale for $15 at Amazon</a>. At this price and size, it’s an absolute bargain for portable storage.</p>



<p>The Samsung Fit Plus is barely larger than a Bluetooth dongle, but it’s durable, it’s compatible with everything, and it’s fast. It’s rated as waterproof, shock-proof, temperature-proof, magnet-proof, and X-ray-proof — exactly what you need for data you can’t lose.</p>

<p>I wrote the vast majority of this article on my phone.</p>



<p>But if you’re picturing me painstakingly tapping out a thousand-plus words on a tiny screen with my thumbs, think again. The process was much more delightful thanks to my foldable keyboard.</p>



<p>Having acquired a foldable phone (Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold5) last year, it seemed fitting to buy a foldable keyboard to go with it. So far, it’s been a great addition to my gadget arsenal, allowing me to get some quick writing or emailing done without firing up my laptop. It also stows away more easily than regular Bluetooth keyboards, with a case that doesn’t look out of place on a coffee table.</p>



<p>If you’re like me and find yourself tiring of touchscreen typing, then here’s what you need to know about foldable keyboards and why you should consider getting one.</p>
