Just when you think you know the depths of the human ingenuity to commit fraud, another guy comes along and takes the cake. But in the case of Gregor MacGregor, this will never happen as he will forever be the greatest scammer to ever live. He sold a fake country, but at a time where nobody could confidently and quickly verify his claims. Due to his social status, everyone believed him - some sold everything to live there only for disaster to await them.
