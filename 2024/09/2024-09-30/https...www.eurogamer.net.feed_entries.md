<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Hell-is-Us-Preview-Header-1.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Set in the early nineties, Hell is Us - the upcoming action-adventure game from developer Rogue Factor - follows R&eacute;mi on a journey to find his parents in the fictional country of Hadea. The problem? Hadea is a hermit state. The only reason why R&eacute;mi lives outside of its borders is thanks to his mother, who smuggled him out when he was five. Unfortunately, she was caught by the Hadea border control, leaving him alone and eventually entering the Canadian foster system. Her capture, and the fact that his father was a blacksmith in a village called Jova, are the only things he truly remembers from his short time in Hadea. It's due to this that R&eacute;mi, despite understanding the rationality behind his parents actions, wants to reunite with them and learn exactly why they got him out.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmosph

However, it's actually a point raised in last week's Direct that I want to tackle in this week's blog. Many believe - with some justification - that the PS5 Pro is a step too far and that such a console isn't needed. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-do-we-actually-need-ps5-pro-or-xbox-enhanced-consoles-this-generation">we've made the argument ourselves</a>. Looking back at that piece, I warned about higher costs of a Pro console, but also looked at the potential improvements it could bring - all of which have come to pass with PS5 Pro. Microsoft declined the opportunity to follow likewise, but now we have some idea of wh
