Silent Hill 2 is often regarded as one of the best survival-horror games of all time and just like Resident Evil 4 and Dead Space, it's getting the remake treatment.

Silent Hill 2 will be a retelling of the story from the original version of the game that was released back in 2001. 

Set in the titular town, Silent Hill 2 sees writer James Sunderland searching for his long-dead wife Mary after seemingly receiving a letter from her. There, James finds a number of ghastly horrors awaiting him, including famous enemies like Pyramid Head as well as the unhinged Eddie Dombrowski. 

Is Mary still alive or could there be some darker force at play here?
