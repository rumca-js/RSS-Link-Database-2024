The problem? Hadea is a hermit state. The only reason why R&eacute;mi lives outside of its borders is thanks to his mother, who smuggled him out when he was five. Unfortunately, she was caught by the Hadea border control, leaving him alone and eventually entering the Canadian foster system. Her capture, and the fact that his father was a blacksmith in a village called Jova, are the only things he truly remembers from his short time in Hadea. It's due to this that R&eacute;mi, despite understanding the rationality behind his parents actions, wants to reunite with them and learn exactly why they got him out.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/atmosph", "id": 1239660, "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-abandons-maps-and-quest-markers-and-channels-brilliant-immersion-in-return", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 107, "source_url": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Hell-is-Us-Preview-Header-1.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Atmospheric slasher Hell is Us abandons maps and quest markers, and channels brilliant immersion in return", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-30T15:00:00+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/5PRO-DIRECT-SPECIAL-SITE.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>A new DF Direct Weekly lands - as usual - today, with the team's thoughts on the recent State of Play, reaction to the most recent RTX 5080/5090 leaks and, perhaps inevitably, more PlayStation 5 Pro.
