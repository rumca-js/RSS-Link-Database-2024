<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I had a fan on my POE Hat start of have issues. It had functioned flawlessly for years and then started a cycle of trying to spin up and then stopping. I suspect that the bearings probably had worn to the point where it would not work correctly. </p> <p>I have tried to replace the fan with two different 25mm fans and splicing the original JST connector on the new fan and I haven&#39;t had much luck with either of those working at all. A couple of questions:</p> <ol> <li>Is there a good place to source the original fan ( and connector ) so that I don&#39;t have to mess with splicing the wires.<br/></li> <li>The replacement fans wouldn&#39;t ever spin up, and I wasn&#39;t sure if there was a current requirement on the fan operation that I needed to get closer to the original size fan. I was thinking of maybe a difference in inrush current requirements, but I didn&#39;t see that anywhere in the specs for the original fan.</li> <li>Is it possible

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been working on an RTOS for the Raspberry Pi Pico called <strong>RPi-Pico-pyRTOS</strong>, and I’d love for the community to try it out! It’s built in MicroPython with task scheduling, message passing, notifications, and more.</p> <p>If you’re interested in real-time systems or looking to implement an RTOS in your Pico projects, give it a go and let me know your thoughts! Feel free to ask questions or report any issues.</p> <p>Check it out here: <a href="https://github.com/Techie-Inc/RPi-Pico-pyRTOS">RPi-Pico-pyRTOS GitHub</a></p> <p>Still a work in progress porting from the original pyRTOS created by Rybec, I haven&#39;t tested everything yet and will continue to put in effort on this and expanding on features such as multi-core support.</p> <p>I&#39;ll make a <a href="http://hackster.io">hackster.io</a> tutorial soon as well to make set up a little easier. In the meantime, feel free to ask questions on usage.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm
