<p>Arm’s attempt to purchase part of Intel’s computer chip business may have been declined, but it once again demonstrates the important role played in the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2138291/the-pc-industry-has-a-lot-to-thank-apple-for.html">evolution of today’s tech</a> by Apple and its handheld Newton. </p>



<p>While it isn’t quite clear what Arm would gain by buying Intel, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-27/arm-rejected-by-intel-after-approaching-it-about-buying-product-unit">Bloomberg</a> </em>claims it tried to do so all the same.

<p>In a significant move, California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a highly contested artificial intelligence (AI) safety bill on Sunday, citing concerns over its potential to stifle innovation and impose excessive restrictions on AI technologies, including basic functions.</p>



<p>Newsom’s decision to veto <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047">Senate Bill 1047</a>, which would have required safety testing and imposed stringent standards on advanced AI models, came after tech giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI raised concerns that the bill could hamper AI innovation in the state and possibly push companies to relocate.</p>
