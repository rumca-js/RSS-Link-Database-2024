Well, I hope it was worth it, Rudy. You sold out completely, offering up every last bit of your integrity for the chance to push election conspiracy theories in court on behalf of a man who won&#8217;t even bother to look in your direction now that you&#8217;ve professionally disgraced yourself on his behalf. No matter [&#8230;]

I don’t think I’ve ever seen quite as much hype about a state bill as California’s SB 1047, a pretty terrible “AI Safety” bill.

It seems so long ago that people were&#160;trying to stop&#160;the worst aspects of the&#160;EU Copyright Directive. It was quite a battle, as Chapter 6 of Walled Culture the book (free digital versions&#160;available) recounts in detail. The final legislation was passed in March 2019, but it is important not simply to accept what happened and move [&#8230;]
