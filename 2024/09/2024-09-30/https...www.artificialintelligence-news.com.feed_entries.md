<p>As data management grows more complex and modern applications extend the capabilities of traditional approaches, AI is revolutionising application scaling. In addition to freeing operators from outdated, inefficient methods that require careful supervision and extra resources, AI enables real-time, adaptive optimisation of application scaling. Ultimately, these benefits combine to enhance efficiency and reduce costs for<a class="excerpt-read-more" href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/han-heloir-mongodb-the-future-of-ai-powered-applications-and-scalable-databases/" title="ReadHan Heloir, MongoDB: The role of scalable databases in AI-powered apps">...
