The rules state that there can only be 2 player armies when disputing for a territory. </p> <p>My question is - what happens if there are 3 different armies that somehow are in one territory disputing over that territory? After the 2 cards get played, battle happens and the first player gets to settle disputes first. Has anyone had this happen before when playing? Or did I miss a rule in the rulebook?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/boredguitarist\"> /u/boredguitarist </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ft1971/risk_europe_rules_question/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ft1971/risk_europe_", "id": 1240835, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ft1971/risk_europe_rules_question", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Risk: Europe Rules Question", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-30T17:13:58+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>There are several games which have not yet released that I have my eye on for the holidays, either for myself or as gifts to friends/family.

I got pretty upset because I couldn\u2019t figure out what I could do better and that\u2019s when a different post from 6 years ago revealed that you can have multiple turns in one generation. Please enjoy looking over my board which was played with maximum 2 actions per generation. Looking back I\u2019m actually quite happy I got this close and I obviously would have won had I read page 8 of the rules more carefully.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s", "id": 1237421, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fsq84i/i_was_going_to_ask_what_i_was_doing_wrong_but", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7Dd15qh-fnEjVRPbPWgof064627T--Dzhuiyk5hkXKg.jpg", "title": "I was going to ask what I was doing wrong but then I realized you get multiple turns per generation.

There are more lower ranked cards and as the point number goes up there are less cards like that. For example, there are like ten rank 1 cards and only one rank 7 card. Everyone takes turns drawing and playing cards and each card has a different action, similar to the action cards in exploding kittens. Each round, the objective is to end up with the highest point card. The first person to win a certain number of rounds wins the game.
