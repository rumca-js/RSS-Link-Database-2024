Time to BUILD!!!

In this session we'll build 5 web apps that use OpenAI's API for processing and intelligence functions.

Instead of using the AI through ChatGPT that gives a generic experience you can customize what you and your users interact with.

We'll be using Bottle as the Web App framework, and SQLite as our database backend. This will allow us to have a fully functioning app that we can use through our browser.

By building your own AI powered apps you can hard code in what users can or canno
