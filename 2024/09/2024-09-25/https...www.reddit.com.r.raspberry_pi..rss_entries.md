<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I bought a Pi 5 about 2 months ago and its mostly been relaxing on my desk. I bought it to turn into a DHCP/DNS resolver for our office. I bought the Pimironi nvme hat as well so that I could run off SSDs instead of the SD card. I had everything configured, and working great at home. I got it all working, brought it into work...and now I think the Raspberry Pi has died / broken in some strange way.</p> <p>I thought I would try to describe the issue, instead I recorded the issue. There is a visible diagnostics screen in the SD card video. There are no visible LED error patterns, at least they don&#39;t seem like any BIOS error pattern I&#39;ve seen before.</p> <p>NVME:</p> <p><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/1dQaRSl3680?feature=share">https://youtube.com/shorts/1dQaRSl3680?feature=share</a></p> <p>SD Card:</p> <p><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/UqalNWjPwPY?feature=share">https://youtube.com/shorts/UqalNWjPwPY?feature=share</a></p> <p>With the nv

Problem is I can no longer access the OMV dashboard using the ip address in a browser.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let me preface by saying that I made my first raspberry pi monitoring camera way back in 2012.</p> <p>I would not have been able to make this idea back then without a 3D printer.</p> <p>I want a raspberry pi zero case with built-in camera housing for a fish-eye lens camera, and/or an IR-camera with built-in IR LEDs. The latter is optional.</p> <p>My goal is to have a small device I can attach to the wall with velcro tape, or just set down on a table, and have it record my dog when I&#39;m out. The fish-eye lens is to get a wider perspective, as the default camera is quite limited.</p> <p>The software is not a problem, I already have a motion container image with pushover alert support and S3 syncing.</p> <p>But I never could find the right parts for this. Also I live in Europe so some US sites are very well stocked but just terrible to order from.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MinApp55"> /u/MinA

I am running OrangePI with &quot;Orangepi5plus_1.0.6_debian_bookworm_desktop_xfce_linux5.10.110&quot;. The reason for using OrangePI is that it can drive my display that expects DP output. RaspberryPI will not work. I have an odd screen resolution of 720x1920 (not 1920x720). The orangePI drives this display using usb-c display port, but the screen is rotated.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello I am here to share my problems with the Atlas Scientific Do probe. I used Raspberry pi and the DO kit from Atlas Scientific that monitors lake water. We were doing just fine in our prototyping stage. We connected are Raspberry Pi to our Isolation board and EZO DO circuit board. The readings were doing great, until I kind of fumbled. First we started to do calibration, many times. We also kind of kept the cap of the probe lose a little bit. Now the reading that are not possible like in normal water the DO levels were like 30 or something around that. It would also randomly spike to like 50s. And apparently you need to calibrate once in like ever two days if you use hot water like 80 or above. If I get help ASAP that would be great.</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Open-King2228"> /u/Open-King2228 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1foutw7/
