<p class="has-text-align-none">In <em>Slackers &#8211; Carts of Glory,</em> you have a big problem: You’re out of beer but the grocery store closes in mere minutes. To further complicate things, you don’t have a car or a bike, just a shopping cart with enough WD40 on its wheels to break the sound barrier. So, with no better choice, you must mount the metal stead and hill bomb your way to glory. Ergo, the subtitle. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Accomplishing this feat is as difficult and dangerous as it sounds, with your hoody-wearing shopping kart pilot more often than not being thrown into tree trunks or over cars in ways that would be horrific if not for the g

<p class="has-text-align-none">You know a Star Wars-ass name when you see one. There’s something about the cadence and the mouthfeel of a name that immediately suggests it could only exist in the Star Wars setting. It’s that combination of unexpected noun followed by a handful of Scrabble tiles chosen at random. It’s the bare minimum effort to make an Easter egg from an easily recognizable phrase. (Looking at you, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ello_Asty">Ello Asty</a>). A prerequisite of a SW-AN is that it’s fun to say: Jabba the Hutt is a Star Wars name, but Max Rebo is a Star Wars-ass name.</p>
