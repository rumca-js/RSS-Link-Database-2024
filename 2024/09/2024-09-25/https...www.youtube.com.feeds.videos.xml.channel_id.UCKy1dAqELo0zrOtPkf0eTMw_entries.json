Its echo summoning is used to cleverly combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you\u2019d expect from a classic-style 2D Zelda with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by Tears of the Kingdom. This experiment doesn\u2019t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn\u2019t quite as compelling, but it\u2019s an impressively successful one all the same. Echoes of Wisdom is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before Breath of the Wild without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced.
