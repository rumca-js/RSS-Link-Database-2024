<p>Generative AI (genAI) and “<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1612465/ai-hallucination-mitigation-two-brains-are-better-than-one.html">hallucinations</a>” go hand in hand, regardless of how well the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1627101/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> behind genAI tools are trained.</p>

<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, artificial intelligence (AI) is coming to enterprise IT. Deployment begins with tools to help admins manage their fleets, fix common faults, and optimize existing assets. </p>



<p>These tools are also coming to the Apple enterprise world in which Cupertino continues to make <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3529029/apple-delivers-enterprise-it-improvements-for-iphone-ipad-and-the-mac.html">important investments</a>. Apple device management vendor Kandji has <a href="https://www.kandji.io/blog/kandji-announces-kai-artificial-intelligence-for-device-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced its own AI for IT</a>, called Kai.

<p>Google’s new <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3511356/google-pixel-9-pro-fold.html">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> isn’t your average smartphone. And that’s putting it mildly.</p>



<p>The second-gen Pixel Fold’s unusual folding setup really does change the way you think about your phone — and think about interacting with Android in general, as I’ve learned during <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3511356/">my first several weeks living with the device</a>.</p>



<p>And while the Fold’s hardware is undoubtedly the underlying <em>reason</em> for all of this, so much of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold experience really revolves around the <em>software</em> and <a href="https://www.computer

<p>Secure PC disposal is a big deal. Companies want to ensure no data escapes from their corporate laptops. Even if you’re just using a PC at home, you want to make sure  your sensitive files — financial documents, private photos, and whatever else — aren’t recoverable by whomever might next have the system in their hands.</p>



<p>Back in the Windows 7 days — and before — wiping a PC before disposing of it was complex. You had to hunt down specialized tools for erasing a PC’s drive, and then you needed Windows installation media to get the computer into a like-new-from-the-factory state. None of this is necessary anymore; everything you need is built directly into Windows and available in a few c

<p>For years, Microsoft has prided itself on the time, effort, and money it puts into fighting climate change. In early 2020, Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith promised in a blog post <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company would invest $1 billion to make itself carbon-negative by 2030</a>. </p>



<p>Smith vowed Microsoft wouldn’t use deceptive tricks to get there, for example by pouring carbon in the atmosphere, then buying so-called “offsets” that claim to reduce carbon elsewhere, such as planting trees in a rain forest.</p>



<p>Investigations have found that offsets can b
