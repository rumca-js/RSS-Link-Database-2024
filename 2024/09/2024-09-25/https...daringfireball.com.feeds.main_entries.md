<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253023/mkbhd-panels-wallpaper-app-response-criticism">A swing-and-a-miss from MKBHD</a>. Criticism of the app is on two separate levels, but they’re being conflated. Level 1: the app is not good. Level 2: <em><a href="https://x.com/_ali_taylor/status/1838655765730726172">a paid wallpaper app</a>? — LOL, wallpapers are free on Reddit</em>. That second form of criticism — that there shouldn’t even exist a paid wallpaper app — is annoying and depressing, and speaks to how many people do not view original art as being worth paying for. But it also speaks to the breadth of Brownlee’s audience, which I think is more tech-focused than design-focused. <a href="https://mastodon.social/@scottsmith/113195506931136164">Scott Smith, on Mastodon, observed</a>:</p>
