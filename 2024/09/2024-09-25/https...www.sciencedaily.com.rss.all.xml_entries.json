A study on fossil plants draws a new scenario on the dispersal of the ancestors of grape plants and reveals that these species were already on the territory of Europe some 41 million years ago. The paper describes a new fossil species of the same family, Nekemias mucronata, which allows us to better understand the evolutionary history of this plant group, which inhabited Europe between 40 and 23 million years ago.", "id": 1212397, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240925122920.htm", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 188, "source_url": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the grape family", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-25T12:29:17+00:00", "description": "Researchers have discovered a new way to help liquid flow in only one direction, but without using the flaps that engines and our circulatory system rely upon to prevent fluid backup.
