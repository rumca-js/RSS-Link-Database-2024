<p>Amazon is gearing up for its Prime Big Deal Days this October, and some early Chromebook sales are already sneaking out.</p>



<p>Beginning October 8, Amazon will launch Prime Big Deal Days, the fall version of its Prime Day event each summer. Our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/prime-day">Prime Big Deal Days hub</a> offers deals in all sorts of categories, including special, one-off deals as they roll in. On this page, I’ll collects the best Prime Big Deal Days sales on Chromebooks, with deals from budget to premium models.

<p>Microsoft’s “new” Outlook app has received a ton of criticism as it doesn’t quite live up to its predecessor. Even worse, the new version of Outlook comes bundled on new PCs. Fortunately, Microsoft provides a download link for the “old,” better Outlook app — for now.</p>



<p>There have been multiple Microsoft email clients over the years. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/606623/the-best-email-client-for-you-may-be-mail-not-outlook.html">I use the excellent Windows Mail</a>, which has ominously warned about <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2277417/heres-how-to-fight-the-new-outlook-and-keep-mail-for-now.html">transitioning to Outlook</a> sometime in 2024.

<p>When looking for a top-notch VPN, the two most important things to look for are privacy and speed. While privacy is crucial to a good VPN, speed should not be overlooked. Faster speeds mean quicker file downloads and website load times, a better streaming quality, and just a better all-around experience.</p>



<p>I’ve tested numerous VPNs and run their servers through countless speed tests to determine the fastest services based on network averages. I highlight not only the fastest download speeds, but also the fastest upload speeds, and more. Read below to see PCWorld’s curated list of the fastest VPNs available now.</p>

<p>The PC processor industry is on the cusp of a major transition. We’re seeing the rise of what I’d call the “productivity processor,” with chips specifically designed for the work-obsessed, always-on-the-go professional. It’s a sea change in the way chip companies respond to user needs, and we’re not done yet. </p>



<p>We’ve talked about laptops with all-day (and more!) battery life for several years now, but without the performance to back them up. Now we have two processor families making good on the promise: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X platform and Intel’s Lunar Lake. These aren’t chips that just <em>happen</em> to offer long battery life. No, they were specifically designed to do this, from the ground up.</p>



<p>For me, a “productivity processor” must do two things. First, it must proficiently run office apps and surf the Web without compromises. Secon

<p>The core of this bundle is the 5th-gen Echo Dot, which delivers clear vocals, great bass, and overall great performance. The smart speaker is easily controlled using Alexa voice commands, whether you want to play certain tracks, set timers, look up answers online, or control the other smart home devices on your network.</p>



<p>But it also comes with a limited-edition Jack Skellington shell that houses the Echo Dot within. That means

<p>Software developers have embraced “artificial intelligence” language models for code generation in a big way, with huge gains in productivity but also some predictably dubious developments. It’s no surprise that hackers and malware writers are doing the same.</p>



<p>According to recent reports, there have been several active malware attacks spotted with code that’s at least partially generated by AI.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-deploy-ai-written-malware-in-targeted-attacks/">BleepingComputer chronicles multiple attacks</a> using suspected AI-written code, with reports from Proofpoint and HP making the case that these tools were generated in ways that no longer need the technical expertise normally required for large-scale malware attacks. You could call it the democratization of hacking.</p>

<p>OpenAI just <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1838642444365369814">announced via X/Twitter</a> that the Advanced Voice feature is finally being released to ChatGPT. This exciting update allows users to have more natural spoken-language conversations with the chatbot, bringing us yet another step closer to <em>Her</em> becoming reality.</p>



<p>Advanced Voice isn’t just “ChatGPT with text-to-speech” — it uses its underlying GPT-4o technology to analyze the tone and speed of your voice and pick up on non-verbal cues like body language, then itself responds with emotion in its own voice.</p>



<p>With five new voices, ChatGPT feels more alive than ever. The responses come faster so it feels like you’re holding a real-time conversation, and the update improves accents in (certain) non-English languages. Other improvements include the ability to provide c
