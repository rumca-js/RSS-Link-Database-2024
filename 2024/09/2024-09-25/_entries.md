## Analysis-Fed's bumper rate cut revives 'reflation specter' in US bond market

The Federal Reserve's aggressive start of the easing cycle has rekindled inflation worries in the U.S. bond market, as some investors fear looser financial conditions could re-ignite price pressures.  Yields on longer-dated Treasuries that are most sensitive to the inflation outlook have risen to the highest since early September, with some investors worried that the Fed's shift in focus from beating back inflation to protecting the job market could allow for a rebound in price pressures.  "I think there are questions around how quickly inflation will be able to get to the Fed's target if we're in a cutting environment, and if we're in an environment where the Fed is saying we want to support the labor market before the labor market gets weak," said Cayla Seder, macro multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets.

The benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow closed at record highs for the second straight time in the previous session, with most of the heavy lifting done by commodity-linked stocks after top economy China unveiled a large stimulus package.  However, a weak consumer sentiment report sparked angst about the labor market's health among investors who are worried if the Fed's decision to cut rates by a rare 50 basis points in the previous week was due to a sharp slowdown in the economy.  Odds that the central bank will lower borrowing costs by another 50 basis points at its November meeting have ticked up to 58.2%, from a coin toss earlier in the week, as per the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
