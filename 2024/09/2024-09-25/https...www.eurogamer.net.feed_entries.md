With a rapid nine-minute reveal and little additional information made available after the fact, this is our first look at the new hardware, PSSR upscaling and 11 upgraded PS5 Pro titles in the flesh. Going in, the questions were simple: is the premium $699/&pound;699 price point commanded by the PS5 Pro justified? Does the pro console deliver a genuine upgrade in terms of frame-rates, image quality and visual features? </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-hands-on-preview-is-it-worth-it">Read more</a></p>

But even in her brightest moments, Zelda has always played second fiddle to her sword-wielding hero Link.

Most museums, of course, strive to dig up the past and present it in such a way that contemporary audiences can easily digest it, but it's rare to feel this transformation take place quite so literally. As you leave the bustling modernity of Kyoto Station behind, concrete gives way to fields, mountains and farms, transporting you to the kind of rural idyll you might remember from games like Attack of the Friday Monsters or Famicom Detective Club.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-nintendo-museum-a-joyful-celebration-of-machines-magic-and-the-art-of-play">Read more</a></p>
