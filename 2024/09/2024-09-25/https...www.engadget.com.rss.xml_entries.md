<p>The biggest reveal at Meta’s Connect event was its long-promised <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-reveals-its-orion-smart-glasses-175353381.html"><ins>AR glasses</ins></a>, Orion. As expected, the prototype, each of which reportedly costs around $10,000, won’t be ready for the public any time soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Meta offered a glimpse of its new holographic avatars, which will allow people to talk with lifelike holograms in augmented reality. The holograms are Meta’s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/codecavatars/"><ins>Codec Avatars</ins></a>, a technology it’s been working on for several years.

The publication also says Sam Altman would be given equity in the new corporation.</p>
<p>OpenAI’s move to for-profit wouldn’t eliminate its non-profit entity entirely. The non-profit would own a stake in the new for-profit venture but it won’t have nearly the power as it did. An OpenAI spokesperson gave a statement that’s identical to the one they gave to <em>Fortune’s </em>initial report about the restructuring. Couldn’t they at least have used OpenAI’s software to word a different statement?</p>

<p>Although Meta Connect 2024 lacked a marquee high-end product for the holiday season, it still included a new budget VR headset and a tease of the “magic glasses” Meta’s XR gurus have been talking about for the better part of a decade. In addition, the company keeps plowing forward with new AI tools for its Ray-Ban glasses and social platforms. Here’s everything the company announced at Meta Connect 2024.</p>

<p>Google and Roblox have teamed up to create a game that teaches kids how to spot internet scams and to increase caution regarding the sharing of personal information online. The suite of experiences is called, and I quote, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/be-internet-awesome-roblox/"><em>Be Internet Awesome World</em></a>. Did Melania Trump <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/bebest/">name this thing</a>?</p>
<p>This “gameplay experience” exists within <em>Roblox</em>, which Google says helps it “reach kids where they’re already spending time to teach them the basics of online safety.” It brings kids to the “magical world of the Internauts” which is home to a number of minigames that address various aspects of internet safety. Some of the games focus on phishing attempts, while others emphasize “practicing kindness online.” Good luck with that last one.</p>

<p>Over the last year, Meta has made its AI assistant so ubiquitous in its apps it’s almost hard to believe that Meta AI is only a year old. But, one year after its launch <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-metaverse-is-getting-an-ai-makeover-194004996.html">at the last Connect</a>, the company is infusing Meta AI with a load of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/metas-ai-product-news-connect/" data-original-link="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/metas-ai-product-news-connect/">new features</a> in the hopes that more people will find its assistant useful.</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes is that users will be able to have voice chats with Meta AI. Up till now, the only way to speak with Meta AI was via the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. And like last year’s Meta AI launch, the company tapped a group of celebrities for the change.</p>

Just eight months after its release, Samsung has now revealed its 990 Evo Plus SSD. The company claims it’s 50 percent faster than the previous model and is suitable for gaming, business and creative tasks.</p>
<p>Samsung says the drive uses its 8th generation V-NAND technology, with a maximum sequential speed of 7,250MB/s for the 990 Evo Plus’ 4TB model and a write speed limit of 6,300 MB/s. The SSD has a nickel-coated heat shield to prevent overheating and the company says it’s 73 percent more efficient. For those looking for the random read and write speeds, they’re 1,050K IOPS and 1,400K IOPS, respectively.</p>

<p>Google has just made the history and geography nerd in me very happy. The company has announced that Google Earth is getting historical imagery of areas through satellite and aerial captures dating back 80 years. Google previously released a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-earth-timelapse-3d-130027183.html">Timelapse tool</a> that shows satellite images from 1984 to 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new shots will include everything from changes in a California reservoir over five years to images of cities like London, Berlin and Warsaw at the start of World War II. There are also photos of American cities like San Francisco in 1938 and images of the city in 2022. It reminds me of another site I&#39;ve spent much too much time on, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://1940s.nyc/map#13.69/40.7093/-73.99397">1940s.nyc</a>, which uses the NYC Municipal archives to show photographs of buildings from 1939 to 1941.</p>
