Kamala HQ Attacked Me For Telling the Truth About Public Education | Ep. 1450

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Kamala Harris campaign attacked me and labeled me a "top Trump operative" after I called for the Department of Education and the entire public school system to be abolished. Also, an MSNBC reporter is shocked and appalled to discover that normal voters don't care at all about January 6th. And police in Seattle will now only respond to 911 calls if there is "supporting evidence" of a crime. How does that work?
