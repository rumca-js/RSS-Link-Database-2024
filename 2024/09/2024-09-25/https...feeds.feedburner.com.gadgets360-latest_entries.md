A recent study published in the journal Neuron reveals insights into why both monkeys and humans struggle under pressure. Researchers found that stress impairs brain signals crucial for movement execution when faced with high rewards. The study, involving monkeys completing tasks for water, demonstrated that performance declined when potential rewards were either too low or excessively high. These findings have significant implications for understanding human behaviour, particularly in high-stakes situations such as sports and performing arts.

Researchers from Sandia National Laboratories have discovered that exploding a nuclear bomb near an asteroid may produce X-rays powerful enough to push it off course. Instead of blowing the asteroid apart, the method involves vaporising its surface to alter its trajectory. Using the Z Machine, the world’s most powerful X-ray source, they successfully tested this concept in the lab. This breakthrough could play a crucial role in protecting Earth from potentially catastrophic cosmic impacts in the future.
