There was no sign of the promised improvement from Julen Lopetegui’s team.</p><p>For Arne Slot, however, it was another hugely encouraging display as Liverpool eased into round four with plenty to spare. His team recovered from a Jarell Quansah own goal to dismantle West Ham with a brace from both Diogo Jota and Cody Gakpo, plus a solitary strike from substitute Mohamed Salah. Edson Álvarez’s deserved red card capped a miserable night in the north for West Ham.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/25/liverpool-west-ham-carabao-cup-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This competition may be somewhere down Mikel Arteta’s priority list but that doesn’t mean the Arsenal manager doesn’t value it. On a night that saw his fourth-choice goalkeeper Jack Porter become the youngest player to start a game for the Gunners at the age of just 16 years and 72 days in the absence of the injured David Raya, it was Ethan Nwaneri who caught the eye as the 17-year-old scored twice on his full debut.</p><p>After the fallout from their tempestuous draw against Manchester City, Arsenal never really looked like being turned over against opponents who used to revel in giving Arsène Wenger’s sides a bloody nose back in the days of Sam Allardyce as soon as Declan Rice had put them in front.

<p>The beauty trend that uses near-infrared light waves has surged in popularity – but can you achieve results at home?</p><p>If you are interested in beauty trends and self-care, you’ve probably encountered red light therapy (RLT). Formally known as photobiomodulation, doctors first discovered that red and near-infrared light wavelengths sped hair regrowth in the late sixties. Later studies found it boosted wound healing. Since then, it has gradually entered the esthetics field, initially gaining traction as an in-office tool for post-operative recovery in plastic surgery patients, explains Dr Prem Tripathi, a facial plastic surgeon based in Alamo, California.</p><p>By the mid 2010s, RLT devices emerged for use at home. These have surged in popularity as a non-invasive way to purportedly smooth wrinkles, heal acne and scars, improve skin tone and boost hair growth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/sep/25/what-is-red-light-therapy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s not just men, women and children who benefit – the economy also improves when fathers are given proper parental leave</p><p>Taking four months of paternity leave when my daughter was born meant simply that I was there. I was there when my wife was recovering from her C-section and needed someone to carry our newborn up and down the stairs. I was there to drive us to A&amp;E after our baby cracked her head, and there for the awful nights in hospital that followed as we waited to see whether she would be OK. I was there to spend day after day arguing with my incredible wife until we found our balance, our equality and a way to parent that works for us both.</p><p>But despite a growing mountain of evidence from sources such as <a href="https://pregnantthenscrewed.com/">Pregnant Then Screwed</a> and the <a href="https://www.fatherhoodinstitute.org/">Fatherhood Institute</a> that decent paternity leave is good for dads, good for mothers and good for babies too, the vast majority of

<p>British MCs are increasingly making bilingual tracks with their European peers – and, they explain, it’s not just to attract new audiences</p><p>The British are notoriously bad at bothering to learn other languages – and even listening to them. Across Europe, music fans are used to enjoying tracks even if they can’t understand the lyrics, but this has rarely been the case in the UK, where we do not often deviate from English-language pop. Even Bad Bunny, who was the most streamed artist on Spotify globally between 2020 and 2022, has never really been embraced by the British.</p><p>But while British listeners are mostly ignoring multilingual music, British rappers aren’t. Central Cee, currently the UK scene’s biggest name, has been seizing on bilingual collaborations as he courts a global market: back in 2022 he put out Eurovision, a posse track featuring seven rappers from across the EU – including frequent Italian collaborator Rondodasosa – and last year he featured on Eurostar by

<p><strong>Nintendo Switch; Grezzo/Nintendo</strong> <br>It’s great to finally get to play as Zelda, but working out how to take an active  without being able to fight is rather hard work</p><p>Unlike Princess Peach, waiting in a castle to be rescued from Bowser, Zelda has never been a damsel. She has always commanded magical power, even in the early days of the series, when she would enlist green-clad swordsman Link to save the kingdom. For the last couple of decades, since 2003’s Wind Waker, Zelda and Link have been something of a team; they are friends, companions, a powerful regent and her loyal knight. But still we, the players, have always taken Link’s role in the story. Echoes of Wisdom is Zelda’s first star turn in the series that bears her name. Sinister rifts have appeared across the kingdom of Hyrule, sucking its citizens inside, where whole slices of the landscape are stuck in suspended animation. Zelda can traverse these rifts, and close them – after conquering the dungeo

<p>Democrats were fooled by their social media echo chamber in 2016. Now Republicans may be falling into the same trap</p><p>In the aftermath of Donald Trump’s shock victory in 2016, one common explanation for why the Democrats had not seen it coming was that they had succumbed to the social media echo chamber. The fact that many digital platforms, such as Twitter (now X), tended to be dominated by liberals had lured Democrats into a false sense of security. This, so the explanation went, made them complacent, leading to inconsiderate gestures that alienated sections of the electorate: Hillary Clinton’s infamous jab at Trump’s supporters as “deplorables” was often cited as a prime example.</p><p>With the internet ever more captive to the caprices of timeline algorithms, the risk of echo chambers is even greater in this election cycle.

<p>Samara Weaving excels in post-apocalyptic horror where humanity has renounced words – which might have been useful to decipher what’s going on<br></p><p>Here is a post-apocalyptic feature that works well as an exercise in tension-release horror-movie mechanics and features an admirably expressive, athletic, and entirely wordless lead performance from rising genre fare “it” girl Samara Weaving.</p><p>Text splashed on screen before the title explains that this is all taking place sometime after “the Rapture” has thinned the world population, and some of those who remain have renounced the “sinful” use of speech. Weaving’s protagonist, who is apparently called Azrael, is living in a forest with her beau (Nathan Steward-Jarrett), surviving on who knows what and living in patched rags, when they are captured by similarly silent zealots.

<p>Puccini set his one-act opera in the 17th century, but its tragic story has had many painfully real counterparts all too recently, says ENO’s Annilese Miskimmon</p><p>Great operas have the ability to thrive through constant reinvention. The masterpieces of the canon transcend the specifics of their original settings as new generations of directors, performers and musicians reimagine them for their audiences.</p><p>Directors can be motivated to update an opera from an original setting to something more contemporary out of a desire to find a world more comprehensible and vivid for today’s audiences. Or, a piece that caused a scandal when first performed may now be so well loved that only a revolutionary modern presentation can remind us of its original power to shock. Being able to transmit the world of an opera from a composer’s initial vision into a future they couldn’t even begin to imagine allows us to remember that many were the Young Turks of their day.

<p>David Litchfield’s lost 1974 film captures McCartney’s extraordinary enthusiasm and skill, some killer tunes and a whole host of hilarious incidentals</p><p>I’m amazed, and there’s no maybe about it. Paul McCartney and Wings star in this engrossing hour-long documentary (or, if you will, rockumentary) shot on analogue video in 1974 (while Band on the Run was riding high in the charts) by cameraman and VFX veteran David Litchfield, as the band worked in Abbey Road on a potential live-in-studio album featuring Wings standards, early McCartney compositions and covers. It was to be called One Hand Clapping but both album and film fell appropriately silent, release plans were stalled, though the material surfaced in the form of various bonus extras over the years.</p><p>Now the film is restored and re-released and it’s a complete joy, quite as entertaining for me as Peter Jackson’s account of the Beatles’ Let It Be.

<p>The far right demands a pure ‘Irishness’. But our island story has long been interwoven with other ethnicities and diasporas</p><p>When lecturing on Irish immigration history, I usually start by asking: in which decade was the first footage of people of colour in Ireland filmed? Some students guess the 1960s. Others reach back to the 30s when the singer, actor and activist Paul Robeson performed in Dublin. The answer? The first filmed footage depicting an African diaspora gathering in Ireland is older than the independent Irish state.</p><p>The film, <a href="https://youtu.be/Jxb8y4zlyVM?si=yf4sfcZKAquTklyl">a silent black-and-white British Pathé reel</a>, shows members of the Southern Syncopated Orchestra, an early jazz band, at Dublin port in October 1921.

In the same month that Dubliners enjoyed the orchestra’s music, Irish republican leaders nego

It inspired me to veer off the reckless path I was on</p><p>I don’t remember the exact moment my sister asked me to be her birthing partner. Perhaps it was just a natural assumption we made, having always gravitated towards one another in times of need. The thought of it thrilled and terrified me.

<p>Whether you are planning to eat it today or keep it for later, here is how to pick the perfect produce, every time</p><p>September and October is harvest time for much of the homegrown fruit we enjoy in the UK – apples, pears and autumnal berries are abundantly available. But shops and supermarkets are also stacked with fruit from all over the world – apples and pears, yes, but tropical fruit and avocados, too. All of this may look colourful and appealing, but it may not be ripe at all. To the untrained eye, a ripe melon may be indistinguishable from one that won’t be ready to eat for a week. How do you tell if something is at its best, past its best – or rock hard and sour because it needs more time?</p><p>There are some universal clues to look out for, most importantly colour and smell. Generally speaking, ripe fruit is fragrant, and as emphatically the colour it’s supposed to be as possible. Beyond that, there are techniques and strategies for specific crops. Here’s how to gauge
