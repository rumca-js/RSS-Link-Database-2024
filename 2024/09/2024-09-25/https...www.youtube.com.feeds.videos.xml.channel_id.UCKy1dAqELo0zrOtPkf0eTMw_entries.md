## The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Review

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom reviewed by Tom Marks on Nintendo Switch.

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is far greater than a gimmicky spinoff led by Zelda instead of Link. Its echo summoning is used to cleverly combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you’d expect from a classic-style 2D Zelda with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by Tears of the Kingdom. This experiment doesn’t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn’t quite as compelling, but it’s an impressively successful one all the same. Echoes of Wisdom is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before Breath of the Wild without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced. Creating echoes aside, if this is the future of Zelda, I can’t wait to see more.

Marvel’s upcoming Thunderbolts movie is still shrouded in mystery, but we've finally gotten our first good look at the project thanks to the Thunderbolts teaser trailer. It doesn't reveal a lot about the plot of this MCU team-up. It does, however, give us our first look at Lewis Pullman as Bob, aka The Sentry. This Superman-esque hero is finally making his MCU debut, and that means the entire world should be very, very afraid.

Who is The Sentry, and why is he both the Marvel Universe’s greatest hero and its worst nightmare? Let’s break down the history of this mentally unstable hero and how he may fit into the plot of Thunderbolts.

Thunderbolts is directed by Jake Schreier and stars David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Geraldine Viswanathan, Lewis Pullman, Olga Kurylenko, and Florence Pugh. The film will be released in theaters on May 2, 2025.
