It's out in 2025 for PS5 with more details and gameplay to come, but for now, there's a new region in Japan to explore and a new protagonist donning the Ghost mask.\n\nPlayers control Atsu, who ventures through Ezo (which would become known as Hokkaido) for unknown purposes. Ronin are aware of her, and alongside a trusted horse, she also has a wolf, even if they're not quite best friends. For now, we know that she dual-wields katana, operates flintlock firearms, and can even play the Shamizen.\n\nWhat is the significance of Mount Y\u014dteiand Ezo? Why is the story set over 300 years after Ghost of Tsushima, and why did Sucker Punch move on from Jin Sakai? What could players possibly expect?
