Do you even API???\n\nIn this session we'll build 5 web apps that use OpenAI's API for processing and intelligence functions.\n\nThe OpenAI API gives you most of the functionality of ChatGPT, but does it in a way so that you can build your own programs to be able to complete the tasks that are important to you. Instead of using the AI through ChatGPT that gives a generic experience you can customize what you and your users interact with.\n\nWe'll be using Bottle as the Web App framework, and SQLite as our database backend. This will allow us to have a fully functioning app that we can use through our browser.\n\nBy building your own AI powered apps you can hard code in what users can or canno", "id": 1208947, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67a4oq3Pmp0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 102, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCD4EOyXKjfDUhCI6jlOZZYQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/67a4oq3Pmp0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Coding DIY - Build AI Web Apps with OpenAI API", "vote": 0}]
