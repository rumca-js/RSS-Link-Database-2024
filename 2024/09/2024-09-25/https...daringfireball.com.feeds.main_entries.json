Criticism of the app is on two separate levels, but they\u2019re being conflated. Level 1: the app is not good. Level 2: <em><a href=\"https://x.com/_ali_taylor/status/1838655765730726172\">a paid wallpaper app</a>?\u2009\u2014\u2009LOL, wallpapers are free on Reddit</em>. That second form of criticism\u2009\u2014\u2009that there shouldn\u2019t even exist a paid wallpaper app\u2009\u2014\u2009is annoying and depressing, and speaks to how many people do not view original art as being worth paying for. But it also speaks to the breadth of Brownlee\u2019s audience, which I think is more tech-focused than design-focused. <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@scottsmith/113195506931136164\">Scott Smith, on Mastodon, observed</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It\u2019s really interesting to compare the reaction from the indie iOS\ncommunity of <a href=\"https://iconfactory.world/@Iconfactory\">@Iconfactory</a>\u2019s Wallaroo to the mains", "id": 1212291, "language": null, "link": "https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/panels", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 489, "source_url": "https://daringfireball.com/feeds/main", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "\u2605 Panels, a New Wallpaper App From Marques Brownlee", "vote": 0}]
