Today, Steam Families is now out of beta and available to all Steam users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steam Families combines and replaces both Family Sharing (used to lend games to family members) and Family View (now known as Parental Controls, used to limit a family member\u2019s access to certain Steam features and content), and also makes it possible for restricted family members to make purchase requests for approval.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big change is that Steam Families now allows up to six people to play games simultaneously from a shared game library. However, if two or more people want to play the exact same game at the same time, multiple copies of that game will be needed.
