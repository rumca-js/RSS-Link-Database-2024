Former president Donald Trump’s and Vice President Kamala Harris’s tax policies are on completely different tracks. Trump has proposed about $6.5 trillion in tax cuts and would impose major tariffs on imported goods. Harris has proposed $4.2 trillion in cuts and would cut taxes for households under $400,000 and would raise taxes on corporations and the rich. 

WSJ’s Richard Rubin breaks down the very different tax plans from the two candidates.
