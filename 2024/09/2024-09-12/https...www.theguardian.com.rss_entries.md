<p>Uefa report reveals some eye-catching attendance figures and a thriving sport, but Ligue 1’s poor TV deal suggests nobody should get complacent</p><p>The European football pyramid is in rude health. That is, at least, the broad conclusion of a report from Uefa that charts the club game’s structural and demographic progress over the past 12 months. It shows that more supporters of men’s and women’s football are passing through the continent’s turnstiles than ever, and that lower-tier crowds are underpinning a 7% surge in uptake.</p><p>There is plenty to admire about the findings of Uefa’s club talent and competition landscape report. It makes clear, from its analysis of the 2023-24 season, that the bounceback from Covid-19 lockdowns is complete. Nobody would suggest, after a look at the data, that football’s appeal is waning and that modern attention spans cannot survive 90 minutes, or in most cases a significant degree longer, inside a stadium. The sport has a captive audience that

There was a brief moment, around the time of their eponymous 1995 album and its successor Curtains, where it looked as if the Nottingham band’s lushly orchestrated, emotive songs might find a wide audience: the former briefly reached the Top 20, the latter propelled them to a major label deal. But they were doomed to remain a critically acclaimed cult concern, bigger in continental Europe than at home. They were a band that remained slightly out of step, too twilit and idiosyncratic for an era when British alternative rock tended to brash primary colours and singalong commerciality, their image too down-at-heel and their mood too downcast, their music more suited to soundtracking the demanding films of French director Claire D

By this, I mean the kind of dinner you scarf by yourself when it’s so late it’s almost early; the thing you eat when nobody is watching and the options are meagre but you still regard yourself as a person of high gastronomic standards, who sees the lowliest of food items as merely the opening salvo in a negotiation.</p><p>Which is how I found myself one night pelting a chicken and mushroom Pot Noodle which just happened to be lurking in the cupboard, with freshly sliced spring onions and batons of ginger, shiny black ribbons of finely chopped toasted nori and dollops of sriracha sauce and crispy chilli oil.

<p>A self-help sceptic offers tips for contentment that start with abandoning the quest for super-productivity</p><p>I have always resisted anything that smells a bit self-helpy. Perhaps it’s because I’m pretty content with my pretty average, relatively low-stress life, where days seized and squandered pass in fairly equal number, attended by tides of frustration or mild satisfaction. Thankfully, as readers of Oliver Burkeman’s old Guardian column already know, he’s a self-help sceptic, too. He doesn’t trade in magic bullets or revelatory hacks. Indeed, he rejects the premise that life can be somehow mastered and the implication that, until we manage get to that point, we’re still half-formed.</p><p>Floundering is living, too, Burkeman explains. And if there is any key to success, it’s giving up altogether the quest for super-productivity and rejecting the nagging impulse to get on top of things. Instead, we’d all be happier and more productive if we did what we could – and no more –

It’s not their use that bothers me, but their absence.

How’s Mum, how’s Dad, how’s Grandad, how’s Nan? No one has ever asked, how’s Uncle, how’s Daughter, how’s Dog?</p><p>I mean, if it’s a friend making the inquiry about a parent, then fine.

I wish that I had oysters every single day of my life.”</p><p>Oysters are not to everyone’s taste but Karol’s enthusiasm for the filter-feeding bivalves comes as a surprise – because she is vegan.

<p>On the surface, little appears to have changed in the 30 years that bestselling author Peter May has been visiting the Isle of Lewis. But tourism has had a big impact – from Sunday opening hours to a deep water port for cruise ships</p><p>There was a joke doing the rounds when I was first visiting the Outer Hebrides more than three decades ago. On the flight to Stornoway, halfway across the Minch, the pilot makes an announcement: “We will shortly be arriving on the Isle of Lewis. Don’t forget to turn your watches back two … hundred years.”</p><p>And there was, indeed, as you arrived on the islands for the first time, a sense of stepping back in time – to a place and a culture that had changed little in perhaps centuries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/sep/12/my-love-affair-with-isle-of-lewis-scotland-biggest-island">Continue reading...</a>

And incidentally, no one keeps an unfiltered cigarette in the corner of his mouth with more style than McKellen. His character is a critic, and therefore arrogant, spiteful, bad mannered and unpleasant – and who moreover abandons his much-vaunted integrity and objectivity when it suits him, to salvage his career.

With the race down to four runners, here’s my guide to a party reeling in two directions</p><p>Reams of commentary will be written about the battle for the Tory leadership, because newspaper pundits confuse blowing hard on cold ashes with real manual labour. But if reading it all seems too much like hard work, then this column is for you. Today’s piece won’t be about “What the Conservatives must do to become fit for government”, since I don’t want them back in government, ever. No, the purpose of our inquiry is to suss out what kind of opponent the party’s next leader will be: the fights they’ll pick, the parliamentary votes they’ll force and the hurdles they’ll heave into the path of better politics. And I believe the best way to do that is with a game involving two words. As you glance across the contenders, ask yourself this: are they a moron or a bastard?</p><p>I am not in the business of throwing insults, but using two technical terms with

<p>Sadly it’s not a reality show where the 1% battle for survival. No, this is a wry, droll and incredibly understated Norwegian family saga about tasty pink fish</p><p>Billionaire Island! The title promises so much. A daring new reality show, perhaps, where the world’s filthiest capitalists compete to see who can survive the longest on an uninhabited Alaska islet. Episode five: an increasingly feral Richard Branson reacts poorly to the Duke of Westminster’s attempt to levy a tax on raindrops. Episode 28: the contestants vote to eat Mark Zuckerberg, only to find his innards are silicon.</p><p>Calm down, it’s not that. Billionaire Island is the English translation of Milliardærøya, which is … a Norwegian dramedy about salmon farming. It is about wealthy people – the characters are the dominant entrepreneurs on an island that is a leading player in the global fishing industry – and the story combines a struggle for corporate power with family drama. In other words, Succession with salmo

<p>Cattle are the most common cause of death in the UK farming industry – with some figures suggesting cows kill more people than dogs. So what can you do if the herd approaches?</p><p>“I remember feeling I was about to die,” says Jill Gilmore. She and her husband, Mark, were walking their dog, Finnegan, in the Stockport area and had just climbed over a stile on a public footpath. Jill was slightly ahead, with Finnegan on a short lead, when a group of cows appeared. “It was just instant,” she says: the herd of 20 or 30 cows attacked her, butting her to the ground. She doesn’t remember the details, just snippets: hooves coming down on her and an acceptance that she was dying. “I had kind of relaxed,” she says. “Then Mark came up to me and just absolutely shouted at me to get up. He helped me up, got my arms around his neck.” He tried to get them hurriedly out of the field, dragging her under a gap in the fence, conscious the cows could attack again. She finds it easier to talk about th
