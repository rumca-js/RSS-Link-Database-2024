Trump lost the debate. It's ok to admit that. It doesn't make you an anti-Trump op sent by the deep state to say so. It's time to move on to what's next.

And while the moderators asked about topics that don't matter to Normie-America, normies are STILL concerned about the economy.</p><p>Kamala didn't address the economy.
