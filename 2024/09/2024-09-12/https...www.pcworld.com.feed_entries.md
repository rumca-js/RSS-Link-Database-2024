<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1966306/best-mechanical-keyboards.html">Mechanical keyboards</a> can feel like dangerous rabbit hole. Plummet past the fixed offerings from big-name manufacturers into custom territory, and you’re faced with costs that run into the hundreds of dollars—and myriad decisions to make about each layer of a peripheral most people take for granted.</p>



<p>But as I found out when Razer unveiled a new entry in its BlackWidow line, there can be an easier way to ease into the world of custom keyboards. Take home a BlackWidow V4 Pro 75% keeb, and you have the option to leave it completely as is…or slowly work your way to completely overhauling it so it feels just the way you like. If you’re familiar with PC sellers like iBuyPower, CyberPowerPC, and even NZXT, which sell prebuilt PCs using replaceable components, this keyboar

<p>With Store Awards 2024, Microsoft wants to know what you think the best apps are in the Microsoft Store, reports <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/whats-the-best-app-in-the-microsoft-store-microsoft-wants-to-know">Windows Central</a>.</p>



<p>Both developers and users can nominate apps — including their own — and there are only two stipulations: first, a nominated app must be publicly available in the Microsoft Store as of September 15, 2024, and second, a nominated app cannot be owned by Microsoft employees. Games are eligible for nomination as well.</p>

<p>AMD appears to have forked its Ryzen Master software, essentially placing support for its older Ryzen and Threadripper processors into a separate release that contains fewer features.</p>



<p>Visit <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/ryzen-master.html">AMD’s Ryzen Master page</a>, and you’ll see two versions of the software: one for “Ryzen 3000 processors and newer,” and a second version that’s optimized for “Ryzen 2000 series processors and older.”</p>



<p>AMD’s Ryzen Master software is AMD’s version of other third-party utilities that provides a summary of a Ryzen system’s basic system parameters, including the CPU clock speed and temperature, the integrated Radeon graphics, and more. It also allows users to overclock their system, and store personalized performance profiles for various scenarios. </p>

<p>In Windows, you have options when it comes to viewing photos and videos, but you <em>probably</em> just use the default photo-viewing app Microsoft Photos, which comes pre-installed with Windows.</p>



<p>Recently, however, it’s come to light that Microsoft Photos has been causing computer slowdowns for many users.</p>



<p>There are two main reasons for this: first, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2024/06/03/microsoft-photos-migrating-from-uwp-to-windows-app-sdk/">Microsoft migrated the Photos app</a> from UWP to Windows App SDK back in June, and second, Microsoft has been <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2069425/microsoft-photos-renaissance-continues-with-new-ai-features.html">adding new AI features to the Photos app</a>.</p>



<p>As a result, the app has grown sluggish and takes longer to start than it used to — which can

<p>According to the <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide">latest Statcounter figures</a> for Windows desktop market share by version, Windows 10 is still the most widely used by a long shot. Over 64 percent of Windows users are still on Windows 10, with Windows 11 users lagging behind at around 31 percent.</p>



<p>So, even though Microsoft clearly wants to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2347757/how-microsoft-wants-to-urge-users-to-switch-to-windows-11.html">push Windows 10 users to Windows 11</a>, the company still has great incentive to keep working on the older version (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801718/windows-10-wont-receive-any-more-feature-updates.html">despite ending official support soon</a>).</p>

<p>The main draw of becoming a Windows Insider is that you get access to Windows updates before everyone else does. But there’s no point in sugarcoating it: getting to try out the latest Windows features before they become publicly available does come with some quirks and risks.</p>

<p>If you use a VPN, you’ve likely come across the kill-switch feature. But you may not know what it actually does or why you’d want to use it.</p>



<p>A VPN’s kill switch is one of the first features I recommend people enable with their VPN and something I always have on whenever I connect. It’s a simple, fail-safe way to guarantee your data is never accidentally exposed if your VPN disconnects. It’s so important that a service must include a robust and trustworthy kill switch in order to make it onto my list of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">best VPNs</a>.</p>



<p>Below I’ll explain what a kill switch is, why I think you should always utilize this feature, and how to use it with your VPN.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>No built-in tools on computers and mobile phones can replace video backgrounds if you don’t record them using a green screen.</li>



<li>To record videos with AI virtual backgrounds without a green screen, use third-party webcam screen recorders, such as <a href="https://recorder.easeus.com/">EaseUS RecExperts</a> for Windows computers, Vmaker for online, and ManyCam Lite for Mac.</li>



<li>Recording screens with virtual backgrounds on iOS and Android devices is more complicated. Because of the technology limits, you still need a plain chroma color to remove the background first and change the backdrop later.</li>
</ul>



<p>Recording yourself with a virtual background for presentations, job applications, blog creation, live streaming, or online meetings can help to engage your audience and add profession
