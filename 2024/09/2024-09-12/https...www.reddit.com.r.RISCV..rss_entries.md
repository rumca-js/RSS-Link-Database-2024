<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So here is a link to the issue :<a href="https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex-demo-system/issues/122">Unable to load a firmware if the size is bigger than a certain value · Issue #122 · lowRISC/ibex-demo-system (github.com)</a></p> <p>So in short is that if the program is smaller or equal to 9404B, it can load and execute correctly. However, if the program is larger than 9408, the core crash and the program cannot execute. I have to re-program the fpga for the interupt to work again. </p> <p>Any thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Secret_Fun_1260"> /u/Secret_Fun_1260 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ff3dq5/openocd_cannot_load_program_larger_than_a_certain/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ff3dq5/openocd_cannot_load_program_larger_than_a_certain/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have installed RISC-V toolchain on Ubuntu. On the bin directory, all the binary is generated for GNU format, not the ELF format. How can I solve this issue? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/himadridipta"> /u/himadridipta </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1feza0j/riscv_toolchain/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1feza0j/riscv_toolchain/">[comments]</a></span>
