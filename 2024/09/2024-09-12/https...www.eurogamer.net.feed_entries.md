Having teased <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s latest season of content last week, EA has more firmly detailed its upcoming Storybook Nursery Kit and Artist Studio Kit DLC releases, which are both now set to arrive next Thursday, 19th September.
</p><p>
Starting with The Sims 4's Artist Studio Kit, it includes - as you've probably already guessed - a bunch of new furniture items and decorative bric-a-brac that can be combined to make a suitably chaotic space for Sims to unleash their creativity.
</p><p>
"Set up your new easel in the centre of your studio," EA writes, "surrounded by tools of the trade &ndash; a variety of brushes, colourful paint cans and new inspiring still-life objects that Sims can paint from reference or draw creativity from." Expect drawers and shelves, tube

Tony Hawk has revealed he's "been talking to Activision again" about the Pro Skater series ahead of its 25th anniversary this September.
</p><p>
The original Tony Hawk Pro Skater debuted on 29th September 1999, and would go on to receive four further numbered entries - alongside dozens of spin-offs - culminating in 2020's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2020-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-activisions-game-of-the-generation">critically acclaimed</a> (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-fastest-selling-game-in-franchise-history">record-breaking</a>) remake of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 &amp; 2.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, plans to give Pro Skater 3 &amp; 4 a similar remake treatment were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-confirms-thps34-planned-until-studio-absorbed-into-blizzard">reportedly scrapped</a> after Acti

The world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is beautiful. At <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom 2024</a> in Cologne last month, Ubisoft refrained from providing a fresh chance to go hands-on with its highly-anticipated upcoming epic - for that, we'll have to wait just a little bit longer. Instead, the publisher gave press a look behind the scenes at more of the game's visual prowess, via a presentation on Shadows' environmental upgrades and new graphical fidelity.

Ubisoft's vast virtual version of Japan features in the first Assassin's Creed made solely for the current-gen of consoles - and it looks the part, with dense forests and towering mountains,

There's a clear PC focus, with the PlayStation 5 version featuring a trio of awkward graphics modes - none of which quite hit the target. I also get the sense it's a game tailor-made for the PlayStation 5 Pro, assuming that the features of the hardware are put to good use. Using the PC version of the game, I decided to look at 'BMW' on a number of fronts. Could the resources of the standard PS5 be better utilised for smoother gameplay? To what extent would PS5 Pro be a game-changer? And what of Series S: if Game Science had issues with the PS5 version, can Microsoft's junior Xbox hack it?</p><p>First up, let's quickly recap what BMW is doing on PlayStation 5.

## Caravan SandWitch review - sci-fi that benefits from the power of a real place

With her baggy, almost plus four style trousers and bouncing quiff, she's relatively close to Tintin, but I had a twittering sense that there was something else at play too. Eventually, I remembered it: Emil and the Detectives, the children's adventure by Erich K&auml;stner. More specifically, those airy, bendy, thick-lined ink illustrations by Walter Trier. Retro and modern all at once, as art struck on the cusp of the 1930s often was. Cheerful and spirited, filled with a headlong sense of derring-do. It's a perfect fit.</p><p>Caravan SandWitch is a lovely thing, an exploration adventure game without player death but brought into focus by a quiet sense of mourning. Sauge has returned to her home p
