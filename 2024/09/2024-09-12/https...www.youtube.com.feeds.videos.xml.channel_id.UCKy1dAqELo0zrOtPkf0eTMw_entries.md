In today's Daily Fix:
Microsoft has announced an additional 650 staff have been layed off from its games division. Xbox head Phil Spencer confirmed that no studios were closed during this round of layoffs, and that those affected would be receiving severance packages. This brings the number of laid off Microsoft staff to around 2,500 this year, following a massive 1,900 reduction in its workforce earlier, including the closure of studios Arkane Austin and Tango GameWorks (the latter of which was picked up by KRAFTON). In other news, the PS5 received a software update bringing new party features and controller charging options. This comes on the heels of the reveal of the PS5 Pro (and its bank-busting price). And finally, Tony Hawk is teasing something related to the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 25th anniversary, and confirmed he's had discussions with Activision. Maybe we'll finally see the Pro Skater 3 + 4 collection finally drop.

## Pete Holmes Knows Batman Comedy Is a “Violation” and That’s The Point | IGN Arcade

Many actors have portrayed the Caped Crusader, but none have like comedian and You Made It Weird host Pete Holmes. The Dropout (formerly CollegeHumor) Badman shorts, created by and starring Holmes as the absolute dimmest Dark Knight in history, were an early example of how high the bar could be for internet sketch comedy. Pete puts those chops to work, sharing his insight into how to do Batman satire right... while playing Batman: Arkham Knight as Badman. Pete's got an affinity for sneaky guys in dark uniforms, which he puts on full display marking and merking bad guys in Splinter Cell: Conviction while thoughtfully considering whether or not comedians are responsible for hecklers in the first place. Pete brings things home with a rousing round of Pong, as he reflects on how a life he once compared to Frodo's struggles in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers has flourished into something more akin to Aragorn's successes in The Return of the King.

The film industry has lost one of its all-time greatest talents with the news that legendary performer James Earl Jones has passed away at the age of 93. A decades-long veteran of the stage and screen, Jones was beloved around the world for his versatility, easy-going charisma, and endlessly listenable contrabass voice. That last attribute is also the reason most people likely recognize his name, because although he gave many committed performances in a wide variety of films, TV shows and theater productions, his most famous role will always be as the voice of Darth Vader from the Star Wars series. Commonly considered one of if not the most iconic villains in film history, Darth Vader is the role Jones will be most remembered for, which makes it all the more remarkable that the only aspect of the character he directly contributed was his voice.

Vader was always a team effort, from his striking visual design derived from Ralph McQuarrie’s original concept art, the physical performance
