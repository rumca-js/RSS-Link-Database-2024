After the low-point of the season (for me) last episode, we return to Annatar & Celebrimbor, Númenor, and Khazad-dûm!  We've got some interesting references and the first appearance of the epic Doors of Durin!

HOW IT WORKS:
1) Pull up Rings of Power on your Prime Video account on your tv, computer screen, or whatever device you want to watch on.
2) Use a second screen, phone, tablet, or whatever to pull up this stream.
3) We all start playing the film at the same time, watching together, then discussing afterwards
