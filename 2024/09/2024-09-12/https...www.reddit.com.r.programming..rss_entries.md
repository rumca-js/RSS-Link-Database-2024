<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h3>What Semantix Does</h3> <p>Current methods for extracting structured outputs from LLMs often rely on libraries such as DSPy, OpenAI Structured Outputs, and Langchain JSON Schema. These libraries typically use Pydantic Models to create JSON schemas representing classes, enums, and types. However, this approach can be costly since many LLMs treat each element of the JSON schema (e.g., <code>{}</code>, <code>:</code>, <code>&quot;$&quot;</code>) as separate tokens, leading to increased costs due to the numerous tokens present in JSON schemas.</p> <p>Semantix offers a different and more cost-effective solution. Instead of using JSON schemas, Semantix represents classes, enums, and objects in a more textual manner, reducing the number of tokens and lowering inference costs. Additionally, Semantix leverages Python&#39;s built-in typing system with minor modifications to provide meaning to parameters, function signatures, classes, enums, and functions. This
