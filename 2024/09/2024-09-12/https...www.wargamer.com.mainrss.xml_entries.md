								<p><strong>DnD races</strong> represent the different species found in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. Your choice of<strong> DnD species</strong> (as they’re also called) decides your character’s size, speed, and some unique abilities based on their ancestry. The 2014 version of fifth edition also features <strong>Dungeons and Dragons races</strong> that grant a character certain ability score increases. This guide explains each of the 5e races, from the core Player’s Handbook options to the rarer species found in supplementary books.</p>

								<p>Upcoming <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> release Duskmourn has done an impressive job tapping into new areas of horror, pretty much dodging any overlap with the gothic horror of Innistrad. Mainly, it’s a campy 80s-90s style of horror we see, but there’s also a strong psychological horror element shown, for instance, in the ‘Fear of’ cards. And with this new creation, Duskmourn seems to be dipping its toes in another subgenre: extraterrestrial horror.</p>
