<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m curious. Personally I feel like I’m NEVER satisfied in the same way as a great video game or movie. That “ahhh, that was great” feeling, where you can put it down and feel “closure” from the experience. I’m constantly seeking a new experience to satisfy the itch, that never seems to come. Do I derive fun and value from the experience? Absolutely. But it’s not the same as any other medium, for me anyway. A spirit island victory is probably the closest. </p> <p>So I enjoy my games very much, but never feel entirely satiated, they all have their drawbacks in some ways. So I end up wanting to try other games in search of that “one”. Does anybody else feel this way? Obviously there can be a level of dopamine seeking behavior for our little rat brains, but didn’t know if there’s something else to it that you guys may have observed.</p> <p>Sorry for the ramble, just wanted to hear other people’s thoughts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Cooperative card boss battler about superheroes beating villains together. At first glance it looks very similar to Marvel Champions, but there are several very important differences: decks are ready, there is no deckbuilding, and at least three heroes must always participate.</p> <p>For some players this is a flaw (especially if you play solo - three heroes are quite a big load), but on the other hand, thanks to such restrictions characters are more different from each other than in Marvel Champions, where each hero must be able to do everything, otherwise he will not survive in solo play. Everyone has their own unique playstyle. And setting is not Marvel, but original. There are even quotes on each card from non-existent author&#39;s comics :-)</p> <p>Rules are simple, fights are pretty fast, there are many different villains, many interesting combinations of action cards, and environment decks add extra special rules. Overall a great game. One sign

Then player 2, then player 3, then player 4. Start player rotates, you&#39;re now last. Player 2 takes their turn, then player 3, then player 4, then it&#39;s you again. That&#39;s a long wait.<br/> Making the start player marker go backwards doesn&#39;t solve it either, cause then you&#39;ll get two turns in a row which can be devastating.<br/> A game that does it interesting is Akropolis, first player has two turns each round, first and last.<br/> What are your thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/robaanrobio"> /u/robaanrobio </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ff137l/what_are_you_thoughts_on_rotat

My husband challenged me to find one or two games he likes so we can play them maybe once a week or twice a month on date night. </p> <p>A few of his interest that might help are; cars, tools, cooking and fitness. When we are with friends he does like to play cards. I don&#39;t think he would like games involving imaginary creatures such as dragons and monsters. </p> <p>I&#39;m not sure if it is relevant but we played it takes two and a way out on ps4 and we both really enjoyed that. So I was thinking maybe a co-op game? I also thought maybe heat would be a nice boardgame, but besides that I couldn&#39;t really think of any other games. </p> <p>I&#39;d really appreciate it if you have a

This means I bring their physical damage right down to the skull symbol but then they still have all their stats on mental and by that point I seem to just abandon finding the players and instead go off on a wild goose chase of opening new rooms in a hope of finding a mental item damage weapon. Is that right? </p> <p>How damage affects movement - my playgroup get very despondent very quickly as soon as they’ve had damage applied to their speed. Once their speed goes down to the skull are we right in th

So basically I want to know if any of you in the community have done this with very young children. is it fun for them? or will they get bored easily?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, yeah I know im not the first guy to make a post like this, and this post is probably gonna get banned, but bare with me for a minute.</p> <p>In this game, you play as a pot dealer making profits, buying properties, cars, gaining loyal following and using every tool to avoid danger, such as Mafia and other players working with Police to get you out of the game. Properties shield you from the Mafia, and hiding pot helps you avoid the Police. Are in for a &quot;Pot &amp; Hustle&quot;?</p> <p>Yeah name is not really that good :D</p> <p>So I am really into casual card and board games, but sometimes they lack the little complexity and sometimes even fun, so I created my own card game. I played it with my friends, and ofc friends say good stuff about your creations, so i want your opinions. I will link tabletop simulator link bellow, and if you want real life experiance, i will attach a pdf file, so you can print and play.</p> <p>Thank you for your time
