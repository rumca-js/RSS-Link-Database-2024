<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have an Amiga 500 that currently has Kickstart 1.2. A friend of mine who upgraded his A2000 to a higher version of kickstart gave me his 1.3 ROM chip but when I pop it into my machine, I just get a black screen. Not sure if that means the rom is bad, but it was working when it was pulled from the other machine. Not sure if there are any diagnostic steps I could take to figure out what the problem is. When I pop the 1.2 rom back in, it works fine so I know the Amiga itself isn&#39;t faulty.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/homestar92"> /u/homestar92 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ffdxc3/are_kickstart_roms_model_specific/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ffdxc3/are_kickstart_roms_model_specific/">[comments]</a></span>
