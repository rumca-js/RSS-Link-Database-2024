<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys,</p> <p>I am currently trying to generate large lead lists for clients by scraping <a href="http://maps.google.com">maps.google.com</a> . The information I want is the business name, their number (if available), and their address. However, I am curious if anyone knows of a query to gather all the businesses in a region? Also if anyone knows of a way to bypass the fact that google maps only surfaces a max of 120 results per query?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/youngkilog"> /u/youngkilog </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ffgkqs/need_to_gather_all_brick_and_mortar_businesses_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ffgkqs/need_to_gather_all_brick_and_mortar_businesses_in/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! I&#39;ve been scraping data from the internet for a while now, but I&#39;ve never come across this issue. I am trying to scrape data from &quot;Chalkboard&quot;, which is a fantasy sports betting app only available on iPhone and android. To do this, I set up fiddler as a proxy on my laptop and have been routing all traffic through the proxy to monitor any http/https traffic and look for Chalkboard&#39;s api endpoints. However, I don&#39;t think any of the data being sent to the app from their servers uses HTTPS! None of the responses contain relevant json data for the betting data. The only responses that contain some information are when I select a few players to make a bet--Chalkboard will send a request to their servers to determine if the selection is valid, and their servers will respond with json data that answers the app&#39;s request. Also, images for the players are sent through the app (and maybe the data could be encoded in

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, </p> <p>I am working on a <strong>webscraping framework</strong>(named <strong>Goscrapy</strong>) of my own in my free time. </p> <p>Goscrapy is a Scrapy-inspired web scraping framework in Golang. The primary objective is to <strong>reduce the learning curve for developers looking to migrate from Python (Scrapy) to Golan</strong>g for their web scraping projects, while taking advantage of Golang&#39;s built-in concurrency and generally low resource requirements. </p> <p>Additionally, Goscrapy aims to <strong>provide an interface similar to the popular Scrapy framework in Python</strong>, making Scrapy developers feel at home. </p> <p>It&#39;s still in it&#39;s early stage and is not stable. I am aware that there are a lot of things to be done and is far from complete. Just trying to create a POC atm.</p> <p><strong>Repo</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/tech-engine/goscrapy">https://github.com/tech-engine/goscrapy</a></p> </div><!-- S
