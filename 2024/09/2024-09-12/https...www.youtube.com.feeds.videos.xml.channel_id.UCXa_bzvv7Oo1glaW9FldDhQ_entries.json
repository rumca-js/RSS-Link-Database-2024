As more of an enthusiast product than a mid-gen refresh for the general public, it doesn't ship with a disc drive or a vertical stand.\n\nHowever, one must ask: What are the differences between it and the base PS5? Thus far, we know about the larger GPU and its 60 Compute Units compared to the latter's 36. Then there's the advanced ray tracing, enhancing the quality of the technology in supported titles without sacrificing performance.\n\nPlayStation Spectral Super Resolution is another, further closing the gap between Fidelity and Performance modes in terms of image quality. There are several other features, like CPU performance, a larger SSD, and much more, so let's delve into a proper specs comparison and see if the PS5 Pro is worth the upgrade.", "id": 1134533, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64STCmlVmys", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/64STCmlVmys/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "PS5 Pro vs PS5 In-Depth Specs Comparison \u2013 YOUR EVERY QUESTION ANSWERED", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-12T16:00:16+00:00", "description": "Konami have released new details about their upcoming remake, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.

It saw several important franchises, like Forza Motorsport, rise to dominance, while others, like Gears of War, had their start.

Grand Theft Auto 4 and 5, Alan Wake, Burnout: Paradise, L.A. Noire, Dark Souls, Max Payne 3 - it's almost an embarrassment of riches for those lucky enough to live through the era.\n\nConsidering the sheer variety and quality of its line-up, the fact that the Xbox 360 remained on the market for 11 years before being discontinued makes sense.
