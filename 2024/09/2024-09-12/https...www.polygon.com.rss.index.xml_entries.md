<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">This year marks the 10th anniversary of The Game Awards, and in that time Geoff Keighley’s annual event has established itself quite firmly as the leading awards ceremony for the game industry — the Oscars of gaming. It remains promotionally overstuffed to the point that it’s still arguably better known for trailers than awards, but that is changing. And although its winners tend to be pretty conservative, they are broadly representative of the critical consensus. Its voting body is composed of a wide range of international games media, so the chances are, your favorite publications’ and critics’ picks feed into The Game Awards. (Polygon’s do.)</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">In the 10 years it’s been running, Geoff Keighley’s The Game Awards has fairly convincingly established itself as the premier awards show for gaming; it is as close as you can get to a video game Oscars, which was seemingly Keighley’s intention all along. While the event is still primarily known for wall-to-wall trailers and game reveals, the awards themselves are growing in reputation, and the top prize — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/450195/game-of-the-year-game-awards-frontrunners">Game of the Year</a> — is coveted by developers and widely perceived as reflective of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24209076/game-of-the-year-2024-uncle
