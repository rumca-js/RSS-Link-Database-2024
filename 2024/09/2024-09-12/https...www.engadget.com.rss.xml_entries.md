<p>Valve has big savings on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">the entry-level (LCD) Steam Deck</a>. You can take 25 percent off the 512GB model or 15 percent off the 64GB one, dropping their prices to $336.75 and $296.65, respectively. The sale runs through September 26 while supplies last for the two phased-out models.</p> 
<p>The 512GB (NVMe SSD) <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-lcd-review-2023-still-one-of-the-best-handheld-pcs-140044516.html">LCD Steam Deck</a> initially cost $449, so the sale shaves over $112 off its MSRP. For some perspective, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-oled-review-its-just-better-180038030.html">the OLED version</a> with the same storage costs $549. This deal on the (lower-grade but still high-quality) LCD variant is a terrific chance to get started with handheld PC gaming on the cheap.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>OpenAI has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/" data-original-link="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/">unveiled</a> its latest artificial intelligence model called o1, which, the company claims, can perform complex reasoning tasks more effectively than its predecessors. The release comes as OpenAI faces increasing competition in the race to develop more sophisticated AI systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>O1 was trained to "spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would," OpenAI said on its website. "Through training, [the models] learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes." OpenAI envisions the new model being used by healthcare researchers to annotate cell sequencing data, by physicists to generate mathematical formulas and software developers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The NASEM report was written by a panel of aerospace experts and lays out what it sees as a possible &quot;hollow future” for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). It addresses issues of underfunding due to “declining long-term national emphasis on aeronautics and civil space,” <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-warns-of-budget-challenges-in-year-ahead/"><ins>an assertion</ins></a> that NASA itself is aware of and agrees with.

<p>iFixit embodies the spirit of “screw it, I’ll just do it myself” that has always been a trait of some tech enthusiasts. As one of the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ifixit-put-the-landfill-bound-samsung-galaxy-ring-through-a-ct-scanner-131529577.html">Right to Repair</a> movement&#39;s proponents, the company is now flexing its muscles with an electronics product of its very own. FixHub is a USB-C powered soldering iron designed to help fix whatever&#39;s on your workbench (and be easily fixable itself). The iron is joined by a 55Wh battery pack which acts as a stand and temperature control, ensuring you can fix things wherever you go.</p>
<p>Founder Kyle Wiens explained FixHub was born of frustration with soldering irons, and their limits. He was annoyed that he had to drag an extension cord out on the street to fix his car stereo. So the iFixit team set about looking for a way to improve what has traditionally been an unsophisticated tool. Th

<p>The Nintendo Switch is now over seven years old and due for a refresh, even if the storied console maker isn’t chasing technical specs, like its rival. Nintendo Switch 2 rumors (again, I’d wager real money it won’t be called that) have been bouncing around for years, even. Sometimes they teased DLSS, NVIDIA’s “deep learning supersampling” upscaling tech to add polish and higher resolution to existing Switch games. Other times, rumors just ended up being the OLED Switch — largely the same console as the original.</p>
<p>Will this be something like the Wii? Another left turn, console wise? Or something evolutionary, like the Wii U or GameBoy Color. It’s unlikely the company will ditch the hybrid form-factor as it effectively married home and portable consoles together — and is probably a huge reason for the Switch’s success.</p>
<p>We’re expecting it to be backwards compatible with the Switch’s game library, while Nintendo’s account system management should make it smoother to swap b
