I'm starting to take my old Kill Team models - which aren't "play legal" anymore in Kill Team - and statting them out in One Page Rules. Mainly Grimdark Future: Firefight but I'm also finally taking a harder look at the Gang Wars expansion, as well. I'll talk about this and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
