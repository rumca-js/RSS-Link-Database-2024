Francis Glassborow

Francis Glassborow is a long retired octogenarian mathematics teacher and computer programming enthusiast. He has used a multitude of computer languages and has a lifetime fascination with natural languages. In both cases he is interested in the contrast between languages and the way they express ideas.
In the late 1980s he was influential in taking the then C User Group(UK) into the long lived ACCU that many know and love. As well as being the editor of CVu for over a decade he has also been a regular contributor to that publication. In the late 1990s he founded the ACCU Conference which has continued to flourish since he stepped aside as its Chair some time in the noughties.
