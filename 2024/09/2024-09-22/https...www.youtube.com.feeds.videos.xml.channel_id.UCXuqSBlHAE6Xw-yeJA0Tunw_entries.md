Jawa, the sponsor for this season of Scrapyard Wars, is THE marketplace for buying and selling gaming components, peripherals, and even fully assembled PCs! Save BIG on your next PC upgrade, just like Linus and Luke did, by checking them out at https://jawa.link/SYW

The reality competition series you asked for is back AND NOW ITS ONE BIG FREAKING VIDEO! Luke and Linus go head 2 head to build the ultimate gaming PC on a fixed budget, meaning they gotta be cheap with all their components, like GPU and CPU. Find the deals to claim the crown. But things never go as expected, do they?
