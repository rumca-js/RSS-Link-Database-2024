Our lab FPGAs were broken, so unfortunately, I don\u2019t know much about implementing it on one. I also have never taken any computer architecture class. I\u2019ll hopefully be taking one next semester, but I just realized that we might not have one anymore. Although, I am taking a digital system and computer design class.</p> <p>Is this a feasible project within one year if I plan to implement the RV64I ISA, add additional extensions, and get it running on an FPGA?
