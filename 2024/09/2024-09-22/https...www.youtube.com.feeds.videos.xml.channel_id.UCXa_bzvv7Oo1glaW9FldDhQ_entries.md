Spiders' GreedFall 2: The Dying World is its next big role-playing game, but that doesn't mean it'll have a traditional release. Instead, the developer's going for early access, which goes live on September 24th for PC, to improve and expand on the title alongside the community.

This time, players control a Teer Fradee native, who's uprooted from their home and shipped off to Gacane. From peacefully convening with nature to handling warring factions and the Malichor. Where they go from there, their ultimate purpose - it's all up in the air. However, early access players will experience the entire beginning of the adventure.

There are six skill trees to invest in, six companions, three regions to explore, multiple quests to undertake, and much more. While there's still plenty to be done with the title, especially as further updates arrive, here's what you should know before heading into early access.

Though it’s not everyone's cup of tea to play retro games, those who are interested in gaming’s history should take the time to explore some of these titles, if only to see how far gaming has come over the years.

With last year’s Mortal Kombat 1, the franchise rebooted itself yet again, and is set to continue telling the story of its new universe with its upcoming expansion, Khaos Reigns. 

As we know all too well about Mortal Kombat by now, however, even in spite of the multiple reboots, the series never quite loses its connective narrative tissue across timelines. As such, here, we're going to take a deep dive into the franchise and recount its entire story, from beginning to end, in as much detail as possible.

Keep in mind that this is an updated version of a multi-part story recap we did for the entire Mortal Kombat series prior to the release of Mortal Kombat 1, which we have updated to include that game’s story events, and briefly touch on what the upcoming Khaos Reigns expansion is set to bring to the table.  We have also added high quality footage for some of the older games in the series which were not present in our original upload.

Picking up shortly after the events of the 2018 reboot as Kratos and Atreus prepare for the arrival of Ragnarok, the game deals with various personal themes between all the characters. Much like the PS5 release of the game two years ago, Ragnarok is still a seminal experience.

The new PC release of Ragnarok continues trends set  out by PlayStation Studios’ PC releases by having a feature-complete port that allows players to tinker with settings to their hearts’ content. The game also looks drop dead gorgeous on supported hardware, and is surprisingly scalable, from high-end gaming rigs to the Steam Deck.
