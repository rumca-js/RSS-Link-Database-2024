<p>The party should be toasting its landslide, but instead a state of near-paralysis seems to have set in</p><p>We may need to have a rethink. Over the last few days it seemed to have become apparent that Keir Starmer wasn’t very good at the politics of being a politician. Taking the free suits and glasses. Being slow to realise this could make him look hypocritical. Sitting back while different factions within the Labour party elite kick lumps out of one another. Making <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/sep/09/explainer-uk-labour-winter-fuel-payments-cut">a mess of the winter fuel allowance</a>. Unsure whether he was making cuts or means-testing benefits. Unable to move on from days of bad media. Generally looking a tad on the dim side.</p><p>Now not so much. Come the start of Labour’s party conference in Liverpool, Keir was a man on a mission. Willing to learn from his mistakes. Ready to do whatever needed to be done. And what needed to be done was … nothing.
