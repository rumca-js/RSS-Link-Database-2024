Reports of Batch-Dependent Suspected Adverse Events of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine: Comparison of Results from Denmark and Sweden 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39202624/

2023, Nationwide study from Denmark

Identified a batch-dependent safety signal for the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine

2024, Suspected adverse events (SAEs) Denmark and Sweden

SAEs reported to national authorities

Results

Significant batch-dependent heterogeneity was found,

in the number of SAEs per 1000 doses for both countries, 

with batches associated with high SAE rates detected in the early phase of the vaccination campaign,

and positive correlations observed between the two countries for the severity of SAEs from vaccine batches that they shared. 

Conclusions

The batch-dependent safety signal observed in Denmark and now confirmed in Sweden suggests that early commercia
