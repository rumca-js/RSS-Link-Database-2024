Instead, the developer's going for early access, which goes live on September 24th for PC, to improve and expand on the title alongside the community.\n\nThis time, players control a Teer Fradee native, who's uprooted from their home and shipped off to Gacane. From peacefully convening with nature to handling warring factions and the Malichor. Where they go from there, their ultimate purpose - it's all up in the air. However, early access players will experience the entire beginning of the adventure.\n\nThere are six skill trees to invest in, six companions, three regions to explore, multiple quests to undertake, and much more.
