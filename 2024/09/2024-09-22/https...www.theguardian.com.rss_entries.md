<ul><li>Daniel Gidney says agents ‘don’t care’ about county game</li><li>Long-serving executive wants higher salaries for players</li></ul><p>Lancashire’s chief executive has said agents are the main threat to the future of the County Championship. Daniel Gidney, one of county cricket’s longest-serving chief executives, criticised agents for not caring about the championship and instead turning players’ heads to the ever-burgeoning number of franchise tournaments.</p><p>“We need to have more of an open conversation,” Gidney said as he watched Lancashire turn the tables on Somerset at Old Trafford to improve their survival chances and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/sep/20/surrey-county-cricket-day-four-surrey-somerset-title-race-live">give Surrey the title</a>. “Coaches get blamed, administrators get blamed, but if you want to blame anybody, blame agents … I think the game as a whole needs to come together to find a way to support the championship.</p> <a href="ht

<p><strong>The Lowry, Salford<br></strong>The original magic that made the play the most successful in the National Theatre’s history still holds, with its visceral impact perhaps now more relevant than ever </p><p>Joey, the eponymous hero of War Horse, is surely one of British theatre’s most magical creations.

<p>What we wear tells the world who we are, but open any wardrobe and the clothes reveal deep memories of our true selves</p><p>On my first birthday I was given a charm bracelet and over the years various friends and relations gave me little charms to put on it: a tiny tennis racket, a dog that looked a bit (but not very) like ours, a key for my 21st birthday. Once I earned my own money, I occasionally bought a charm and added it to the bracelet – and it slowly grew into a miniature record of my life. When it was stolen in a burglary, I felt I’d lost not just the physical object but my life story.</p><p>Clothes narrate our lives in a similar way, though unfortunately you can’t fit them into a tiny box. They are an autobiography in fabric, gathering emotions and memories like a non-rolling stone.

<p>A working-class writer rails against the corporate world and small-mindedness in a striking debut novel written as a monologue</p><p>Mark Bowles’s striking debut explores working-class identity, masculinity and alienation. Like the author, Bowles’s narrator Henry Nash grew up in West Yorkshire and studied at Oxford, where he wore his learning “like a trench coat on a summer’s day” and struggled to fit in with his peers. Now he teaches in London, writes books and dreams of escaping the “anti-intellectual” English who “hate anything which doesn’t return them to the prosaic and the everyday”. Instead, he divides his time between London, Paris and Rome, “spending 50 weeks in the former and two in the others”.</p><p><em>All My Precious Madness </em>is written as a monologue. Henry rails against a world dedicated to the pursuit of money. He directs his anger at the digital consultant he nicknames Cahun (after the French surrealist), who frequents the same Soho cafe and destroys Henry’s p

Here, happily reunited couples <br>tell their stories about how it all went unexpectedly right</p><p>Society tells us that love stories should be linear, that marriage is until death us do part. We’ve learned, though, that things are often a little more complicated. The average adult may have five relationships and fall in love with three people (bad news for two of the five, then). Divorce has recently neared the 50% rate in the UK, a percentage that is now falling, mostly because fewer can afford it. Despite these statistics, we are still fed the idea that the ultimate goal is to find “the one”. Is it any wonder then, that divorce is often viewed as a failure?</p><p>We see the “success stories” of life in long love and we wince at messy divorces – what we see less is the grey area in between.

Too many Britons are stuck in neighbourhoods they find unlovely and depressing, jobs that are going nowhere and lives with too little sense of purpose. To escape, or at least to have some prospect of improvement, would be wonderful. Part of the mood of despondency that has settled over the country is that the already slim chances of improvement – as the Labour government’s dark messages of gloom refract and magnify – now seem negligible. The smart strategists who win elections have badly misjudged the national mood: they are much less smart advisers to government.</p><p>Public transport beyond London is in decay, forcing immobility on the poorest.

He reveals why he’s never been one to shy from a challenge </p><p>There’s no denying the physical resemblance between the actor John Lithgow, who is sitting in front of me, and the author Roald Dahl, who he will soon depict on stage at the Royal Court. On one wall of the London studio where rehearsals are taking place is a collage of pictures of Dahl in his later years. In the opposite corner is Lithgow, here for another day of production prep, neatly squeezed into a wooden chair. “I was first sent the script mainly because I’m as tall as Dahl was,” Lithgow says, flailing his long limbs for effect. “And I do look a lot like him. Though I’m not sure I’m particularly proud of that part.”</p><p>Beyond their looks, the men share few similarities. Lithgow is genial, enthusiastic, softly spoken. The Dahl he intends to depict on stage starts off equally delightful. “He’s a charmer,” Lithgow

<p>The number of people flying abroad to have surgery is higher than ever, but are the risks too high?</p><p>I was on hold to the doctor when I watched an Instagram video where a travel influencer with pink hair documented, “One of the greatest things we’ve ever done”, which turned out to be a “three-day comprehensive medical checkup” in Turkey. It was mesmerising, with the uplifting plinky music and girlish voice that sounds as if it’s sharing fabulous gossip when, in this case, it was detailing the cranial MRI, ultrasound, colonoscopy, neurology and urology appointments her boyfriend underwent on their romantic minibreak. And it did look romantic. We watch him being wheeled between luxury offices with an expression of wonder. A thorax CT scan! A colon biopsy! More, his eyes implore, I love you, more! The influencer has had so much interest in this post, she’s organising group trips, “so we can all go and get checked out together!”</p><p>To get a doctor’s appointment at my GP, I gues

<p>Great products that work on your skin while you sleep</p><p>It is 2.30am, and I am exhausted yet struggling to sleep. The irony that I am writing about skincare for night-time is not lost on me. But when you have to go out into the world having existed on little or no sleep, it will help you look a little less shattered. Your skin operates differently in the early hours, a time when it renews itself. As we get older, however, the ability of the skin to do this is reduced. So a product created specifically to work at night makes all the difference. And there’s choice. Some are really technologically advanced – Clinique detects specific skin concerns and treats them accordingly. There are masks, too: Sisley’s is soothing and great for dehydrated skin; Laneige’s is super-hydrating, has a clear, water-like texture that goes on like moisturiser and is perfect for oilier skins; retinol boosts cell turnover as it brightens and unclogs pores. And then you have the stalwarts, such as Estée

From puberty and the grisly onset of menstruation, in pictures such as Brian De Palma’s <em>Carrie</em> and John Fawcett’s <em>Ginger Snaps</em>, to pregnancy and childbirth – <em>Rosemary’s Baby</em> is the obvious example – women have provided a rich seam of inspiration for genre film-makers over the past half century. But look a little closer and two trends become apparent: the vast majority of female body-based horror deals with various aspects of the reproductive system, and it has largely been made by men (<em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/26/titane-review-julia-ducournau-palme-dor-cronenberg-agathe-rousselle">Titane</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/07/the-first-omen-review-horror-prequel-has-its-creepy-

Not that I was receptive to that information – I was far too busy dreaming of what else the world could offer. The excitement and glamour of the mainland was too gripping to let me take stock of the privilege of plodding towards adulthood on a tiny island. I took for granted the freedom I had: the slow speed limit that almost guaranteed my safety; the low crime rate; the fact I was never more than 10 minutes away, no matter how much I tried to escape. Guernsey was my playground and yet I spent most of my days staring at the horizon yearning for the energy of the big city.</p><p>I was raised by Londoners who moved to the island to set up shop in the 70s.
