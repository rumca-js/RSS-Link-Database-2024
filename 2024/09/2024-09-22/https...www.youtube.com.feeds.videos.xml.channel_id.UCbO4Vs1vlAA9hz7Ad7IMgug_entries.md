Welcome back to Inside Tabletop. In this series I talk to people that live and work in Gaming, getting them to share their insights on the business of game entertainment. 

My lonely solo Inside Tabletop run is over for the next month as I'm rejoined by Chris from Lords of War to talk about more current-events news in the world of Tabletop. With the Pre-Orders going live for KILL TEAM this weekned, I'm talking with Chris from Lords of War about whether or not small-scale 40k will get Games Workshop into new and different kinds of stores. Let's dive in!
