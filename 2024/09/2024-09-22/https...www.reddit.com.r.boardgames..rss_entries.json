Munchkin, Monopoly, Talisman, Horrified spin-offs, Dark Souls, - honestly, the list can go on and on. Mechanics, repetitiveness, lackluster compared to some more popular titles, art direction, randomness factor, low complexity, - regardless of the reason, which game do you feel has unjustly developed a bad reputation? Which would you defend in these waters? Would you go so far as to recommend one of these?</p> <p>I feel this is an important discussion, as numerous factors not pertaining to the quality of the game itself may contribute to a negative outlook, such as unreasonable comparison to another title, theme preference, category bias, low-complexity bias, and, of course, popularity. Showing respect for one another will keep the topic focused and expand on the information and viewpoints presented.
