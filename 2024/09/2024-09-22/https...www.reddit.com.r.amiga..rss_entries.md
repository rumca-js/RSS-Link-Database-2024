<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Very niche and specific, i guess, but is there any / a simple way to mount an .ADF image as DF0: and then reboot the amiga so it boots from that mounted ADF? </p> <p>I have many Floppy images on my Compact Flash HDD currently, and instead of writing them to a physical floppy disk, can i perhaps just mount them? (A real DF0: is physically present, though)</p> <p>Also can i have a software ram/kick/chipset downgrade that is persistent after Reboot, so old and picky games would run? Does anybody do that successfully? </p> <p>I have a working way to mount ADFs to a virtual FDF0: under workbench and i also have TUDE Gui to degrade, but somehow it is not persistent when i reboot (also it crashes with some settings).</p> <p>System: A1200 with 16mb Blizzard 030, Kick 3.0 , internal CF, DF0 floppy drive present.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/multioptional"> /u/multioptional </a> <br/> <span><a href="http

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Apologies if this has been asked a hundred times before, but I must admit I&#39;m finding it a bit confusing. I&#39;m an old IBM PC guy and am just dipping my toe into the Amiga scene now. Basically I&#39;m looking at the pros and cons of a Gotek vs an internal HDD. The Gotek is straightforward enough but could someone please give me some advice re putting a 2.5&quot; HDD inside the Amiga. I&#39;m looking at 2.5&quot; HDDs because I have quite a few of them lying around from old laptops etc. and I think one of them should be big enough for the Amiga - provided there is a 44 pin IDE interface available. I also read that I will need more RAM for WHDload then the stock 1M, but does it need to be chip ram, fast ram etc? Does the IDE interface require a faster processor, and for that matter which IDE interface is a good fit for the A500+ ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deanodley"> /u/deanodley </a> <

Now I dont know how to configure again the bridge board and I am thinking to sell it. I don’t know if I will sell it all together or only the bridgeboard. Of course I will sell it in good conditions but for repair.
