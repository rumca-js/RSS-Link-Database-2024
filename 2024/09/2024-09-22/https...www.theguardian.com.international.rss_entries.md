Willis won his second straight start subbing for Jordan Love. He also got a sweet measure of revenge against the team that traded him to Green Bay in August. Willis accounted for 134 of the Packers’ 137 yards in the first quarter. He finished with 202 yards passing and 73 rushing. The Titans fell to 0-3 under first-year coach Brian Callahan, their worst start since losing the first six of 2009.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/22/nfl-roundup-sunday-football-scores">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was tense, it was physical, it was loaded with drama and storylines and that was before the momentum in this Premier League title-shaper had swung again – away from Arsenal just before half-time. Mikel Arteta’s team had recovered from an initial storm that featured Erling Haaland putting Manchester City in front with his 100th goal for them – in only his 105th appearance.</p><p>Riccardo Calafiori’s long-range equaliser on his full Arsenal debut was a thing of beauty, City raging over the ethics of a quickly taken free-kick by Thomas Partey in the buildup and the visitors felt the surge of possibility when Gabriel Magalhães headed them in front, from a set-piece, of course. No team does them quite like Arsenal these days.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/22/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The ‘unstoppable’ 27-year-old silenced his doubters and left Joshua defiant but badly hurt on an unforgettable night</p><p>“I’ve only got a few words to say,” Daniel Dubois began in his typically shy and reclusive way just a few minutes after he had bludgeoned Anthony Joshua to the canvas for the fourth and final time to knock out the former two-time heavyweight champion of the world. It was a pitiless display of punching power and yet there was far more than brute force to his stunning victory.

<p>An impressive turnout of Arsenal fans arrived at the Emirates Stadium hoping the women’s team would set the tone for the day, with the men’s team playing the same opposition later in the day. They may not have delivered victory on the opening weekend of the WSL season, but they certainly put on a show, scoring first and last in a thrilling 2-2 draw with Manchester City, in which the hosts’ record goalscorer, Vivianne Miedema, was on the scoresheet for her new club.</p><p>Jonas Eidevall made three changes to the side that suffered a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/18/hacken-arsenal-womens-champions-league-match-report">1-0 defeat by BK Häcken</a> in Gothenburg on Wednesday, with Stina Blackstenius, Caitlin Foord and Frida Maanum all coming into the starting XI.

## For 61 years I’ve been too lazy to use sunscreen. How badly have I damaged my skin – and is it too late to change?

<p>Too much sun can lead to everything from wrinkles to skin cancer. Time to get myself checked out – and turn over a new leaf</p><p>Like so many men, I’ve made a terrible job of looking after my skin. Born in 1963, I grew up at a time when every pasty white Briton wanted to be tanned, and the darker the better. It suggested you’d been abroad, when travel was expensive and therefore glamorous. Sure, you could buy Coppertone or<strong> </strong>Ambre Solaire – but it didn’t offer much protection even if you used it. The term SPF, or sun protection factor, was introduced in 1974, but I don’t think I heard it for another 10 years, by which time I had been burned more times than you could count.</p><p>And that set the pattern for most of my life. However fierce the sun, slapping on sunscreen, or even wearing a baseball cap, felt like too much of a faff, or too late, or both. I’ve grown a little more sensible since I met a woman who takes care of her own skin and that of her kids. But even

<p>Remember that your anger is on your side. It is a useful emotion</p><p><em><strong>The question </strong>I am a 42-year-old woman about to undergo a mastectomy to treat breast cancer. I’m increasingly feeling what I think is anger, which has always been a difficult emotion for me to experience in myself. In the past I’ve squashed it down and turned it inwards, resulting in a low mood. However, I feel as if I’m about to have a reckoning with anger. It’s coming for me. My usual coping mechanism for negative emotions is shaking them out of my body by running, but I won’t be able to do that for a while. I feel I’ll need to go through the anger and come out the other side, but I am afraid. I know the fear and the anger are connected. I worry about the effect anger will have on me, as the only angry woman tropes I know are negative ones. More than that, though, I worry about loved ones as I don’t want my anger to scare them, making me the one they must walk on eggshells around. What I wa

<p>Concern for the Democrats’ political future appears to be driving the White House’s policy of containment</p><p>The Middle East crisis has reached an extremely dangerous juncture. That’s a statement made many times since the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel on 7 October last year precipitated a descent into war. Yet it is precisely because nearly 12 months of international diplomacy, on-off ceasefire and hostage negotiations, protests, sanctions threats, lawsuits and political and moral pressure on the warring parties have failed to halt the slaughter in Gaza and elsewhere that this moment is especially fraught. With no end in sight, no obvious way out, no credible “peace process”, unchecked escalation grows more likely. Fear, anger, political opportunism and sheer desperation overwhelm calm, objective thinking about actions and consequences. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/20/top-hezbollah-leader-airstrike-beirut-israel">The dogs of war run free</a>.</p><p>Las
