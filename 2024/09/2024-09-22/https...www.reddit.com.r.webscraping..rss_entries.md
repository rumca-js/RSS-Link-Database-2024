<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am new to web scraping. I am a bit skeptical about not getting my ip blacklisted by the site I am blacklisting, for it I am using multiple steps:<br/> 1. rate limiting the requests<br/> 2. using a browser (be it headless) instead of requests<br/> 3. adding actual browser lookalike headers.<br/> Please suggest if any step I am missing. Now I want to use proxies. I am planning to just scrape free proxies, validate them, and then feed them to the scraping systems. But these proxies are unstable/unreliable for long-term usage (i.e. each proxy may be active for only some time). There I see three options:<br/> 1. open a browser context with a fixed proxy<br/> 2. apply proxy per page<br/> 3. applying proxy per request.<br/> Currently, I simply open a headless browser and process multiple tabs in the browser in a single-threaded asynchronous fashion (as multiple processes seem to explode the memory consumption). I see setting proxy per page to be the most o

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello and thanks in advance for any scraping advice I can get.</p> <p>So here is the situation,</p> <p>I need an expansive Excel list of wedding planners, wedding florists, wedding caterers, wedding DJ&#39;s, wedding venues, and wedding photographers. I need this list in virtually every major city in the usa. What I need for each vendor would be NAME, EMAIL, and WEBSITE to put in a spreadsheet.</p> <p>I have no experience doing this sort of thing besides manually going through expansive wedding websites that list many vendors one by one but this is expensive when you need this info in many cities and you are doing it manually. I have looked into scraping software and even tried to hire someone who knows this stuff to show me how to use these tools but apparently it can&#39;t gather the emails because with the wedding vendor list websites, you have to manually click on their website and then find the email, the rest is pretty easy for scraping software
