The Gotek is straightforward enough but could someone please give me some advice re putting a 2.5&quot; HDD inside the Amiga. I&#39;m looking at 2.5&quot; HDDs because I have quite a few of them lying around from old laptops etc. and I think one of them should be big enough for the Amiga - provided there is a 44 pin IDE interface available. I also read that I will need more RAM for WHDload then the stock 1M, but does it need to be chip ram, fast ram etc? Does the IDE interface require a faster processor, and for that matter which IDE interface is a good fit for the A500+ ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/deanodley\"> /u/deanodley </a> <", "id": 1192481, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fn372c/a500_hard_disk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 458, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "A500+ Hard Disk", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-22T18:01:58+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fmzdyu/v11_amiganet_boards/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tFBmf-N9-2no1HKW2FP7xjNWXBvh_bpK4ACE6n243gk.jpg\" alt=\"V1.1 amiganet boards\" title=\"V1.1 amiganet boards\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ll post plotter papers when I find them, should have 1.2A somewhere ...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Slugity\"> /u/Slugity </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fmzdyu\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fmzdyu/v11_amiganet_boards/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 1191886, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fmzdyu/v11_amiganet_boards", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 458, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tFBmf-N9-2no1HKW2FP7xjNWXBvh_bpK4ACE6n243gk.jpg", "title": "V1.1 amiganet boards", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-22T17:46:02+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The PiStorm came with zero instructions<br/> Same with the RGB2HDMI and the GoTek, no instructions came with any of it.</p> <p>The only guide I could find was for the A500, which is not the same as the 2K version.
