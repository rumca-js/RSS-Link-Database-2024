A new statistical technique developed by a researcher at the Texas A&M University School of Public Health and colleagues elsewhere offers fresh insights into how diseases affect individual cells. This innovative method, known as hybrid Bayesian inference, blends different statistical approaches to better understand complex diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which has long puzzled scientists due to its elusive nature.
