I know i can use some terminal software to connect to linux but i also need to be able to go into the bios without always moving the PC to my room, connecting it to a monitor just because i want to do sth. in the bios or reinstall an os etc..</p> <p>So i need to be able to get image and also be able to make inputs. I know vnc but i dont have an intel vpro or amd pro cpu, i have an i5-4590, so i can&#39;t access bios with that. if there is any workaround without buying a whole new Server with a pro cpu it would be nice. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Shindikat\"> /u/Shindikat </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fmq6wk/cheapest_way_to_get_video_output_over_the_network/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fmq6wk/cheapest_way_to_get_vi", "id": 1190378, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fmq6wk/cheapest_way_to_get_video_output_over_the_network", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "cheapest way to get video output over the network", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-22T09:02:28+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I&#39;m having a fairly simple setup for exposing a few of my services when needed, it looks like that :</p> <p><a href=\"http://y.x.com\"><code>y.x.com</code></a> <code>{</code></p> <p><code>reverse_proxy :8096</code></p> <p><code>}</code></p> <p>The one thing I&#39;m wondering is, am I missing something on not adding some <code>encode xxzip</code> or anything of that kind when defining my reverse proxies ?</p> <p>Is it really useful or is it just good practice that I should put as soon as possible ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Daitan_\"> /u/Daitan_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fmoy6x/anything_to_add_to_a_caddyfile_for_simple/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fmoy6x/anything_to_add_to_a_caddyfile_for_simple/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1190187, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fmoy6x/anything_to_add_to_a_caddyfile_for_simple", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Anything to add to a Caddyfile for simple Homeserver ?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-22T08:29:09+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello folks</p> <p>I find myself using SSH (and such) quite a lot</p> <p>However, my personal computer has quite some dotfiles and tools (zsh, tmux, nvim, command aliases, maybe some future nix config files, etc\u2026) which I became habitued to and that improve my productivity and ergonomy </p> <p>What&#39;s the best ways to make them to be automatically installed and mounted on the remote ?</p> <p>I am thinking about two options : temporary or permanent (installed on a different userspace which is optionally deleted at logout, updated with the new tools and dotfiles at every login)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/The-Malix\"> /u/The-Malix </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fmohuy/automatic_install_of_dotfiles_and_tools/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fmohuy/automatic_install_of_dotfiles_and_tools/\">[comments]</", "id": 1190015, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fmohuy/automatic_install_of_dotfiles_and_tools", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 450, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Automatic install of dotfiles and tools", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-22T08:22:22+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I was having a Google Suite for Education account with loads of storage, big G then lately decided to reduce the storage to 10GB only and my mail box alone was already bigger than that.
