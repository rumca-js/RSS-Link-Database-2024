But the moment I try to boot u-boot, compiled using the &quot;raspberry arm64 generic&quot; config, it just lands on the default rainbow output of the GPU.</p> <p>It works fine on qemu emulating the rpi3 with 512mb of ram. And I don&#39;t have a uart/JTAG/... cable to see if serial works either and ideally I&#39;d rather not buy one just for this.</p> <p>Is there something obvious I&#39;m missing? Short of this I can always work down from the Linux kernel but that would take a while. My goal is to be as close to the metal as possible, but a very minimal binary with a framebuffer set up would have been grand.</p> <p>Cheers, thanks for any help</p> </div", "id": 1191783, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fmwy85/uboot_on_the_pi_zero_2_w", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "U-boot on the pi zero 2 w", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-22T15:49:14+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fmwdx5/recreating_80s_broadcast_tv_with_a_raspberry_pi/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/tvMNNRKcLb6qdR4egLf61f9pZNagHcovQ4azLpR4I8E.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04dcdb70bc634438e1be2febeacd8d9d358dea55\" alt=\"Recreating 80's broadcast TV with a Raspberry Pi: My Nostalgia Machine\" title=\"Recreating 80's broadcast TV with a Raspberry Pi: My Nostalgia Machine\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/wrong-dog\"> /u/wrong-dog </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_BkD85yIg0\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fmwdx5/recreating_80s_broadcast_tv_with_a_raspberry_pi/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 1191556, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fmwdx5/recreating_80s_broadcast_tv_with_a_raspberry_pi", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://external-preview.redd.it/tvMNNRKcLb6qdR4egLf61f9pZNagHcovQ4azLpR4I8E.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=04dcdb70bc634438e1be2febeacd8d9d358dea55", "title": "Recreating 80's broadcast TV with a Raspberry Pi: My Nostalgia Machine", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-22T14:02:37+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fmu02h/made_this_star_trail_image_with_a_pi_4_and_camera/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/gpohoepkadqd1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28ea7239f3f53563620c96267b16fa9350f81bf2\" alt=\"Made this star trail image with a pi 4 and camera module v3\" title=\"Made this star trail image with a pi 4 and camera module v3\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gudge2007\"> /u/Gudge2007 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/gpohoepkadqd1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fmu02h/made_this_star_trail_image_with_a_pi_4_and_camera/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>", "id": 1191046, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fmu02h/made_this_star_trail_image_with_a_pi_4_and_camera", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 470, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://preview.redd.it/gpohoepkadqd1.jpeg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=28ea7239f3f53563620c96267b16fa9350f81bf2", "title": "Made this star trail image with a pi 4 and camera module v3", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-22T08:58:43+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I am not really experienced in electronics, but I would like to connect a electronic water pistol to my Raspberry Pi, which is connected to motion detector (PIR-Sensor).
