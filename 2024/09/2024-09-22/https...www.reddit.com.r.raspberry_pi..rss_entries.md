## U-boot on the pi zero 2 w

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, I&#39;ve been trying to get u-boot working on my raspberry pi zero 2 w</p> <p>It seems to boot fine with a very minimal Linux install. no overlays, only this board&#39;s dts, the startup/boot init firmware, and the kernel which I compiled myself to make sure the tooling was working fine. But the moment I try to boot u-boot, compiled using the &quot;raspberry arm64 generic&quot; config, it just lands on the default rainbow output of the GPU.</p> <p>It works fine on qemu emulating the rpi3 with 512mb of ram. And I don&#39;t have a uart/JTAG/... cable to see if serial works either and ideally I&#39;d rather not buy one just for this.</p> <p>Is there something obvious I&#39;m missing? Short of this I can always work down from the Linux kernel but that would take a while. My goal is to be as close to the metal as possible, but a very minimal binary with a framebuffer set up would have been grand.</p> <p>Cheers, thanks for any help</p> </div

## Connecting electric Water Pistol to Raspberry Pi GPIO

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I am not really experienced in electronics, but I would like to connect a electronic water pistol to my Raspberry Pi, which is connected to motion detector (PIR-Sensor). I would like to trigger the water pistol by setting the PIN on high using a transistor. Background: I want to create a device that stops our cat peeing against our barbecue cover...</p> <p>I am a bit unsure about the correct circuit I should use here. My plan is to replace the electric button of the water pistol by a transistor (NP2222). Then, I also wanted use a snubbing diode (1N4007) to avoid voltage spikes that could kill the transistor. </p> <p>Is this reasoning correct? Can somebody explain me what the correct wiring would be between the Li-Ion battery, the water pistol motor, transistor, snubbing diode and raspberry Pi (GPIO18 and GND)?</p> <p>Many thanks for your help and sorry for my ignorance... </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre
