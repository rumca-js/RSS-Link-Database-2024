## If you thought Hitman 3 VR was bad on PC just wait until you see Hitman 3 VR Reloaded in action

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/b1_5mQPfjc.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>As a slight disclaimer before I kick off the kicking, these first impressions are based on 90 minutes of playing the retail version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a> VR Reloaded on launch day. Apparently a big patch will be releasing on the 9th September that is said to address a lot of the issues that I had with the game. But I'll never know because I'll be damned if I ever put my face inside this nightmare again...</p><p>Hitman 3 VR on the PlayStation VR is still one of my all time favourite virtual experiences. Despite the limitations of the platform with its unreliable Move Controllers and low resolution headset, Hitman's sprawling, highly detailed levels were a joy to explore.</p><p>Actually being <em>inside</em> of these small sandbox envorniments felt so immersive and a natural fit for the game but as

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/eternal-life-of-goldman-artwork.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>How many games feature an elderly protagonist? More often than not, we find ourselves playing as plucky and attractive youngsters, superpowered teens, or occasionally a gruff dad. But what about an old man with a walking stick?</p><p>Well, that's who you play as in platformer adventure The Eternal Life of Goldman, from developer Weappy Studio and publisher THQ Nordic. And if an old man may seem like a slow, weak character with a lack of ability, you're forgetting the walking stick. Because the obvious thing to do with a walking stick is bounce on it. Naturally - this is a video game after all.</p><p>If that sounds like a callback to NES classic Duck Tales, you'd be right. Indeed, the game as a whole is a callback to the past, but with plenty of modern twists. This isn't just a walking stick, but a multi-faceted tool with three interchangeab

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-1-Recovered_GDwas52.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Around the time Eurogamer launched, I was temping at an insurance office in Bournemouth, and I had a temping lunch break pal called Ken who I'm invoking now for two reasons. Firstly, Ken was the first person I spoke to who ever talked about "net anxiety" - the worry that one should be off making their fortune on the new frontiers of the internet. Secondly, he was the first person I met who played games online. Actual games. There was a driving game he liked, and I think he dabbled in a few shooters. It was like alchemy to me. It was like knowing - and having lunch with - an actual wizard.</p><p>Here's the thing, though: I say Ken liked the games. In truth he was like one of those writers who doesn't like writing but likes having written. Ken liked being the only person I knew who played games online, but the actual playing of games online was
