Welcome back to Inside Tabletop. In this series I talk to people that live and work in Gaming, getting them to share their insights on the business of game entertainment. 

My lonely solo Inside Tabletop run is over for the next month as I'm rejoined by Chris from Lords of War to talk about more current-events news in the world of Tabletop. This time we're tackling a topic that has spent eight months brewing in the hearts and minds of Warhammer fans; the return of square-based gaming.
