<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m not looking to start any arguments or a negative discussion around either system, I’m just trying to work out which system I would rather invest in. </p> <p>I’ve been back into the hobby for 5 years, purely the painting side but recently I’ve had the urge to get back into the gaming end of things, the last time I played a game was around 6th edition/ early 7th edition warhammer fantasy and truth be told I was quite young at the time so I don’t really have a clear memory of it. I absolutely love Warhammer fantasy, the lore, the characters etc. I’ve also been diving into the lore of Age of Sigmar and while it’s different it’s still really enjoyable and it’s peaked my interest in the setting. </p> <p>Im hoping to be able to settle for a system to invest my time and money into, I’ve seen numerous arguments from both communities saying how well each system is doing so I thought I’d ask here to get a better perspective about individual experience. </p>
