On this page, the &quot;Perps&quot; section doesnt load immediately, so Im thinking I need to use Selenium to first click the &quot;Perps&quot; button and then extract the table data that appears(The positions, leverage, liquidation and so on..) However, Im having trouble figuring out how to correctly click the &quot;Perps&quot; button, maybe someone point me in the right direction?</p> <p>Maybe I also dont need to click the &quot;Perps&quot; button and can directly scrape it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/beginnercoderyeah">

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I keep reading that you can scrape with requests in Python. Does this ever actually work robustly for a real world scenario?</p> <p>I have a scraper that basically gets text content from any web page you enter. Pretty simple, but I‚Äôve only been able to get it to reliably work via a headless browser.</p> <p>I know this is inefficient, but to handle all cases I need to be able to execute JavaScript. I‚Äôm guessing requests in Python didn‚Äôt work because I wasn‚Äôt using the correct headers.</p> <p>I‚Äôm using selenium. I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs a better way because I‚Äôm not sure how scalable this is. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SuddenEmployment3"> /u/SuddenEmployment3 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fc7hc1/am_i_missing_something/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fc7hc1/am_i_missing_something/">[comments]</a></
