Switzerland’s Zeki Amdouni halved the deficit before the break but as the Swiss pressed for an equaliser late in the second half, Ruiz netted his second and substitute Ferran Torres also got on the scoresheet as Spain hit the hosts with lightning counterattacks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/08/nations-league-roundup-10-man-spain-enjoy-rout-in-switzerland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US Open champion has addressed flaws in her shotmaking, serve and psyche to reach new heights</p><p>As the magnificent opening set of the US Open final between Aryna Sabalenka and Jessica Pegula reached its breathless climax on Saturday evening in New York, the supreme quality of their shotmaking belied the suffocating tension on both sides of the net. After failing to serve out the set against a resolute Pegula, Sabalenka desperately tried to avoid the familiar sensation of collapsing under pressure in a significant grand slam match.</p><p>The solution that Sabalenka found was reflective of the extensive work it has taken for her to become a champion. In the closing stages of the set, Sabalenka did not simply blast her way to victory – she also found joy with touch, net play and intelligence. In three of her last four winning points in the set, Sabalenka disrupted Pegula’s excellent defensive efforts with deft volleying and intelligent drop shots.</p> <a href="https://www.theg

<p><strong>Toronto film festival:</strong> impassioned performances help to buoy a fact-based wrestling drama that sticks too closely to formula</p><p>There are winks throughout the Matt Damon/Ben Affleck produced wrestling drama Unstoppable suggesting that those involved are keenly aware of the archetypes that have come to define and often plague the sports movie genre. The lead character has a Rocky poster in his room and we see him twice walk to the top of the historic steps from the series to feel inspired. A high school coach pokes fun at stirring speech cliches at a key teaching moment. A college coach is ridiculed for his overuse of mythical fables as motivation. But more often the film, premiering at the audience-friendly Toronto film festival, is content to be just as bland and boilerplate as the many many against-all-odds crowd-pleasers that have come before it.</p><p>The true story of over-achieving wrestler Anthony Robles, born with one leg to a struggling young mother, is

<p>Whenever mainstream politicians begin to mutter about infiltrators, fifth columnists and failed assimilation, that smell of sulphur is fascism in the air</p><p>The problem with “fascism” as a description of any modern political tendency is that the term is a weapon of mass destruction that flattens the landscapes that it wants to describe. Fascism is so freighted with historically specific meaning that using it for other times and places can seem sloppy and excessive. And yet, juxtaposing the politics of contemporary south Asia with fascism, in its Nazi variant, serves a double purpose: it connects modern Indian majoritarianism with one of its ideological ancestors and it helps us name and identify the ideological kernel of fascism that survived to fight another day.</p><p>India’s ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) is the political arm of a Hindu militia, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), founded in 1925, around the time Adolf Hitler began to find his political bea

<p>Bright citrus for couscous and cakes – or just to savour</p><p>I bought a bag of lemons, complete with their leaves – lemons so beautiful I kept them in a shallow dish in the kitchen for several days, just to look at them. I often picked them up to squeeze and sniff. I occasionally caught my finger on the sharp barbs that hide on their stems, like the thorns on roses. I pierced their skin with my thumbnail and inhaled, a smell bright and sharp and cleansing to mark the days I have always felt are the start of a new term.</p><p>I roasted the first, sliced in half, with large shallots whose flesh sweetened in the heat of the oven, and tossed them with pearls of fat, chewy couscous. The second and third I peeled with a vegetable peeler, shaved off any pith, then painstakingly set about shredding it with a small, razor-sharp knife. Far finer than I would slice orange peel for marmalade, these tiny strips of lemon were cooked with sugar and water, bubbled down like jam, scenting the hou
