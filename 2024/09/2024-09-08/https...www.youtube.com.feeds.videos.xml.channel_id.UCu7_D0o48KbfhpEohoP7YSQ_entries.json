But what if they seem to exist and are used in cars and consumer electronics? And if they solve the common problem of efficient reverse polarity protection? Enough reasons to look at \u201cideal diodes\u201d and check them out. I am sure you will consider using them in one of your future projects if you only know they exist and how they are used!\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nIdeal diode with TI chip: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DCc4uyn\nIdeal diode with LM74610 chip: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dlz2ykx\nTiny Ideal diode chip LM73100 (not tested): https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmlGZPz\nSchottky Diode SR5100: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdSGX1v\n\nPatreon supporter company:\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\n\nThe links above are usually affiliate links that support the channel (at no additional cost to you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGitHub: https://www.github.com/sensors", "id": 1103935, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tQHjUYKQwI", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ", "source_obj__id": 17, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/1tQHjUYKQwI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "How to Protect Your Devices Against Reverse Polarity Using Ideal Diodes", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
