<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looks like there is another JH-7110 based SBC (10+ year product lifecycle). I saw it mentioned in the <a href="https://forum.rvspace.org/t/starfive-rvspace-eco-community-updates-august/4550">monthly updates at StarFive</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.geniatech.com/product/xpi-7110/">https://www.geniatech.com/product/xpi-7110/</a> (since they are not listing a price, and asking people to submit for a quote, I would guess that this board is, at least for now, primary targeting Industrial customers, and not end consumers. Although if it is really targeting Industrial customers instead of end consumers, it is very odd that it only has one Ethernet port - less redundancy.)</p> <p>StarFive must have made a fanatic return on their investment with the JH7110 SoC. It is in millions of meters (electricity, water and gas) throughout China, and is used in more SBC&#39;s than any other RISC-V SoC that I know. And now is being used for Industrial Applications like 

## BPI F3 where can I get gcc source?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Maybe I am dumb, but,</p> <p>I followed their buildroot compilation guide and I always end up downloading &quot;their&quot;, binary only gcc for x86_64. I dont want to do that, I need their source of that toolchain. Wtf why gpl3 source not posted alongside!?</p> <p>Or, maybe better, what are correct CFLAGS for Spacemit K1? I just received my 16GB board and trying to build kernel for it, it works a while but I often get random &quot;Fatal exception in interrupt&quot; load access fault, fence w,w bad address 0 cause 5 under load, with Clang16. Kernel rev.date. is 13.08.2024.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/strlcateu"> /u/strlcateu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1fbol5s/bpi_f3_where_can_i_get_gcc_source/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1fbol5s/bpi_f3_where_can_i_get_gcc_source/">[comments]</a></span>
