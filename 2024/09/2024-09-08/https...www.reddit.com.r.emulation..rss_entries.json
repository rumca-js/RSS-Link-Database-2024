Here&#39;s what I found:</p> <p>WinEra - Developed by a single person, this was the first compatibility layer to successfully run Minecraft on PC.</p> <p>XWineOne (XW1) - Created by a team of 2-8 people, XW1 has the largest amount of supported games as far as I know. </p> <p>??? - This layer, developed by one person with some help, was notably used to play Tomb Raider Remastered, making it the first game to run on PC outside of DirectX samples.</p> <p>Spasaha - Focused primarily on Destiny 1, this layer is also developed by one person with additional support.</p> <p>WinDurango - Currently unknown in terms of how many people are involved - probably many I presume, and WinDurango stands out as the only compatibility layer that is open source.</p> <p>The order of", "id": 1106731, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1fc6noe/its_not_just_xwineone_theres_windurango_winera", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/.rss", "source_obj__id": 475, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "It's not just XWineOne - there's WinDurango, WinEra Spasha and another.
