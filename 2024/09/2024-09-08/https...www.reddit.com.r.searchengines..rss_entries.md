You innocently search for “cherries” in your local store.</p> <p>Your results are the advertised sale items for every item in the store!</p> <p>Then you continue to narrow it down and you get History of cherries What’s so good about cherries Why you shouldn’t eat cherries Where cherries come from What else you should know about cherries What other people are saying about cherries The health benefits of cherries Do cherries cause cancer What happens when you eat too many cherries More about cherries How to grow you own cherries Can you eat the pit in a cherry Recipes using cherries Cherry pie</p> <p>All you wanted to know. Finally being overwhelmed with the results, you call the store, ask for produce and they tell you if they are in stock and price. </p> <p>As I get bombarded with search results and the associated NAGGING, I just say STOP! And try to figure a work around :-)</p> <p>Good day!</p
