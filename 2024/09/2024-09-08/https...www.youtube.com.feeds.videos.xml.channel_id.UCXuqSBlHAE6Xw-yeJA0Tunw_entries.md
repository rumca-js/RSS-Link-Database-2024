BIG Shoutout to Unifi for lending us all of these AP's, wouldn't have been able to make this video with out them! If you have a large house, its common to add multiple Routers or internet devices to help cover the whole area. But can you have too many? Today we add over 50 Ubiquiti Access Points to see if you cellphones can get better or worse WiFi?
