<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know Inoreader has a built-in feature to remove duplicate articles, and I’m trying to replicate this using Feedbin’s filters. For example, I subscribe to multiple categories from The Verge, and sometimes the same article appears in more than one category, leading to duplicates.</p> <p>I haven’t been able to figure out how to manage this in Feedbin. If anyone knows if this is possible and how to set it up, I’d really appreciate your help!</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ill_Connection_3017"> /u/Ill_Connection_3017 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fbwent/possible_to_remove_duplicate_articles_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fbwent/possible_to_remove_duplicate_articles_with/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a way to set up an RSS feed for YouTube channels, but only after they reach a certain number of views, say 100k or more. I know you can get RSS feeds for general uploads, but is there a way to filter them based on view count?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/janalpadi"> /u/janalpadi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fbrqef/is_it_possible_to_get_an_rss_feed_for_youtube/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fbrqef/is_it_possible_to_get_an_rss_feed_for_youtube/">[comments]</a></span>
