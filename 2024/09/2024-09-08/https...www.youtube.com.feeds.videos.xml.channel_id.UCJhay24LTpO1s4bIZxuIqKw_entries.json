As a C++ developer, it would be advantageous to employ familiar building tools, such as CMake and Conan, for this process.\n\nIn this presentation, we will delve into the development of a C++ addon for Node.js using CMake, a cross-platform build system, and Conan, a package manager. We will also discuss the deployment of pre-built binaries.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2024/\nSponsored By think-cell\n---\n\nDvir Yitzchaki\n\nDvir Yitzchaki is a C++ developer who is knowledgeable in modern C++ programming techniques.
