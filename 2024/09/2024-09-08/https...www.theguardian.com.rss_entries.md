<p>Anger is rising at Indonesia’s new administration – while Thailand, Cambodia, the Philippines, Laos and Brunei are all led by the children of former leaders</p><p>In early August, against a backdrop of deadly student-led protests, Bangladesh’s prime minister Sheikh Hasina resigned her position, bringing to a close a political dynasty that stretched back to the country’s founding.</p><p>This week, students took to the streets on the other side of Asia, to protest against amended election laws that have helped foster the establishment of a new dynasty. In a few weeks Prabowo Subianto will be sworn in as Indonesia’s president – and with him his vice-president, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, the 36-year-old son of current leader Joko Widodo.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/a-family-affair-can-asia-break-free-from-the-power-of-its-political-dynasties">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Welshman claims rare home tour win</li><li>Onley second overall as Donovan misses out on podium</li></ul><p>Superficially, the final stage of this year’s Tour of Britain into a windswept Felixstowe had a routine look, a chaotic bunch sprint won by the Slovenian Matevz Govekar, and Steve Williams of Wales straightforwardly sealing overall victory. But what preceded the sprint was 158 kilometres of anarchic racing, with a strong southerly splitting the peloton repeatedly amid a frantic series of attacks and chases.</p><p>The wind was at its most damaging between Framlingham, Aldeburgh and Wickham Market a couple of hours from the finish, blowing from the side and prompting the DSM team to increase the pace so violently that one of their number misjudged a corner in Framlingham and took to the pavement. With the peloton splitting in the crosswind, the first surge dislodged the triple stage winner Paul Magnier and – initially at least – the rider in fourth overall, Tom Donnenwirth

Blanket criticism of all women who don’t have the benefit of children is hurtful and harmful. Second, why&nbsp;do men not get the same level&nbsp;of intolerance if they choose&nbsp;not to procreate?

<p>Brazilian musician best known for his hit Mas Que Nada who popularised the bossa nova worldwide </p><p>Sérgio Mendes, who has died aged 83 after suffering from the effects of long Covid, was one of the most successful Brazilian artists of all time. A pianist, songwriter, arranger and bandleader, he enjoyed a lengthy career that began in the bossa nova boom of the early 1960s and continued for six decades – long after the bossa craze was over.</p><p>His success was based on his skill in matching Brazilian songs and rhythms against different western styles, from jazz and rock to funk and hip hop. In the 60s he recorded with the American jazz saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and then notched up hits with covers of songs by the Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/08/sergio-mendes-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Queen Elizabeth Hall, London</strong><br>The Austrian artist-philosopher muses on disability and choreography, mobility and mobilisation in this quietly thought-provoking show</p><p>Michael Turinsky comes out on stage in his wheelchair pushing a hostess trolley with a pot plant and some fancy tonic water on it. He drops some niche names in philosophy, and tells us we almost got a lecture on communism, but he changed his mind. It’s the start of an unpredictable, uncategorisable performance from Vienna-based artist-philosopher Turinsky, part of the Unlimited festival of disabled artists.<br><br>
 Instead of communism, Turinsky has decided to muse on disability and choreography; mobility and mobilisation; gesture and environment. Addressing the audience directly, he’s mild mannered, smiling his words in a winsome tone that suggests an appreciation of the absurd and self-deprecating humour – when he talks about identifying as “crip”, a reclaiming of the word that’s seen as an a

<p>Paulomi Debnath has shared a kiss with her husband every morning for 18 years. Ron Hill ran every day for more than 52 years. When does an enjoyable habit become a compulsion?</p><p>Anyone who spotted the run Tom Vickery uploaded to exercise tracking app Strava on 18 February last year might have been a little confused. The 30-minute sprint appeared to have taken place right in the middle of the Channel, not far from Guernsey and heading towards the west coast of France. The run was also, curiously, a ruler-straight line, appearing on Vickery’s public profile as an unbending, inch-long streak of orange in the blue swathe of the app’s virtual sea. Oh, and it was at a world record-breaking pace.</p><p>Of course, anyone who knows Vickery wouldn’t have been surprised at all. The 38-year-old triathlon coach from Cambridge was on a two-day ferry trip to Bilbao for a holiday and this rather speedy jog was simply another run on his then nearly four-year daily running streak on Strava.

I’m a skilled, ex-military-trained navigator. One famous day, after he hadn’t listened to my instructions, we ended up lost. He threw the atlas back into my lap saying, ‘Get us out of this mess.’ Reader, I did.</p><p>You’d think with satnav the arguments would have stopped, but they have not. Now it’s a case of whichever satnav I choose isn’t quite right: the writing isn’t big enough, the instructions not clear enough. Thus it was that we were driving back from York arguing about the relative merits of Apple v Google v the car’s satnav when I decided to stop talking. We got to a service station. ‘Do you want anything?’ he asked. ‘No,’ I said, my voice thick with sulk.

<p>This striking home is an homage to the art of woodwork</p><p>It all started with eggs. As a child in the 1950s in County Meath, Liz Pickett would collect dozens of eggs from the large wooden henhouse on her family’s farm, before walking to school. For more than a century, Liz’s family have lived on this bucolic windswept corner of eastern Ireland, just yards from 12 miles of overarching sandy shoreline, looking over the kinetic Irish Sea, where the range of blue on offer eclipses even the most committed watercolourist’s palette.</p><p>“It was Baltic in there today,” says Liz describing her daily dip in the sea. “But you feel great afterwards, you become addicted.” Liz, who lives with her husband, Roger, and their basset hound, Poppy, built their home in the early 90s on the site of the former henhouse. “We wanted to keep and preserve the old-world charm and feel when we designed it, so we decided to build a thatched cottage.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ar

Following Odysseus, Agamemnon, Ajax, Menelaus and Aeneas on their journeys home from Troy, Fry breathes contemporary relevance into these ancient tales.

<p>We take a look back at London fashion week though the lens of legendary photographer Chris Moore</p><p>This September, the British Fashion Council continues its 40th anniversary celebrations, so we’ve taken the opportunity to revisit the last four decades at London fashion week through the lens of the original catwalk photographer, Chris Moore. As fashion week begins, Mr Moore, who turns 90 this year, won’t be squashed into the photographers’ pen at the end of the runway, but he will probably feel the twitch of his shutter finger as the season’s shows get under way. Covid was the natural opportunity for Moore to hang up his camera bag, though he still continued with some longstanding clients, including CSM degree shows, Simone Rocha and Christopher Kane, until last year. Moore will most likely be at home in Northumberland with his longtime partner, Maxine Millar (herself a photographer who has run the studio since they met in the late 80s), and their beloved cats, enjoying a long w

<p>The small resort is close to visitor hot spots such as Bodrum and Fethiye but retains a mellow vibe and is perfectly placed for exploring the coast</p><p>When Bodrum and I first met, 30 years ago, my main thought was that it was a long way from anywhere. In summer 1994, when I worked as a holiday rep, there were no international flights to Bodrum’s small airport and only a few holidaymakers made the four-hour trek from Dalaman airport. Famous for its picturebook Crusader castle and waterfront lined with <em>gulets</em> (wooden sailing boats), Bodrum was back then a working town that just happened to have supermodel looks.</p><p>In the intervening decades, those good looks have helped change it beyond recognition– the town itself and the peninsula that stretches westwards are fringed with increasingly sophisticated small resorts. The forested coves, bays and inlets that surround Bodrum are now home to some of the country’s most luxurious hotels, some with room rates of more than €1,
