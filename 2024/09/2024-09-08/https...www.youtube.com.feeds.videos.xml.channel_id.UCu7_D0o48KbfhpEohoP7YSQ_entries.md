We all know that “ideal” parts do not exist. But what if they seem to exist and are used in cars and consumer electronics? And if they solve the common problem of efficient reverse polarity protection? Enough reasons to look at “ideal diodes” and check them out. I am sure you will consider using them in one of your future projects if you only know they exist and how they are used!
