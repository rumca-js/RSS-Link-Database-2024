It ended in 7 turns and we each had 6 things in our tableaux when the vp pile of 24 was empty. And in the full game produce was only played once ever while trade was only played twice.</p> <p>Given one of the end conditions is <em>12</em> cards in someone&#39;s tableaux and advanced rules let you play 2 action cards per turn each this seems like it ended really fast? Like with 2 action cards a turn surely that would make the game last only 3-4 turns. Is there a chance we played this wrong or fucked up somewhere? It seems cool but it didn&#39;t feel like it really &#39;got going&#39; before it was over.

We play on a chess app too. But I like the idea of a table top that we casually play thru. Haven&#39;t seen any turn trackers on printables or like a 2 sided coin we can use to flip and keep track of &quot;player 1&quot; &quot;player 2&quot;. I don&#39;t want the clock counter thing. I want to be able to use this with other games the same way, and wanted to crowd source an idea. What would you make or use?

The campaign went fairly quick and we finished it in a day but we feel we missed a lot of rules and struggled with most fates becuase of how confusing some of them were.

I simply loved it (as did everyone else), so I took a leap of faith and bough John Company (from the same designer) as well. I introduced this game to my 2 &quot;inexperienced&quot; friends yesterday and they really liked it! It&#39;s a heavy game (4.44 weight according to BGG) and they kind of stumbled throughout the first round, but aftwerwards everything ran rather smoothly. I can see why some people might not like it, but this game is simply incredibly smart and fun! One of my friends actually liked it so much that he called me afterwards at 10pm to know where I had bought it

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>…nor can I remember many details about it but I’m hoping someone will know what I’m talking about! It’s a card based game that used played mats (they were like a mousepad material). There were cute, colorful blobby characters and the premise has something to do with an apocalypse/meteor/evolution? I think each round brought you closer to the world ending. Maybe with something like meteor or apocalypse or disaster in the title? I vaguely remember volcanos on the box and maybe dinosaurs? I know this is not a helpful description but I remember it being very fun and would love to figure out what it was! The friends who played it collected cards and expansion packs and different player mats that were all different colors and themes but all very cute</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ukulelerapboy"> /u/ukulelerapboy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fbnngn/i_played_a_

As far as I know, this is the first time Humble Bundle is doing physical board games, and I thought it was interesting.</p> <p>Anyone picking this up? How much did shipping end up costing?
