From the city limits to the research options, Frostpunk 2 takes the micromanagement of the first game and scales it up a couple notches. \n\nTake a tour of these 15 differences between the two games just ahead of Frostpunk 2\u2019s September 20th release. Frostpunk 2 is set 30 years after the Great Storm devasted New London in the first game. Society somehow survived, thanks in no small part to \u2018The Captain\u2019 from the first game, and oil is a new promising resource to build a better future with. \n\nThere\u2019s plenty of small changes and additions to Frostpunk 2, but it all comes down to the shift from the micro to the macro. We\u2019ll see if this shift is as engaging as the first game\u2019s micromanagement or if it fails to differentiate itself from other city-builders soon enough.", "id": 1105706, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpsTtvUuwgg", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/bpsTtvUuwgg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Frostpunk 2 vs Frostpunk 1 - 15 BIGGEST DIFFERENCES", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-08T16:00:29+00:00", "description": "Akimbot is an action-platforming game that was released on August 29th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. This indie game is a sure-footed love letter to PS2 titles of the same genre. Ratchet and Clank is a notable inspiration, as seen by Akimbot\u2019s weapon selection, fluid movement, and tone. \n\nSadly, the dynamic duo of Exe and Shipset isn\u2019t as lovable and endearing as other platformer mascots. Shipset quips and whines constantly, and the game features a lot of banter between the two throughout its eight-hour runtime. \n\nThe generic adventure plot is tropey and predictable, but still provides plenty of laughs and twists. Akimbot excels in its fast-paced level design and variety of gameplay styles. One minute you\u2019re dodging asteroids in a spaceship, the next you\u2019re playing a Centipede- like hacking minigame. Akimbot provides a brisk action-platforming adventure that\u2019s hard not to like, especially if you\u2019re a fan of the genre or PS2 era action games.", "id": 1105707, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ5RoBYKqpo", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gQ5RoBYKqpo/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Akimbot Review: Reliving Ratchet And Clank PS2 Nostalgia All Over Again", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-08T12:00:01+00:00", "description": "As immersive as GTA V is, there\u2019s huge scope for Rockstar to set ground-breaking levels of realism in the expectedly humungous world of Leonida and its neon-soaked Vice City in Grand Theft Auto VI. \n\nThe world itself will look great \u2013 that\u2019s a given \u2013 but how we can interact with this world might just be how Rockstar distinguish GTA VI from its contemporaries.
