A significant discovery of ancient silver coins has been made on the Mediterranean island of Pantelleria, located between Sicily and Tunisia. Archaeologists from the University of Tübingen, Germany, unearthed 27 Roman silver coins, known as "denarii," dating back more than 2,000 years. The coins were found hidden in a hole in the wall during excavations at the Acropolis of Santa Teresa and San Marco. Some of these coins feature a human head profile, which remains unidentified.

Patients suffering from chronic pain have limited treatment options, often relying on medications like opioids that come with harmful side effects and high addiction risks. A new study in mice, published in Current Biology journal, suggests a new way to use the placebo effect for treating chronic pain. By activating specific neurons in the brain linked to pain relief, researchers managed to create an environment where mice associated pain relief with their surroundings, providing a sustained placebo effect.

In 2006, a fungal disease called white-nose syndrome began decimating bat populations across New England. Over the following decade, the loss of these bats, essential for controlling insect populations, led to significant consequences for agriculture and human health, according to a new study. With fewer bats around to consume insects, farmers resorted to increased use of insecticides, resulting in a 31 percent rise in pesticide application, according to a report.

Auroras are expected to be more intense around September's equinox due to the Russell-McPherron Effect. The phenomenon occurs when Earth's magnetic field temporarily aligns with the solar wind, allowing charged particles to penetrate and interact with our atmosphere. This interaction causes vibrant Northern Lights, especially during the equinox. With solar activity peaking, there is a possibility of more frequent geomagnetic storms, making September a key time for aurora sightings across the Northern Hemisphere.

A new milestone in atomic physics has been reached with the development of the thorium-229 nuclear clock. This advanced clock offers a precision level that could potentially reveal whether the fundamental constants of physics, such as the speed of light and gravitational constant, change over time. Detected by Chuankun Zhang and his team at JILA, this breakthrough enables researchers to probe the stability of these constants with a level of accuracy not previously possible. The implications of this discovery could reshape our understanding of the universe.

China is preparing to launch its Tianwen-3 mission around 2028, aiming to return samples from Mars. Liu Jizhong, Chief Designer, shared details at the Tiandu Forum in Huangshan City, Anhui Province. The mission will involve collecting samples from the Martian surface, returning them to Earth through a docking process in Mars’ orbit. Liu also highlighted the importance of international collaboration, with plans for shared data and joint future missions. This mission is part of China's broader planetary exploration programme, including Tianwen-2 and Tianwen-4 missions.

In a recent breakthrough, researchers led by Zihao Ou, Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Texas at Dallas, have developed a technique to make mouse skin temporarily transparent using a common food dye called tartrazine. By applying a solution of the dye mixed with water, scientists could observe the internal organs and blood vessels of live mice without any surgery. This non-invasive method could revolutionise medical research, allowing for clearer views of body structures in real-time. If successful in humans, the technique may have wide applications in healthcare, including improved visibility for procedures like drawing blood.

SpaceX successfully launched the NROL-113 mission on 5th September 2024, sending classified spy satellites into orbit for the United States National Reconnaissance Office. The mission was SpaceX’s second launch of the day, following an earlier Starlink mission. The Falcon 9 booster landed successfully on the droneship "Of Course I Still Love You" in the Pacific Ocean. The NROL-113 mission is part of a series of launches under the NRO’s proliferated architecture, aimed at deploying a resilient network of smaller satellites.

Scientists have created nanorobots that could revolutionise the treatment of brain aneurysms by delivering clot-forming drugs directly to the weakened vessel area, reducing the risk of stroke. These robots, smaller than blood cells, were successfully tested in rabbits. The nanobots are guided using magnetic fields and heat, which release the drug at the aneurysm site, blocking the weak spot and preventing rupture. While still in the early stages, with further research, this technology could provide a safer, more precise alternative to traditional treatments for brain aneurysms in human patients.

A colossal asteroid impact about 4 billion years ago dramatically altered Ganymede, Jupiter's largest moon. The asteroid, estimated to be 186 miles wide, struck Ganymede with such force that it reoriented the moon and removed a significant portion of its original surface. This impact not only created a massive crater but also affected Ganymede's internal structure, including a potential hidden saltwater ocean.
