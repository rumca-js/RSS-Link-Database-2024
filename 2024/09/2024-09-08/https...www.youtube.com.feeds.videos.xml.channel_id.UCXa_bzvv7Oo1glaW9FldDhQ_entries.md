Everything is much more expanded in Frostpunk 2. From the city limits to the research options, Frostpunk 2 takes the micromanagement of the first game and scales it up a couple notches. 

Take a tour of these 15 differences between the two games just ahead of Frostpunk 2’s September 20th release. Frostpunk 2 is set 30 years after the Great Storm devasted New London in the first game. Society somehow survived, thanks in no small part to ‘The Captain’ from the first game, and oil is a new promising resource to build a better future with. 

There’s plenty of small changes and additions to Frostpunk 2, but it all comes down to the shift from the micro to the macro. We’ll see if this shift is as engaging as the first game’s micromanagement or if it fails to differentiate itself from other city-builders soon enough.

Akimbot is an action-platforming game that was released on August 29th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. This indie game is a sure-footed love letter to PS2 titles of the same genre. Ratchet and Clank is a notable inspiration, as seen by Akimbot’s weapon selection, fluid movement, and tone. 

Sadly, the dynamic duo of Exe and Shipset isn’t as lovable and endearing as other platformer mascots. Shipset quips and whines constantly, and the game features a lot of banter between the two throughout its eight-hour runtime. 

The generic adventure plot is tropey and predictable, but still provides plenty of laughs and twists. Akimbot excels in its fast-paced level design and variety of gameplay styles. One minute you’re dodging asteroids in a spaceship, the next you’re playing a Centipede- like hacking minigame. Akimbot provides a brisk action-platforming adventure that’s hard not to like, especially if you’re a fan of the genre or PS2 era action games.

As immersive as GTA V is, there’s huge scope for Rockstar to set ground-breaking levels of realism in the expectedly humungous world of Leonida and its neon-soaked Vice City in Grand Theft Auto VI. 

The world itself will look great – that’s a given – but how we can interact with this world might just be how Rockstar distinguish GTA VI from its contemporaries. Anything from manipulating the economy via more in-depth methods, influencing the populace through mission outcomes, and customising the cityscape via buildings or destruction are possible. 

How the world interacts with us is subject to innovation too; from the VCPD being a smarter, more fearsome force, to social media showcasing the residents of Vice City and their reaction to our various criminal exploits. This feature speculates on 15 features that could elevate GTA VI beyond its predecessors.
