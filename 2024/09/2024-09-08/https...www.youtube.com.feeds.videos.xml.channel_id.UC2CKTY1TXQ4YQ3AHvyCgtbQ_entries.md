I'm back from the NOVA Open (had a great time) and now I seem to be getting into Necromunda? My first ten Cawdor models are nearly all built already. How did that happen? We'll talk about that, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
