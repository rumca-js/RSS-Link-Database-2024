<p>Amazon Prime Big Deal Days is back this year, returning on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-announces-the-return-of-prime-big-deal-days-on-october-8-and-9-050356758.html">October 8 and 9</a>. The “fall <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Prime Day</a>” of sorts has served as the online retailer’s unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season for the past few years.</p>
<p>We expect most of the deals to be Prime exclusives, meaning you must be an active Prime subscriber to get the discounts. There are always a couple of deals available for everyone, though, so it’s worth perusing Amazon’s site even if you don’t pay for Prime. It’s also worth doing so now because we’ve found a number of solid early Prime Day deals already available. These are the best of the bunch; we’ll be updating this post regularly in the lead-up to October Prime Day, so check back for the latest deals.</p>
