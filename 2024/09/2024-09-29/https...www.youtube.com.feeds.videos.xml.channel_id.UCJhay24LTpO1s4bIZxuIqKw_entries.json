Starting from Aristotle's hylomorphism, where substance (hyle) and form (morphe) are inherently interconnected, we discuss a structured concurrency model that guarantees safety, is efficient and as easy to use a non-concurrent programming. This concurrency model is proposed for the Hylo programming language.\n\nWe consider the basic requirements for concurrency, bring in ideas from structured programming to allow us to construct this concurrency model. As a result, the concurrency model is for general use, and does not fit just a certain type of problems.\n\nThrough various examples, we would walk the attendees through building effective concurrency abstractions. While our central focus is on ease of use, we will ", "id": 1234048, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6fI4asLJxo", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 421, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/k6fI4asLJxo/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Concurrency Hylomorphism - Lucian Radu Teodorescu - ACCU 2024", "vote": 0}]
