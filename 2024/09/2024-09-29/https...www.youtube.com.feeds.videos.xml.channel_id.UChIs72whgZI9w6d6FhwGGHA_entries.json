Corsair's choices make no sense to us. The company custom-designed the chassis for this build, and yet somehow didn't bother adding a couple millimeters to accommodate a larger radiator or adding built-in metal cable tie points (instead deferring to adhesive that peels off from the heat exposure). The Corsair ONE i500 is not worth it. There are better pre-builts you could buy in similar form factors for less of a rip-off.\n\nWe buy these pre-builts for our reviews to ensure we get the true customer experience.
