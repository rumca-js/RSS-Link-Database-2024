<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need to combine multiple feeds into a single one. Right now I&#39;m using <a href="http://rss.app">rss.app</a> but am quickly running out of feeds used, and don&#39;t want to pay a higher price for the larger account- especially when, I really don&#39;t need <a href="http://rss.app">rss.app</a> for most of the feeds I&#39;m using.</p> <p>What&#39;s available out there that I can load multiple individual feeds into one, and get a single rss url back out? I like free options :)</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/eyal8r"> /u/eyal8r </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fsc5h7/combining_multiple_feeds_into_one/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fsc5h7/combining_multiple_feeds_into_one/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve noticed that my reader is predominantly filled with tech topics, so I’m looking to diversify my feeds by adding some content from other areas of interest. This could include blogs, websites, YouTube channels, or even podcasts. I use the new <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> app to manage everything, so I’m open to any format—video, audio, or text!</p> <p>If you have any recommendations for feeds or topics that you think I might enjoy, please share them here! I love exploring new content and discovering things that I might really like.</p> <p>Just a heads-up: I prefer feeds that aren’t too frequent.
