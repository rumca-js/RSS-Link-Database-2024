<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I dont know the correct term if its editing or cracking but i have a question. I have a booking software that needs a key and i have the key but it has a pair limit for one booking of 15 pairs. How do i change this limit to un limited pair btw this software is connected to its server but editing the pair limit wont matter for authentication i think.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Former-Ad2541"> /u/Former-Ad2541 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://gadarpanel.com/PANEL/Login">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1fs9r4w/please_help/">[comments]</a></span>
