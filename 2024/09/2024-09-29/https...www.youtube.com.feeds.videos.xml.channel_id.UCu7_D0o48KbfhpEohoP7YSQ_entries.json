Another application, a LoRa 1:1 link, can be beneficial because it inherits all the good properties, like long distance and low power. It is simple, does not need an infrastructure, and can be used bi-directionally. Because I want to build a long-range bidirectional mailbox notifier, I will evaluate a few LoRa boards, connect them to an ESP32 and an ATTINY1614, and finally integrate them via MQTT into Home Assistant.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nSketches: https://github.com/SensorsIot/LoRa_Mailbux_Notifier\nRA-02 board: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Debzo4p\nE32-TTL-100 module: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEGNOSV\nESP32 Prototype board: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DFCiUa5\nESP32 mini board: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DB1WPTx\nRF_Setting tool download: https://www.cdebyte.com/Resources-Download\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\n\nThe li", "id": 1232705, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXi5lgOuPNc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 17, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/jXi5lgOuPNc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "\"Transaction Proof\" Mailbox Notifier using an unknown E32 LoRa board and an ATTINY1614", "vote": 0}]
