I got inspired to make a little laptop using the Pi 400 as a base since it seems like the perfect form factor for such a project. The laptop uses a little external screen I found on amazon, and uses 2 usb battery banks for power (1 for the Pi and 1 for the screen due to the limited output ports of the banks). I know it looks a little rough with the hot melt glue and all showing, but this was mainly a proof of concept for me and if I end up getting bored I may revisit the project and make some improvements!
