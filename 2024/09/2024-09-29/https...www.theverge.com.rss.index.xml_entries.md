  <p id="MGZI28">California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047">(SB 1047</a>) today.

And so, after years of waiting and months of testing the latest models, Sayman got to work.</p>
