Welcome back to Inside Tabletop. In this series I talk to people that live and work in Gaming, getting them to share their insights on the business of game entertainment. 

My lonely solo Inside Tabletop run is over for the next month as I'm rejoined by Chris from Lords of War to talk about more current-events news in the world of Tabletop. With trailers and previews now up for WAR OF THE ROHIRRIM, how is making a licensed product for an ANIME going to change the designs of the Middle Earth Strategy Battle Game by Games Workshop?
