The Corsair ONE i500 pre-built gaming PC, for which we paid $5,000 after tax, is woefully insufficient in its cooling design, power configuraiton, and even assembly quality. Corsair's choices make no sense to us. The company custom-designed the chassis for this build, and yet somehow didn't bother adding a couple millimeters to accommodate a larger radiator or adding built-in metal cable tie points (instead deferring to adhesive that peels off from the heat exposure). The Corsair ONE i500 is not worth it. There are better pre-builts you could buy in similar form factors for less of a rip-off.

We buy these pre-builts for our reviews to ensure we get the true customer experience. To support this work, please consider buying something from our store or supporting us on Patreon.
