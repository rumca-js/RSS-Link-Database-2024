Lords winning ties as the attacker is amazing. Dany getting three 8 sided dice attacking is great as is Brienne getting two sided for defense is great. I also really like jorah Mormont getting an extra territory card for taking two territory cards for taking two territories with castles or ports is huge. Better than cerseis.</p> <p>Some maeste

The Asia rulebook says to use 2 nectar nice and 3 regular dice for each of the 2 birdfeeders but I only have 5 of each dice available. Would it be better to: </p> <ul> <li><p>Use only 4 dice per birdfeeder (2 nectar, 2 regular), potentially making predators even less effective and hurting players using the &quot;collect all x in birdfeeder&quot; powers, but maybe players will like the higher turnover</p></li> <li><p>Use only 1 birdfeeder with 5 (or more) dice, and have a separate way to decide any conflicts between the simultaneous players (like just having it alternate, but that&#39;s a separate system to track

I have seen hundreds of posts recommending buying Imperium + Ix, and honestly, I like expansions, but I’d prefer to stick to a single box, since I’ve had problems in the past with adding expansions after just a few plays (I sold KoT because the Power Up! expansion was too unbalanced despite having great reviews).</p> <p>Second, and this ties in with the first point, I also saw that a lot of people recommended going for Uprising, since it&#39;s like a version 2.0. After looking into the game, honestly, I was thrilled. We preferred the second movie, and having giant worms at your service seems great, but it also seems to be quite a bit more difficult
