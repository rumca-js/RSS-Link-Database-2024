<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been a busy month or two with new releases. So I&#39;ve been shuffling around between different games a lot and I realized there is an amazing feature of almost all the recent games I&#39;m playing that has made my enjoyment of them that much better: Saving anywhere.</p> <p>Growing up on the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s PC gaming, I am no stranger to games that let you save anywhere. Stuff like point and click adventure games, early 3D shooters like Doom and games like Warcraft and X-Com let me save and load at my leisure, leading to what some call save scumming.</p> <p>But these days there is less need for save scumming, and the save anywhere options lend themselves instead to a world where you can be playing a game, suddenly need to depart from them, and stamp your save down and pick up right where you left off.</p> <p>I was amazingly surprised to find that Echoes of Wisdom, the new Zelda game let you do just that.

Fix it! Use the pieces and put everything back where it belongs. It’s simple but satisfying, and there’s no rush. You can take your time and enjoy the building process.</p> <h1>What&#39;s new?</h1> <p>I recently spent several weeks working on a brand-new color palette for each level, embracing soft, pastel tone

Steam: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722640/CoinOp_Vice/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722640/CoinOp_Vice/</a></p> <p>It turned into an Action Roguelike Deckbuilder with a hundred mini-games.</p> <p>About a year ago, I significantly changed the concept. Initially, the game was meant to be a linear progression through around a hundred levels. However, early beta tests showed that, by today&#39;s standards, the game lacked depth. While the mini-games themselves were well-received, their linear sequence felt too simple.</p> <p>I had to make a tough decision - to add a &quot;meta-game.&quot; A separate gameplay mechanic to tie the scattered arcades together (2.5D Top-Down). Now, for completing mini-games, players earn cartridges that grant abilities and various weapons. The game evolved into an Action Roguelike Deckbuilder with a hundred mini-games.</p
