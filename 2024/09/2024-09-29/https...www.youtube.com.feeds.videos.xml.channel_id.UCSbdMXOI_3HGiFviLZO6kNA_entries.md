Many say that Meta just had its iPhone moment at its recent conference.  Some say it's solely due to Orion, Meta's new AR glasses prototype, but I say its because of multiple factors. 1. A cheap mixed reality capable VR headset launching this month, 2. Meta is the first company to open camera access to developers to actually develop compelling mixed reality (and future augmented reality) apps 3. The most compelling AR device the world has ever seen; Orion. 

Tech giants have been racing towards consumer AR devices for the past two decades now.. but I don't think anyone has come this close to putting together an entire package that includes developers, hardware, software.. and research together in a way that actually makes sense- until now.
