LoRa modulation is used in many applications, like LoRaWAN or Meshtastic. Another application, a LoRa 1:1 link, can be beneficial because it inherits all the good properties, like long distance and low power. It is simple, does not need an infrastructure, and can be used bi-directionally. Because I want to build a long-range bidirectional mailbox notifier, I will evaluate a few LoRa boards, connect them to an ESP32 and an ATTINY1614, and finally integrate them via MQTT into Home Assistant.
