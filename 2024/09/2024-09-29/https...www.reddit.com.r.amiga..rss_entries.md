<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi to all, I have an A600 with brand new Furia accelerator and 1mb chip ram expansion. I have also a 3com PCMCIA network adapter (fully working, tested on an Amiga 1200 and I can surf aminet). On the A600 it doesn&#39;t work with the same Miami DX that I have on the A1200. When I try to &quot;query the device&quot; from the SANA II parameters windows, it crashes... I tried to free the 4mb area and I tried Card prep and Card reset in all the combinations but without success... Has anyone had the same problem? Thanks </p> <p>Pago</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_Pago_"> /u/_Pago_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fsc40f/amiga_600_with_furia_and_3com_pcmcia_network/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fsc40f/amiga_600_with_furia_and_3com_pcmcia_network/">[comments]</a></span>

## I wish there was... a case for SBC Amigas (V4SA, Minimig, Pimiga etc.) that looked like a CD1200

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I would buy in a heartbeat a SBC case working with SBCs that emulate or run AmigaOS, and that has a space for a CD drive in it, that is styled after the CD1200 especially that great domed top.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m trying to make amiga floppies on a pc, and i found this software/hardware solution online. I have all the components necessary to use it (pc floppy drive, cable, paralel connector, computer with a paralel port) and i’m wondering if it’s actually viable. I’ve seen a decent amount of documentation on it so i want to know if it’s a good choice for making amiga disks on pc</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SirDoodThe1st"> /u/SirDoodThe1st </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fs3e8u/has_anyone_here_used_adtwin/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fs3e8u/has_anyone_here_used_adtwin/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi team!</p> <p>Recently I see that some people is trying to use the Amiga as a &quot;serious&quot; daily driver. So, here is my experience as an Amiga user who tried this project few months ago.</p> <p>I am a professional photographer and writer and if for my photojournalism work I use a MacBook Pro for my personal projects (from where I received my 60% of incomings) I tried to use my Amiga 2000. I was also thinking to by a Vampire but at the end I gave up with the project. And here are the reasons:</p> <p>First of all you need to know for what you need to use your miggy. My goals where:</p> <p>1.- PHOTO RETOUCH: In photoshop I (and I think the 90% of photographers) use the software for:</p> <p>a) Dodge and burning. A lot of times TIFF format in 16 bit. Almost the 99% in black and white.</p> <p>b) Resize pictures increasing and decreasing the pixels (or cms or inches) and the dpi.</p> <p>2.- PRINT with color management capable printer.</p> <p>3.- SCA
