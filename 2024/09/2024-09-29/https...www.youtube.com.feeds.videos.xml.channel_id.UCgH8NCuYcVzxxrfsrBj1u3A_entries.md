It's been sixteen years since The Cure's last album, but a 14th is on its way. "Songs of A Lost World" will be released in November and this is its opening track, "Alone". I'm sorry there's only a fraction of it  here - copyright was an issue - but it's beautiful and all (nearly) seven minutes of "Alone" can be found here:
