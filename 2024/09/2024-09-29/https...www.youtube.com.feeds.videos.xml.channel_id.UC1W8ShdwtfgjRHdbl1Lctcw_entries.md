Seattle 1920s in color [60fps,Remastered] w/sound design Added

I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Seattle 1926, The bustling streets of Seattle are highlighted through various scenes. Cue cards identify notable locations such as the intersection of Jackson Street and 4th Avenue, Pine Street and 4th Avenue, Jackson Street, Juanita Bay, the Fremont Bridge, 34th Avenue, and the University Bridge


Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
