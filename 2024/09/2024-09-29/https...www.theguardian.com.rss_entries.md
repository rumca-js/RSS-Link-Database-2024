<p>The Madrid derby was stopped for 15 minutes after two PA announcements failed to stop supporters in the south stand at the Estadio Metropolitano throwing missiles at Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Coach Diego Simeone and captain Koke approached the end in an attempt to get them to stop while Joséma Giménez got involved in a discussion with supporters, including some wearing balaclavas, before the referee, Mateo Busquets Ferrer, took the teams off the pitch.</p><p>They eventually returned at 10.42pm, with around 20 minutes still to play, during which Atlético scored a late, late equaliser, Angel Correa bundling in at the very end. According to La Liga protocols, another incident would have led to the permanent suspension of the match. Fortunately, that did not happen but the fallout will continue. Perhaps the best city derby in Europe – the only one to have been played out in a European Cup final – has been marked with abuse in recent years, including racist chanting aimed

<p>The former Game of Thrones star is so glam in this tale of the 80s criminal known as the Godmother that she wears more furs than even Sansa Stark. It’s a hefty slice of fun</p><p>Joan Hannington’s story makes you ask what on earth you have been doing with your time. How does someone manage to overcome a loveless childhood, an abusive marriage and penurious single parenthood to become a successful jewel thief and then an influential player in the criminal underworld known&nbsp;as the Godmother? It’s all I can do to manage a shower three times a week.</p><p>Hannington told her tale in her 2002 autobiography, I Am What I Am (since republished as Joan), which has been turned into this six-part drama. At heart, the adaptation is a crime caper, but with enough of the protagonist’s background sketched in – including Joan’s need to provide for her daughter, Kelly (Mia Millichamp-Long) – to keep you emotionally invested.

<p>Chastening defeat adds to Old Trafford crisis story but the reality is they were simply undone by a maverick opponent</p><p>Well, Manchester United: here’s your Wembley of the North. Several years ahead of schedule, and perhaps not quite as envisaged in the architects’ drawings, but note-perfect in most other respects.

After all, this is not simply a job but an office, and even in moments of decay a certain carriage is demanded. “Is there a fire drill?” the Tottenham fans gleefully asked as Old Trafford slowly emptied.

It’s almost humiliating, and I wish that we could just look at the work sometimes.”</p><p>OK, so let’s talk about the work. The reason we’re chatting (over video call, she’s in Oslo) is because a duet Portner made called Islands is being performed in London for the first time, by the National Ballet of Canada.

<p>YouTube isn’t always a stupefaction engine. Curious children and other autodidacts have unrivalled access to knowledge</p><p>With highbrow content but defiantly low production values, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/numberphile">Numberphile</a> YouTube channel might be considered the antithesis of the platform’s biggest successes. While stars such as the controversial <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgn8d04kdko">MrBeast</a> orchestrate elaborate stunts and giveaways, Numberphile videos feature mathematicians talking through complex concepts at length. There are occasional questions or prompts from the unseen cameraman. The props are usually a sheet of brown paper and a marker pen. The closest the episodes get to clickbait are titles such as Tau vs Pi Smackdown or The Lazy Way to Cut Pizza; a typical video is More on Bertrand’s Paradox, or An Amazing Thing About 276.</p><p>None of this sounds like catnip for young viewers.

<p>The wonders of oceanic life shine through in a magical book that is at once Anthropocene novel, disquieting AI thriller, postcolonial allegory and a portrait of friendship</p><p>Richard Powers’s 2018 Pulitzer-winning book <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/08/the-overstory-richard-powers-review">The Overstory</a></em><em> </em>was one of the landmark novels of the past decade.

<p>French genre specialist Alexandre Aja’s chiller builds up a palpable sense of menace but fumbles the last act</p><p>A survivalist horror movie starring a suitably gaunt and ravaged-looking Halle Berry as a mother intent on protecting her twin sons (Anthony B Jenkins and Percy Daggs IV) from the evil that stalks the world outside, <em>Never Let Go</em> is a slippery film seeded with doubts and uncertainties. The one thing we never question, however, is that there is a very real threat to the children’s safety. Whether that threat comes from something malevolent lurking in the woods, or whether it’s located closer to home is key to the film’s sinuous sense of menace. The picture, directed by French genre whiz Alexandre Aja (<em>Switchblade Romance</em>, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/mar/12/review.features27">The Hills Have Eyes</a></em>), is reasonably effective up to a point – it taps into the hostility of the natural world and the rituals that we adopt to keep

<p>The existential threat from a large meteor is real, but two next-generation telescopes are about to make us safer</p><p>On 4 September, an asteroid was spotted curving towards Earth. Astronomers quickly established that it would impact the planet in 10 hours’ time. The Philippines island of Luzon was in the line of fire, and there was nothing they could do about it but watch. Sure enough, at 16.39 UTC (17.39 in the UK), just as predicted, the space rock <a href="https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Planetary_Defence/Asteroid_2024_RW1_impact_ESA_analysis">plunged into the world and burst into flames</a>.</p><p>If you’re wondering why you’re still around to read this, it’s because that meteor was only a metre in length. Far too puny to cause any damage, the asteroid instead harmlessly ignited in the upper atmosphere, temporarily painting the sky in a blue-green streak of light. As it turns out, small asteroids hit the planet all the time. They’re nothing to worry about – but it doesn’t t

<p>Even the combined charm of its two leads cannot elevate this one-joke comedy-thriller about two underworld fixers double-booked on a job</p><p>This comedy thriller takes the sparky chemistry between Brad Pitt and George Clooney – a force that could power the national grid as well as several instalments of the Oceans series – and turns it on its head. Clooney and Pitt play unnamed competitors, both covert fixers of other people’s messy situations. When, due to a communication breakdown, they find themselves hired for the same job (a hotel room, a body, a compromised politician), the (un)professional rivalry between them boils over into petty niggling and bickering. The joke is that, for all their personal differences, they are basically the same man. But it’s a joke that soon wears thin, and a film that erases itself so thoroughly from your memory, it’s almost as if Pitt and Clooney had performed one of their bespoke clean-up services on your brain.</p><p>In UK and Irish cinemas and

<p>Josh Greenbaum’s funny and touching documentary follows the comedian and his old friend across the US in a likable portrait that never quite rings true  </p><p>When the comedian Will Ferrell learned that one of his oldest friends had transitioned to female and was now living as Harper Steele, he suggested a road trip together as a way of supporting and learning from her. The resulting film is a poignant and frequently very funny portrait of their evolving relationship. But that’s as far as it goes. To suggest that the documentary offers much in the way of real insight into the experience of a late-life newly transitioned individual as she navigates the US is disingenuous. The cushioning effect of Ferrell’s celebrity and, judging by the closing credit list, an extensive and well-funded production team, mean that while this is a likable-enough film, it is an insulated and artificial construction.</p><p>In UK and Irish cinemas and on Netflix</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fi

<p>Maisy Stella and Aubrey Plaza are a winning duo playing their present and future selves in Megan Park’s silly but surprisingly satisfying film</p><p>Eighteen-year-old Elliott (a fizzing, star-making turn from Maisy Stella) is poised on the brink of the next stage of her life. She’s about to leave her home and her family of “third-generation cranberry farmers” in Muskoka, Ontario, and head to the city for college. To celebrate the fact, she camps overnight on an island and takes a bunch of mushrooms with her besties. And that’s when things get weird. The shrooms open some kind of cosmic portal and Elliott is visited by her 39-year-old self (Aubrey Plaza). And Elliott’s “old ass” has some advice for her younger self. It’s a fun, silly premise, but while there’s no shortage of stoner humour, the film is deeper and considerably more satisfying than the drug-baked adolescent wisecracking might initially suggest.

It was the place menaced and blackmailed by Cesare Borgia and ruled on the advice of Niccolò Machiavelli himself. Yet inside this treacherous city, three of the greatest names in art vied to create works of transcendent beauty. Each of them is still recognised by only one of their names: they are Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael.</p><p>Not much written evidence survives of the creative rivalry that raged between these men – and what has endured often does not stand up to scrutiny. But this autumn the British public will have the chance to witness the competition between these revered artists with their own eyes for the first time. In fact, they will be able to see it twice: once on the walls of the Royal Academy of Arts, where drawings by this trio of masters will be brought together for comparison as never before (f

Frederick Ashton’s ballet has been performed by the company since 1962, just two years after its premiere. And the current artistic director Carlos Acosta was a fine latter-day Colas, the young farmer whose adoration of the badly guarded Lise provides the motor for this bucolic love story. All of which may explain the loving attention to detail that has gone into this blissful revival.</p><p>It does the ballet the great tribute of understanding that if you take care of the steps – of the dancing hens who shake their feathered arms as they wake at dawn, of the young lovers throwing ribbons across the stage as the

<p>What does it feel like to discover, in adulthood, that you are a twin? Here, five sets of brothers and sisters tell their stories of meeting for the first time – and what happened to them next</p><p>Imagine finding out late in life that there’s someone out there who looks just like you: same eyes, same nose, same mouth. Not a doppelganger, but a twin you never knew existed. Discovering that you’re a twin is “a life-changing experience,” says Nancy L Segal, a professor of psychology and the director of the Twin Studies Centre at California State University, Fullerton.</p><p>Segal has written nine books on twins and is now working on her 10th. Over the years, she has come across at least 100 pairs of reared-apart twins. In most cases the twins were separated at birth and adopted by different families. “Adoptees often feel that something’s missing in their lives,” Segal says. “I think it relates to the fact they don’t look like their family members. They don’t feel a certain kind of b

<p>Growing up poor blights children’s lives, and results in lower work and health outcomes that cost the exchequer long term</p><p>What’s Labour’s governing philosophy? That was the question posed at a dinner I went to with some MPs and former staffers during the party’s annual conference in Liverpool last week. Is Keir Starmer more influenced by the communitarian blend of leftwing economics and socially conservative values that is “blue Labour”, or is he driven by the Fabian democratic socialism that was at the heart of his campaign to become Labour leader?</p><p>A prime minister’s motivating beliefs are always pored over by those interested in what direction a particular government might take. But in this case I’m not sure how much it matters, because there is a third governing philosophy dominating Labour that renders almost everything else moot.

<p>A pet is a symbol of virtue, its happiness a test of our humanity. This year it’s also a marker of electability…</p><p>My friend Shay has acquired a cat. It started when her family got a kitten, but then the kitten attracted a stray, who entered the house and ate all the food, much like that awful tiger who came to tea. He’s a big guy, muscular, itchy, needy, and they took him to the vet, to discover he was unchipped. They put up posters, they asked online if neighbours had lost a cat. “Enjoy your new cat!” said the neighbours. The vet’s advice was not to feed it or pay it any attention. The cat shelter’s advice was to feed it and love it.</p><p>They compromised, with a bed in the shed and food outside. Foxes used the bed as a toy – the cat stoically remains at their window. Along the way, Shay’s young daughter has named it Mr Fish, a name both formal and disgusted. I have enjoyed my Mr Fish updates, not just because it’s very funny seeing my friend compelled to care for an animal

But if, also like Waitrose, that means it has a reputation for being posh, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s expensive. Indeed, my notes from a recent press tasting of 140 Booths bottles are peppered with variations on themes of “good value” and “bargain”. Such are the costs of production and duty these days, real value, as opposed to a wine being merely cheap, tends to start around £10 at Booths as it does everywhere else.
