Some say it's solely due to Orion, Meta's new AR glasses prototype, but I say its because of multiple factors. 1. A cheap mixed reality capable VR headset launching this month, 2. Meta is the first company to open camera access to developers to actually develop compelling mixed reality (and future augmented reality) apps 3. The most compelling AR device the world has ever seen; Orion. \n\nTech giants have been racing towards consumer AR devices for the past two decades now.. but I don't think anyone has come this close to putting together an entire package that includes developers, hardware, software.. and research together in a way that actually makes sense- until now. \n\nJoin my discord to talk more about VR design with me:\nhttps://Discord.gg/Thrill\n\nSupport Content Like this:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n00:00 Intro\n", "id": 1235246, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGNXE1oP2mw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 368, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCSbdMXOI_3HGiFviLZO6kNA", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/kGNXE1oP2mw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Meta Just Had its iPhone Moment.", "vote": 0}]
