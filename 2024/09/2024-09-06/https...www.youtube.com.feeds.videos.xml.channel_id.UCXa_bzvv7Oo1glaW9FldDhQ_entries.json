There is definitely room for expanding on these ideas perpetuated in this game, and it will be interesting to see how these are elaborated on, or what new ones they conceive in the future.", "id": 1098131, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEkf2TIgUdE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/OEkf2TIgUdE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Squirrel With A Gun Review - One of the Craziest Games of 2024 You Are Not Playing", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-06T16:00:44+00:00", "description": "Space Marine 2 is available for early access owners, with its worldwide launch set for September 9th on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. However, it's already garnered an impressive player count on Steam and positive reviews from critics.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to dive into the third-person shooter, from its excellent visuals to the compelling campaign, but the combat is what sells it. Every action in the game, whether you're moving around, slicing up Tyranids with a Chainsword, or breaking out the Heavy Bolter to mow down swarms of enemies, feels fantastic. It also doesn't hurt that the enemies and combat scenarios are enjoyable to engage with.\n\nWith just how solid the combat feels, it's possible that Space Marine 2 may unseat the likes of Gears of War.
