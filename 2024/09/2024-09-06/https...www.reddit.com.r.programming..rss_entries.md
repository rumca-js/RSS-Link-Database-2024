<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know for a fact that some people use the Inspect Element options to figure out the remaining stock for the dolls Mattel sell on their website. This is helpful since some of these releases sell out faster than others and I’d like to be able to prioritize how I spend my money. Searching for “quantity” in the inspect element page sometimes works for other Shopify websites and you can see the remaning stock, but it doesn’t seem to work for Mattel Creations. However, some people are still able to know. Can anybody help me with this please? This is an example: <a href="https://creations.mattel.com/products/monster-high-outta-fright-operetta-doll-hrp93">https://creations.mattel.com/products/monster-high-outta-fright-operetta-doll-hrp93</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yellowx0"> /u/yellowx0 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1fa6fm4/how_can_i_figure_out_product_s
