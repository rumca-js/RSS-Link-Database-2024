At the moment, Chromium auto-starts but I can&#39;t seem to exit chromium.</p> <p>If I press Ctrl+Alt+F2 I get to the command prompt but I can&#39;t seem to figure out what I need to type to make the change I want. I essentially want to rotate my screen 180&#39;. It is set up as portrait but the way the display is made I need to rotate it 180&#39;.</p> <p>These are the instructions I followed from the Mango website.

I\u2019m in Raspbian Lite, Raspberry Pi 3B. Anyone knows how to solve it? I tried everything. With the HDMI - RCA adapter the screen is cut off and with the 3.5 mm Jack video composite out this cut off is even bigger. The boot/firmware/config.txt is ignored. I put the sdtv_mode=2 for PAL, the line to disable the HDMI and the oversacan_right=16 etc.. but nothing changes. Just the raspi-config works. I tried to changes my TV settings too, but there is not way to change the size, just from 4:3 to 16:9.
