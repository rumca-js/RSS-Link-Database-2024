I don&#39;t know if this is the right sub, but I&#39;m studying for my Computer Architecture exam and precisely I&#39;m learning about the CPU datapath, implementing a subset of RISC-V instructions. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/oNhkoEq\">Here</a> you can find a picture of what I&#39;m talking about. My question is, as the title says, why is the sign-extended offset of a branch instruction shifted left by 1 before going into the adder that calculates the address of the jump?<br/> My hypothesis is the following: I know that the 12 immediate bits of a B-type instructions start from bit number 1 because the 0-th bit is always zero. So maybe the offset is shifted left by one so that the 0-th bit is considered and the offset has the correct value. But I have no idea if I&#39;m right or wrong... Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/asdrubale_2\"> /u/asdrubale_2 </a> <br/> <span><", "id": 1098572, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1farhn2/why_is_the_offset_of_a_branch_instruction_shifted", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "source_obj__id": 471, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Why is the offset of a branch instruction shifted left by one?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-06T13:03:36+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>In the standard page 267 the description of the zip instruction doesn&#39;t match the operation, which is correct?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PColim\"> /u/PColim </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1faenrb/zip_instruction_which_one_from_the_description_or/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1faenrb/zip_instruction_which_one_from_the_description_or/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1095251, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1faenrb/zip_instruction_which_one_from_the_description_or", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/.rss", "source_obj__id": 471, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "zip instruction: which one from the description or the operation is correct?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-06T12:10:29+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h2>Editor&#39;s Note</h2> <p>Welcome to the fifty-eighth issue of the SG2042 Newsletter.
