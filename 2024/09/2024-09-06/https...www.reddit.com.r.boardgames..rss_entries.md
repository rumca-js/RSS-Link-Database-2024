It is missing one of the player pieces, and it is not one of those pieces that would be considered &quot;unlimited&quot; in count.</p> <p>Now, the game is for the most part playable (I could use some other random wood cube to substitute the missing player piece) but not technically complete. I am also concerned about the value of the game should I choose to re-sell it down the line, knowing it isn&#39;t complete.</p> <p>What do you guys tend to do if you obtain a used game from a seller that is incomplete, even if for a small thing such as this, aside from reaching out to a manufacturer for a replacement piece? </p> <p>(1) Ask seller for refund with seller paying return shipping?</p> <p>(2) Ask for a small refund off the purchase price of the game to compensate for the game being incomplete?</p> <p>(3) Suck it up ?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My spouse and I have played the base game of It&#39;s a Wonderful World a lot and thoroughly enjoyed it. After 100+ games the excitement started to die down, only to be sparked again by Corruption &amp; Ascension expansion.</p> <p>Now they are selling the campaign expansions at a discount, and I can’t help but wonder if they are worth getting if you are not interested in playing the campaigns. I have understood that both of them contain booster cards that you can use with the base game, but I cannot find any detailed information about them. Do they give you any extra options or new viable strategies compared to the base game, or are they just extra copies of the base game cards?</p> <p>So I would be very interested to get information on those cards and hear your opinions. What do the boosters bring to the table and would you invest extra money to get them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Stephen_I

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, so i have played hegemony 2 times in 1 week. One at 4 players and the other at the 3 player count. While 3 players is not bad 4 players is where it really shines and comes into full force. Its one hell of a game, i dare say of all the games that i haved played this past year, this has to been the most inmersive and fun experience i have ever had. We have come out of this game wanting to play more and keep exploring the avenues it offers. Im going to play it again this sunday and im beyond excited to get it going on again. I bought the crisis and control expansion and im excited as it brings more replayability by adding different modules, but il comment on that later. Now in my opinion this is a game that you have to play with the same group since everyone is in the same playing field and if you teach other gamers they will be at a disadvantage. So the caviat being playing it with the same group or with other gamers that have already pl

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With the Everdell Duo campaign I saw Farshore is also there for a more reasonable price than what it&#39;s usually at, leading me to consider picking it up.</p> <p>I was surprised to see it has a slightly lower BGG rating (7.9) than the original (8.0). This is surprising first because, at least from what I&#39;ve heard, Farshore is an improved version that I believe incorporates some ideas from Everdell&#39;s expansions. But also (like expansions) these sorts of sequels tend to be higher rated because a) they address perceived issues with the original game, and b) there&#39;s a self-selection effect such that people who don&#39;t like the original/base game are less likely to play them. For example I looked up a few other notable games and in each case the sequel was higher rated than the original (Frosthaven, Gaia Project, Dune Imperium: Uprising, Wyrmspan, and TTR: Europe were all rated higher than their predesessor). In Farshore&#39;s case, it does

My BIL and his friends could take half an hour to take a turn. My patience is about 30 seconds long.
