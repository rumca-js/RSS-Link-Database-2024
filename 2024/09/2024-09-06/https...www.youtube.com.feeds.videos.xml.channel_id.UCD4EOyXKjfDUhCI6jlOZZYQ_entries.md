Programming is about data, the question is how to manage the data. Databases store text data and makes it easy to add, update and find data that you have stored.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the language used to interact with Relational Databases. It is used by systems such as MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres and SQLite.

SQLIte is a dirt simple Relational Database that gives you the power of SQL with the administrative overhead of a text file. It is fast, easy to use, AND has near no security built in.

We will learn how to add SQLite to our Python projects so that we can add the capability to store and request data easily.

The class will go over:
- Relational Database Basics
- Basic SQLite Management
