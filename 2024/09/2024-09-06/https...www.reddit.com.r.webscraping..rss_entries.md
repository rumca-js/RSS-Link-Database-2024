<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m build this web app that scrapes IG to get the followers of an account, and I am using Selenium to do so. Running my script locally works fine as it logs into my personal account and then access the profile url, but I know that if I tried to run it on another laptop which i have never used to log in to my account before, Instagram would show me a verification page where I need to enter the code sent by email, and that would hinder the working of my selenium script.</p> <p>How would you go about deploying this kind of app on a Linux server ?</p> <p>I am thinking about renting a VPS where i could install a GUI and use it to log in manually to my account to &quot;warm it&quot; first, and solve any problem that I&#39;d have to deal with manually from Instagram. And then deploy my app on that same VPS where it would run without problem since instagram will just think that I am using a usual laptop and browser to access my account.</p> <p>Any help or

## Is DNS caching something to consider when web scraping?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m new and I haven&#39;t much knowledge.</p> <p>I was wondering, if I scrape one site every few seconds, Is DNS caching something to set up to avoid a lot of DNS lookup or is done automatically? </p> <p>Practical example: I have a script that every few seconds check a marketplace for new products. Let&#39;s say marketplace domain is martketpalce.com. To convert that domain to an IP, it is sent a DNS lookup to a DNS server. To avoid sending a DNS lookup every time I scrape martketpalce.com, should I do something in particular or not?</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dekoalade"> /u/dekoalade </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fai79t/is_dns_caching_something_to_consider_when_web/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fai79t/is_dns_caching_something_to_consider_when_web/">[comments]</a></span>
