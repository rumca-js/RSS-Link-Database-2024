Today, the company is synonymous with high-end saxophones. \n\nThe most popular saxophone it sells, the Series II alto, starts at about $7,000, but a Selmer can cost you as much as $30,000, depending on the customization and finishes like gold plating. \n\nJohn Coltrane, one of the most influential jazz musicians of all time, used Selmer saxophones in his performances. He recorded his magnum opus, \"A Love Supreme,\" on a Mark VI. One of his Mark VI tenor saxophones is on display at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.\n\nMusicians are willing to pay for a Selmer for a variety of reasons: the familiar sound, the history behind the brand, the craftsmanship and attention to detail, and the playability.\n\nMORE SO EXPENSIVE VIDEOS:\nWhy Lego Is So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d8sNML3WT8\nWhy Hagoromo Chalk Is So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/BORVxbsdk", "id": 1095985, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJg7j5ge9EM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCcyq283he07B7_KUX07mmtA", "source_obj__id": 152, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zJg7j5ge9EM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why Selmer Saxophones Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
