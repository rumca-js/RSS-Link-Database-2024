In this report, we close out the story on what's going on at the tech company that sold over $250,000,000 of products in its time in business. The company has been collapsing from within for years now, silently, but grew louder this year as contractors went unpaid. Now, dozens of staff are unpaid and are filing lawsuits against former employer EK Water Blocks (EKWB), which is headquartered in Slovenia and has branches across the world. We piece together what went wrong.
