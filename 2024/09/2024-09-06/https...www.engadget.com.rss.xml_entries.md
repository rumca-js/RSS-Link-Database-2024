<p>Talks between Apple and the union for the Apple Store in Oklahoma City have produced a tentative agreement that includes new benefits and protections for its staff. The Penn Square Mall Apple Store in Oklahoma City announced they’ve reached a “tentative labor agreement” with Apple and the Communication Workers of America (CWA), according to a released statement.</p>
<p>Terms are still being negotiated between both parties but the benefits for the store’s employees would be significant. The three-year agreement reached between the CWA and Apple would give employees a wage increase of up to 11.5 percent. An Apple spokesperson said by email that if the contract is ratified, employees would receive a 4 percent raise in the first year of employment and 3 percent in the second and third year each “based on employee performance.”</p>

This new distraction-free writing slate comes with a nicer chassis, faster internals, a bigger display and most importantly, a color screen.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you’re unfamiliar, reMarkable is the standard bearer for those devices standing in the delta between high and low tech. It’s an e-paper slate with a stylus (or keyboard) for reading, writing or editing your own documents, or annotating PDFs. The focus is giving you a calmer space to get some Serious Work(™) done, free from the distractions a “proper” computer or tablet would harbor. The company has always maintained that its devi

<p>Signify launched a more future-proofed Philips Hue Sync Box, the company’s gizmo that plugs into your TV and creates a light show synced with your onscreen content. Unlike the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-philips-hue-play-hdmi-sync-box.html">original model from 2019</a>, the upgraded box supports <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-28-hdmi-2-1-specification-is-now-available-with-10k.html">HDMI 2.1</a>, making it better suited to the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>The Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box supports resolutions up to 8K at 60Hz for video and 4K at 120Hz for gaming. In theory, this should make for a smoother, more screen-accurate Hue-powered light show. Even if you don’t have a current-gen gaming console or compatible TV, the box will be better equipped to handle the gear you buy down the road.</p>

<p><em>What the Car? </em>is a celebration of gaming through pure creativity, unfettered by the trappings of narrative logic. It isn&#39;t as wildly surprising as <em>What the Golf?</em>, and it doesn&#39;t have the VR immersion of <em>What the Bat?</em>, but like those previous two games, it still delivers more charm and whimsy than you&#39;ll see in most other titles. Why does the car have legs, you ask? Shut up and play.</p>
<p>As we learned from <em>What the Golf?</em>, the developers at Triband Games specialize in subverting your expectations. So while your main character is indeed a car, you won&#39;t actually be racing on four wheels over boring old tracks. Your car sprouts legs early on, and that alone teaches you to expect the unexpected. Every level you play twists the weirdness a bit further: You&#39;ll get long legs; you&#39;ll get a rocket pack and springy legs; you&#39;ll be transformed into a soccer ball.</p>

<p>Sony shared a first glimpse of its plans to celebrate PlayStation’s 30th anniversary, and it seems PS5 Pro is coming to the party. Its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/did-sony-just-reveal-the-ps5-pro-design-in-its-30th-anniversary-announcement-212322835.html">decorative logo</a> includes an image of the rumored upgrade to the current-gen PS5 console. Zoom between the S of the PlayStation logo and the 3, to reveal a different rectangle to the PS5s that appears elsewhere. The main change appears to be a differently proportioned console — if this is the Pro, it’ll be shorter than the OG PS5 — and have more stripes across the body, making it look a lot like the PS5 Pro rendering leaked in late August. How much, though? And how much more powerful?</p>

<p>Most microSD cards are fast enough for storing and transferring files, but some will provide a little more bang for the buck than others. If you’ve got a device that supports the format — be it a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-review-130025998-130025862.html">Nintendo Switch</a> or other <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-handheld-gaming-system-140018863.html">gaming handheld</a>, a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-12-review-new-features-143039315.html">GoPro</a>, a <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-raspberry-pi-5-uses-the-companys-own-chip-designs-061316561.html">Raspberry Pi</a> or a dash cam — we’ve researched the market and put more than a dozen top microSD cards through a bunch of benchmark tests.

<p>Withings is announcing the ScanWatch Nova Brilliant, a 39mm version of its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-releases-luxury-version-of-its-scanwatch-2-smartwatch-150042693.html"><ins>ScanWatch Nova</ins></a> smartwatch. It comes in titanium silver and a two-tone silver and gold. For those with smaller wrists, this watch should be a more comfortable fit than the standard 42mm option.</p>

<p>The elegant timepiece mixes analog features with modern digital ones. A small OLED screen on the top half of the watch helps you tell the time quickly and can also display health metrics, but there are mechanical hands for a classic look. It’s also water resistant up to 50 meters (5 ATM) and has a five-link stainless steel bracelet for improved outdoor durability. The battery lasts for 30 days but there’s no info about the charging time.</p>
