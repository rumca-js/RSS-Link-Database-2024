Italy levelled after half an hour with Federico Dimarco volleying home a deft backheel pass from Sandro Tonali, and the sides went in level at the break after a pulsating opening half.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/06/nations-league-roundup-italy-stun-france-despite-conceding-in-12-seconds">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Interim manager takes charge for the first time against Ireland, the nation he won 40 caps with as a player</p><p>Lee Carsley has never pretended otherwise. When England first came calling, he was torn. It was September 2015, he had a coaching role at Brentford and the England Under-19 manager, Aidy Boothroyd, wanted him as his assistant. “When I was asked to do it, the first thing I thought was: ‘Well, I’m Irish … how does that look?’” Carsley told Shane Keegan’s excellent How To Win At Dominoes podcast in June 2020.</p><p>It is impossible to prescribe how the individual with dual nationality ought to feel with regard to their heritage. Each case is nuanced, deeply personal. Carsley was born and raised in Birmingham and so England is a significant part of him. As is Ireland, where his maternal grandmother is from (specifically, Dunmanway in County Cork).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/06/englands-lee-carsley-puts-mixed-feelings-firmly-behind-him

<p></p><p>The day after Craig Bellamy smiled and apologised to a Turkish translator for rambling his way to the end of an answer, his passion for the Wales job spilled over on to the pitch. In the buildup there was an understandable, first-day-at-school nervous energy to Bellamy and no wonder his excitement given the buzz his team emitted. Officially, this was a Nations League opener against a team four places above them in the rankings but, in simple terms, it was Bellamy’s first examination as a manager.</p><p>There was still a touch of the old Bellamy – the fourth official Sigurd Kringstad was never too far from a glare – but he will have been chuffed with this showing. As first impressions go, this was a resounding if not imperfect performance against a Turkey team who played more than 35 minutes with 10 men after Baris Alper Yilmaz was sent off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/06/bellamy-starts-wales-reign-with-draw-against-turkey-despite-yilmaz

<p>Opener may have chucked away his wicket but he is such a natural attacking batter and illuminated a grey day</p><p>Perhaps the strangest part of Ben Duckett’s dismissal was how long it seemed to take, the ball falling very slowly out of the grey Oval sky.

Milan Rathnayake was bowling from the Vauxhall End, rolling out something that is probably best described as right-arm moderate. Duckett had played a couple of dot balls. Tiring of this, he pirouetted away from the next one, fell backwards, waited, waited some more, then wafted at it, trying to impart some momentum; the whole thing by now a bit like a last slightly woozy game of badminton on the lawn before tea, succeeding only in clot

<p><strong>Toronto film festival:</strong> the actor gives a physically committed performance as a retired boxer cutting weight with dangerous speed in a silly and overcooked drama</p><p>“There is no ripcord!” screams a furiously hammy John Turturro repeatedly in lurid boxing psychodrama The Cut, a film that often makes you wish there was one for us to pull. Not because it’s all just <em>too</em> intense but because what could have been a tough and probing study of over-the-cliff male body obsession instead becomes a ridiculously overcooked shock horror.

<ul><li>Frenchman moves past Ethan Vernon to take win</li><li>Steve Williams holds on to overall lead in Newark</li></ul><p>The list of previous Tour of Britain winners in Newark is short, but it points to a promising future for the Frenchman Paul Magnier, who took his second stage win in four days on the banks of the Trent. Colombia’s Fernando Gaviria (2017) and the Dutchman Olav Kooij (2023) are both sprint names to be reckoned with, and these two incisive victories suggest the 20-year-old Magnier is on the same road.</p><p>This was a finely calculated effort in a slightly less technical finish than in Kelso on Tuesday. The Israel- Premier Tech sprinter Ethan Vernon led out and as the road drifted slightly to the right, Magnier came up the narrow gap on Vernon’s left side, “through a mousehole” as Magnier put it, and the 24-year-old from Bedford resisted the temptation to close the door, giving the Frenchman a clear run to the line.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/art

<p><strong>The Yard, London<br></strong>While its subject matter is powerful, the story of three split selves is too disconnected to follow, with one scene jumping to another and not joining up to form a whole</p><p>The fracturing experience of childhood adoption manifests as a split self on stage. There are three versions of one woman, from different points in life, talking about a fourth, present-day incarnation, off stage. The ambition is to become whole but that requires a painful journey back to the beginning.</p><p>Selina Thompson’s play employs an overarching tree metaphor, so the split selves are Sapling (Angelina Chudi), Bark (Muki Zubis) and Seed (Nandi Bhebhe), on a mission to unite with their whole self, called Sycamore.

<p>Post-Covid hunger for travel is taking a heavy toll on the environment amid race to net zero, say experts</p><p>For some people, summer holidays are a relaxing break from daily life, a blissful chance to hit the sunbed and lie flat for as long as humanly possible.

It’s just that so far, that gap “year” has lasted two (she hasn’t stepped on to a rugby pitch since the end of the 2022 World Cup), and has involved a dizzying number of coaching gigs and a return to her original sport: cricket.</p><p>Her latest assignment is as an assistant coach on England Women’s tour to Ireland, which starts on Saturday with the first of three one-day internationals in Belfast, followed by two T20s in Dublin.

That Thomas Adès’s Aquifer, led by Simon Rattle making his first Proms appearance as chief conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, held its own is a testament to two of Britain’s most consistently original talents.</p><p>Aquifer, here receiving its UK premiere, takes its name from an underground layer of permeable rock through which water seeps and flows.

<p>Ahead of her seventh album, aptly titled 7, the Canadian Portuguese musician will answer your questions on anything from her long and storied career</p><p>Seven years since her last album, 2017’s The Ride, Nelly Furtado’s seventh album is, quite sensibly, named 7. The Canadian Portuguese musician’s return to music was partially inspired, she has said, by going out and hearing her defining hits – Maneater, Promiscuous, Like a Bird – being remixed by DJs, and her eldest daughter showing her how they were being enjoyed by a new generation on TikTok. The album embraces Furtado’s Latin roots, featuring collaborations with Bomba Estéreo, and her pop bona fides, with the likes of SG Lewis (Dua Lipa) and Tove Lo on board – threading the joins between her introspective 2003 album Folklore and 2006’s pop-R&amp;B smash Loose, which doesn’t seem to have aged a day.</p><p>Since then, Furtado has been named as an influence by the likes of Lorde, Billie Eilish and Lipa; she’s also collaborated wi

Everybody was so young when the first surrealist manifesto was published in October 1924: was it really a century ago? Painter Yves Tanguy sports a punk hairstyle as he grimaces for the automatic camera; Marie-Berthe Aurenche, another painter, whips her hair up into chaos; Salvador Dalí closes his eyes as if asleep.</p><p>These people are funny and having fun. Of all the modernist art movements, it was the surrealists who were best at enjoying their revolution. In the Pompidou’s perfectly judged exhibition, that pleasure shines through as you meet these artists, all dead now, not so

Such factors are not specifically German or, say Italian, nor were they the manifestations of a unique historical era, now safely in the distant past. Not only can the malignant political-economic-ideological climates required for the flowering of fascism develop anywhere, so are its emotional dynamics present in the psyche of most human beings.</p><p>“We each have a Nazi within,” the Auschwitz survivor Edith Eger has written – pointing, in my observation, to a near-universal reality.

Mumbai construction worker Dasru (Manoj Bajpayee) is forced to go on the run with his three-month-old daughter, Joram, when his wife is killed by unknown assailants. He flees to his home state of Jharkhand, where he has a secret past as a tribal rebel, but the police and powerful local politician Phulo Karma (a superbly chilling Smita Tambe) are on his tail. Between tense pursuits, there is a real sense of a rural community succumbing to “progress” – mining, land grabs, corruption – and a traditional culture buckling under the strain. <em

The Australian ex-supermodel swears by the benefits of limiting red meat, wheat, dairy, sugar and processed food, and by something she calls “alkalising greens” (no, me neither). Through her glossy wellness brand, WelleCo, she tirelessly promotes her Super Elixir – a blend of vitamins and minerals apparently devised by her naturopath when she was feeling rundown and menopausal – to women who want to look as incredible as she does at 60, and are willing to believe that has something to do with kale.</p><p>So far, so relatively benign, though admittedly things took a darker turn when Macpherson dated Andrew Wakefield <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10290417/Elle-Macpherson-confirms-split-
