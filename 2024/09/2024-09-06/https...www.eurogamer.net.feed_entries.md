High-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has returned to YouTube - two months after admitting he exchanged "messages with an individual minor" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" - accusing critics of a "planned and coordinated attack", and asking, "Did any of you consider [they] may have been over the legal age of consent?".

Concord, Sony's floundering 5v5 hero shooter, has now officially gone offline just two weeks after its PS5 and PC launch - its short life abruptly ending with an undignified "error" message.
</p><p>
Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-pvp-shooter-concord-is-firewalk-studios-first-game">unveiled last May</a> as part of former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">optimistically expansive push into live-service gaming</a>. Unfortunately for Sony and developer Firewalk Studios, Concord's launch this August failed to make much of an impact - player numbers were less-than-stellar, and subsequent reports claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">only around 25,00

With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>'s Shattered Space expansion just weeks away from release, Bethesda has been teasing some of the things players can expect to find when House Va'ruun's homeward of Va'ruun'kai opens for business on 30th September.
</p><p>
"Thank you to the millions of players who have made the Settled Systems their home and helped make this an incredible first year for Starfield", Bethesda wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1832055921758867842">post on social media</a>, before turning its attention to those pre-launch teases.

This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss the most dramatic few days for PlayStation in recent times.
</p><p>Sony's stunning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">decision to kill off live-service shooter flop Concord after less than two weeks</a> sent shockwaves around the industry, setting a new precedent for how swiftly a troubled title from a major publisher could be given the axe. After eight years of work, the game has already disappeared from sale, and will soon vanish from people's game libraries, with refunds automatically given. It's a remarkable move - even if Concord does somehow get a second lease of life - and another nail in the coffin for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-confirms-delay-to-half-its-planned-
