<p>Belarusian takes on Jessica Pegula, who has overcome injury this year to reach her first grand slam final</p><p>Over the past couple of years a curious divide has opened up on the women’s tour. The rankings, on one hand, do not lie.

Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 2, has now reached the finals of the past four hardcourt majors and she has made her presence felt at the semi-final stage or better in seven of the past eight she has competed in. It is just as clear she is the best in the world at the grand slam tournaments and on Saturday she will attempt to capture her third such title in two years.</p> <a href="https://www.theg

Early on, he addressed the crowd, talking about how nervous he was. It’s the kind of thing festival headliners are wont to say, flattering the magnitude of the event, but in Gibson’s case, it didn’t seem pat: he looked genuinely, frantically uneasy. It’s only been three years since he released his debut solo album, pivoting from what looked like being a lucrative gig behind the scenes as a pop songwriter and producer for BTS, Clean Bandit, Stormzy and George Ezra. His breakthrough single Marea (We’ve Lost Dancing) was a reflection on the privations of the Covid era, release

<p><strong>Toronto film festival:</strong> the actor returns to the big screen for his first leading role since 2017 yet David Gordon Green’s charmless throwback comedy fails to justify why</p><p>The strange and spotty career of writer-director David Gordon Green – from rural indies such as George Washington and Undertow to stoner comedies such as Pineapple Express and Your Highness to star-led Oscarbait such as Our Brand is Crisis and Stronger to horror reboots such as the Halloween and Exorcist reworks – takes another new turn with this year’s Toronto film festival opener, the rather forced family comedy Nutcrackers. Green had said that the film is intended to evoke the sorts of universally appealing 80s comedies he grew up with, such as Overboard and Uncle Buck and after following the commercially lucrative low-budget model for horror, he was keen to see if it could work for another, less recently proven, genre.</p><p>Having also grown up with similar touchpoints while then also mo

<p>Foley’s powerful memoir, narrated by Jamie Lee Curtis, details the life and death of her son, James Foley, who was beheaded by Islamic State terrorists</p><p>When Diane Foley learned of the beheading of her son by Islamic State terrorists in 2014, “time didn’t just freeze. Time disappeared entirely from time.” James Foley’s murderers claimed they were acting in retaliation for America’s airstrikes in Iraq. The image of James kneeling in an orange jumpsuit, a black-clad captor standing triumphantly behind him, was adopted as part of Islamic State’s anti-American propaganda, and in the west became a symbol of the terrorist group’s brutality.</p><p>American Mother is Diane’s memoir, co-written with the Irish novelist Colum McCann, which details not just her son’s captivity and murder but his life before that. James was the eldest of five children in a God-fearing, all-American family who, after a period spent teaching, became a freelance reporter dedicated to telling the stories of vi

<p>(Anti-)<br>Featuring possibly his best track yet, the North Carolina guitarist-songwriter goes to the sparse and seamy side on this worthy successor to Boat Songs</p><p>MJ Lenderman’s spit-and-sawdust alt-Americana album <em>Boat Songs</em> (2022) was acclaimed long before the latest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/24/ten-gallon-hits-why-country-is-the-biggest-pop-music-craze-of-2024">country music renaissance</a>, so expectations are elevated for its follow-up. The North Carolina singer-songwriter’s wry writing style, well suited to thumbnail character studies, still offers dry wit and pop culture references. Yet his fourth solo outing has darkness shadowing it too. Birds fly in and out of songs, maybe signifying freedom or its want, amid recurring references to alcohol, eschatology and the furnished emptiness of hotel rooms.</p><p>Still, there’s always the promise of redemption.
