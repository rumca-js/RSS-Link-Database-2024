It&#39;s just the full firehose of trending topics. For example:</p> <p><a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trending/rss?geo=US\">https://trends.google.com/trending/rss?geo=US</a></p> <p>Anyone know of a way to modify the feed, maybe with a URL-bsed argument or componant, that could get it to be less frequent? This current feed is posting many times per day. It also features <em>all</em> trends, including boring crap like &quot;today&#39;s weather&quot;. </p> <p>Any suggestions for improving this? </p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chickenandliver\"> /u/chickenandliver </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1facd27/google_trends_rss_fe", "id": 1094620, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1facd27/google_trends_rss_feeds", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/.rss", "source_obj__id": 482, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Google Trends RSS feeds", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-06T10:04:04+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Another call to the community, this time about voice features. I&#39;ve tried the Readwise Reader &#39;Listen&#39; service and it&#39;s frankly incredible. But here&#39;s the thing. I can only afford one subscription, and at the moment I&#39;m leaning more towards Inoreader because of its far more sophisticated handling of feeds.</p> <p>So my question is, how does Inoreader&#39;s Text-to-Speech measure up? I&#39;d be happy to be pointed towards a demo, a review, or just hear about your experience with it.
