<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to subscribe to Google&#39;s weekly Trends email, but they are depreciating that in favor of RSS feeds (wow!)</p> <p>However, it looks like there is only a single feed for each location, meaning you can&#39;t adjust for time. It&#39;s just the full firehose of trending topics. For example:</p> <p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trending/rss?geo=US">https://trends.google.com/trending/rss?geo=US</a></p> <p>Anyone know of a way to modify the feed, maybe with a URL-bsed argument or componant, that could get it to be less frequent? This current feed is posting many times per day. It also features <em>all</em> trends, including boring crap like &quot;today&#39;s weather&quot;. </p> <p>Any suggestions for improving this? </p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chickenandliver"> /u/chickenandliver </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1facd27/google_trends_rss_fe

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Another call to the community, this time about voice features. I&#39;ve tried the Readwise Reader &#39;Listen&#39; service and it&#39;s frankly incredible. But here&#39;s the thing. I can only afford one subscription, and at the moment I&#39;m leaning more towards Inoreader because of its far more sophisticated handling of feeds.</p> <p>So my question is, how does Inoreader&#39;s Text-to-Speech measure up? I&#39;d be happy to be pointed towards a demo, a review, or just hear about your experience with it. Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alexwent1"> /u/alexwent1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fabgyk/text_to_speech/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fabgyk/text_to_speech/">[comments]</a></span>
