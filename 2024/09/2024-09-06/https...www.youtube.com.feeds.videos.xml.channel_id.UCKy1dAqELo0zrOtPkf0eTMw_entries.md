Creature Commandos is kicking off James Gunn’s new DC Universe come December, but the official start actually begins next year. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Gunn had this to say, “ Superman is the true start of everything, it's a humongous epic. This is a way for people to just take a little nibble and see what it tastes like. There are a ton of fun references to other DC stuff, a bunch of hints for things that are coming. So I think it's just an extraordinarily fun way to start.”

Jumping back to what we can expect from the #DCU Creature Commandos and moving from #Superman, EW were given these exclusive images of the upcoming series: One featuring David Harbour’s Frankenstein sharing a cup of coffee with Frank Grillo’s Rick Flag Sr. - And this one, showing us more of the Creature Commandos in Doctor Phosphorous, G.I. Robot, the Bride and Rick Flag Sr. James Gunn is no stranger to dealing with oddball superhuman ensembles, so it’ll be interesting and fun to see how Creature Comma

The second weekend of the Black Ops 6 beta is upon us, and Activision has some changes in store. Basically drop times for certain weapons has been decreased, movement while aiming down sights has been increased, and movement with a knife has also been given a boost, meaning things have been SPED UP. In other news, Larian isn't done with Baldur's Gate 3 just yet, but they're not saying what's in store for the groundbreaking RPG. And finally, Xbox has a broadcast planned for the Tokyo Game Show. We don't know what they plan on showing off, but Xbox has had a hard time in Japan ever since the original Xbox console's launch, so we're just as curious as you are.

Joker: Folie à Deux, reviewed by SIddhant Adlakha. Narrated by Erik Adams.

The worst thing about Joker: Folie à Deux is its unfulfilled potential. It begins with the promise of a novel approach to the Joker and Harley Quinn, placing them in a world where the opposite of cruelty is musical romance. Unfortunately, the DC sequel gets bogged down by a lengthy courtroom saga, which not only keeps the dazzling Lady Gaga away from the spotlight, but centers the movie entirely around its own predecessor, without doing or saying anything new.

## How Beetlejuice Turned 17 Minutes Into 36 Years and Counting

Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is in theaters now but think back to when you first saw Beetlejuice (1988). What did you make of him? He’s clownish, but no Pennywise or Joker. He’s a ghost, but he’s also just sort of a fast talking scammer. Or is he a corpse? It’s not totally clear, but one thing is: he’s memorable as hell!

Beetlejuice is only on screen for 17 minutes of the classic 1988 Beetlejuice movie, which is pretty short considering the film is named after him. But how did a seemingly-random scary guy who’s barely on screen at all become a pop culture phenomenon long and steady enough to make a 36-years-later sequel viable? With a combo of clever filmmaking, a very accessible gateway to ghouls, and a dash of real-world folklore with all the charm of your favorite childhood ghost-summoning games, Beetlejuice turned just 17 minutes of screen time into a rent free place to live in our heads decades later.
