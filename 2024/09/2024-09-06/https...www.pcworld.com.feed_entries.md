<p>You’ve probably already noticed that smartphones hear a lot more than their manufacturers claim they do. Have you ever discussed a new tech product with a colleague only to start seeing ads for that product in apps like Instagram and Facebook? It’s spooky when it happens.</p>



<p>And while people have shared anecdotes like this over the past several years, no one has ever really <em>proven</em> that phones eavesdrop on us like that. Phones aren’t <em>allowed</em> to eavesdrop on us like that… right?</p>



<p>Well, <a href="https://www.404media.co/heres-the-pitch-deck-for-active-listening-ad-targeting/">journalists from 404 Media</a> recently found evidence that companies like Amazon and Google <em>do</em> listen in on everything.</p>

<p><em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> was <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2083778/the-hardest-boss-fight-in-baldurs-gate-3-is-also-its-most-delightful.html">an absolute smash hit last year</a>, and it remains one of the most popular PC games out there. In fact, as I write this story in the middle of a work day, it has over 70,000 concurrent players on Steam.</p>



<p>The latest major patch for the turn-based RPG will get a lot of those players excited because it’s bringing native support for game mods, available from right within the game.</p>



<p>Modding isn’t anything new for <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em>. Players were messin’ with the set dressin’ even before the official release, back during the game’s multi-year-long early access period. But this new toolset will make it easy for PC players to download and install mods without any external tools (e.g.,

<p>Don’t you just hate when your cables get tangled? Especially when you’re carrying tech gear around in a bag. One way to solve that issue is to replace your long cables with retractable alternatives.</p>



<p>You know, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charging-4-Stage-Charger/dp/B0CXXQT84R/">this Baseus retractable USB-C cable that’s on sale for just $10.79 on Amazon</a>. Normally $16, this cable currently has an on-page 20% off coupon as well as an addition 5% off if you use the coupon code <strong>7ODA37VT</strong> at checkout.</p>



<p>That’s a nice discount for this retractable USB-C cable that has four preset lengths (from 1.1 feet to 3.3 feet) when it isn’t retracted. And when it <em>is</em> retracted? It fits in your palm, which helps keep it protected and tangle-free within your pockets and bags.</p>

<p>If you watch as much YouTube as I do, you’ve no doubt been inundated with AI in the last year or so. AI-generated thumbnails, AI-generated voiceovers, even full-on AI-generated video is now in the cards.</p>



<p>Well, YouTube has taken notice and has officially promised to protect the creators on its platform with new tools.</p>



<p>YouTube’s infamous Content ID system — the thing that makes YouTubers freak out whenever someone starts humming a song because they don’t want their video demonetized — is <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/responsible-ai-tools/">being augmented with new AI-hunting tools</a>. Content ID can now search for AI-generated singing voices based on existing artists. This tool is apparently being refined “with [YouTube’s] partners,” with a plan to implement it beginning in 2025.</p>

<p>When it comes to important files, it’s best practice to keep offline backups in case of emergency. If you have a lot of data to store, you might want a 4TB drive… if only they weren’t so pricey.</p>



<p>Good news! Right now, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-External-MU-PH4T0S-AM/dp/B0CMDJXZ19">this 4TB Samsung T5 EVO portable SSD just dropped in price from $425 to $200 on Amazon</a>. That’s a whopping 53% discount for an exceptional drive that suits almost everyone and can be carried around easy-peasy.</p>



<p>While regular external hard drives were great back in the day, they’re physically larger than portable SSDs like this Samsung model, and they’re a lot slower. Not only is the Samsung T5 EVO faster because it’s an SSD, but it also has Intelligent TurboWrite tech for even faster speeds.</p>

<p>System builders in the small form factor (SFF) niche absolutely love cramming the most powerful parts into the smallest case possible, and making it look good in the process. But desktop manufacturers seem to have a lower limit on these designs.</p>



<p>One boutique builder seems to have busted through it, though. The MegaMini G1 is… well, it’s just the cutest lil guy.</p>



<p>We’ve seen preliminary designs for the MegaMini G1 a few times this year, including at Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress. But now the manufacturers — mini PC specialist <a href="https://www.geekompc.com">Geekom</a> and general electronics brand <a href="https://www.tecno-mobile.com/home/">Tecno</a> — are ready to start selling.</p>

<p>Bluetooth is everywhere now. First released in 1998, Bluetooth has made its way into nearly every modern gadget, including phones, laptops, speakers, mice, keyboards, gaming controllers…</p>



<p>Which explains why development is slow and methodical. The last update to Bluetooth came out in 2016, meaning it’s been almost a decade since Bluetooth 5.0 and we’ve been eagerly awaiting the next since.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Bluetooth 6.0 is now just around the corner, and it looks like it’s going to be a good one with some ingenious features. The <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG)</a> recently shared some details about one such feature, which we’re really excited about.</p>

<p>The chasm between PC and console gaming has slimmed down in recent years to nothing more than a fine line, and even that line is disappearing. Gaming laptops, for example, are console-like in many ways.</p>



<p>And it’s not just the games that have been crossing over between platforms — many accessories have been interchangeable for years. Keyboards on consoles, controllers on PCs, headsets on everything. It’s a great time to be a gamer, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>Had Benjamin Franklin been alive today he may well have added “bloatware” to his famous quote: “But, in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes.”</p>



<p>The fact is, if you buy a Windows PC or laptop it’s going to come with a bunch of annoying apps that have very little actual benefit to you but provide the apps’ vendors a nice little income stream when hapless users sign up.</p>



<p>I’m all too aware of this scourge. I’ve got a heap of bloatware on my new gaming laptop and I’m spitting chips about it!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Bloatware is another way companies remove my agency to decide on things myself…</p></blockquote></figure>
