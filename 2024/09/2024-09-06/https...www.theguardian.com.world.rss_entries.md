<p>Yvette Cooper to lead summit with figures from the intelligence agencies and police aimed at tackling criminal gangs </p><p><strong>The former head of the British Border Force, Tony Smith, has said that tackling people-smuggles using the English Channel as a route was like playing “Whac-A-Mole”.</strong></p><p>He said that a concerted effort was needed in Europe and in the countries organising the trade, telling listeners of the BBC Today programme:</p><p>This is a very lucrative business for the smugglers. Putting a smuggling gang out of business, there’s usually another one waiting in the wings because the money is there. It’s a bit like Whac-A-Mole, really. So you do need a very concerted international attempt, both in Europe and beyond.</p><p>We are very close to making that appointment. You have to go through certain processes to make sure you get the right person, give people time to apply. You can’t wave a magic wand. There’ll be announcements about that very shortly.</p> <a
