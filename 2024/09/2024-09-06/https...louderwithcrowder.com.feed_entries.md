<p>The House Judiciary held a hearing on the California perspective of the border crisis. </p>
<p>Although it was intended to serve as a bipartisan effort, no Democratic official showed up. So while lawmakers and electeds have decided no human is illegal, some of the worst crimes are taking place because federal “policy is facilitating a multi-billion dollar smuggling operation.” </p>

	If the media were honest just half the time, no one would think Trump was racist. Additionally, no one claimed such a lie until he announced his candidacy in 2016.
