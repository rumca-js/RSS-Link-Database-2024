<p>The better the Wi-Fi reception, the higher the data throughput. In Windows, you can check how strong the Wi-Fi signal is at your location in five places. If a poor signal quality is displayed, it is often enough to change the orientation of the laptop or move a few feet away to improve reception. </p>



<p><strong>1. The display in the taskbar corner. </strong>At the bottom right next to the time and date and, for laptops, the battery indicator, the Wi-Fi and speaker symbol appear on a shared button in Windows. After clicking on this button, a window opens in which you can read the current strength of the wireless network set and all other wireless networks in the vicinity by clicking on the arrow pointing to the right next to the wireless connection. </p>

<p>Intel may still be a dominant player in PC gaming since it sells a majority of all PC processors — and those chips have <em>integrated</em> graphics built into them — but as far as its presence in discrete graphics is concerned, Intel’s time has seemingly come to an end.</p>



<p>According to analyst firm Jon Peddie Research, shipments of PC graphics cards increased to 9.5 million units in the second quarter of 2024 (up 9 percent from the first quarter). It’s a surprising find since the 10-year average shows a 7.1 percent dip during the second quarter. JPR attributed the gain to the first-quarter launch of new cards.</p>



<p>The more interesting story, though, continues to be the ongoing war between AMD, Nvidia, and Intel in the discrete graphics card market. And in this war, one company has been forced out with Intel now controlling exactly zero percen

<p>Your PC storage drives won’t last forever — which is why a backup strategy is so crucial for keeping your data safe. The best Windows backup software will have your back if and when your primary drive fails.</p>



<p>While Apple’s Time Machine provides users with an effective, set-it-and-forget-it recovery system, Microsoft users aren’t so lucky.

<p>I’ve kept my gaming rig’s specs above the recommended requirements for most new big-name game releases over the last couple of years and it remains that way despite all the hardware that’s hit the market in the interim.</p>



<p>Yet surprisingly, some new games (not all) chug along on my rig. What’s going on then? Is it time for me to fork out for yet another round of upgrades? Or are some game developers leaving me high and dry by not optimizing their games to run well on the decent specs that I have?</p>

<p>I pose the question merely to introduce the topic. The fact is, I already hold a viewpoint: Games just aren’t being optimized properly these days, and that opinion is based on the amazing things I’ve seen devs

<p>Lunar Lake is Intel’s Snapdragon killer.</p>



<p>Intel’s Core Ultra Series 2 (Lunar Lake) was specifically designed to emphasize low power, but with competitive performance. In this it somewhat succeeds, though the Core Ultra 7 258V chip I tested can still run a distant second, or third, behind AMD’s mobile Ryzen processors. But Lunar Lake also provides incredibly good, Snapdragon-like battery life with a powerful, embedded GPU capable of playing yesterday’s top-tier games.</p>



<p>Intel supplied us with a Lunar Lake-powered Asus ZenBook S14 laptop for review, and we’ve spent the last week or so testing it to answer the question: Of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2353351/amds-ryzen-ai-300-is-built-to-dominate-thin-light-copilot-laptops.html">AMD Ryzen AI 300</a>, Intel’s Lunar Lake, and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2112907

<p>It never ceases to amaze my family that while I’m a pretty savvy tech writer who covers B2B enterprise software, I often need guidance when it comes to using consumer products. Some might even say I don’t know what I’m doing.  </p>



<p>Ironic? Perhaps. In my defense, besides a Nest thermostat and a refrigerator that flags us when the door is open too long (my husband set up and controls both devices), we don’t have much of a smart home.

<p>Predictably, the silent swap has caused momentary panic and confusion among Kaspersky users, who initially believed themselves to be the victims of a malware attack.

The concerns were compounded when
