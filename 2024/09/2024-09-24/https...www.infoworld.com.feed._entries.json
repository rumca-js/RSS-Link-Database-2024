This is especially true in cloud computing, which is now the mother of all IT complexity, with security challenges that confound forensic investigators. Lately, I\u2019ve noticed an increasing number of people in law enforcement taking my cloud courses. They are not there to develop cloud solutions for businesses but to learn how to combat cybercrime. More tools are needed to help everyone fight these emerging security threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with its 87-page <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2020/NIST.IR.8006.pdf\">NISTIR 8006 publication</a>, a cornersto", "id": 1200722, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3537036/the-challenge-of-cloud-computing-forensics.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 468, "source_url": "https://www.infoworld.com/feed/", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "The challenge of cloud computing forensics", "vote": 0}]
