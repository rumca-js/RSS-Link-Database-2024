A new analysis of satellite data finds that the record surge in atmospheric methane emissions from 2020 to 2022 was driven by increased inundation and water storage in wetlands, combined with a slight decrease in atmospheric hydroxide (OH).

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the buzz phrase of 2024. Though far from that cultural spotlight, scientists from agricultural, biological and technological backgrounds are also turning to AI as they collaborate to find ways for these algorithms and models to analyze datasets to better understand and predict a world impacted by climate change. Scientists have now demonstrated the capability of a recurrent neural network -- a model that teaches computers to process data using long short-term memory -- to predict maize yield from several remote sensing technologies and environmental and genetic data.

## Better together: Gut microbiome communities' resilience to drugs

Many common drugs can impact the composition of gut microbiome communities. Scientists compared directly, for the first time, the effect of 30 diverse drug treatments on bacteria when they were grown in isolation versus as part of a complex community. The researchers found that the impact of drugs on bacteria is often less pronounced when they are part of a community, due to cross-protection strategies. Mapping and understanding emergent drug-microbiome interactions within the community context may help scientists design improved therapies with fewer side effects and higher drug efficacy in the future.

The tiered umbrella is one of Thailand's oldest and most sacred ornamental symbols. Constructing one of these ornate pieces, also called chatras, can take master artisans up to six months. However, researchers demonstrate a technique for constructing seven-tiered umbrellas using high-powered lasers, which dramatically reduces the production time. Employing carbon dioxide lasers, they were able to fashion umbrellas from stainless steel in a matter of days while preserving their intricate beauty.

## New cancer diagnoses did not rebound as expected following pandemic

Cancer incidence trends in 2021 largely returned to what they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). However, there was little evidence of a rebound in incidence that would account for the decline in diagnoses in 2020, when screening and other medical care was disrupted. One exception was breast cancer, where the researchers did see an uptick in diagnoses of advanced-stage disease in 2021.

Northeast Greenland is home to the 79 N Glacier -- the country's largest floating glacier tongue, but also one seriously threatened by global warming: warm water from the Atlantic is melting it from below. Experts have however now determined that the temperature of the water flowing into the glacier cavern declined from 2018 to 2021, even though the ocean has steadily warmed in the region over the past several decades. This could be due to temporarily changed atmospheric circulation patterns. Researchers now discuss how this affects the ocean and what it could mean for the future of Greenland's glaciers.

Researchers analyzed 193 patients from the Vietnam Head Injury Study with penetrating traumatic brain injury to determine if the location of shrapnel damage to their brains influenced risk of developing PTSD. Damage to areas connected to the amygdala was associated with a lower chance of developing PTSD. The study suggests lesions that could protect against PTSD map to a specific brain circuit connected to the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex.

A new study has revealed that despite the recent pandemic, outbreak detection efforts remain under-resourced in South and Southeast Asia, with only about half the countries reviewed having integrated pathogen genomic surveillance initiatives in their national plans. The study also identifies key priorities to enhance the preparedness of the region against future pandemics.

## Lengthened consonants mark the beginning of words

Speech consists of a continuous stream of acoustic signals, yet humans can segment words from each other with astonishing precision and speed. To find out how this is possible, a team of linguists has analysed durations of consonants at different positions in words and utterances across a diverse sample of languages. They have found that word-initial consonants are, on average, around 13 milliseconds longer than their non-initial counterparts. The diversity of languages for which this effect was found suggests that this might be a species-wide pattern -- and one of several key factors for speech perception to distinguish the beginning of words within the stream of speech.

Parkinson's disease, a debilitating nervous system disorder, is treated with medications that sometimes cause impaired decision-making and poor impulse control. Now, researchers have identified a structure in the brain called the external globus pallidus which may be responsible for this side effect, paving the way for new treatments.
