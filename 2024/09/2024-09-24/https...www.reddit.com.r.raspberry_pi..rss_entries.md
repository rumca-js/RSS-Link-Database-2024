<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, iam building an RC car with a Raspi 3B right now, yesterday randomly my code throws an error that the I2C bus is busy. I run i2cdetect -y 1, but its ultra slow. Than i noticed, that my Pi is very very hot, so i shut it down. After an hour i booted them again but instantly after booting it is at 80-85 degree Celsius and i absolutly dont know why. I reflashed the SDCard with a 32bit OS but the problem is still happening.<br/> I already have a smal black heatsink on the main chip. Anyone know why that happens?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KsmBl_69"> /u/KsmBl_69 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fo8b29/raspi_3b_getting_very_fast_to_85_degree_c/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fo8b29/raspi_3b_getting_very_fast_to_85_degree_c/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, first post here</p> <p>I’ve just had to get a pi 4 model B 4gb for my IoT class in uni and I’ve never used one before (or anything similar lol), but I’m struggling with setup. I installed the OS on a 32gb SD card, enabled SSH and set the wifi connection to my home wifi. Put that into the pi and turned it on, gave it a minute then went into puTTY and inputted raspberrypi.local, etc but it just flashed an error saying no host was found. So I checked the IP’s connected to my router, nothing, no unknown IP or anything that could be the pi. So I restarted my router and turned the pi on and off, still nothing. Erased the SD card and re-installed the OS, put that back in, went through the whole process again… nothing!!! </p> <p>What am I doing wrong?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MealRare2138"> /u/MealRare2138 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fo6moq/help_pi
