I wanted my home designed so that I produce as much energy as I use over the course of a year. To get there, I incorporated a bunch into my plans, like solar panels, home batteries, a geothermal heat pump, airtight house construction, and much more. It’s been a full year since I moved in. There've been a lot of successes as I’ve worked toward my net zero energy goal, a lot of learning … and some hiccups and setbacks too. So, what should you look out for and what strategies should you try? And… was all of my effort really worth it in the end?
