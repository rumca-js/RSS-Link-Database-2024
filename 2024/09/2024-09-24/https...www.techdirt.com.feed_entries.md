Agree with them or not, the folks behind Cards Against Humanity certainly do have a penchant for flair. As you may recall, back during the Trump presidency, when we were still hearing about how a border wall would be built and then billed back to a sovereign nation that was absolutely never going to pay [&#8230;]

Elon Musk&#8217;s superpower does not appear to be rocket science or electric cars—it&#8217;s an uncanny ability to misunderstand why ExTwitter&#8217;s features exist. The clear takeaway from the book “Character Limit” about his Twitter takeover was that he only views the platform’s features through the lens of whether or not he, the richest man in the [&#8230;]

Tennessee&#8217;s government cranks out a lot of stupid laws. It&#8217;s been doing it for years, but things have accelerated recently as the state&#8217;s legislators seek to curtail rights for, well, pretty much everyone but white men. It has enacted book bans, anti-trans laws, and the Supreme Court&#8217;s Dobbs decision triggered its long-dormant anti-abortion law. But [&#8230;]

I do not understand why California Governor Gavin Newsom thinks he has to be the Democratic equivalent of Texas Governor Greg Abbott or Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, signing obviously unconstitutional laws for the sake of winning culture war arguments. It’s really shameful. It’s cheap political pandering, while disrespecting the rights of everyone he’s supposed to [&#8230;]

Last July the FCC announced it was moving forward with plans that should make unlocking your mobile phone easier than ever. According to the FCC announcement, the agency, with broad and bipartisan public support, has been working on new rules requiring that wireless carriers unlock customers’ mobile phones within 60 days of activation. Wireless carriers, trying [&#8230;]

It happened again and it has to stop. Back in 2014, we talked about how a UK woman had trouble getting her passport approved because her middle name was &#8220;Skywalker&#8221; and the UK&#8217;s passport office for some reason thought that Disney would have to give its permission to have the passport approved. There is nothing [&#8230;]
