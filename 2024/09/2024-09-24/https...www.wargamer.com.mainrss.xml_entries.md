								<p>The asking price for the <strong>MTG card</strong> Mana Vault has surged overnight, with multiple printings now up over $150. On Monday, the MTG Commander rules committee banned three powerful ‘fast-mana’ cards that were ubiquitous throughout the format, making the already-rare Mana Crypt a must-have replacement for certain strategies.</p>

								<p>Kobold Press, famously known for its third-party<strong> Dungeons and Dragons</strong> sourcebooks, has just launched a brand-new Kickstarter. This is crowdfunding the first supplementary book for the publisher’s in-house RPG system, Tales of the Valiant. With funding completed in around 30 minutes, there’s a clear audience for this game, which advertises itself as a compatible but alternative rules set to D&amp;D 5e. Despite this, I still can’t get excited about diving deep into Tales of the Valiant.</p>

## Games Workshop’s Warhammer rules paywall is outdated and off-putting

								<p>Last week, <strong>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</strong> fans were confronted with an unpleasant reality that <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> players are already used to, as the rules for the Skaven disappeared from the Age of Sigmar app - unlocking them again requires a single-use code only available in the back of an expensive 'Battletome' rulebook. This rules paywall sucks for consumers, and it’s holding back the otherwise irrepressible growth of the hobby.</p>

								<p>On Monday, the <strong>Magic the Gathering</strong> Commander Rules Committee announced a surprise update to the banlist for the format. Four powerful cards have been banned, including three ‘fast mana’ pieces and the contentious legendary creature Nadu, Winged Wisdom. It’s likely that the prices of the most expensive cards are about to drop through the floor.</p>
