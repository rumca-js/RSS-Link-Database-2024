For a lot of 2024, my battery level stayed above 97\npercent, but it started dropping more rapidly over the last couple\nof months. I left my iPhone at that 80 percent limit and at no\npoint turned the setting off or tweaked it. [...] You can compare\nyour level battery to mine, but here are a couple other metrics\nfrom MacRumors staff that also have an iPhone 15 Pro Max and did\nnot have the battery level limited.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Current capacity: 87%.
