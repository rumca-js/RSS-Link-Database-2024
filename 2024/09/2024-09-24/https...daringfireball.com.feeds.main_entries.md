<p>Juli Clover, MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the iPhone 15 models that came out last year, Apple added an
opt-in battery setting that limits maximum charge to 80 percent.
The idea is that never charging the iPhone above 80 percent will
increase battery longevity, so I kept my iPhone at that 80 percent
limit from September 2023 to now, with no cheating.</p>

<p>My iPhone 15 Pro Max battery level is currently at 94 percent with
299 cycles. For a lot of 2024, my battery level stayed above 97
percent, but it started dropping more rapidly over the last couple
of months. I left my iPhone at that 80 percent limit and at no
point turned the setting off or tweaked it. [...] You can compare
your level battery to mine, but here are a couple other metrics
from MacRumors staff that also have an iPhone 15 Pro Max and did
not have the battery level limited.</p>

<ul>
<li>Current capacity: 87%. Cycles: 329</li>
<li>Current capacity: 90%. Cycles: 271</li>
</ul>
