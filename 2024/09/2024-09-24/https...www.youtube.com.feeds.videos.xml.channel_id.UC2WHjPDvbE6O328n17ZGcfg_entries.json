Their \"Algorithms and Data Structures\" course is amazing - a lot of solid interactive lessons.\n\nSo there are 8 data structures you should know as a programmer, and we\u2019re going to dive into each one, show what they are, and look at real-world use cases, complete with code examples and explanations.\n\nSo, why are these data structures you should know? Because they are the most commonly used data structures and form the foundation for efficient algorithm design, problem-solving, and optimizing code performance. \n\nData structures are the fundamental building blocks of computer programming. And understanding them is better for you than grinding out overly complex edge-case leetcode problems. Unless you\u2019re trying to pass a FAANG interview. Which if you\u2019re ever in one and don\u2019t know what data structure to use, just throw a Has", "id": 1203551, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxdQiBkidWk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 118, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2WHjPDvbE6O328n17ZGcfg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gxdQiBkidWk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "8 Data Structures Every Programmer Should Know", "vote": 0}]
