Ara: History Untold reviewed on PC by Leana Hafer.

While Ara: History Untold is a visually captivating historical 4X with an interesting underlying economy, it gets bogged down well before the midway point, mainly because it doesn’t provide enough tools and UI support to manage all of the things it expects you to manage. Your choice of leader, religion, and government almost always simply add uninteresting passive modifiers, which means most playthroughs will feel roughly the same other than the layout of the map itself. I had a pretty decent time with my march through the ages, especially in the first of its three acts. But it did require me to eventually give up on trying to play optimally, passing turns without doing anything until I emerged victorious. A lot of these systems are exciting and clever in their design – they're just not that enjoyable to interact with past a certain point.

Terrifier 3, reviewed by Matt Donato. Narrated by Erik Adams.

Damien Leone’s beloved, slaughterhouse-scrappy franchise nails the art (heh) of the kill once more in its third installment. Unfortunately, like Terrifier 2, it’s too long, too disjointed, and more like a vision board of ideas that never find their connective tissue. Terrifier 3 earns points with extreme practical gore effects and a dedication to making its audience wince – I'll be gushing about multiple Terrifier 3 kills for a while. (The same can’t be said for the messianic arc now set up for Lauren LaVera’s Sienna Shaw.) It feels like Leone’s trying to keep up with his franchise’s overnight success by chucking plotline ideas at us in hopes something meaningful sticks, but the result is as sloppy as expected. Art returns to deliver a night to dismember, but everything else – like storytelling, or coherent continuity – plays a disappointing second fiddle.

Check out the reveal trailer for Tenet of the Spark, an upcoming narrative-led urban brawler adventure game, where you can jump between three worlds, including a gritty city, the Viking age, and ancient Aztec civilization. The trailer gives us a peek at gameplay, story, and the three unique worlds. Tenet of the Spark will be available on PC and consoles in 2026. 

Tenet of the Spark follows the story of Will, a boxer standing up to street gangs and the ghosts of his past. Aiding him on his dangerous journey are the spirits of his ancestors, whose power he can channel as his consciousness slips back through the ages.
