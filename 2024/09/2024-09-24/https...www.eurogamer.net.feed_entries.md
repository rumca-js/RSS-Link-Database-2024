## Hands on with Sony's new Inzone M10S and M9 II gaming monitors: higher specs, new designs

After all, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-unveils-pc-gaming-gear-brand-inzone">initial lineup</a> of Sony-developed PC monitors were good enough and had an interesting PS5-adjacent design, yet were nothing special in a crowded and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-best-gaming-monitor-7003">competitive gaming monitor market</a>. These two new monitors are much more my cup of tea - especially the &pound;1199 Inzone M10S, which boasts an exciting 1440p 480Hz OLED panel that pushes the boundaries of motion clarity. </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-hands-on-with-sonys-new-inzone-m10s-and-m9-ii-gaming-monitors">Read more</

I've been playing the early access build that's just released on Steam and it's not great, and it confuses me, because the original game from 2019 managed to do the almost impossible: it broke into a busy RPG market and made a success of itself, despite being janky and having some problematic New World colonisation themes. It had nice ideas and had heart, and it gave us a kind of BioWare experience that was missing at the time, and shipped something like 2m copies as a result. But the sequel takes all of that good work and seems to step backwards from it. It's a less enjoyable game to play, it's less distinct, and the ways it has tried to evolve the series have worsened it.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/greedfall-2-mystifies-me-its-currently

This was nightmarish stuff; all shambling animatronic monstrosities and apocalyptic landscapes haphazardly reassembled from the rotting remnants of Disney's beloved theme parks. We saw Epcot's shattered Spaceship Earth roaming a vast, rust-coloured ocean atop something part Rivers of America steamboat, part monstrous narwhal; Snow White's castle balanced high on an impossible precipice amid belching, churning industrial machines; even a razor-limbed robotic caterpillar with Abe Lincoln's animatronic head jammed awkwardly on one elongated neck while the shocked face of Mickey Mouse wobbled horribly on another nearby.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-mickey-rebrushed
