PlayStation fans got a look at multiple new remasters, including updated versions of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> and a pair of Soul Reaver games. And there was new content in there too, including a sequel to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and lots of DLC for already-released PlayStation favorites.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In press for the film, director Francis Ford Coppola, of <em>Apocalypse Now </em>and <em>The Godfather</em> fame, has spoken at length about <em>Megalopolis</em> being a wake-up call for audiences to take up arms for the future of cinema and society as a whole — a bold act of optimism that envisions a road to utopia. But the film, out in theaters this week, is, in actuality, about history, and specifically about Coppola’s personal past.</p>

The action co-op shooter pitting the forces of Super Earth against endless waves of murderous Automatons or terrifying Terminids had a massive launch in February, but faltered over the summer months. A recent patch from developer Arrowhead has led to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#1m">a resurgence of players returning to the fight or picking up the game for the first time</a>, along with tons of positive reception on social media — but all the new fixes bring a few remaining problems into sharp relief.</p>
