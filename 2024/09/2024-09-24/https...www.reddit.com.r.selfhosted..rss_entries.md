<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been toying with an idea lately: self-hosting a Kubernetes cluster with nodes spread across different locations, like multiple houses. The concept is to have data replicated between the nodes so that even if one node fails, the system remains operational without data loss.</p> <p>In a 3-node setup, for example, each node could replicate to just one other node. With proper redundancy, if one node goes down, the others can continue functioning, and no critical data is lost.</p> <p>Has anyone tried something like this? Would the latency between different locations be too much of an issue?</p> <p>Does this setup make sense, or is it more trouble than it&#39;s worth?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bl4rc"> /u/Bl4rc </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fokxts/selfhosting_kubernetes_across_multiple/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello there,</p> <p>I am about to go to university and was wondering if there is a good self hosted alternative to OneNote. I was using OneNote for the last few years of highschool, and it worked alright, but recently it started to work worse and worse, and now I&#39;ve also reached the cloud-limit and would have to spend money to keep using it. I&#39;d like to avoid that if possible.</p> <p>The Features that I am looking for are sync around multiple devices, so I can easily access my notes on my home desktop and mobile. I&#39;d also love it would be working automatically, and I wouldn&#39;t have to manually commit to a git-repository. Bonus points if it would be possible to share dedicated pages, with other people, that don&#39;t have the same app.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FranzDerPalme"> /u/FranzDerPalme </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1foh89z/selfho

I&#39;m excited to share that the first version is now ready to try out!</p> <p>Liwan is designed to respect your users&#39; privacy while providing you with valuable stats. It&#39;s lightweight, easy to set up, and perfect for self-hosting. You can find the quick start guide and more information at <a href="https://liwan.dev">liwan.dev</a>.</p> <p>I built Liwan because I wanted a clean and simple analytics tool for my own projects—something that works well for managing multiple sites without compromising on privacy. Existing solutions didn&#39;t quite fit the bill, so I decided to create my own. I hope it can be useful to others as well!</p> <p><stro

I&#39;m entering the world of self-hosting and initially I&#39;m going to rent a VPS until I save up the money and buy some hardware.</p> <p>The problem I&#39;m facing now is calculating how much vCPU and RAM I need to know which VPS to get. From what I&#39;ve seen in some posts, apparently I should consider 0.25 vCPU and 250 MB of RAM for a simple application. In the case of more demanding applications, it would need to be twice as much (0.5 vCPU and 500 MB RAM).</p> <p>In addition, some applications I&#39;ll be sharing with my immediate family and friends, so I may have up to 10 people using the same application.</p> <p>As this will be my first VPS and renting is worthwhile on a one- or two-year plan, I&#39;m analyzing everything very carefully until I make my decision.</p> <p>Can you help me with this? How do you calculate how much vCPU and RAM you need to run your applications?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently bought a <strong>HP ProLiant DL160 Gen9 96GB RAM Intel E5-2640V4</strong> 1U rack mounted server, one problem is going to be the noise produced compared to a 2u or 3u servers. And it kinda got me thinking on trying to come up with the best cooling solution for this server that will also help lower quieting audio levels. Such things like swapping fans out with noctua but I&#39;m mainly wondering if its possible to watercool / adding a radiator for both cpu&#39;s. I&#39;m thinking of getting rid of the front hard drive bays except room for one ssd drive, so that can clear up room, and if I went water cooling I could add ports that lead outside the case to a radiator</p> <p>here is a picture of the inside of my 1u chassis</p> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/hp-proliant-dl160-gen9-96gb-ram-intel-e5-2640v4-FDnoAja">picture link</a></p> <p>give me as many ideas as possible. i don&#39;t care how long it will take me to come up with a good solution

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I&#39;ve been using PushBullet for a long time to share files and text (e.g., links) between my devices. One of the main advantages I liked was that the devices didn’t need to be connected to each other directly, as files seem to be uploaded to a server and then downloaded by my other devices.</p> <p>Now, I&#39;m looking for a self-hosted solution that can help me migrate from PushBullet. Ideally, it should allow me to easily send files and text between my Windows and Android devices, offer secure transfers, and not limit me when sending large files.</p> <p>I really liked how, on Android, I could quickly share an image or file with all my devices using the share button in just a few clicks.</p> <p>Any recommendations for a self-hosted solution I can set up on my own server would be greatly appreciated!</p> <p><em>(ChatGPT translation)</em></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Similar_Key5353"> /

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey fokes, hope you&#39;re doing great!</p> <p>A few days ago I shared a product I&#39;ve been building here, self-hosted but also paid.<br/> This brought a mixed bag of comments and I was very thankful for them.</p> <p>One of them really stuck with me:</p> <blockquote> <p>The people who dont afford the expensive tools - dont afford or self deploy and manage</p> <p>The people who afford the expensive tools- might not wanna use a less featured tool </p> </blockquote> <p>@<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maddhruv/">maddhruv</a></p> <p>This comment actually shifted my perspective on seeing self-hosted software, and even resonated with me. I wouldn&#39;t pay to self-host something.</p> <p>I was building something I wouldn&#39;t pay for. And this struck me big time.</p> <p>After debating with myself on the proper way to approach this, and to fulfill my desire to provide value and share knowledge, I decided to completely open-source my software.</p> <p>
