<p>As Emiliano Buendía wheeled towards the nearest corner clenching his fists in celebration, in front of the bank of 1,848 travelling Aston Villa supporters, it was the kind of cathartic moment he longed for on the darker days of his recovery from an anterior cruciate ligament knee injury.

But the host forward line all had moments of ­sparkle.

Off the field (or adjacent to it, at least), United were gold-plating their dominance with the completion of a new North Stand that made Old Trafford the biggest club stadium in England. And in what must have felt like a footnote at the time, Manchester was awarded the 2002 Commonwealth Games, with a bid based around a new, purpose-built stadium on a brownfield site. Fast-forward three decades, and the Etihad is now home to English football’s dominant force, an all-conquering team who play in sky blue.

<p>Fantastical storytelling underpins Tarsem’s 2006 film, in which an injured stuntman relates an elaborate fable to a young girl</p><p>Tarsem Singh’s indulgent epic, produced by Spike Jonze and David Fincher, was little seen on its original release in 2006, and now gets a rerelease in a 4K restoration on the Mubi streaming platform. It’s certainly worth noticing, with its Gilliamesque surrealism, and its setting in Rajasthan, north-western India, offers wonderful landscapes. Its beguiling set pieces feature Justine Waddell playing some deadpan comedy as a gloriously costumed princess – although I have to admit that in general the film’s rather placid, stately, fantasy style can be exasperatingly inert.</p><p>The scene is Los Angeles in the early years of silent pictures; Lee Pace plays Roy, a stuntman who is now seriously, perhaps permanently, injured.

He plays a sailor’s hornpipe he composed that playfully references Bach, a music hall song once performed by Miss Piggy (“so I’m in fantastic company”), and then talks about being outbid on eBay on a book of folk songs from Barbados. “Then I found out who the bidder was – my mother!”</p><p>A tall 28-year-old concertina and melodeon player, Cohen Braithwaite-Kilcoyne is a veteran at Bromyard folk festival, which he first attended when he was 11: he’s from down the road, raised in Worcester and Birmingham.

<p>Ex-Alameda CEO and ex-girlfriend of fallen crypto mogul pleaded guilty, but prosecutors signalled lenient sentence</p><p>Caroline Ellison, the former crypto executive and romantic partner of the disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, is slated to be sentenced in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday. Ellison was a central figure in the FTX bankruptcy saga and key witness for the prosecution in the $8bn fraud trial that ended with Bankman-Fried’s conviction.</p><p>Ellison served as the CEO of Alameda Research, which was the trading arm of the now defunct FTX crypto exchange. The collapse of FTX, once valued at $32bn, was directly linked to revelations that it was attempting to financially prop up Alameda with fraudulent accounting. Subsequent investigations and criminal charges found that both FTX and the hedge fund had used billions in customer funds for risky trades and lavish personal spending.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/24/caroline-ellison-sentence

<p>The truth is plainer than ever: the Israeli leader needs forever wars to keep himself in power. Innocent lives just don’t matter</p><p>Benjamin Netanyahu must be stopped. The horror unfolding in Lebanon is another crime, to add to all the others.

A slight miscalculation can leave her car spinning without traction at the starting line, or worse.</p><p>“When it comes to the actual run, I should be 100% wide open [on the gas],” she says. “I should never have to [re-adjust] the throttle or anything like that because, if you do that – first of all, the run is not going to be good. You will <em>never, ever</em> have a good run.

<p>Poor communication has prevented Labour explaining just how its agenda is going to deliver a brighter future</p><p>There is nothing like conference to focus the minds of a governing party. The leading players have speeches to make, and must explain what they are doing and why. And so Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/23/rachel-reeves-defends-labour-cuts-winter-fuel-allowance">find themselves in the curious position</a> of stressing that economic gloom is not an end in itself. It would be uniquely perverse to pursue such an objective. “We are planning for misery” is a slogan that would not endure for very long.</p><p>Their need to state the obvious – that they seek sunnier uplands – is partly due to previous failures of communication. Starmer and Reeves should be explaining not only what they are doing, but also why, most days of the year. The “why” question is the most important, and evidently the answer is not that they want us a

<p>There are enough garments in the world to dress the next six generations. Yet the number of clothes being produced in the global north is soaring – and poisoning poorer countries</p><p>This is how the conversation always goes whenever my 12-year-old daughter, Evie, asks me to buy fast fashion for her. “Please, please, <em>please</em> can I have this,” she’ll say (it’s usually from Shein). Sorry but no, I’ll reply – I’m sure we can find an alternative on Vinted. “One person buying something new won’t make any difference,” she argues. “And besides, it’s so cheap!” There is sulking (her), tutting (me), and dissatisfaction all round.</p><p>As a fashion writer focused on sustainability (or lack thereof), my daughter’s pestering grates, yet I sympathise – what tween doesn’t want to fit in?

The headline says: “The writing is already on the wall for Labour’s floundering government.” In an interview on the Today programme this morning, Curtice distanced himself from that headline, saying “floundering” wasn’t what he wrote. But his assessment in the article is still quite negative.</p><p>Curtice said that Labour won the election, not because voters were enthusiastic about the party, but because they were determined to get rid of the Tories. Reform UK, not Labour, gained most from this, he said. He went on:</p><p>Nearly one in four 2019 Conservative voters

I am often the recipient of such “problems”, and love including them in any meal I can. This way of cooking them is a current favourite. I’ve left the cooking time a little open, because it depends on the thickness of your courgettes, the size of your pan, the reliability of your oven, etc, but you’re looking for slightly coloured, but not collapsing chunks. The dressing is fabulous and, let’s be honest, roasting feta is always a good idea. This makes a great light meal (on a slab of sourdough, perhaps) or side.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/sep/24/roast-courgettes-feta-preserved-lemon-recipe-georgina-hayden">Continue reading...</a>

Behind the scenes, however, she experienced serious emotional abuse</p><p>The last thing my mother, Eryl, told me on her deathbed was to shut up. I laughed, not because the command didn’t hurt, but because she’d been telling me to be quiet, in one way or another, my whole life. For someone who only ever wanted to be a writer, this has been a serious problem.</p><p>I was brought up in the small Welsh-speaking community of 1960s and 70s Cardiff, a dispersed village within the city. Eryl was a highly respected English teacher and we were immersed in books from childhood. Every time I meet one of Eryl’s former pupils they rave, rightly, about her ability to bring set texts to life. She was known to be strict but fair, didn’t have favourites and treated everybody the same.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/sep/24/gwyneth-lewis-why-i-wrote-n

<p>Exclusive: Scholar names Henry Porter as likely co-author of 1604 play after linguistic clues in his surviving work</p><p>Scholars have long suggested that Christopher Marlowe had a collaborator for the comic scenes of his classic play Doctor Faustus, although his name alone is on the 1604 published edition. Now a largely forgotten dramatist, Henry Porter, has emerged as the likely co-author, based on comparative linguistic evidence that has been unearthed from his surviving play.</p><p>Doctor Faustus is a tragic story of vanity and greed, in which a scholar sells his soul to the devil in return for knowledge and power. The tragedy is mirrored by scenes of comic horseplay that are now thought to have been written by Porter, who was described by a contemporary as “the best for comedy amongst us”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/sep/24/christopher-marlowe-doctor-faustus-play">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From razor-wire fences and crumbling cells to no windows and overcrowding, conditions in most jails mean rehabilitation is a nonstarter. Here’s how we can create better spaces for prisoners</p><p>Arriving at a prison – any prison – still makes my heart race a little faster. I have been to more than 100 prisons for my research into how architecture and design can assist in rehabilitating offenders. But my first visit after 18 months of lockdown, to a prison deep in one of England’s most rural counties, felt especially disorienting. I sat quietly for a moment looking up at the towering wall that encircles the car park. It’s topped with coils of razor wire that unfurl like a giant, spiky Slinky, scaring off curious pigeons, but catching every plastic carrier bag that floats on the breeze.</p><p>The surly brick edifice doesn’t reveal an obvious entrance. Straight ahead is a large door, but it’s for the vehicles that bring inmates to the prison. You’ll probably have seen the white escor
