From a fascinating premise to compelling core mechanics, there\u2019s plenty to like here, even if it is still a pretty uneven experience.", "id": 1204110, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZfwiXnzYE8", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/WZfwiXnzYE8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Epic Mickey: Rebrushed Review - The Final Verdict", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-24T15:30:08+00:00", "description": "September has passed us by almost as quickly as it started, with hits like Astro Bot and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.

After that, there's Diablo 4's first paid expansion, Vessel of Hatred, which features a new region, class, and end-game activity.\n\nThe rest of the month looks just as packed if not more, with Life is Strange: Double Exposure, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, MechWarrior 5: Clans, Unknown 9: Awakening, and more to look forward to.
