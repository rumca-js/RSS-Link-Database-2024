<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have the same experience in Python and Nodejs not much overall for either. </p> <p>Good bit of experience with Java. </p> <p>What does everybody think has the best tools that are maintained between Python and Nodejs (Crawlee or others) for web scraping. </p> <p>Current project is going to be a bit complicated. Going to consists of a network of nodes, Ips etc. Going to use rust for the main backend Server for Http requests and delegating webscraping functions and parsing data. </p> <p>So the debate is python or Nodejs or Java? What will have the best and maintained tools and libs for web scraping? Or use a little bit of all depending on strengths?</p> <p>Debating have a repo for Python (tools) , Nodejs (tools), Java (selenium) and call up on each when needing a specific function. Deploying multiple repos to one ec2 isn&#39;t a problem for me. </p> <p>More focused on which one will have the best tools now and likely maintained long term?</p> </div><!-
