<p>The tech industry has changed dramatically since Bill Gates and Microsoft introduced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows operating system</a> in 1985.  While other tech giants (at the time) — including Compaq, Lotus, and Netscape — were eventually acquired, Microsoft has continued to adapt and thrive, buying companies along the way as it sought to grow.</p>



<p>Microsoft, of course, is much more than a survivor. Its strategic acquisitions helped it both diversify its revenue streams and strengthen its position in a variety of markets. In fact, since it was founded in 1975, Microsoft has

<p>There’s been a bit of a kerfuffle recently as some endpoint security service providers complain that macOS Sequoia has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/apples-new-macos-sequoia-update-is-breaking-some-cybersecurity-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broken their products</a> in some way. </p>



<p>Even if true, what I can’t figure out is why these problems were not identified during the extensive beta testing period, and if they were, why no one fixed them and why customers weren’t warned about the problems by vendors before the new OS shipped.</p>

<p>Google’s Gemini chatbot app will soon be available at no additional cost to customers with Workspace business subscriptions, <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/google-workspace-extends-gemini-benefits-to-more-customers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google announced Tuesday</a>. The change should put Gemini in the hands of many more people  — there are 10 million paid Workspace customers, Google <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/duet-ai-in-workspace-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said last year</a>.</p>

<p>The veracious demand for generative AI (genAI) tools is driving a significant increase in the use of power-sucking <a href="https://serverguy.com/cpu-vs-gpu-vs-tpu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPUs and TPUs</a> in data centers, some of which are scaling up from tens of thousands to more than 100,000 units per server farm.</p>



<p>With the shift to cloud computing and genAI, new data centers are growing in size. It is not unusual to see new facilities being built with capacities from 100 to 1,000 megawatts — roughly equivalent to the energy requirements of 80,000 to 800,000 homes, according to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).</p>
