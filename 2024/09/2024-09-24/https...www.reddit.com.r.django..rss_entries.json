I then at the request of my boss built a system around it for straight forward management of it in the web browser. I&#39;d never built anything before, so I used React and Flask. A terrible choice and a fine but uneducated one. I&#39;ve since gotten much better at development in Vue, and I&#39;ve been using DRF in my tests and hobby development. Works great, much easier to scale than Flask. The database connection and ORM is incredibly, incredibly helpful and scaleable.
