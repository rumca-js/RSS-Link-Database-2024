I thinned out the paint and did a lot better job of keeping the paint thinner and smoother up until I started adding all the details and then it just got bumpy again and it looks very similar to the first one.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve been trying to figure out where I should start reading the books, and I looked up a few lists online, and it really seems like you can pick and choose where to begin. It seems like you don&#39;t HAVE to start in chronological order. Hell, I&#39;m actually struggling to find a simple timeline lol.</p> <p>But I bought &quot;Eisenhorn: The Omnibus&quot; and I&#39;m only on chapter 7, but I&#39;m really enjoying it. Now it doesn&#39;t have any Space Marine war stuff or anything. The summary on the back of the book calls it &quot;Part detective story, part interplanetary Epic&quot; and yeah, it&#39;s a fun read so far. I also bought the first &quot;Dark Imperium&quot; and &quot;Plague War&quot; and the very first page says it takes places 1,000 years after Horus kills his father. Now...does that mean I should read the main Horus Heresy series before Dark Imperium? And if you guys have any suggestions on books or series I should check out, pleas
