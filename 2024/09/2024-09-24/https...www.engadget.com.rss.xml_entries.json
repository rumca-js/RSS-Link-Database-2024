This means the sequel is set 300 years after the events of <em>Tsushima</em>, which focused on the Mongol invasion of that region. In 1603, Y\u014dtei was not under Japanese rule, and the debut trailer shows vast, untouched grasslands, snowy forests and sun-drenched ridges dotted with wildflowers, a strong breeze blowing through each scene. There&#39;s a distinct cowboy twang to the music in the trailer, particularly as Atsu interacts with wild horses. She also meets a wolf, which is neat.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"4eaadf1bd1674059b378a527816cf659\"><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%", "id": 1206249, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/ghost-of-yotei-is-a-tsushima-sequel-coming-to-ps5-in-2025-231306124.html?src=rss", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 104, "source_url": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2024-09%2F132af6e0-7aca-11ef-bdff-e4f53ae94e26&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=efc9128cee0345630bb552872aeb93e66ebdb36c", "title": "Ghost of Y\u014dtei is a Tsushima sequel coming to PS5 in 2025", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-24T22:46:01+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"fa1711a055ee4cafbd5b89bb91381a3d\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ipy3ZazeEVg?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"www.youtube.com\"></iframe></div>\n<p>There have been murmurings for some time that Pocketpair was planning to bring <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/palworld/\"><em>Palworld</em></a>, one of the biggest games of the year, to PlayStation 5.
