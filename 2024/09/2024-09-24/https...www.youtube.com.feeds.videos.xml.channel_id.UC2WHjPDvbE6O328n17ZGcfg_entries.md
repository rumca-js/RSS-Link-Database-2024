So there are 8 data structures you should know as a programmer, and we’re going to dive into each one, show what they are, and look at real-world use cases, complete with code examples and explanations.

So, why are these data structures you should know? Because they are the most commonly used data structures and form the foundation for efficient algorithm design, problem-solving, and optimizing code performance. 

Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of computer programming. And understanding them is better for you than grinding out overly complex edge-case leetcode problems. Unless you’re trying to pass a FAANG interview. Which if you’re ever in one and don’t know what data structure to use, just throw a Has
