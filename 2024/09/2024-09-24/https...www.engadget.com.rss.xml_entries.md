<p>The 2020 PlayStation hit <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> is getting a sequel featuring a new protagonist, era and landscape. <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> is heading to PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>
<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei </em>stars a new Ghost, Atsu, who&#39;s journeying through the lands at the base of Mount Yōtei in Ezo — modern-day Hokkaido — in 1603. This means the sequel is set 300 years after the events of <em>Tsushima</em>, which focused on the Mongol invasion of that region. In 1603, Yōtei was not under Japanese rule, and the debut trailer shows vast, untouched grasslands, snowy forests and sun-drenched ridges dotted with wildflowers, a strong breeze blowing through each scene. There&#39;s a distinct cowboy twang to the music in the trailer, particularly as Atsu interacts with wild horses. She also meets a wolf, which is neat.</p>

The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://music.tiktok.com/en/">music arm announced the news</a> that accounts will close by November 28, with all user data and login information deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google subscribers whose subscription ends after November 28 should automatically get a refund or can request one through Google Play before TikTok Music shuts down. On the other hand, Apple users must request a refund through <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223">Apple support</a> before the 28th to get one. Anyone who actually uses TikTok Music might want to wait a minute, though, as the premium service will no longer be available once a refund is processed. Speaking of deadlines, anyone who wants to transfer their playlists from TikTok Music to another music streamer has to do so by October 28.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s been a topsy turvy year for <em>Dead by Daylight </em>maker <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/behaviour-interactive/"><ins>Behaviour Interactive</ins></a>, which has released two spin-offs, laid off dozens of workers and shut down a studio that was working on another offshoot of its tentpole project. Now, Behaviour is bringing another developer into the fold, as it has bought <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/darkest-dungeon-ii-arrives-on-steam-next-week-215102646.html"><ins>Darkest Dungeon</ins></a> developer Red Hook Studios.</p>
<p>The Vancouver-based outfit will continue to operate as a “fully independent studio,” albeit under Behaviour’s umbrella. Terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed, but Red Hook likely won’t have come cheap — nearly seven million copies of the Darkest Dungeon games have been sold to date. Behaviour has also kept on Red Hook’s entire 29-strong staff.</p>

<p>The Roku smart TV platform is an accessible way to watch your favorite streaming content in a centralized location – either built-in to TVs, or by adding affordable dongles or mini boxes, like the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/roku-says-its-new-ultra-streaming-box-is-30-percent-faster-130038051.html">new-for-2024 Roku Ultra</a>, to older televisions. One big advantage of the Roku platform is that it's always getting free software updates to keep it current — like the cool new feature that turns your TV into a sort of virtual art museum by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/rokus-new-feature-will-turn-your-tv-into-a-fancy-art-delivery-system-214841525.html">displaying famous paintings as a screensaver</a>.

## Marshall’s latest Bluetooth headphones promise improved noise cancellation and extreme battery life

<p>We own many devices that run on batteries, and recharging them can be a pain. It’s always welcome when a new device offers plenty of battery life. As if answering these prayers, Marshall has now released its new Monitor III ANC headphones, and you can expect them to run all day.</p> 
<p>Marshall says that you can enjoy up to 70 hours of playtime with active noise canceling (ANC) on. Deactivating ANC increases the maximum battery up to a whopping 100 hours. That’s more than four days of continuous playback. It takes two hours and thirty minutes to fully recharge the headphones, a rather long time that’s a necessary trade-off for the long battery life they offer. The ANC has also been significantly upgraded to block out sounds better than previous iterations of the technology.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Besides long battery life, the Monitor III ANC headphones have an Adaptive Loudness feature that reacts to your surroundings and makes sound adjustments without qua

<p>TikTok has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/en-us/us-election-hub">announced</a> in its US Elections Integrity Hub that it has removed accounts associated with Rossiya Segodnya and TV-Novosti, which own and run Russia state media outlets Sputnik and RT. The company said that it kicked the accounts off the social media platform for &quot;engaging in covert influence operations&quot; that go against its guidelines for spam and deceitful behavior. TikTok clarified that the accounts&#39; content weren&#39;t shown in the For You feed under its state-affiliated media policy and were also labeled as such. Their videos were already restricted in the EU and the UK, as well, but now the accounts had been permanently banned and are no longer visible to anyone in the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Portable monitors have been around for years, but their importance skyrocketed during the pandemic. And with the continuation of remote and hybrid work positions, they’re going to be staples for the foreseeable future. But picking one isn’t as simple as it seems. At this point, almost every major PC maker has its own take on travel-friendly displays, with prices ranging from as little as $100 to nearly $1,000. So to help sort through the confusion, I tested out a bunch of options to put together a short list of the best portable monitors on sale today.</p>

<p>Before you start looking at specific products, it’s super important to think about how and where you plan on using a portable display. Larger panels are great for home use where you may only need to move it or put it away when you have company over. Meanwhile, smaller screens are great for travel an

<p>“It’s the most powerful wearable tracking the most important organ in your body.”</p> 
<p>Dr. Ramses Alcaide is explaining the electroencephalography (EEG) technology that his company <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-07-neurable-brain-controlled-vr-game.html">Neurable</a> uses to track activity with its brain-computer interface (BCI). Alcaide is the CEO and co-founder, and notes that a huge problem with EEG sensors is that they are often affixed to bulky, awkward-looking headsets — not exactly something you want to wear out in public. And to him, that’s why the technology hasn’t yet “created the type of impact that they could [on] the world.” Sure, we’ve seen <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-05-18-axio-melon-eeg-headband.html">a variety</a> of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-muse-meditation-headband-sleep.html">headbands</a> over the last decade, but those add an additional device

<p>At some point, we’ve all encountered someone who just doesn’t get boundaries. They get too deep into our personal space, oblivious — or all too aware — of our discomfort. This problem is magnified online where there’s instant access to someone’s broader digital footprint, which can be a vector for abuse. It’s why most platforms have some sort of block feature, enabling people to limit some user’s access to their lives.</p>
<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-is-nerfing-the-block-button-blocked-users-will-be-able-to-see-your-posts-214928396.html"><ins>Now guess which platform is ending the ability to block people. Yup, that one</ins></a>.</p>
