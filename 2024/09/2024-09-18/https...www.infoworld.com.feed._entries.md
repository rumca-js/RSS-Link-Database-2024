<p>Swift 6, the latest version of the <a href="https://www.swift.org/">general-purpose language</a> developed by Apple, is now available. The language update features concurrency improvements, including extended safety guarantees for data races. Linux and Windows support and a new testing library are also featured.</p>



<p>Published September 16, the update can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.swift.org/download/">Swift.org</a>. For the language and standard library, a new opt-in language mode extends safety guarantees by diagnosing potential data races in code as compiler errors. Data-race safety checks previously were available as warnings in <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/23

<p>As competition heats up among cloud service providers, especially on the generative AI front, Oracle is focusing its energies on providing IT infrastructure that can help developers and enterprises take advantage of generative AI in their operations.</p>



<p>Shifting gears from his standpoint last year, Oracle Chairman and CTO Larry Ellison took to the stage last week to unveil the company’s strategies and products around multicloud, distributed cloud, AI, application development, and security.</p>



<p>Last year, Oracle revealed its <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/644791/what-is-oracles-generative-ai-strategy.html">three-tier generative AI strategy</a> that included helping large langua

This notion eventually became Node.js, the runtime that altered the trajectory of Internet-based software development. </p>
