<p>The other day, we reported that Microsoft has <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2458860/microsoft-makes-good-on-promise-to-speed-up-windows-11-apps.html">made good on its promise to speed up Windows 11 apps</a> that have been suffering from performance issues. That fix is currently in testing and should roll out soon.</p>



<p>But in another positive move, Microsoft is showing that they’re paying attention to performance on a broader scale — in this case, we’re about to see performance improvements to the Microsoft Store.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/ifdef-windows/preview-uwp-support-for-dotnet-9-native-aot/" data-type="link" data-id="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/ifdef-windows/preview-uwp-support-for-dotnet-9-native-aot/">the company’s dev blog</a>, Microsoft is introducing a new path for app developers to migrat

<p>In need of a high-quality 4K monitor? You don’t have to pay a fortune to get one — if you act fast, anyway. Right now, <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-32-curved-4k-uhd-monitor-s3221qs/apd/210-axkm/monitors-monitor-accessories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dell’s gorgeous 32-inch curved 4K monitor is down to just $280</a>.</p>



<p>Not only does this monitor have a large 32-inch curved display that provides an immersive experience with movies and TV shows, it sports a 4K resolution for crisp and captivating visuals. The 60Hz refresh rate might exclude this one for serious gamers, but that’s no reason to skip over it if all you’re going to do is work, browse, and watch.</p>



<p>Connectivity is good with two HDMI 2.0 ports and a DisplayPort 1.2 port, with two USB-A 3.0 ports for connecting peripherals and devices. That all makes

<p>Why did Amazon rise to world dominance? It made online shopping convenient and easy, yes. And it stocked almost every item you can think of, sure. But really it comes down to low prices and discounts. Prime Day and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2460527/amazon-october-prime-day-2024-everything-you-need-to-know.html">upcoming Prime Big Deal Days</a> events are prime examples.</p>



<p>But the online shopping titan is currently facing headwind for its pricing policy. A class action lawsuit alleges that the company advertises with “fake discounts” to entice customers into making purchases.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.classaction.org/media/ramirez-v-amazon-com-inc-et-al.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ramirez v. Amazon lawsuit</a> (PDF) was filed by lead plaintiff David Ramirez at the Western District Court in Washington. I

<p>Microsoft appears to be preparing to push the next Windows 11 feature update, otherwise known as Windows 11 24H2, to PCs beginning next month.</p>



<p>Paul Thurrott <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-11/309667/microsoft-confirms-rollout-schedule-for-windows-11-version-24h2">sniffed out</a> the release date on this <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/enhanced-data-protection-with-windows-and-microsoft-copilot/ba-p/4246428">Microsoft post</a>, which “aligns” a new feature in Copilot with the “the annual Windows 11 feature update release,” or Windows 11 24H2.

<p>Tracking your luggage while traveling, knowing where you accidentally left your keys behind, and making sure your pets don’t get lost while hiking — all of that’s easy with a smart tracker.</p>



<p>And right now, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-SmartTag2-Bluetooth-Resistant-Findable/dp/B0CJWDCXWM/">Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 is on sale for $21 at Amazon</a>, down from its $30 MSRP. It’s a good time to snag a few!</p>



<p>I recently got some of these Galaxy SmartTag2 trackers myself. A couple of them went onto dog collar holders for my pups and the others hitched rides on my keychains. (Yes, I keep misplacing my keys…)</p>



<p>I love that these are water- and dust-resistant with an IP67 rating, so if the dogs get into puddles on their walks or if I drop my keys in water — yes, it’s happened before — the trackers won’t die on me.</p>

<p>Is your computer running slow? Just download more RAM! (If you’re so young that you’ve never Googled “lower back pain,” you might have missed this classic of early internet humor.) But Logitech is doing something similar in real life for some of its high-end gaming mice: boosting sensor DPI with a software update. Neat. </p>



<p>Logitech recently announced that every mouse in its G series with a Hero 2 sensor will be boosted to its maximum possible resolution — a staggering 44,000 DPI (dots per inch) — with a software update that’s planned for October this year.</p>

<p>Remember <em>Flappy Bird</em>? You know, that mobile game that became an overnight sensation for its simple-yet-frustrating setup, and disappeared almost as quickly? I was never a fan, but I found myself fascinated by the original creator’s apparent lack of concern over a potentially lucrative game. Flappy Bird is back—but it’s not the same.</p>



<p>Last week a trailer for<em> Flappy Bird </em>was posted to YouTube by “The Flappy Bird Foundation.” The one-minute video is chock full of ridiculously epic orchestral music over news footage and web video covering the initial sensation, and the shocking decision by solo developer Dong Nguyen to de-list the lucrative game from mobile app stores. </p>

<p>There’s a new hacking method making the rounds and it’s as clever as it is annoying. According to a new report, attackers are using the Kiosk Mode of Chrome to put the browser into full-screen mode, which then refuses to let you do anything else until you input your Google password. At that point, of course, your password is stolen.</p>



<p><a href="https://research.openanalysis.net/credflusher/kiosk/stealer/stealc/amadey/autoit/2024/09/11/cred-flusher.html">A report from OALabs</a> observes this novel attack vector for stealing Google credentials. It’s really a combination of two techniques.</p>

<p>In a gaming PC, the graphics card is easily the most exciting component. Responsible for producing all those beautiful frames and pushing those frame rates as high as possible, you’d be lost without it.</p>



<p>But shopping for a graphics card can be madness. You have to navigate between Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, then sift through each one’s product offerings. You’ll struggle to discern between models like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 and the RTX 4070 Ti. And even after you’ve decided on a model, that model might have numerous variations — like a reference version and a factory overclocked version.</p>
