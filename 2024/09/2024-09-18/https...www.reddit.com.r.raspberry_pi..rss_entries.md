Basically it functions similarly to the OG Simon toy where you have to match the colors according to the sequence. As you match the sequence, another color is added to the sequence. It only gets harder the farther you move up. Unlike the original version, my version gives you 3 lives. Overall, I found this project to be fun to work on. The code was written in Python.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/POKE
