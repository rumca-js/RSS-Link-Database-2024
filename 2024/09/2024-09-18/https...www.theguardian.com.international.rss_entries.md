<p>Life as a professional athlete brings plenty of unwelcome attention. But many basketball players started getting stares when they were still in their early teens</p><p>When <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNZljX750PM">Paul Mokeski</a> traveled to China several years ago to teach a month-long basketball clinic, he says he couldn’t help but feel like Godzilla. For the 7ft former NBA center, who played 12 years in the league, many of them on a Milwaukee Bucks team that battled Larry Bird’s Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals, it was a familiar feeling. People would come out of stores and point as if they were seeing a giant from a storybook. “That’s all part of the gig when you’re as tall as I am,” says Mokeski.</p><p>For decades, when it came to the NBA, height was king. And while that trend has diminished some, thanks to players like Steph Curry and his “small ball” Golden State Warriors team, players of Mokeski’s stature are hardly a rarity in the NBA. But to b

<p>Sonic Youth’s frontman pays homage to the otherworldly New York City artist who turned graffiti into a futurist art weapon and used experimental linguistics to escape definition</p><p>The New York artist Rammellzee was, without a doubt, one of the most intriguing visionaries of hip-hop culture from its mid-70s origins. Raised in the remote beach front outpost of Far Rockaway, Queens, the final stop on the storied A train, Rammellzee discovered the art of graffiti while noticing another teen spray-painting his tag, “Sonic Bad”, at 57th Street station. Already engaged in his own personal investigation of calligraphic writing, Rammellzee was instantly fascinated. He soon found himself descending into the dark underworld of subway tunnels where train cars stood motionless, throwing up his tag across the metal shells with only a haze of visibility to focus, anxiously aware of being nabbed by transit cops.</p><p>Rammellzee, a tall, lean Black and Italian-American mixed-race kid, bounded
