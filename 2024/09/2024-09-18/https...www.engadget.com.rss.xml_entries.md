<p>A new update for <em>Mortal Kombat I</em> (<em>MK1</em>) is less than a week away from release that will add new character skins, new finishing moves and (eventually) new fighters to its “kombatant” selection screen. NetherRealm Studios released a preview of the “karnage” that’s “koming” around the “korner” (OK, we’ll stop with the unnecessary K’s).</p>
<p>The new trailer released on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1836390174827102275"><em><ins>Mortal Kombat</ins></em><ins> creator Ed Boon’s X page</ins></a> shows some of the new stuff <em>MK1</em> players can expect from the <em>Khaos Reigns</em> pack scheduled for release on September 24 and future updates.

The change, though, isn’t because Brazil’s government has reversed its stance on the Elon Musk-owned platform. Instead, it seems that X has begun using Cloudflare’s DNS service, which is for now helping the social network avoid the Brazilian government’s restrictions, though it’s unclear how long that will be the case.</p>

<p>If you grew up in the age of the NES and SNES consoles, you might be positively giddy to learn that one of the greatest video game crossovers since <em>Marvel vs Capcom</em> is available on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Nintendo announced the addition of four new SNES titles to its Switch Online service including the 1993 beat ‘em up <em>Battletoads/Double Dragon</em>. This rare meeting of mayhem between the fly-gulping trio and the martial arts duo Billy and Jimmy Lee takes players through both games’ universes as they plow through unique waves of fist-flinging enemies.</p>

## Bong Joon Ho’s Mickey17 trailer is even crazier than the book

<p>The film adaptation of the immensely popular sci-fi novel <em>Mickey7</em> has been in the works for years, but now we finally have a trailer and <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osYpGSz_0i4"><ins>it’s filled with surprises</ins></a>. For one thing, it’s now called <em>Mickey17</em> and, well, fans of the book know exactly what that implies. It means they’re in for an even crazier experience than what’s written on the page.</p>
<p>The movie is written and directed by one of the modern masters, Bong Joon Ho, who seems to have taken some liberties with the source material. Light spoilers, but the book follows a series of clones of the titular Mickey as they perform the grunt work of colonizing an exoplanet. The book chronicles seven (ish) Mickey variants, but the movie is amping this up to at least 17. This will give us plenty more darkly hilarious clone deaths, which the trailer shows quite a lot of.</p>

<p>Bose has a new soundbar for the fall shopping season, and it includes a few neat tricks for owners of the company’s clip-on earbuds. The Bose Smart Soundbar is a “small, sleek” model with AI Dialogue Mode and a Personal Surround feature for owners of the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review-function-meets-fashion-140015467.html">Ultra Open Earbuds</a>.</p>

The center tweeter handles dialog.</p>

<p>The amount of fines Google has to pay in Europe may have become just a bit smaller. It has successfully convinced the European Union&#39;s General Court to annul the €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) penalty levied against it back in 2019 for what the European Commission described as &quot;<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-20-eu-fines-google-1-7-billion-for-abusive-advertising-practices.html">abusive practices in online advertising</a>.&quot; According to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.ft.com/content/f59441ee-e37f-4aa9-92a9-6f321b981e2c"><em>Financial Times</em></a>, the General Court agreed with the commission&#39;s assessment that Google did block rival advertisers from its platform. However, it argued that the commission failed to take into account &quot;all the relevant circumstances&quot; when it assessed how long the company had implemented anti-competitive practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If found guilty, Meta could be on the hook for 10 percent of its global annual revenue — a number that reached almost $135 billion last year. However, the fine could be much smaller, and Meta will almost certainly appeal it.</p>

<p>The reviews don’t stop. This morning, we’re checking out how Apple’s latest wearable compares to its predecessors and competition. Deputy Editor Cherlynn Low says that, while the Series 10 is noticeably lighter, you wouldn’t notice many differences compared to the Series 9 unless they were side by side. The <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-review-legacy-and-sequel-in-equal-measure-120021405.html">latest Apple Watch</a> is ever so slightly bigger (46mm), but if you need something even bigger, you should consider the Watch Ultra 2, which has a 49mm screen. Apple is also using a new wide-angle OLED to make its latest watch easier to read, even if your wrist is resting to the side. Again, the change is noticeable but not in a huge way. Upgraded charging should bring the Series 10 back to 80 percent in 30 minutes, but we’re still not hugely impressed with its battery life.</p>
