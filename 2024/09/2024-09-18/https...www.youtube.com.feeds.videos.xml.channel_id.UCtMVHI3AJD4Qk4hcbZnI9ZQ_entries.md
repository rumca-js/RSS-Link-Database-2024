Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at an email from someone that wants my money in exchange to hide something that would be quite embarrassing for me. This is an email that's sent out everyday and it's worth looking into and demystifying for not just us but for the ones that get fearful of things like this. Thanks for watching!
