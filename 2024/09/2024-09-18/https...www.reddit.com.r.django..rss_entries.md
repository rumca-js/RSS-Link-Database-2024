<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, Ive just spent a few hours trying to figure out how to solve the 403 error when trying to serve static files. Am using Raspberry Pi OS as test bench and using caddy as reverse proxy on my local network. The issue is, /static paths are throwing 403 and the assets css, js for admin pages are not loading. I have ran collectstatic and the files are there. Pretty sure the issue is with my Caddyfile config. Can someone please help me? Not sure what am doing wrong or how to solve it. </p> <p>Thank you. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ramit_m"> /u/ramit_m </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1fk6bt9/serving_static_files_through_caddy_throws_403/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1fk6bt9/serving_static_files_through_caddy_throws_403/">[comments]</a></span>

If I did it that way, I figured my columns would correspond to what is currently the row index labels, and I would use css to pivot and format the form to the same format.
