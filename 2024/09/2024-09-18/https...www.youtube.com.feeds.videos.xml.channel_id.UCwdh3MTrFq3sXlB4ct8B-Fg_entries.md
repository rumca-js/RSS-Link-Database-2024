The Battle Report team from Warhammer+ put the new edition of Kill Team through its paces – and it's free to watch! The T'au Empire sends in a crack team of Vespid Stingwings to compromise or commandeer a major asset of the Imperium, but the grav-chute equipped Tempestus Aquilons won't let them go without a fight!
