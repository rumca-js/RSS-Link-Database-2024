Yars Rising is the latest indie game from WayForward, the dev team behind the Shantae series. The game lovingly blends the Atari classic, Yar’s Revenge, into a fun platformer filled with colorful art and energetic characters. 

The controls are very tight and the upgrades/abilities you get from the retro Yars minigame are fun to use. This is a solid platformer, but the persistent loading screens and lack of a fast travel option render backtracking more laborious than it should be. 

The colorful visuals and groovy soundtrack make Yars Rising stand out as an energetic ode to the Atari 2600. I couldn’t get enough of the game’s atmosphere and gameplay loop, despite my issues with the loading times.

It’s honestly surprising to believe that the PS5 is almost 4 years old at this point, and Sony seems to have some great plans in store for the future of this generation. 

After a buffet of reports and leaks, we finally have confirmation of the existence of a PS5 Pro. Sporting a significant GPU upgrade and storage expansion, the PS5 Pro is being touted as the definitive way to experience the best of this generation. 

While there’s a certain argument to be had when it comes to the viability of the console itself, it always makes for an interesting idea to assemble a similarly performing PC and gauge the price differences. With this feature, we will be doing exactly that as we try to build out a PC that’s the same as the PS5 Pro.

Starfield may not have landed with the sort of impact that many past Bethesda titles have done for many (personally, I loved it), but long before it had released, developer Bethesda Game Studios made it abundantly clear that it'd be supporting the space-faring epic with new content for years after release. 

Obviously, some of that has already come in the form of a handful of free update (with more presumably to come down the line), but the game is soon also set to get its first major paid expansion in the form of Shattered Space. From reverting to focusing on handcrafted content like past BGS titles to blending its sci-fi offerings with a dash of cosmic horror, Starfield's debut expansion is making some intriguing promises, and here, we're going to go over all of those key details.
