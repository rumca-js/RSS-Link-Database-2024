<p dir="ltr">Discovery in video games has changed over the last 40 years. While we are arguably in a golden age of creativity and innovation in the medium, it's a different type of creativity than when games were in their infancy--learning to crawl, grappling for new ideas, and guessing at best practices. Modern-day games have become largely standardized, and that's mostly for the better. But when we look back at retro game collections like the NES Classic or compilations from Digital Eclipse, we're often remembering the trailblazers, not the oddballs. That's what makes UFO 50 so special--it invokes the sense of wild experimentation and surprise that you would find in a cross-section of the earliest video games.</p><p dir="ltr">The pitch is simple: UFO 50 is a compilation of fictional retro games made throughout the 1980s by a prolific developer called UFO Soft. They range from 1982 to 1989, and span across the entire gamut of retro genres. The presentation leans into this, as selecti

<p>GameSpot parent company Fandom has released its sixth annual Inside Fandom study, and this one reveals insights into how people play and feel about games and general entertainment.</p><p><span>One of the key findings of the study, called The Power of Me Time, is that 54% of consumers spend their free time on gaming and entertainment each week. The study found that 80% of consumers said they considered playing games or watching TV/movies as a passion, beating out other popular interests like music (75%), food and cooking (52%), sports (44%), and travel (38%).</span></p><p>Further, the study found that gaming can provide an emotional outlet--and a positive one. Respondents reported feeling more stimulated, accomplished, and focused after playing games. People reported feeling relaxed, happy, and zen primarily when watching TV or movies. This compares to other leisure activities like sports, which the study found elicited feelings of frustration and anxiety.</p><a href="https://www.ga
