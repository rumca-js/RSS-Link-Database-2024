In these Era 2 benchmarks, we're testing it for build quality, ease-of-installation, cable management, some thermals and acoustics, and overall execution. The Fractal Era 2 follows Fractal's Mood, which we didn't recommend, and other case launches like the Lian Li A3-mATX, NCASE M1EVO, and Cooler Master's NCORE 100 MAX tower. The Era 2 is closest to the A4-H2O of the cases we've reviewed lately, but is distinct in several key areas. It ends up a relatively tall ITX case by dimensions, but still compact. The wood top panel on the case also moves wood from the (now typical) front location to a different area. Mechanical complexity is also overall interesting and tooling is good, but execution struggles in some areas: We had a cracked wood panel and misaligned aluminum panels, contributing two of the only marks against it in our testing -- the last being price.\n\nIf you'", "id": 1167651, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBb-mN2kt-E", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "source_obj__id": 428, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/lBb-mN2kt-E/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Fractal's Excellent Era 2 Case: Review, Thermal Benchmarks, Cable Management, & Quality", "vote": 0}]
