The framework specializes in providing solutions to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) requests. The framework pairs developers, companies and individuals that have specific but out-of-reach AI needs with service providers who have the resources, expertise and models they require. The service is crowdsourced, built on a blockchain and uses a smart contract -- a contract with a pre-defined set of conditions built into the code -- to match the users with the appropriate service provider.

It is crucial for organisms to be able to control which genes are expressed in which cells and when. Naturally occurring chemical modifications of DNA-binding histone proteins are believed to play an important role in this process; however, it had been unclear whether they play a causal role in instructing gene expression. Researchers have experimentally shown that certain histone sites act as critical control sites that help prevent the spurious activation of parts of the genome, including sequences derived from ancient remnants of viruses.
