<p>If you’ve been following Android for long, you’re probably familiar with two seemingly at-odds realities about the role Google’s platform plays in the greater tech universe:</p>



<ol>
<li>Android has been the dominant mobile operating system (and all-around <em>computing</em> operating system) for ages now, thanks to its prominent and diverse presence on the phone side of things.</li>



<li>At the same time, Android has long struggled to gain any meaningful foothold on the <em>tablet </em>end of the equation — with an endless-seeming array of about-faces and puzzling pivots in that area.</li>

<p>But wait: Computers are designed to automate repetitive tasks! Isn’t there be a better way to do this?</p>



<p>The answer is yes — and Microsoft’s new Workspaces PowerToy is how to make it happen. With a few fast clicks, the tool empowers you to pull up any specific group of application windows you need and put them exactly where you want them on your desktop.</p>
