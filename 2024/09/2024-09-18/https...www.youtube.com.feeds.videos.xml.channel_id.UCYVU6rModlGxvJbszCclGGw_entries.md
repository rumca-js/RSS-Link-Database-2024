Tracking people is now like rocket science. In the old days, just recording the IP address (which you can protect with a VPN) was good enough. Now the head butting between privacy believers and big tech continues and I will describe the many other threats that can identify you even when you hide your IP address. These are all threats in the Application Layer (OSI Layer 7) so this cannot be protected in the usual ways. There are solutions! But it requires discipline and understanding of what can be done by the opposition.
