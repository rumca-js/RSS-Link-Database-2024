With visionOS 2, the company has a chance to show the relative few who bought its spendy headset — and those who might yet — that it’s still committed to the new platform.</p>
<p id="ONZO7M">After a few months of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24175689/apple-vision-pro-2-wwdc-2024-keynote-best-updates">using it in beta</a>, visionOS 2 isn’t a dramatic change — it’s more like a smoothed-out version of the software the headset launched with.
