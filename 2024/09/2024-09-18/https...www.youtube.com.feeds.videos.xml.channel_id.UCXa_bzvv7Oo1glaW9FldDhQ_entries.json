The game lovingly blends the Atari classic, Yar\u2019s Revenge, into a fun platformer filled with colorful art and energetic characters. \n\nThe controls are very tight and the upgrades/abilities you get from the retro Yars minigame are fun to use. This is a solid platformer, but the persistent loading screens and lack of a fast travel option render backtracking more laborious than it should be. \n\nThe colorful visuals and groovy soundtrack make Yars Rising stand out as an energetic ode to the Atari 2600. I couldn\u2019t get enough of the game\u2019s atmosphere and gameplay loop, despite my issues with the loading times.", "id": 1170190, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yq0fL2eTa8", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/7Yq0fL2eTa8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Yars Rising Review - A Class Act", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-18T16:00:42+00:00", "description": "It\u2019s honestly surprising to believe that the PS5 is almost 4 years old at this point, and Sony seems to have some great plans in store for the future of this generation. \n\nAfter a buffet of reports and leaks, we finally have confirmation of the existence of a PS5 Pro. Sporting a significant GPU upgrade and storage expansion, the PS5 Pro is being touted as the definitive way to experience the best of this generation. \n\nWhile there\u2019s a certain argument to be had when it comes to the viability of the console itself, it always makes for an interesting idea to assemble a similarly performing PC and gauge the price differences.
