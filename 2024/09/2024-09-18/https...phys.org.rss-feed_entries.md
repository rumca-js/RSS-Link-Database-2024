According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is one of the greatest environmental health challenges that we face today. Various studies have shown that in addition to the lungs, it affects essential organs like the heart and brain, and that those who suffer most from its consequences are the most exposed or vulnerable people in society. It is a pervasive issue that affects all of humanity, and reinforces entrenched inequalities.

Depression is a significant challenge to diagnose and treat. Among the factors influencing depression onset and severity, there is growing evidence for chemical imbalances that generate oxidative stress throughout the body. To address this problem, researchers reporting in the journal Langmuir have developed antioxidant carbon dot nanozymes (synthetic enzyme-like substances) that reduced oxidative stress, rebalanced gut microbes and alleviated stress-induced depression in rats.

An interaction between an elliptical galaxy and a spiral galaxy, collectively known as Arp 107, seems to have given the spiral a happier outlook thanks to the two bright "eyes" and the wide semicircular "smile." The region has been observed before in infrared by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope in 2005. However, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope displays it at much higher resolution. This image is a composite, combining observations from Webb's MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) and NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera).

Atherosclerosis is the build-up of plaque in the arteries which causes their narrowing. It is a primary cause of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and ischemic stroke (IS), both of which are major contributors to the 17.9 million deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases each year globally. The incidence of atherosclerosis-related conditions has been rising steadily over the past three decades, and particularly in younger populations. The increase is driven by lifestyle factors such as unhealthy diets, lack of exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption.

Americans are famously fond of their guns. So it should come as no surprise that a team of NASA scientists has devised a way to "shoot" a modified type of sensor into the soil of an otherworldly body and determine what it is made out of. That is precisely what Sang Choi and Robert Moses from NASA's Langley Research Center did, though their bullets are miniaturized spectrometers rather than hollow metal casings.

Sampling reveals that there is an incredible amount of rubbish lying on the seabed. This is because many people are still flushing all sorts of things down the toilet, believing that they will simply disappear. But, of course, this is not the case. Both wet wipes and chemical substances have a negative impact on the biology of marine animals. This is also true of many other products that are branded as "natural."

In a few picoseconds (trillionths of a second), a small, thin piece of copper momentarily becomes dense plasma, specifically a state called warm dense matter, warm being a relative term—the metal is nearly 200,000 degrees Fahrenheit. With the short duration of a high-powered laser pulse, copper shifts from a solid state to a plasma state in an instant before it explodes. Understanding the progression of heat in the copper is an exciting breakthrough in physics relevant to the interior of giant planets and laser fusion fuel cores.

This approach is realized within a training and partner network throughout the Caribbean. Now, a study shows that all the effort was worthwhile: during the devastating heat wave in the Caribbean in 2023, the young, bred corals out on the reef stayed healthy while most of the remaining wild corals bleached and many died in the aftermath.

Astronomers have observed three types of black holes in the universe. Stellar-mass black holes formed from the collapse of a massive star, intermediate mass black holes found in some star clusters, and supermassive black holes that lurk in the centers of galaxies. But there is a fourth type that remains hypothetical and unobserved.

Preschool teachers have different views on finger counting. Some teachers consider finger counting use in children to signal that they are struggling with math, while others associate its use as advanced numerical knowledge. In a new Child Development study, researchers at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland and Lea.fr, Editions Nathan in Paris, France, explored whether a finger counting strategy can help kindergarten-aged children solve arithmetic problems.
