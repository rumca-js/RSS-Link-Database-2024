New format, new Celtic, new danger.</p><p>The paucity of Slovan Bratislava will most likely be borne out by subsequent Champions League outings but Brendan Rodgers and Celtic were fully entitled to relish what played out here after year upon year of European turmoil.

In their 13th attempt, Celtic finally opened the Champions League proper with victory. This quickly descended into a rout, one absorbing so many games of frustration for Celtic at elite level.

<p>Stand-in captain wants to entertain in rare five-match series as he banks more experience before next year’s Ashes</p><p>In one sense the five-match ODI series between England and Australia that starts in Nottingham on Thursday is slightly lacking in wider context.

Bullet Train, right at the whimsical-comedy end of the ballistic-ballet spectrum, features 152 individual onscreen deaths; Extraction 2, very much on the laugh-free side, has 108. (Commando, by far Arnie’s most violent film, has a mere 81).</p><p>Rebel Ridge, which scored 31.2m views over its first six days on Netflix, feels like an almost-deliberate antidote to all this carnage.

<p>While the rest of Europe worries about a ‘silver tsunami’ or ‘demographic bomb’, the cities of Wrocław and Kraków are treating their ageing populations as an opportunity rather than a burden – with remarkable results</p><p>On a balmy Friday afternoon earlier this month, the most feared group of people in Europe breached the 13th-century defensive walls of Wrocław and poured into the town square. Some wore blue berets, others cowboy hats, straw boaters and, in one instance, a three-tiered cake stand adorned with kitchen sponges and pompoms. Resistance was futile: less than an hour after their arrival, the mayor ceremonially handed over the key to the Polish city’s gate to the flamboyantly dressed couple they had chosen as their queen and king.</p><p>Baby boomers are often talked of as an existential threat to Europe’s economic prosperity and welfare state model.

<p>The author of Capital returns with a short book on inequality that asks big questions</p><p>Thomas Piketty has come a long way. He first captured public attention in 2014 with his wildly ambitious, 704-page updating of Marx’s Das Kapital, entitled <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/17/capital-twenty-first-century-thomas-piketty-review">Capital in the Twenty-First Century</a>. Part of its appeal – it became both an international bestseller and an academic sensation – was the simplicity of its basic thesis. Although packed with history and statistics, its fundamental proposition, that if the return on capital exceeds the growth rate of the economy, wealth will become increasingly concentrated, could be reduced to one simple equation: r&gt;g.</p><p>Piketty’s latest book is almost exactly the opposite. Not only is it much shorter, based on a lecture given to the&nbsp;Société d’Ethnologie in his native France, its key message is: “It’s a lot more complicated than that.”

(Most accounts have Linda McCartney and Yoko Ono also in attendance.) For the new stage version, Stanfield, Richard Short, and Barry Sloane (who also plays Lennon) have streamlined it even further, removing an incognito walkabout sequence on the advice of director Scot Williams. The action now stays within Lennon’s apartment, with its white piano and its view of the Manhattan skyline. Only once do the duo venture outside. “Rem

<p>A strong cast led by Joseph Gordon-Levitt are not enough to bring supense to a story where the local hitman advertises in a paint store</p><p>This under-par comedy noir from screenwriter Mike Vukadinovich and director Potsy Ponciroli feels like a script that the Coen brothers might have taken on while in one of their slack periods – and not just because Coen regular Tim Blake Nelson is in it.</p><p>Himesh Patel plays Will, a nervous rookie cop with a pregnant wife, Paige (Lily James); he has a new job in a sleepy, sweet little town; his cop partner is to be hardbitten cynic Terry, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, with whom he has a “training day” relationship on their first day out on patrol. Terry shows him the ropes, and says how easy it all is in this no-crime backwater. But while Terry is one day busy having illicit sex (while supposedly on duty) with his married girlfriend, partner Will has to go, on his own, and with his weapon drawn, to someone’s home where he misguidedly bel

<p>From banging on about ‘childless cat ladies’ to spreading racist rumours about Haitians eating pets, Trump’s running mate can’t seem to move on from his strange fixation with felines</p><p>Want to know the secret to winning elections and influencing people? Cat memes. This is according to JD Vance, who, you might have noticed, has a bizarre fixation with felines. Donald Trump’s running mate – a man who might soon become one of the most powerful people in the world – has been widely ridiculed and condemned for his comments about “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/06/jd-vance-childless-cat-ladies-tim-walz">childless cat ladies</a>”.

<p>The veteran MP’s inspirational memoir charts a life in politics and testifies to the power of refusing to pipe down</p><p>There is a sense of poetic justice in seeing Diane Abbott back in parliament after the 2024 election. She is now Mother of the House – the title given to the longest serving female MP – and all those who plotted to block her from standing must watch as she receives the respect she deserves. After enduring so much racism, and at a time of few political wins for the left, we have to ask: how did Abbott end up having the last laugh?</p><p>Her autobiography offers some clues. Born to working-class Jamaican parents in 1953, she was clearly always both strong-willed and intellectually gifted. Which is not to say she didn’t have to work hard: early signs of her determination include insisting to her teachers that she apply to Cambridge, swotting up on Latin for the entrance exam, and beating considerable odds by winning a place from her state school.

<p>In 2004, Fable was as famous for what it didn’t deliver as for what it did. But this Python-esque fantasy game deserves to be remembered for more than that</p><p>In 1985, brothers Dene and Simon Carter vowed to each other that they would one day start their own development studio together. The game they imagined was ambitious, as Simon outlined in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/03/19/fable-developer-diaries-unabridged">developer diary</a>: a fantasy role-playing game, “populated with compelling and convincing characters with real personality, people who actually reacted to what you did … We wanted each and every person who played our game to have a unique experience, to have their own stories to tell.” The idea of a living, reactive game world was an obsession for many game creators (and players) at the time, largely because it had never yet been done.

It is former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis who suggests here that the 2010s debt crisis was akin to an ancient tragedy, with the likes of him, prime minister Alexis Tsipras and a slowly strangulated populace at the mercy of overweening Olympian (or rather, European) forces. We should probably pay attention to the idea – but maybe more so to his parting suggestion that this drama doesn’t completely conform to the classical pattern, either.</p><p>Director Elisa Mantin’s melancholic but partisan film makes it clear that the hubris was on the Euro troika side.

<p>Savoury rice cakes in a spicy, coconutty egg curry gravy and a traditional fish curry will make a delectable start to any day</p><p>Sri Lankan breakfast and brunch fare is a vibrant reflection of the island’s culinary heritage, blending diverse influences with indigenous flavours. Central to these morning meals are dishes such as <em>kiri hod</em><em>i</em>, a creamy, coconut milk gravy that’s often paired with <a href="https://www.mylankanfoodjournal.com/string-hoppers/">string hoppers</a>, and <em>kiribath</em>, a ceremonial rice dish cooked in coconut milk that’s often served on special occasions. Sri Lankan fish curry, meanwhile, made with a unique blend of spices, showcases the country’s love for bold, aromatic flavours.

<p>Wing who has won a Premiership title and his first England caps gets away from the pressures of elite rugby by fishing</p><p>With a little more than three minutes left on the clock and England trailing by seven points in Auckland, the ball is tossed wide to Ollie Sleightholme.

It is easy to forget that despite all the upheaval that followed, 55% of Scottish voters decided to keep things as they were. Then, despite being on the losing side of the independence referendum, the SNP became unbeatable, the Conservatives staged a small but sturdy revival and Scottish Labour crumbled like loose shortbread in a handbag. Like those spooky bits of physics that threaten to overturn the whole discipline, the political consequences of the IndyRef seemed bafflingly disconnected from the actual result.</p><p>Rory Scothorne is a historian and writer based in Edinburgh</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/18/scottish-independence-referendum-ten-years-panel">Continue reading...</a>
