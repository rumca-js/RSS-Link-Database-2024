Having worked with Chromebooks for many years, I was shocked by the state of hers. Her Chromebook was chock-full of malware and God only knows what else. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chromebooks don\u2019t get viruses and malware often because ChromeOS has robust security features like automatic updates, data encryption, sandboxing, and so on \u2014 not to mention that the entire thing revolves around a browser, rather than running local programs. However, it does happen from time to time, so it\u2019s better to be prepared. I\u2019ll show you what signs to look out for as well as how to remove the virus or malware from your system.
