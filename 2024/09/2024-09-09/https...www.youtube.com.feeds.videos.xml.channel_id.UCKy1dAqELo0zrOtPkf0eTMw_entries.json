The license would have paid each of the song's three writers $7,500 to use the song in Grand Theft Auto 6, but it would include no royalties from the game. Considering that GTA 5 is one of the best-selling games of all time (and continues to sell to this day), Ware refused, even when other gamers argued that the amount was better than nothing. In other news, a modder has unlocked the full developer toolkit for Baldur's Gate 3, which could lead to complete custom campaigns and other content beyond what the \"official\" modding tools provide.
