<p>Microsoft’s Recall sparked outrage that Microsoft was spying on users. But will Apple’s “semantic search” produce the same headlines?</p>



<p>Apple introduced the new feature at its “Glowtime” event on Monday, where the company launched the iPhone 16, plus new versions of the Apple Watch and its AirPod earbuds. </p>



<p>“If you need to quickly find an important detail, but can’t remember where it was shared, Siri will use your personal semantic index to quickly locate the information you’re looking for,” Greg Jozwiak, Apple’s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, said during the brief segment on Apple Intelligence that accompanied the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-price-features.html">iPhone 16</a> Pro.

<p>AMD plans to unify the architectures used by its datacenter and consumer graphics architectures in what one company executive is calling a “new DNA,” or a “unified DNA,” that combines its CDNA and RDNA architectures.</p>



<p>The goal is to bring more developers into the fold, a complement to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2451584/amd-exec-says-radeon-will-prioritize-market-share-not-high-end-gpus.html">AMD’s adjustment to its consumer  Radeon GPU plans</a> to attack mainstream but not flagship enthusiast products. </p>

<p>One of the best and easiest ways to upgrade your home entertainment system is to get a Fire TV Stick, and now’s a great time to do it because <a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9/">the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is now just $40 on Amazon</a>.</p>



<p>That’s a notable 33 percent discount off its usual $60 price tag, and this is a fantastic price for a device that’s useful for anyone who wants to stream content to their TV. It’s compatible with most streaming services, and Microsoft recently made it possible to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2390368/from-today-hundreds-of-xbox-games-playable-on-firetv-heres-how-it-works.html">play hundreds of Xbox games on Fire TV even without an Xbox console</a>.</p>

<p>Gaming laptops equipped with RTX rarely sell for this cheap, so take advantage while you can if you’ve been in the market for one.</p>



<p>Right now, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/i5-13420H-Processor-GeForce-Display-ANV15-51-51H9/dp/B0CP8D4SM2/">get this Acer Nitro V for just $650 on Amazon</a>, which is a nice cut from its usual $780 price and significantly lower than almost any other laptop you could get with an RTX GPU.</p>



<p>Running on an Intel Core i5-13420H processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU, this is a decent combination that’s enough to play pretty much any game out there in great quality. Not the <em>best</em> quality, mind you, but better than most other laptops in this price range.</p>



<p>The only thing that’s far from ideal with this particular configuration is the 8GB of DDR5 RAM. It’s the minimum amount we’d recomm

<p>A little while back, I made a big change to my desktop PC workflow — I swapped my pair of 24-inch desktop monitors for a single 35-inch ultrawide display, which stretches much further side-to-side than a traditional widescreen monitor does.</p>



<p>Ultrawides used to be a luxury in the monitor world, but prices have come down in recent years, and even basic computers like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2079827/i-switched-my-desktop-for-mini-pc-and-regret-nothing.html">my $300 mini-PC</a> have become powerful enough to push an ultrawide’s extra pixels without dedicated graphics cards.</p>
