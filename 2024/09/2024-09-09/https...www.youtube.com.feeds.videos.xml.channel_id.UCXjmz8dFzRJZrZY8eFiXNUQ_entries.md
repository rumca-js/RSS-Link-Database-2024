When Bill Hader's Barry first debuted on HBO it was an immediate success.  The story, world, and characters developed by Bill Hader and Alec Berg were gritty and real.  Though Anthony Carrigan's NoHo Hank was an instant stand out.  NoHo Hank brought a sense of humor to an otherwise dark world of crime.  Anthony Carrigan's performance was one of a kind, and the show wouldn't have been the same without him.  Which is odd seeing as NoHo Hank was originally not supposed to make it out of the pilot episode.  What would Barry have looked like without NoHo Hank?  Thanks to Bill Hader and Alec Berg we'll never know.
