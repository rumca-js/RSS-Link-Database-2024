<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve written a Quarterback backup software file extractor that recovers files even in the presence of a corrupted file catalog. </p> <p>Originally, it had no catalog support and simply dumped files into a single directory. It now attempts to process the primary catalog, restoring files/directories into their original locations. It tries to handle corruption automatically. There&#39;s command line options to ignore the catalog completely, and just retrieve the files. </p> <p>There were at least two header formats used: a 16-byte header and a 20-byte header. I originally supported only 20-byte headers, but have also added a command line switch to support 16-byte ones. </p> <p>The project is written in Python and is open-source here. Should run on multiple platforms.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/keithgh1/AmigaQB_extract">https://github.com/keithgh1/AmigaQB_extract</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit
