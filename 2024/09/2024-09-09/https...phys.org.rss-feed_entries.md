Your title is incident meteorologist (or IMET), and your job is to support agencies and emergency responders who fight these devastating blazes by providing accurate weather forecasts. Your forecasts help determine a variety of factors about how the weather could impact the fire, including but not limited to how quickly the fire might spread and where it could go.

Hydrogen energy, with its green, low-carbon and high-calorific-value properties, is emerging as the new key to solving the energy crisis. Electrochemically, water splitting has garnered much attention as a promising hydrogen production technique. However, the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode limits the overall energy conversion efficiency. Therefore, the development of efficient catalysts for the OER is critically needed.

Native shrublands were once common across the Canterbury Plains, but over time, conversion of land to other uses, including irrigated pasture, has contributed to their gradual decline. Now, a new study by scientists at Manaaki Whenua—Landcare Research has found that spillover of nutrients and water from adjacent intensive agriculture is facilitating invasions by exotic plants into reserves set up to protect the last remnants of these native shrublands.

Throughout Earth's history, the planet's surface has been regularly impacted by comets, meteors, and the occasional large asteroid. While these events were often destructive, sometimes to the point of triggering a mass extinction, they may have also played an important role in the emergence of life on Earth. This is especially true of the Hadean Era (ca. 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago) and the Late Heavy Bombardment, when Earth and other planets in the inner solar system were impacted by a disproportionately high number of asteroids and comets.

During protein synthesis, or translation, genetic information transcribed in the cell's mRNA directs the stringing together of amino acids—the building blocks of proteins. As the translation machinery carouses along the string of nucleotides that make up the mRNA, it recognizes them in groups of three, called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid.

Every cell in our body contains the same DNA, yet liver cells are different from brain cells, and skin cells differ from muscle cells. What determines these differences? It all comes down to gene regulation; essentially how and when genes are turned on and off to meet the cell's demands. But gene regulation is quite complex, especially because it is itself regulated by other parts of DNA.
