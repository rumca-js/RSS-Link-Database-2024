Well, iPhones. We\u2019re expecting four new devices: the base iPhone 16, a larger iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro and another beastly iPhone 15 Pro Max. The Pro models might get slightly larger screens, with the regular Pro likely to move to 6.3 inches from 6.1 inches, while the Pro Max should hit 6.9 inches, an increase from 6.7 inches. The iPhone 16\u2019s camera module could be getting a design refresh too.</p>\n<p>While those are likely to be the stars, Apple doesn\u2019t miss a chance to showcase even more of its hardware, especially if it ties to the iOS juggernaut. There are plenty of rumors of redesigned AirPods, as well as an updated Apple Watch.</p>\n<p>Apple\u2019s next standard smartwatch may have a bigger screen more in line with the Ultra. The company may also introduce a new band system with new connectors that are easier to swap out.</p>\n<p>The event kicks off at 1PM ET.
