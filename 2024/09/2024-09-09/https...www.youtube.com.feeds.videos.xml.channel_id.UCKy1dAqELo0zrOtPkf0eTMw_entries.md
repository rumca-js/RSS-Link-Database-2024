In today's Daily Fix:
Martyn Ware, co-founder of the 80's synth band Heaven 17 told Rockstar Games to "Go F*** Yourself" after getting a lowball offer for the band's song, Temptation. The license would have paid each of the song's three writers $7,500 to use the song in Grand Theft Auto 6, but it would include no royalties from the game. Considering that GTA 5 is one of the best-selling games of all time (and continues to sell to this day), Ware refused, even when other gamers argued that the amount was better than nothing. In other news, a modder has unlocked the full developer toolkit for Baldur's Gate 3, which could lead to complete custom campaigns and other content beyond what the "official" modding tools provide. We could see something along the scope of Fallout: London or The Forgotten City, both of which started as mods for Fallout 4 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, respectively. And finally, Sony has announced a PS5 technical presentation for tomorrow at 8am Pacific. Join us
