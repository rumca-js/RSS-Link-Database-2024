Conventional wisdom dictates that having a companion by your side makes handling a stressful situation easier. But after a 30-minute demo with Little Nightmares 3, it seems conventional wisdom doesn't apply to The Maw, the macabre setting of all Little Nightmares games. Little Nightmares 3, scheduled for release in 2025, will bring players to never-before-seen areas of The Maw, some of which I got to see for myself in a recent hands-on demo.

The latest in the Mario Party franchise offers more boards, more minigames, and more ways to screw over your friends.

Super Mario Party Jamboree is the third Mario Party game to release on Nintendo Switch, and the first to combine both traditional and motion controls. At a preview event, we played around an hour of the game, including classic Mario Party, Daily Minigame Challenges and the new Koopathlon and Bowser Kaboom Squad modes. Super Mario Party Jamboree might not change anybody's mind about the franchise, but with the right crowd, it's as much fun as Mario Party has ever been, and with seven boards, 20 characters, and over 110 minigames, it looks set to be the most Mario Party for your money on the Switch so far.
