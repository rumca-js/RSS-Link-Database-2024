According to a new report, Kamala Harris is receiving debate advice from Hillary Clinton because she has "experience" debating Donald Trump. That's like saying that the Washington Generals have experience playing the Harlem Globetrotters.

Kamala Harris is out there giving emotional support, but what America really needs is a president who kicks butt, takes on our enemies, and stops bad policies‚Äînot one handing out hugs like it's a therapy session. And then there's Tim Walz, who's more focused on awkward "bro hugs" than addressing the real issues facing the country.

A new poll the weekend before the crucial Trump-Harris debate shows the new Democratic candidate down in the race; Kamala‚Äôs team tries to downplay debate expectations; and the media continue to try to push the vibes for a few more weeks.
