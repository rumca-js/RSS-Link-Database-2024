However, on September 19th, Santa Monica Studio's God of War Ragnarok finally arrives on the platform, less than two years after its stunning success on PS4 and PS5.\n\nKratos and Atreus return, with Fimbulwinter in full swing and Ragnarok looming in the distance. While they must prepare for the battle, learning about Tyr,, provides some hope of potentially defeating their enemies. All Nine Realms become available to explore, with new challenges, bosses, equipment, and more to experience.\n\nPC players can look forward to uncapped frame rates, native 4K, various upscaling solutions, Super Ultrawide screen support, and more.

It could see the usual array of new bosses, environments, and enemies. However, it may also allow for new features like a boss rush, a boss rematch, or an Arena for tackling waves of foes. We'd also like to see new stances and Spells to expand the available gameplay.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be too bad to have some quality-of-life features like an in-game map, transmog, loadouts, and much more included.

It's the critics' top-rated game of the year and Team Asobi's best work. Ironically, it arrives at a time when Sony published one of its worst efforts in years - Firewalk's Concord, which subsequently went offline and was pulled from sale.\n\nAmid all the cancellations, you wonder about Sony's live-service approach, especially when Astro Bot shows that a stellar game is possible without microtransactions, road-maps and always-online requirements. It achieves this with only 60 developers and three years of development with a playtime of roughly 12 to 15 hours, which is also extraordinary.\n\nWill this be the final straw for Sony, even with other live-service titles coming up? Maybe not, but Team Asobi's title is a reminder that the publisher should stick with what it does best - excellent single-player games.", "id": 1108088, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uvoC1Bv0Ps", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/0uvoC1Bv0Ps/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Astro Bot Is Proof That Sony Should Stick To SINGLE PLAYER GAMES", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
