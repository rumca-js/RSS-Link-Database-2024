Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with author, documentarian, and podcaster Matt Walsh. They discuss the soon-to-be hit film “Am I Racist?” as well as implicit bias, the disparity of demographics, how men and women both find meaning through responsibility (in different ways), and why concepts like white guilt have taken the place of religion for many on the secular left.

Matt Walsh is a popular writer, speaker, and one of the Right's most influential voices. He is the host of “The Matt Walsh Show,” and author of the best-selling children’s book Johnny the Walrus. His documentary “What is a Woman?” has become a cultural phenomenon and one of the most talked-about documentaries of 2022.
