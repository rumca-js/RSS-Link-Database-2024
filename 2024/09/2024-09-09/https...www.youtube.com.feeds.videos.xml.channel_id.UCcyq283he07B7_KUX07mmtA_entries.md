IPOs are a team sport, and business leaders lean on expertise from a broad range of disciplines to prepare for and enter a new world of accountability and growth. One of the hottest IPOs of the year was Reddit, which rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange on March 21. 

In coordination with Fidelity, Business Insider presents The Road to IPO, a virtual conversation with Reddit’s head of investor relations, together with top minds from finance, legal, and strategy, who have collaborated with Reddit and others on every step of their IPOs. 

This experienced panel will impart helpful tips on what makes a successful launch into the public markets. The panelists will share what company leaders need to know before and during the IPO process, and how to navigate the early days of life as a publicly traded company.
