Basically offering cheaper alternatives (no data transfer cost) to AWS with (i believe) more personalised DevOps support and no vendor lock-in. </p> <p>While we are doing decent at the moment, I overheard my director saying that we also desperately need sales boost. I have been helping him reaching out to some potential prospects, but most of them are not open to the idea of changing their current systems and I feel like I need to help my company. I don&#39;t really know what else to do and I was hoping I could get some advice here. </p> <p>New startups are still using the AWS credit benefit and have no struggles with cost yet. Older companies aren&#39;t exactly open to the idea of changing anything. Even to get a meeting to explain our services are hard. </p> <p>I&#39;m sorry if I post this on the wrong subreddit, but I thought experienced tech peo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I made my original snake game some people argued the only reason it was possible, was that the PC already had the BIOS and OS on it so what I call a &quot;58 bytes snake game&quot; is not only 58 bytes because the BIOS and OS are each thousands upon thousands of bytes.</p> <p>While it&#39;s true that without those wrappers the program wouldn&#39;t be that small, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a valid argument, but anyways, I made a POC snake game that can work without any BIOS, bootloader, or OS, all the code, including the hardware initialization, fits in 114 bytes (and filler) and runs on QEMU.</p> <p>I also commented every single line in the code so you can use it to learn about how the BIOS initializes the hardware, although I tried making it very minimal (just like the original snake game), so there is not much to see.</p> <p>The main problem I encountered when making this was the icount. The icount is an optional QEMU argument that allows you t
