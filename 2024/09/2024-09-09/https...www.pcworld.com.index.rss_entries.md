<p>A few days ago I answered a phone call from my mother, who was in a semi-frantic state because her Chromebook was screaming bloody murder at her. Having worked with Chromebooks for many years, I was shocked by the state of hers. Her Chromebook was chock-full of malware and God only knows what else. </p>



<p>Chromebooks don’t get viruses and malware often because ChromeOS has robust security features like automatic updates, data encryption, sandboxing, and so on — not to mention that the entire thing revolves around a browser, rather than running local programs. However, it does happen from time to time, so it’s better to be prepared. I’ll show you what signs to look out for as well as how to remove the virus or malware from your system. Read on to learn more.</p>

<p>For months, internet rumor mills have claimed that AMD’s next-generation Radeon RX 8000 graphics cards would cede the high-end market to Nvidia’s GeForce lineup, after the GeForce RTX 4090 stomped all over the competition this time around.</p>



<p>Now, AMD’s senior VP and general manager of the computing and graphics group, Jack Huynh, all but confirmed it when he responded to Tom’s Hardware’s question about whether Radeon will compete with Nvidia at the “top of the stack”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“My number one priority right now is to build scale, to get us to 40 to 50 percent of the market faster. Do I want to go after 10 percent of the TAM [Total Addressable Market] or 80 percent?
