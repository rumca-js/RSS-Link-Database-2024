<p>In this bonus episode, Devindra and Engadget Contributing Reporter Kris Holt break down everything new (and not so new) in the iPhone 16 lineup. Is Apple Intelligence alone enough to entice iPhone owners to upgrade? Does anyone actually need the camera button? And why are we so intrigued by the Apple Watch Series 10 (which is undoubtedly the most interesting product Apple launched today)?</p>

<p><em>Kind Words 2 (lofi city pop)</em>, a game where you send real letters to real people and then wander around a cozy town, is due to hit Steam on October 7.</p>
<p>It’s the sequel to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-28-kind-words-social-network-nice.html"><em><ins>Kind Words (lo-fi chill beats to write to)</ins></em></a>, an award-winning 2019 game from independent Boston studio Popcannibal. Players in the original game had a single bedroom where, backdropped by a sweet lo-fi soundtrack, they wrote and responded to letters from other players. There were small bits of room customization and sticker collection in the game, but it was truly just about connecting with strangers in a warm and nice way. This was a prescient idea: Just six months after <em>Kind Words</em> came out, the coronavirus pandemic locked down the globe. Connecting with people safely and from a distance suddenly became a top priority, and <em>Kind Words</em> carried this respons

## Apple AirPods 4 hands-on: Seriously impressive ANC performance

<p>Apple is using this version of the AirPods 4 to bridge the gap between the AirPods and the AirPods Pro. As such, this model has some features that were previously exclusive to the company&#39;s priciest buds. Those include Siri interactions that allow

## iPhone 16 Pro hands-on: How does a faux camera control button feel so real?

<p>Apple&#39;s latest attempt to slightly differentiate the iPhone 16 series is... a faux button it&#39;s calling Camera Control. But unlike last year&#39;s new button, this one doesn&#39;t actually physically depress, and uses a mix of sensors and haptic feedback to simulate the sensation of movement. And in my brief hands-on right after Apple&#39;s iPhone 16 launch event, I have to say I actually thought it was a real button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got a quick look at the iPhone 16 Pro here in Apple Park, and got a deep walkthrough of the new camera control and its corresponding interface. When I first picked up the iPhone 16 Pro Max, I felt like it looked sleeker and thinner than my iPhone 15 Pro Max, which was nice. My fingers were then drawn to the new &quot;button,&quot; which has a groove that surrounds it, which helps with identification by touch.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>From the home screen, I pressed down on the camera control and the camera app quickly opened.

<p>Hey, there were good intentions! When Apple revealed its new type of case, no longer offering leather cases for the iPhone 15 series, the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-new-finewoven-iphone-15-magsafe-cases-are-already-discounted-145008254.html">FineWoven case </a>was pitched as a leather substitute that used 68 percent post-consumer recycled content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The material looked a <em>little</em> similar to leather in press shots, but the reality was a material that was smooth and scratchy at the same time, a surface that was almost as absorbent as Bounty with fingerprints and a <em>fantastic</em> opportunity for third-party iPhone case manufacturers.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When leather gets old, it gets... nicer? There's a patina. When Finewoven cases got even a few days old, it got scratched and blotchy. It's not a huge surprise, then, that there are no new FineWoven colorways, or any iPhone 16-compatible FineWov

The device is also thinner, delivering the bigger and slimmer update the company loves to give new devices. It&#39;s lighter too, so all three of the design changes should make the wearable more comfy to... wear. And of course, the new display will be a key selling point for this updated model.&nbsp;</p>

Apple unveiled its latest iPhone models at an <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event-live-updates-iphone-16-ios-18-apple-watch-and-more-expected-100014448.html">event</a> in Cupertino today, and as expected, the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/when-does-the-iphone-16-launch-when-to-expect-the-new-updates-to-iphone-and-ios-144939051.html">iPhone 16</a> handsets are largely iterative of last year's models. While the smartphones, standard and Pro versions, took center stage, Apple also showed off the new Apple Watch Series 10, two new pairs of AirPods and hearing aid features coming to the second-generation AirPods Pro. The company also went into detail on its latest mobile chipsets that power the new iPhones, and reminded folks what they can expect when <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-ios-18-release-date-is-days-away-but-is

<p>Apple just announced a forthcoming update to its popular Voice Memos app that brings multitrack recording, of a sort. It was announced at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event-live-updates-on-iphone-16-launch-ios-18-apple-watch-10-airpods-4-apple-intelligence-and-more-100014783.html">today’s iPhone event</a> and looks pretty neat.</p>
<p>The demo shows a guitar player laying down a track and then, simply, singing on top of it. All of this is handled via the app. It looks like the magic stops at two tracks, but there’s a simple edit interface that lets you make adjustments to each layer.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There’s also some algorithmic and machine learning mojo happening under the hood, as the demo doesn’t show the user wearing headphones when singing on top of the guitar track. In the old days, doing overdubs without headphones would be a one-way ticket to a terrifying cacophony of noise.&nbsp;</p>

## iPhone 16 Pro has a DSLR-like camera button and a slightly bigger display

<p>Say hello to the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max. Apple’s latest high-end models may look familiar, but they have slightly larger displays than the iPhone 15 Pros: The screen on the iPhone 16 Pro is 6.3 inches and the Pro Max is 6.9 inches, an increase of 0.2 inches in both cases. Mainly, this means the bezels on the 16 Pros are ultra slim.</p>
<p>Really, it’s all about the camera button this time around. Both of the new Pro models have a dedicated button just for snapping photos and filming video, professional style. Lightly pressing the button activates the focus and pressing harder actually snaps a picture, similar to a DSLR. It’s touch-sensitive, too: A soft press opens up additional tools that are controlled by swiping along the button, such as setting the zoom and aperture. A long hold on the camera button swaps between still photo and video modes.</p>

<p>Apple has introduced a new feature called Visual Intelligence with the iPhone 16. From the demo that Apple showed as part of its September 2024 event, it seems like Visual Intelligence is Apple&#39;s version of Google lens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new feature is activated by a brand new touch-sensitive button on the right side of the device called Camera Control. With just a click, Visual Intelligence can identify objects, provide information, and offer actions based on what you point it at. Aim it at a restaurant to instantly pull up menus and ratings, or snap a flyer for an event to add it directly to your calendar. Curious about a dog’s breed? Point and click to find out. Eyeing a bike for purchase? Click to search for it online.</p>

This encompasses prevention, with levels limited by default and a noise app to measure exactly how noisy your surroundings are. Apple notes that one in three people are regularly exposed to noisy environments that can damage hearing, even with in-ear buds like AirPods Pro and noise cancellation.</p>

The company unveiled the A18 chip at the iPhone 16 launch event today, and as you&#39;d expect, it&#39;s built with Apple Intelligence in mind. The chip offers more memory and a new 16-core Neural Engine, in addition to some incremental performance boosts over older models. More so than the past few years — where you could point to new camera lenses or hardware tweaks as a reason to get the new iPhone — the chip is the key selling point for the iPhone 16 lineup.</p>

<p>There are arguably only three sure things in life: death, taxes and a new bunch of iPhones every September. Like clockwork, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-event-liveblog-iphone-16-ios-18-apple-watch-and-more-announcements-at-the-its-glowtime-event-100014474.html">Apple has revealed</a> this year&#39;s iPhone lineup, which is anchored by the iPhone 16 and its larger sibling, the iPhone 16 Plus. Apple has made some alterations to the external design, but the company’s main focus this year is on Apple Intelligence, with the new phones designed from the ground up to support that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few notable changes to the exteriors of both devices this year. First, the rear camera array is arranged vertically on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus with a pill-shaped bump.

<p>After nearly four years, Apple finally delivered an update to its most premium headphones. But instead of a new generation of AirPods Max, the company simply refreshed the existing over-ear headphones with USB-C support and a handful of new colors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the same $549 price tag, the AirPods Max will maintain their status as Apple’s most expensive AirPods, though the updates are mainly cosmetic. The over-ear headphones will now be available in five colors: midnight, blue, purple, orange and starlight. Apple is also ditching the lightning connector for a USB-C port, much like it did with its Beats Studio Pro headphones.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But anyone hoping for more significant upgrades will likely be disappointed. The latest AirPods Max will have the exact same design, with Apple’s “breathable knit mesh” band, stainless steel frame and memory foam cups. The company also didn't upgrade its chip from the H1, or add any new audio features to t

<p>Apple’s annual iPhone event sure brought the fire on the handset side of things, but the company also announced two new AirPod models to join the ever-growing lineup. There's the standard AirPods 4 and a slightly more high-tech AirPods 4 with ANC.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The biggest news is perhaps the addition of USB-C to the charging cases. This finally brings the AirPods in line with the rest of the world and, most importantly, newer iPhone and iPad releases. The AirPods 4 earbuds should also fit better, thanks to some design refinements.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Both versions of the earbuds also include the H2 chip, allowing for an improvement in sound quality. There's even personalized spatial audio, voice isolation and gesture-based Siri controls. You can nod your head, for instance, to make certain adjustments. All told, these buds should get 30 hours of battery life.&nbsp;</p>

If you wear your watch while you sleep, you&#39;ll get an alert in the morning if symptoms are detected through the night, urging you to visit your clinician. The data for this will be collated in the Health app on the iPhone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than using oxygen saturation, which would be the logical approach, Apple says it&#39;s using motion tracking.

Spoiler alert: It continues the trend of this year’s Pixel hardware feeling more mature and ready to take on the competition than ever. With the introduction of a new larger size and serious battery life improvements, the Pixel Watch 3 feels like a smartwatch worthy of the Fitbit and Google partnership. There are still some quirks the company has to iron out, but for now, the Pixel Watch 3 feels like the final evolution of a Pokémon that is ready to battle the big beasts from Samsung and Apple.</p>

<p>In just hours, Apple's September event is kicking off, where Apple will introduce its latest lineup of iPhone 16s. That means this week is a bad week to buy a new iPhone because you could snag a previous model at a lower price in the coming weeks, or get the newest iPhone 16. The Apple event is today, September 9 at 1PM ET (10AM PT) at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park in Cupertino. You can livestream Apple's <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uarNiSl_uh4">It's Glowtime event on YouTube</a> (which we’ve embedded above for your convenience), as well as on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab

<p>The next iPhone will be revealed later today at 1PM ET. Well, iPhones. We’re expecting four new devices: the base iPhone 16, a larger iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro and another beastly iPhone 15 Pro Max. The Pro models might get slightly larger screens, with the regular Pro likely to move to 6.3 inches from 6.1 inches, while the Pro Max should hit 6.9 inches, an increase from 6.7 inches. The iPhone 16’s camera module could be getting a design refresh too.</p>
<p>While those are likely to be the stars, Apple doesn’t miss a chance to showcase even more of its hardware, especially if it ties to the iOS juggernaut. There are plenty of rumors of redesigned AirPods, as well as an updated Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Apple’s next standard smartwatch may have a bigger screen more in line with the Ultra. The company may also introduce a new band system with new connectors that are easier to swap out.</p>
<p>The event kicks off at 1PM ET. You can follow along on our <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" hre
