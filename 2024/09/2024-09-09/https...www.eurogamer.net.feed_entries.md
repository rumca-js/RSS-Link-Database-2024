Apple has unveiled the iPhone 16, claiming it'll be possible to play AAA games on all devices in the line-up - and not just on the pricier Pro models, as was the case last year.
</p><p>
Apple started <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-triple-a-games-are-coming-to-iphone-15-pro-and-the-implications-are-mouthwatering">bigging up the iPhone's AAA gaming credentials</a> with 2023's iPhone 15 range, announcing the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> would all be playable exclusively on the ray tracing enabled iPhone 15 Pro.

Developer Mojang has unveiled changes to Minecraft's content release schedule that'll see the blockbusting sandbox adventure trade its traditional single summer update for multiple content drops throughout the year. And that's on top of plans for a native PS5 release and more.
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-future-of-minecrafts-development">blog post</a> outlining the future of Minecraft's development, Mojang said its new release model is designed to satisfying players' desires for "new Minecraft content more often", and will see content drops of varying sizes releasing "more frequently" each year. It also revealed it's been trialing the approach for a while, pointing to a December 2023 update that turned pots into functional storage containers and made visual changes to bats, as well as this April's Armored Paws upd

A month after Bungie acknowledged player "uncertainty surrounding the future of Destiny" following mass layoffs at the studio, the developer has announced "major changes for the future" of its live-service shooter, which will now receive multiple paid expansions a year.
</p><p>
More specifically, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s overhauled release model, announced to coincide with the series' tenth anniversary, will see two "medium-sized" paid expansions release annually, alongside four "major" free content updates. All this will form a "new multi-year saga" (the first since Destiny 2's Light and Darkness saga concluded with its The Final Shape expansion earlier this year) promising new characters, factions, twists, and more.

It's oddly freeing in many ways - not just as a traversal tool, but the feel of it - the glide, the airtime, the speed - is just so perfectly engineered to give you pitch-perfect control over Link's movements.</p><p>It's a sensation that developer Pocket Trap have perfectly recreated in Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo, a top-down adventure that sees you spin, grind and leap across the screen as the young yoyo master Pippit Pipistrello, whose aunt's spirit gets trapped in sa
