Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a surge of immigration from Haiti is destroying communities in America — even those thousands of miles away from Haiti. It's gotten so bad that, according to many reports, the Haitian immigrants are killing and eating people's household pets. Will this be the thing that finally convinces the cat ladies that the border must be secured?

Will this be the thing that finally convinces the cat ladies that the border must be secured? Also, Kamala Harris is fading fast in the polls.
