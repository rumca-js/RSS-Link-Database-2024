No warning, no chance to react. One minute everything was working fine, the next, the firewall was completely dead. It wouldn’t even power back on.</p> <p>In that moment, I realized just how vulnerable my network had become. The firewall is a key piece of my setup, and without it, I was left scrambling to get things back online. But fortunately, I had prepared for something like this. I had a full backup of my OPNsense firewall configuration saved.</p> <p>That backup saved me from a total disaster. I was able to spin up
