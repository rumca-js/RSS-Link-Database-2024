<p>Spider-Man: No Way Home hit theaters almost three years ago, and it's been a long time since we've heard any word about the next adventure of Spider-Man. But now, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton is in talks to helm Spider-Man 4 for Marvel Studios and Sony. And the film may begin shooting very soon.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/spider-man-4-finds-its-director-1235995984">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Marvel and Sony are planning to film the sequel early next year. Tom Holland will be back as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and the screenwriting team of Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers are also returning for the new film.</p><p>Assuming Cretton closes his deal, he will be only the fourth Spider-Man live-action director since the original film was released in 2002. Sam Raimi helmed the first Spider-Man trilogy, while Marc Webb tackled the two Amazing Spider-Man films. More recently, Jon Watts directed his own Spid

But after a 30-minute demo with Little Nightmares 3, it seems conventional wisdom doesn't apply to The Maw, the macabre setting of all Little Nightmares games. Little Nightmares 3, scheduled for release in 2025, will bring players to never-before-seen areas of The Maw, some of which I got to see for myself in a recent hands-on demo.

<p>Did you know that there's a Devil May Cry 5 multiplayer game available right now? A tabletop multiplayer game, that is. Popular board game manufacturer Steamforged Games released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HW59Q8V?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Devil May Cry: The Bloody Palace</a> a few years back. The board game originally carried a $115 list price, but it's now out of print and there's still some stock lingering at major retailers. Over at Amazon, you can grab the board game adaptation Capcom's demon-hunting series for $43. And if you prefer to go hunting for demons on your own, The Bloody Palace is playable solo, too.</p><div title="" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="undefined" data-template="undefined" data-size="buylink__small" data-title="" data-collection="%7B%22text%22:%22See%20at%20Amazon%22,%22monetizedUrl%22:%22%22,%22rawUrl%22:%22https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HW59Q8V?tag=gamespot-promos-20%22%7D" class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B

<p>HBO is bringing the behind-the-scenes chaos of making a superhero movie with The Franchise. Created by Mendes, Jon Brown, and Armando Iannucci, the series focuses on a crew for an upcoming superhero franchise film, trying to rein in the chaos of egos and their lives outside of the production.</p><p>"The Franchise follows the crew of an unloved franchise movie fighting for their place in a savage and unruly cinematic universe," the official show description reads. "The comedy series shines a light on the secret chaos inside the world of superhero moviemaking, to ask the question--how exactly does the cinematic sausage get made? Because every f***-up has an origin story." HBO announced the series will premiere on October 6 and released a trailer.

<p>AMD is reportedly stepping back from directly competing with Nvidia in the pursuit of the flagship consumer GPU. As the company continues on its quest to gain more market share overall, it believes that scale is the answer and not having the outright fastest card on the market.</p><p>That's according to Jack Huynh, AMD's senior vice president, who spoke with <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-deprioritizing-flagship-gaming-gpus-jack-hyunh-talks-new-strategy-for-gaming-market">Tom's Hardware</a> at IFA 2024. With rumors regarding the upcoming RX-8000 series of AMD GPUs potentially dropping flagship models (which AMD hasn't officially confirmed), Huynh was pressed to comment on the company's long-term strategy for consumers and how it might differ to that of Nvidia. The answer seems to be something similar to what AMD attempted five years ago--surrendering the flagship fight to Nvidia while attempting to gain market share where most consumers are spending th

From blue shells to King Boos, Mario Kart and Mario Party have spent decades seemingly committed to fostering as much division among their players as possible--my wife once exclaimed, "I do not love you" when I beat her to the finish line of a flagpole minigame in 2018's Super Mario Party.

Every arcade--a concept that's also a relic of a time long passed--had walls lined with MvC machines, and each one was surrounded by players dropping quarters into X-Men Vs.

Capcom Fighting Collection, however, brings together all six of those era-defining fighting games--along with the historic brawler that started the core partnership between Marvel and Capcom--in a new era. Thankfully, this package presents each game in a way that celebrates that storied past while also injecting new life into them with modern features, creating a collection that's up to the task of reintroducing these classics to a new age of players.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.
