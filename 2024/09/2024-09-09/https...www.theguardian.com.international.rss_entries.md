<ul><li>Captain has scored 66 goals in 99 international matches</li><li>‘I felt I was on 30 goals and then, bam, I went to 50 and 60’</li></ul><p>Harry Kane prepared for the milestone of his 100th cap by saying he wants to reach a century of goals for England. The captain, who trained in gold boots before Tuesday night’s Nations League game against Finland, has scored 66 times in 99 appearances and has set the target of hitting another personal achievement.</p><p>“It’s possible, it’s there,” Kane said. “What is it, 34 goals? It is strange, I have touched on it a bit, 100 caps have come round so quick – especially the last few years playing three major tournaments in such a short space of time. In those years I’ve done around 15, 16, 17 caps a year whereas a normal year would be 10.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/09/harry-kane-century-england-goals-100th-cap">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The new US Open champion joins Spaniard as dominant force in a new age of tennis, with players born in the 1990s now almost completely bypassed</p><p>As Jannik Sinner digested his first triumph at the US Open on Sunday, afternoon, his victory closed out the first year since 2002 in which none of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer has won a grand slam title, putting a new complexion on the sport. The “big three” era, once the focal point of men’s tennis, which in recent years has been held up solely by Djokovic’s excellence, is finished.</p><p>There was once a time when it seemed like there might be a period of uncertainty as the old greats finally disappeared into the night, a long transition as players fought to see how they would come out on top in a new era. Instead, Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have snatched the reins with stunning self-assurance. By splitting the four grand slam titles between them this year, they have positioned themselves as the two leading figures

<p>Explaining things to another person – or a rubber duck – can boost your understanding and even bridge political divides</p><p>Over breakfast this morning, I enjoyed a short chat with Mia, my new Spanish study buddy. I went over some of the stuff from my recent lesson and explained what I have learned about the psychology of happiness from a <a href="https://www.spanishlanguagecoach.com/intermediate-spanish-podcast">Spanish-language podcast</a>. By the end of the 10-minute conversation, I felt that I had embedded more of the vocabulary, grammar and turns of phrase than if I’d done an hour of textbook exercises.</p><p>Mia, however, does not exist in real life: they are an AI that I created to take advantage of a phenomenon called the “protege effect”. According to a wealth of psychological research, we learn more effectively when&nbsp;we teach someone else about the topic we’ve just&nbsp;explored – even if that person doesn’t really exist.

<p>New England have lost an all-time great quarterback and coach over the last few seasons. But there are encouraging signs as they start to rebuild</p><p>The post-Bill Belichick era for the New England Patriots is off to a sunny start. The Patriots went on the road Sunday and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671628">beat the Cincinnati Bengals</a>, a widely anticipated playoff team, 16-10. New coach Jerrod Mayo, a Belichick disciple turned replacement, got a soothing Gatorade bath in his debut game. The Patriots were eight-point underdogs, and their win was the most surprising result of Week 1 action.</p><p>On some level, the Patriots’ life after Belichick figured to be bleak. The coach who brought the franchise six Super Bowls is spending this year doing broadcasting gigs, and there’s no recapturing the magic that Belichick and Tom Brady conjured together for nearly two decades. But through a different lens, the Patriots of old died when Brady walked out the do
