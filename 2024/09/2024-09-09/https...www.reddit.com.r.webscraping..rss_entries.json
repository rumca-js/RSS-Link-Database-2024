I am using python requests and residential proxies because they are implementing IP rate limiting. The problem is, the API sends the results in different order (from all of the results - meaning I might get different list on the very same page) every few seconds/minutes (not sure yet) even when not using any proxies, or even when using sticky sessions. Is there any way to get around this?
