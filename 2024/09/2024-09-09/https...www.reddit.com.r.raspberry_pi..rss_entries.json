A while back I disabled the USB Ports on my Raspberry PI 4, since I was using it through VNC Viewer on my desktop. Long story short: I got a new internet router, set everything up and send the old router back to my ISP. Only now am I realizing that I completly forgot to give the raspberry pi the new wifi password, so now I cannot connect to it and I also can&#39;t use it by plugging my peripherals into via USB. I tried plugging it into LAN, but I still cannot connect via VNC Viewer.<br/> I don&#39;t really have an idea on how to gain access back to my pi.
