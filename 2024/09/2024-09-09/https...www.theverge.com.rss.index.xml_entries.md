It looks a lot like prior Apple Watch models, but it has an updated design that makes the whole package thinner while expanding the screen sizes to 42mm and 46mm, up from 41mm and 45mm on the Series 9. That said, even though the sizes have crept larger since the Series 7, both the 42mm and 46mm don’t feel chunky when you wear them. Apple says the new display is 40 percent brighter and that it

  <p id="tKdRQJ">For the first time, Apple’s AirPods for the masses come in two different versions. Today, the company announced its AirPods 4 earbuds, which start at $129, but there’s also a higher-tier $159 model that brings active noise cancellation to this open-style design. We’ve seen this attempted by other brands before — most recently Samsung with the Galaxy Buds 3 — and I’m very curious about how well Apple’s implementation will be able to combat city streets and airplane noise without the help of an in-ear seal from silicone tips.</p>
