<p>At points, the formidable artist’s story makes you flinch at the toxicity she’s faced. Her incredibly frank account of being rejected by her mother and losing her son is almost beyond comprehension</p><p>The latest edition of the BBC documentary strand In My Own Words presents Alison Lapper’s story. As you might expect from this formidable woman, born without arms and with shortened legs, and abandoned by her mother to a children’s home, she tells it unsentimentally and unsparingly. Almost every word is like a hammer blow to your heart. She tells us that art is about expressing and evoking emotion, but even when we see her new exhibition going up, full of works about her son Parys, who died five years ago at 19, a true understanding of how she has borne all that she has, how she has found the strength to keep going remains elusive. Perhaps it must; perhaps it should. But she is extraordinary.</p><p>We begin with the event that brought her to public consciousness – when the sculptur

In his essay Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren he said “the standard of life in progressive countries … will be between four and eight times as high as it is today”. The productivity gains, Keynes thought, would mean people’s material needs would be satisfied. Their dilemma would be how to spend their free time. Some people were stubborn, he accepted, and would still work “three hours a day”, but both the poor and the rich would enjoy such wealth that this would become unnecessary.</p><p>History suggests Keynes got it wrong.

The speculators include Elliott Management, a firm with a reputation for being New York’s finest financial bruiser.

<p>As the government mulls an outdoor smoking ban, clubbers are lamenting the possible loss of a valuable space where friendships are formed and bonds strengthened</p><p>To some people, the nightclub smoking area offers a moment of relief from the ear-rattling speakers and clouds of dry ice inside. For others, it’s an opportunity to sit down and chew the fat with a friend, or to forge a connection with a new one. Rarely is it just about having a cigarette. Whatever its function, a trip to the smoking area has become a ritual part of the night for many clubbers, regardless of whether they smoke or not. It’s an experience that might be lost altogether if the government pursues a ban on smoking outside clubs, bars and pubs.</p><p>On Friday night at a small DIY club in Sheffield, the smoking area is packed despite the cold temperature. People are exchanging names as they share Rizlas and filters and accidentally pocket one another’s lighters. In one corner, there’s a group of friends runn

<p>A combination of Tuscan recipes for baking tomatoes from a book published in 1899, resulting in delightfully soft tomatoes with an irresistible nutty crumble crust</p><p>Two years ago, a friend bought me a book at an auction. “Dear friend, will you accept this little book?” she joked, before handing it to me with a cover like a dried teabag crossed with a stocking, and a dislocated spine that revealed what looked like fishnet underneath. It must be 100 years old, I said as I put on my reading specs.

<p>A foppish French aristocrat encounters a clan of peasants and their blood-sucking patriarch in a deliriously camp period yarn</p><p>Ageing and death are perhaps the foundation of all horror, but this droll French chamber piece, adapted from an 1839 novella by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksey_Nikolayevich_Tolstoy">Aleksey Tolstoy</a>, puts a devious spin on that. The titular “vourdalak” – a kind of Mitteleuropean vampire – is Gorcha, wizened patriarch of a family of forest-dwelling peasants, who is driven to feed on the blood of those he loves the most. With the film incarnating this beastie in the form of a toothy puppet resembling Norman Tebbit (voiced by director Adrian Beau), it’s a cruel but funny metaphor for parental authority and late-life dependency. Obviously they didn’t have assisted living in early modern Bohemia.</p><p>Arriving in the midst of this folkloric spat is Marquis Jacques Antoine Saturnin d’Urfé (Kacey Mottet Klein), a nervous envoy for the Frenc

My apologies if this is old ichthyological news to you, but it is new news to me, and it is very definitely going to be the hook for this week’s column.</p><p>The female deep-sea anglerfish is very large compared with the male deep-sea anglerfish. In some species, he sniffs her out (using his giant nostrils) and upon finding his mate, he bites into her, his teeth and lips then dissolving into her flesh. His little fishy body dangling off hers like a limp appendage, he loses himself utterly, including the use of his eyes – what is the point of them, when he has hers? Some males “become little more than blobs or skin tags”, says James Maclaine, senior curator of fish at the Natural History Museum.

<p>A sense of inevitable finality permeates every frame of Marusya Syroechkovskaya’s documentary, composed of personal footage shot over a decade</p><p>At the age of 16, in 2005, Marusya Syroechkovskaya was already certain that she would die young. “Everyone knows Russia’s for the depressed,” she would say, as she witnessed her circle of adolescent friends succumb, one by one, to a terrible cycle of drug addiction and suicidal despair. Her teenage world shifted, however, when she met her twin flame in Kimi Morev, a blond-haired boy with sensitive features that belie deep sorrows. Composed of personal footage shot over a decade, Syroechkovskaya’s moving documentary is both a hymn to a troubled soul and a portrait of a lost generation.</p><p>A sense of inevitable finality permeates through every frame of the film, which opens with Morev’s funeral in 2016. At the same time, Syroechkovskaya beautifully balances darkness with light. Her loving bond with Morev sparkles across the fuzzy camc

<p>When does a quilt stop being craft and start being art? It’s a question full of sexist overtones, writes the novelist <strong>Tracy Chevalier</strong>, but there’s a Swedish ‘third way’ that changes everything</p><p>The art versus craft debate is almost as old as the question: “What is art?” Boiled down to its gnarly, still disputable essence, art is created to make us think and feel, while craft is made to be used. A painting on a wall makes us ponder, whereas knitted scarves keep us warm, ceramic vases hold flowers upright and embroidered tablecloths cover tables.</p><p>Historically, art was made only by middle- and upper-class men. Outliers such as women, the working-class and minorities didn’t have the time or resources to learn to paint professionally. There were social as well as financial barriers: women weren’t allowed to study life drawing at the Royal Academy until the 1890s for fear they would see nudity. Craft, on the other hand, has always been available to more people

<p>This detailed biography complicates our perception of the bad boy of French art and illuminates his fraught friendship with Van Gogh</p><p>Sue Prideaux begins her biography of Paul Gauguin with an account of his long-lost teeth. Four of them were discovered in the year 2000 in a well near the site of his last bamboo hut in French Polynesia. The artist had secreted them there in a jar, for whatever reason, and investigation by the Human Genome Project proved them to be his. It was thought that the teeth might also offer conclusive evidence for the popular belief that Gauguin had been “the bad boy who spread syphilis around the South Seas”. But no trace of any treatments for the disease, arsenic or mercury, were discovered. “What other myths,” Prideaux asks, as she embarks on her reassessment of his life, “might we be holding on to?”</p><p>Prideaux is drawn to wild men as a writer; her previous biographies include award-winning lives of Edvard Munch and Friedrich Nietzsche.
