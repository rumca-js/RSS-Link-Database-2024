<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m sick and tired of the influx of AI-generated images that prop up when searching the web. Even when I look up specific keywords that should exclude AI-generated search results such as; “traditional Chinese sumi-e dragon”, I still get a bunch of AI-generated dragons, maybe some in a style similar to what the keywords would suggest. </p> <p>It’s not helpful and just results in me having to spend more time scouting through the ugly AI stuff. So please, does anyone have any way to permanently avoid this issue? I would be in your debt 🥹</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Outrageous-Active-85"> /u/Outrageous-Active-85 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1fcmlxz/ai_free_search_engine/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1fcmlxz/ai_free_search_engine/">[comments]</a></span>
