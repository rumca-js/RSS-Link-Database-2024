<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I’m a 4th-year CS student and web developer with experience in Python, Django, and DRF, primarily focusing on CRUD REST APIs. While I’ve worked with Django, I’ve mostly done projects with JavaScript and React.js, and now Next.js. This shift has made me forget some Django and DRF concepts.</p> <p>I’ve been assigned a project as a Backend Developer for a mobile app, which involves concepts like notifications, time scheduling, and AI chatbot integration—areas I haven’t worked with before. I see this as a great opportunity to learn and build at the same time.</p> <p>I’m looking to deepen my backend development skills with Django. I want to move beyond the beginner level and apply what I learn to real-world projects. I’m considering <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/django-python-advanced/?couponCode=ST17MT91224A">advanced Django courses on Udemy</a> but want to avoid getting stuck in tutorial hell. My goal is to build and deploy
