<p>Working from home has gone from being a growing trend to a full-scale phenomenon. There are many perks to a work-from-home arrangement, to be sure, but there can also be downsides: For example, there’s a good chance you’ll need to supply your own monitor. Fortunately, there are many great home office monitors to choose from, as I’ve discovered through extensive real-world testing.</p>



<p>Below you’ll find my picks for the best home office monitors, and below that you can learn more about what specs and features matter when shopping for a home office monitor.</p>

<p>This is a different Civ feel, one with the charm of <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/anno/117-pax-romana">Anno 117</a>. A city is not just symbolized here as in <em>Civilization VI</em>I with a few houses and landmarks, but we can see and feel it. We can drive to the harbor, where fishing boats are bringing in the next catch, while Egyptian warships patrol the coast.</p>

<p>Elgato has now launched its largest Stream Deck yet, the Elgato Stream Deck Studio. The live streaming tool features a whopping 32 programmable LCD buttons in two rows as well as a pair of rotary dials. This compares to Elgato’s original Stream Deck, which has 15 buttons. The Deck Studio, however, is intended specifically for professional users and traditional studio broadcasters. </p>



<p>The Elgato Stream Deck Studio measures almost half a meter in length and connects with a single USB-C input on the front. There are also two more USB-C ports on the back, one of which offers connection to a PC and another can be used to power the device instead of the Stream Deck Studio’s 25W Ethernet connection. It’s also possible to connect several Elgato Stream Deck Studios to each other. </p>

## How to stop Microsoft Teams from automatically launching at startup

<p>Microsoft Teams is Microsoft’s platform for business-oriented communication via chat, audio calls, and video calls. The service is part of Microsoft 365 and often comes already integrated with work PCs, especially if you’re part of a company that relies on Microsoft apps.</p>



<p>You might even find that Teams automatically opens whenever you boot or restart your computer. This could be helpful if you’re always on Teams and use it a lot… but what if you <em>don’t</em>? Maybe it’s slowing down your startup times and you want to disable this behavior.</p>



<p>Fortunately, you can. Here’s what you can do if you don’t want Microsoft Teams to automatically launch at startup.</p>

<p>I always love spotting great deals on power banks because I truly think they’re must-have accessories. Everyone deserves the peace of mind in knowing that their phones and laptops won’t die mid-day.</p>



<p>If you don’t have a power bank yet, here’s a solid one to start with: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Charger-Baseus-20000mAh-Charging/dp/B08THCNNCS/">Baseus’s 20,000mAh power bank is on sale for $41 on Amazon</a>, which is nearly half off its usual price. Pretty good for a high-capacity portable charger that’s still compact enough to carry around comfortably.</p>



<p>The 20,000mAh capacity is enough to fully charge an iPhone 15 or Galaxy S23 Ultra from zero to full over 3 times. It’s also enough to fully charge a dead MacBook Pro (yes, it’s great for laptops, too).</p>



<p>But this power bank isn’t just large — it’s also fast. It has a 6

<p>For PC gamers, Steam has been such a mainstay for so long now that it’s practically melded into the operating system itself. The thing is, Steam is more than just a market — it can do a lot more.</p>



<p>Just because you’ve used Steam a lot doesn’t mean you know everything about it. Valve has continued to update its flagship product over the years with several intriguing and downright useful features, and it’s a real shame that many of those features fly under the radar.</p>



<p>So, I dug through some of Valve’s recent announcements and explored the software from end to end. Here are some cool Steam features I found that you might’ve overlooked.</p>
