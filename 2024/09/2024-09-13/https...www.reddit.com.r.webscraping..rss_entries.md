<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m working on a project that requires searching across podcast episodes and I&#39;ve been playing with the listen notes API. I recently came across Taddy&#39;s Podcast API and it seems cheaper with fewer restrictions and a richer API. Has anyone actually used this? If so, please share your reasoning for using this over Listen Notes.</p> <p>I&#39;m mainly concerned about the recency and completeness of the data they provide. I&#39;ve tried Podcast Index as well but it looks like they only share links to the RSS feeds of the whole podcasts but I need episode-level searching like ListenNotes provides. Is the only option to use podcast index in this case, to scrape all of the data myself and then run search? </p> <p>Any advice would be appreciated!</p> <p>P.S : my previous post got removed for self-promotion but I promise I am not affiliated with any of these products I just want to choose one to use. Although in hindsight I understand how it looked
