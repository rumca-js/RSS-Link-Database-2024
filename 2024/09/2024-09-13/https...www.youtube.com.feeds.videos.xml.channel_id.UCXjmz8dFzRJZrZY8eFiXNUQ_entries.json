Lasting 12 seasons, with a successful spin-off in Young Sheldon, The Big Bang Theory had a reach most sitcoms can only dream of.  But going into Big Bang Theory's 3rd season, the show was at a tipping point.  They needed something fresh to round out the main characters and Bernadette Rostenkowski rode in to save the day.  Without Bernadette our main characters, specifically Howard, could have been doomed to circle the drain with the same tired tropes until it's eventual cancellation.  Luckily Bernadette saved The Big Bang Theory.\n\n#bernadetterostenkowski #thebigbangtheory #youngsheldon #sheldoncooper \n\nSOURCES\nhttps://screenrant.com/big-bang-theory-how-bernie-almost-didnt-happen/\nhttps://collider.com/big-bang-theory-best-character-bernadette/\nhttps://www.thethings.com/big-bang-theory-creator-bill-prady-revealed-adding-mayim-bialik-and-melissa-rauch-were-not-part-of-the-plan/", "id": 1140894, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoeWLkkw4aY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXjmz8dFzRJZrZY8eFiXNUQ", "source_obj__id": 236, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/HoeWLkkw4aY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "How THIS Character Solved Big Bang's Biggest Problem", "vote": 0}]
