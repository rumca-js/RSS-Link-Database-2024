It has been touted as the world’s fastest-growing combat sport and, simultaneously, an ancient practice whose origins have been lost to prehistory.

Bare-knuckle boxing is exactly what it sounds like. Two fighters enter a ring without gloves and, over a series of two-minute rounds, attempt to punch the other athlete into unconsciousness

<p>The chaos element of the populist right disrupts France’s weary liberal regime, in a novel of sadness and eerie serenity that marks a new direction</p><p>French novelist Michel Houellebecq’s last novel, 2019’s <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/serotonin-9781250758088/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article">Serotonin</a>, practically dared the reader to abandon it.
