Bananas are (slightly) radioactive. The banana equivalent dose (BED) is a measurement of radiation. It&#8217;s definitely not enough to hurt you. When we think about risk, the BED is a useful way to find perspective. Is the exposure this new thing will cause on the order of a banana? If so, perhaps we shouldn&#8217;t worry [&#8230;]
