TCP/IP is the network protocol that makes the Internet and modern networking function, but even experienced coders may ask, "what's a default gateway?".

This class will teach the basic concepts of TCP/IP so that coders understand why it matters, and how it works. We'll discuss everything from what an IP Address is, to Name Resolution, TCP Ports, and a whole bunch more.

The class will go over:
- Basic Concept of the Ethernet Standard
- IP and MAC Addresses
- Understanding Subnets
- DHCP
- Ethernet and TCP/IP Hardware
- TCP Ports
- DNS and Reverse DNS
- Understanding URL's
- PING, TRACEROUTE, IP and ARP Commands
- Virtual Hosts in Apache and Web Servers
- and more....
