<p>The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) has announced a breakthrough in artificial intelligence hardware by developing a brain-inspired neuromorphic computing platform. Capable of storing and processing data across 16,500 conductance states in a molecular film, this new platform represents a dramatic leap over traditional digital systems, which are limited to just two states (on and off).</p>



<p>Sreetosh Goswami, assistant professor at the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE), IISc, who led the research team that developed this platform, said that with this discovery, the team has been able to nail down several unsolved challenges that have been lingering in the field of neuromorphi

<p>OpenAI said its project Strawberry has graduated to a new family of large language models (LLMs) that the company has christened OpenAI o1.</p>



<p>The new family of models, which also includes an o1-mini version for cost efficiency, according to the company, can be differentiated from the latest <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3484668/openai-releases-new-version-of-gpt-4o-via-azure.html">GPT-4o models</a> basis their reasoning abilities.</p>



<p>“We’ve developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond. They can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math,” the company wrote

<p>American companies have unwittingly hired hundreds — maybe thousands — of North Korean workers for remote IT positions, according to the US Department of Justice, the FBI, the US State Department, and cybersecurity companies.</p>



<p>The sophisticated scheme, perpetrated by the North Korean government for years, partly funds that country’s weapons program in violation of US sanctions. </p>



<p>Agents working for the North Korean government use stolen identities of US citizens, create convincing resumes with generative AI (genAI) tools, and make AI-generated photos for their online profiles.</p>

<li>Multitasking really is a whole new game on a device like this, and that opens the door to some incredibly interesting ways to get stuff done on the go.</li>



<li>Part of that is undoubtedly tied to the phone’s folding form — but part of it is <em>also</em> a result of the Android-based <em>software </em>enhancements Google’s built in
