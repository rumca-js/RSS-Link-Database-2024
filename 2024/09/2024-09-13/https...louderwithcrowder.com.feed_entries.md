Unclear how many people born in Springfield end up in $100 million mansions but that’s neither here nor there. </p><p>Legend cannot physically comprehend what living paycheck to paycheck is like, let alone in poverty. Additionally, he has the means to pack up and move anywhere he pleases with the snap of his fingers.

It's not about memes and trending on social media. It's about voter contact and registering new voters. And if these numbers coming out of Pennsylvania and North Carolina indicate how Trump is doing in the other swing states, he is in an amazing spot right now.</p><p>CNN's Harry Eten explained why Kamala is desperate for the Taylor Swift endorsement to pay off. Harris is doing worse with young voters than Biden at this time. Democrats hope the youths will vote for Kamala because their favor

Or about the next debate that isn't happening and why. On Thursday, Donald Trump said there won't be a third debate. On Thursday morning, a puff piece praising debate moderator Linsey Davis accidentally(?) said the quiet part out loud about why she and David Muir ganged up on Trump.</p><p>Trump said there would be no third debate, which is a smart move. As Scott Jennings said, the next moderators would be worse.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitte
