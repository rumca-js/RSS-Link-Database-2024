<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A lot of games that involve percise physical dexterity (categorized on BGG as &quot;Action / Dexterity&quot;) get a bad wrap for being either &quot;juvenile&quot; and toy-like, or mindless party games, which is really too bad. We have a few outstanding members like <strong>Cube Quest</strong> or the recently kick-started <strong>KUGO</strong> and <strong>The Flames of Fafnir</strong>, the latter which is more involved than being solely a dexterity game.</p> <p>Playing with younger members, I enjoy games like <strong>Super Mario Blow Up! Shaky Tower Balancing Game</strong>, <strong>The Fuzzies</strong>, and the classic <strong>Don&#39;t Break the Ice<em>. With a casual adult audience, *</em>Jenga</strong> is a classic (we have The Donkey Kong Collector&#39;s Edition that adds some extra elements of gameplay, but really doesn&#39;t add too much and leans a bit on randomness for sure - still good fun for a casual time).

You actually can play it like Catan and trade resources at anytime. I can ask to trade my stone for some wood or even promise to gather a resource for a trade. You can even trade money, cards or future actions. Definitely has moved up my list. I am looking forward to playing today with a few others I get together with every friday.

We already have Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, Runebound, Heat and Gloomhaven. </p> <p>We loved Heat especially and found it very fun playing against bots together AND I also enjoyed it at 5 players</p> <p>So I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a game like Heat that handles low and high player counts equally well?

I was shocked that such gem is out of print, let alone published in other languages (I know the game is kinda out of date but it&#39;s an absolute blast - a Munchkin-like game with the same cool design and lots of stuff other than cards to play). Since it&#39;s impossible for me to ship a real copy to my country (due to political reasons) I decided to find a digital one in order to print it out, translate it to make it understandable for my friends, and enjoy playing. To my utter disappointment, I&#39;ve found nothing more than some pictures of game parts on eBay and a PDF with rules.

You are ONLY allowed to ask for a card based off of certain conditions about your own cards (I don&#39;t really remember those conditions, like same half of the suit maybe?). </p> <p>And if the person that you ask for the card has the card, then you get it? And if you have all of the cards in the same half suit, then you can reveal it put it down., and make your hand smaller.</p> <p>The entire goal of the game, if I remember correctly is to correctly guess all the cards that your team has. </p> <p>What is this game called?
