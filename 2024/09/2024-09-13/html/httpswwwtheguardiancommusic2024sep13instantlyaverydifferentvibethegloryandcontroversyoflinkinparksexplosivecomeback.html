On Wednesday the group played their first full-length concert since 2017, at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, and they play London’s O2 Arena on 24 September. The comeback has been concocted under a level of secrecy to rival even that Oasis reunion, with band members, crew and venues being sworn to silence.</p></pre></div></body></html>
