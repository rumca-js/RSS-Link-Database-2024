Since this is my first post in this subreddit, I don't know under which Flair "Hardware" should be put. Which the SSD-prices massively increasing (reference: Samsung 980 1TB doubled its price in few months) and AI potentially worsening this <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/SSD-demand-explodes-due-to-AI-server-9835287.html">trend</a>, I recently found myself comparing specifications of QLC- vs TLC-SSDs. So, why do QLC-SSDs seem great for selfhosting? The main weaknesses of QLC (in my eyes) are lower reliability and slow write speeds. However, readspeeds and random I/O are often on favorable levels. However, like most SSDs, QLC-SSDs makes up for slow writes by using pseudoSLC-Cache, with the size usually in neighborhood of 10 to 20 GB. At some point I realized that during everyday use, I very rarely find myself in the situation of having more for 10 or so Gb of constant writes on my drive and if </p></div></pre></div></body></html>
