Blessed with the most enticing and charming streets of a medieval old town that meanders upwards in car-free bliss, on the way have lunch at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ristorantelaciotolasanremo">La Ciotola</a> (Via S Stefano 4) where the ravioli is homemade and superb. San Remo has a brilliant market where you can buy anything from essential undies to bagfuls of chilli with the tongue-in-cheek claim that it is <em>meglio del viagra</em> (better than Viagra).
