It consisted of 5 core players but over time when one couldn't make it one of the five would ask if they could bring their sibling or s/o to sit in for the missing one. Now it's to the point that everybody wants to play and we have 7/8 players but I don't feel like playing Captain Sonar every single time</p> <p>I've played with the idea of running two games at the same time but I don't know how well this would be received, has anybody done this before for their game nights? </p> <p>Or do you guys just straight up uninvite people?</p> <p>Or am I not thinking of a different solution?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/INeedAUserName89"> /u/INeedAUserName89 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fg07qy/too_many_players/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/commen</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/commen</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
