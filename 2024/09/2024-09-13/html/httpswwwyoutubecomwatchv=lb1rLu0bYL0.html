He's worked more than 15 years as a developer everywhere from Germany banking sector to London's tech startup scene. He's now a dev rel for hire and runs several open source projects.

We talk about:
Eddie's journey into open source
How he built his reputation through hackathons
How he leveraged his network to find his first freelance clients
His audio-video setup for filming tutorials

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's the theme from a 1982 police show.
