I recently came across Taddy's Podcast API and it seems cheaper with fewer restrictions and a richer API. Has anyone actually used this? If so, please share your reasoning for using this over Listen Notes.</p> <p>I'm mainly concerned about the recency and completeness of the data they provide. I've tried Podcast Index as well but it looks like they only share links to the RSS feeds of the whole podcasts but I need episode-level searching like ListenNotes provides. Is the only option to use podcast index in this case, to scrape all of the data myself and then run search? </p> <p>Any advice would be appreciated!</p> <p>P.S : my previous post got removed for self-promotion but I promise I am not affiliated with any of these products I just want to choose one to use. Although in hindsight I understand how it looked </p></div></pre></div></body></html>
