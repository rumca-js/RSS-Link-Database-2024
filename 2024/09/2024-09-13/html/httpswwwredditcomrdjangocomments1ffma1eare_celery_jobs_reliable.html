I have a scheduled task in fastapi to do a few python things every hour. Currently, it's been working great for me.</p> <p>Looking to scale up my project and just wondering if celery is a reliable solution. I'll probably be using cookiecutter-django since it's built in and should workfor this project, but just wondering if celery is the right choice for this. It's important that it runs every hour.</p> <p>Any advice would be appreciated, Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/5800X3D"> /u/5800X3D </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1ffma1e/are_celery_jobs_reliable/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1ffma1e/are_celery_jobs_reliable/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
