Would it be possible to scrape multiple websites and all their associated pages for specific key terms and if that term is present to return the URL for the page In which it appears? Any pointers would be appreciated as this seems relatively doable but I’m unsure if I’m missing any potential problems that would prevent this being viable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ganjamun99"> /u/Ganjamun99 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fg1dex/we_scraping_for_specific_key_terms/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fg1dex/we_scraping_for_specific_key_terms/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
