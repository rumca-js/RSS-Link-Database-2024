Ok the conservative PiS is once again not doing its job. Not surprised, will get better with the new government.</p> <p>New government comes, the Minister of Health sends the guidelines and what's the response?</p> <p>"Only the proper medical companies can make guidelines and when the government does it it's pressuring doctors"</p> <p>I'm fucking sorry, WHAT!?</p> <p>This was the statement of the Supreme Medical Council. So what as all that "We have no guidelines from the government" bs when PiS was in charge?</p> <p>Is the Council lying? Or are they just that incompetent?&lt;</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
