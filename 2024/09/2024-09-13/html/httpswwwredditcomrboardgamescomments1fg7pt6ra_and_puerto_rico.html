I heard good things about both, but I'm not sure I want to get both. </p> <p>Does Ra provide some replayability ? My 1st concern would be that we're pretty much done after 2 or 3 games. Is it pretty casual? Could try bringing it to family gatherings. </p> <p>I'm leaning more towards Ra because I don't own any auction game, and I've heard that while puerto rico was excellent at the time, there are newer, better experiences out nowadays, but I'm still open to getting it as well. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Useful_Nocebo"> /u/Useful_Nocebo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fg7pt6/ra_and_puerto_rico/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fg7pt6/ra_and_puerto_rico/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
