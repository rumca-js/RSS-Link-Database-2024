Maybe someone here knows?</p> <p>Fixing Unmapped Folders After Moving to a New Server</p> <p>Hey all, I recently moved Radarr from a Windows 11 PC to a Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE) server. I have Radarr up and running and exported/imported my settings. For the most part, it looks good and is working well.</p> <p>I did some Linux gymnastics, mounted my movies drive from the Windows PC (I'm keeping Plex there for now), and added it as my root media folder. But now I'm showing 5,700 unmapped folders. Mapping them manually isn't a viable option for so many movies. It crashes the browser tab and would take way too long.</p> <p>When I open the folder to look at the mappings, the vast majority of movies show as existing. I want to link the existing movies in Radarr with the updated root directory location.</p> <p>Any suggestions to fix this?</p> </div>&lt;!-- SC_ON</pre></div></body></html>
