I expect that most of the time he will play it with me or by himself (he has friends but they don't come over that often), so I want to it to work at 1-2 players, but at the same time I want to be able to play it with my board game group (5-6 people). </p> <p>He's young but can already handle more complex games so difficulty is not a big issue. We already have Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, Runebound, Heat and Gloomhaven. </p> <p>We loved Heat especially and found it very fun playing against bots together AND I also enjoyed it at 5 players</p> <p>So I'm wondering if there's a game like Heat that handles low and high player counts equally well? Would be great if it was co-op or with only light competition like Heat (he can be a sore loser sometimes) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.co">https://www.reddit.co</a></pre></div></body></html>
