Ideally, this would generate a visual map of our organization that clearly outlines the hierarchy, from C-level executives down to entry-level positions.</p> <p>I’d also like to have the functionality to click on each employee’s node in this map to access additional information about them, similar to the interconnectedness found in second brain software.</p> <p>If you know of any open source tools that meet these requirements or if you have other suggestions, I’d be grateful for your recommendations!</p> <p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/a">https://www.reddit.com/user/a</a></pre></div></body></html>
