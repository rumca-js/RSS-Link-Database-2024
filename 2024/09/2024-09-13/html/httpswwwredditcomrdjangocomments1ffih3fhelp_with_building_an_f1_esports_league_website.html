The platform will allow users to register, participate in races, view league standings, and more. I’m using Django for the backend and am excited to bring this idea to life, but I could really use some advice and guidance on a few things: </p> <ol> <li><p>User Registration and Profiles: I want users to create accounts, join leagues, and manage their own profiles. How can I handle custom profiles for users (e.g., race statistics, team affiliation)? </p></li> <li><p>Race Scheduling and Results: What’s the best way to design a system for race scheduling and results entry? Should I have separate models for races and results, or is there a better approach? </p></li> <li><p>Live Leaderboards: I want a leaderboard that updates with each race, showing points and rankings. Are there any resources or techniques for building real-time leaderboa</p></li></ol></div></pre></div></body></html>
