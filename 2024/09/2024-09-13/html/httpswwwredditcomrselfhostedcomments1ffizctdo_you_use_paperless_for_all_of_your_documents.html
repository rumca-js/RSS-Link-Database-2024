For example, education a related material is easy to put into a folder structure by semester.</p> <p>There's no harm in putting it in paperless, EXCEPT if there's ever a problem with the application and you need a file for something time-sensitive. Then you'd need to manually find a file in the ./media folder which could be a nightmare.</p> <p>So, are you putting everything in paperless? Are there any documents you prefer to keep with a folder structure? Just looking to get some other perspectives!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FiziksMayMays"> /u/FiziksMayMays </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ffizct/do_you_use_paperless_for_all_of_your_documents/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://ww</span>">https://ww</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
