Not only did he face a rapid turnaround from his run to the US Open semi-finals, this has been an unusually gruelling summer with the Olympics and numerous surface changes. Every other singles semi-finalist, male and female, chose to rest this week.</p><p>In his first experience of leading Great Britain’s Davis Cup team as its No 1 player, the challenge proved to be a step too far for Draper as he was outplayed 7-6 (5), 7-5 by an inspired Francisco Cerúndolo, who spent two hours firing outlandish forehand winners to every line on the court. His win gave Argentina a 2-0 victory against Great Britain.</p> &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/13/jack-draper-beate">https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/13/jack-draper-beate</a></pre></div></body></html>
