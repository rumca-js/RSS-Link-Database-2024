The villain, who was created in 2018 by writer Donny Cates and artist Ryan Stegman, is making his first live-action appearance. And both creators would very much like to be paid for that.</p><p>On social media, <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanStegman/status/1834224424557384105">Stegman noted</a> that he had not received any advance notice about Knull's cinematic debut while jokingly speaking about what he would use his share of the money for the character's appearance.</p><div><blockquote><p>lol &lt;a href="htt</p></blockquote></div></pre></div></body></html>
