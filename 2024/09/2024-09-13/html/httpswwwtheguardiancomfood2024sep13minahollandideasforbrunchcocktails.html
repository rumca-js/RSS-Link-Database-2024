He was referring to his portmanteau of the words “breakfast” and “lunch”, of course, but I love the idea of brunch as a corruption. It is, after all, a meal with an edge; a louche late start made possible by the weekend, and the acceptable face of drinking before noon.</p><p>Beringer made the point that brunch enables you “to prolong your Saturday nights, heedless of that moral ‘last train’”. It starts later, for a start, with more “solid attributes” on the menu than breakfast. He was writing, of course, for the hungover. So, what to drink at brunch? It makes sense that cocktails have become traditional, especially those that combine the enlivening properties of juice with the fuel of alcohol, such as the mimosa or the bloody mary.</p> &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/sep/13/mina-">https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/sep/13/mina-</a></pre></div></body></html>
