<p>The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) has announced a breakthrough in artificial intelligence hardware by developing a brain-inspired neuromorphic computing platform. Capable of storing and processing data across 16,500 conductance states in a molecular film, this new platform represents a dramatic leap over traditional digital systems, which are limited to just two states (on and off).</p>
<p>Sreetosh Goswami, assistant professor at the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE), IISc, who led the research team that developed this platform, said that with this discovery, the team has been able to nail down several unsolved challenges that have been lingering in the field of neuromorphi</p></div></div></div></div></pre></div></body></html>
