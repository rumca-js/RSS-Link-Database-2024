The application will include Google Maps integration, and data access will be role-based. Additionally, it will feature JWT-based authorization, along with login and logout functionality.</p> <p>I have experience working with Django, primarily from building an user management system where I managed most of the functionality through the admin panel, which worked well for that project.</p> <p>However, I’m currently struggling with the front-end design of my new project. Is it possible to use a theme for this? If so, how can I implement one? I would really appreciate any recommendations for tutorials that focus on modern design for Django applications.</p> <p>While I’ve used admin panel themes before, I’m unfamiliar with applying themes to other parts of a Django project. Any guidance would be helpful!-</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &amp;#32</pre></div></body></html>
