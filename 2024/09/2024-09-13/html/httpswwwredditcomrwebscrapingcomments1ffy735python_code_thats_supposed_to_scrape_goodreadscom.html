For reference, I'll paste the code below, if someone could let me know what I've been doing wrong, I would highly appreciate it. </p> <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: this has also been posted in <a href="/r/learnpython">r/learnpython</a>, but I haven't received any input yet. </p> <pre><code>import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import json from datetime import datetime import argparse # This, in theory, extracts the first 3 reviews per book def get_top_reviews(book_url): review_list = [] try: print(f"Fetching reviews from {book_url}.</code></pre></div></pre></div></body></html>
