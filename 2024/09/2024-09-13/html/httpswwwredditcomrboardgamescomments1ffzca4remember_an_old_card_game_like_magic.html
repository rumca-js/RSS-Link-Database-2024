I wanted to find and old card game I played. When I was a child (2008 - 2015) I had a card game like magic, it had a book showing a lot of characters like monters, assassins and so on. I remember it had two factions one red and evil and one blue and good. But I don't remember anything else</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/YosuLpng"> /u/YosuLpng </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ffzca4/remember_an_old_card_game_like_magic/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ffzca4/remember_an_old_card_game_like_magic/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
