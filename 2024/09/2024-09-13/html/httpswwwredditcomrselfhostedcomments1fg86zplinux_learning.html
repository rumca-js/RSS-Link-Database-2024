I SSH into it. Still testing, probably been a month and a bit now.</p> <p>Anyway. I got to the point I want to up the 2TB internal drive I have installed. I never really understood the Linux file system like I do Windows. I'm only just starting to learn Linux. I just couldn't picture it in my head until now.</p> <p>I'm running CasaOS for the Jellyfin setup and it seems nice and easy. Currently have small SSD for the server install, an internal drive and 2 USB drives attached. I've decided I want a 4TB drive I have in the machine, so I've hooked that up via USB while its in a dock.</p> <p>I know I can copy from with CasaOS but it gives you no feedback on where its got so wanted to do it in the Linux Terminal. Worked out the commands so I can get feedback. Unlike Windows, I now realise each drive is in its own folder, so its like one big folder system instead of drive letters</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
