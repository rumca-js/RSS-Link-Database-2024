Are there any other OS' that are similar in usability for a newbie mostly looking to run a minecraft server and maybe explore linux?</p> <p>my primary issue with the PC running windows for a minecraft server is that i cant seem to have more than one edition of java installed at a time, meaning i can only have one minecraft version server at a time, and to swap i need to uninstall the current one and reinstall the new one and i can NOT be bothered to do all that.</p> <p>The PC also isnt connected to a monitor, keyboard, or mouse. i think its only connected to power </p></div></pre></div></body></html>
