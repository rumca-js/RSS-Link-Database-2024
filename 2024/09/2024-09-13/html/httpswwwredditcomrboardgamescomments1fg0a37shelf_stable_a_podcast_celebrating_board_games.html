Adjacent themes that sometimes come up include: trying before you buy, thrifting / buying used, communal game libraries, and sustainable practices in the industry. We also just talk a lot about what we've been playing with a focus on fun stories as opposed to reviewing the games.</p> <p>If that sounds like something you might enjoy, please give us a listen and let us know what you think. Shelf Stable is available in most major podcast apps including Spotify and Apple Podcasts:</p> <p><a href="https://shelfstable.libsyn.com/">https://shelfstable.libsyn.com/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kata124"> /u/kata124 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fg0a37/shelf_stable_a_podcast_celebrating_board_games/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comm</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comm</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
