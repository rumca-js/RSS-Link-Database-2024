It was pretty mediocre in my opinion. We played a couple games last night and I just realized though it is a negotiation game at its core. I just assumed you could only bribe other players. You actually can play it like Catan and trade resources at anytime. I can ask to trade my stone for some wood or even promise to gather a resource for a trade. You can even trade money, cards or future actions. Definitely has moved up my list. I am looking forward to playing today with a few others I get together with every friday. Maybe it will work or maybe fall flat. We shall see.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tetrach"> /u/tetrach </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ffxjhq/archipelago/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
