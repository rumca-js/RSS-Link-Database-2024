The rules say that I would then get a 2nd larvae and therefore die, but this seems super harsh? I'm effectively being killed by 1 larvae. </p> <p>What incentive would I have to ever scan my contamination cards if I've already got a larvae on my board? I should then always try to get to surgery right? </p> <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/East_Pickle_9342"> /u/East_Pickle_9342 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ffrtrq/nemesis_rules_larvae_infection_rules/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://</span>">https://</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
