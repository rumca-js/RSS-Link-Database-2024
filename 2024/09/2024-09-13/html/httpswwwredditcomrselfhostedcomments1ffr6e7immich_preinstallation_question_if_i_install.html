I know that it's not the best thing to do, but I don't have space for a unix server with all the HDD that I have for Plex, and I also use my Windows PC every day... so the unix server would be another computer that PC that consumes energy.</p> <p><strong>So, my question is, if I install Immich how I said, then can I use a folder on my Windows PC where I have my photos &amp; videos stored? Do I have to do something on the unix host like "network folder" on windows?</strong></p> <p>Thank you, and sorry for the obvious question but I'm not so expert on unix :) </p> &lt;/di</div></pre></div></body></html>
