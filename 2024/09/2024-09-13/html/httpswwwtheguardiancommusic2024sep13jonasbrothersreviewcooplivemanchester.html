As with the Eras Tour, the show is a career-spanning retrospective with a set neatly partitioned by specific albums. Some might call it plagiarism. Others may call it smart; why not give it a try given how there’s bound to be a crossover of fans? Whichever way you fall, one thing that’s certain is just how entertaining it is.</p><p>When it comes to the set list, the Jonas Brothers actually have Swift beat: tonight, the trio perform more than 60 songs from across their six albums (Swift manages about 45), whizzing through numbers in medleys with such exhilarating speed that by the time you’ve recognised the chorus of one, they’ve moved on to another.&lt;/</p></pre></div></body></html>
