Just got hold of Typewriter from the Kickstarter campaign and noticed a couple of light scratches on a couple of token keys, this could just be bad luck from production but it made wonder if i could get a spray or something to protect them from future scratches.</p> <p>Has anyone had any luck doing this before maybe with sprays or otherwise? I’ve seen some images of worn or plastic tokens from Quacks of Quedlinburg and want to preemptively avoid it if I can and I don’t want coin capsules. I should say I have no evidence these tokens won’t stand the test of time </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rja1985"> /u/rja1985 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fg2efd/protecting_acrylic_tokens/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fg2efd/protecting_acrylic_tokens/">[c</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
