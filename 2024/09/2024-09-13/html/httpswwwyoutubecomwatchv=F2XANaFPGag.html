Transformers One’s core duo of Orion Pax and D-16 and the fallout of their broken friendship provide an occasional spark, but despite the efforts of its impressive voice cast and a standout performance from Brian Tyree Henry, this animated origin story rarely shows anything more than meets the eye. Its G1-inspired aesthetic is cool in small doses, but Transformers One regularly fumbles trying to follow its transforming robots through the action. Though the tragedy of Optimus Prime and Megatron’s storied rivalry could have felt larger than life, Transformers One is mostly content with half-hearted puns and barely legible Cybertronian battles that could have used some major transforming before rolling out.</pre></div></body></html>
