We're not expecting to get close to MSRP, so don't be shy. I'd rather it went to a good home than get scrapped for its RAM and recycled. </p> <p>Shipping is TBD, the boss wants us to sell to a US based person on Ebay because of scams, but I can sell directly to an international buyer who is an active or trusted member of this group or a few like it.</p> <p>Cheers!</p> <p>Shipping is ~30 for CONUS, and $100ish to western Europe.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bitwise_Gamgee"> /u/Bitwise_Gamgee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1fftwv9/milkv_pioneer_one_on_fleabay_if_anyone_is_looking/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1fftwv9/milkv_pioneer_one_on_fleabay_if_anyone_</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1fftwv9/milkv_pioneer_one_on_fleabay_if_anyone_</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
