The river is already in emergency flood stage; sirens went off at 8 PM to indicate this, and the river has risen by more than 80 CM in the last three hours. We may very well beat 1997, and even if we don't, we are likely to lose our main bridge and its temporary replacement in addition to widespread damage elsewhere. The crest is expected to reach us sometime Sunday.</p> <p>Basically, towns anywhere near the Czech border may end up with similar accounts. Jelenia Góra is also being flooded.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vip_year_doll_eye"> /u/Vi</a></td></tr></table></pre></div></body></html>
