If it's freebies you're after, the Epic Games Store has another bunch for you to add to your calendar, with acclaimed photography puzzler Toem and zombie rogue-like The Last Stand: Aftermath both now confirmed to be getting the freebie treatment next week.
</p><p>
Starting with Toem, it's a game of chill beats and quirky characters that sees players setting off on an expedition across a gloriously presented black-and-white world. Along the way, there are gentle problems to solve, all requiring creative use of your camera.
</p><p>Christian Donlan called Toem a "cheerful modern classic" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toem-review-a-photography-puzzler-and-a-journey-filled-with-lovely-moments">his Essential review</a>, championing its "playful challenges and a warm sense of place".
