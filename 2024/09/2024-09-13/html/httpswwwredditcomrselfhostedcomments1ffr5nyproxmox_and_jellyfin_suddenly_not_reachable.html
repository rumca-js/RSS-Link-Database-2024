Interestingly enough the tailscale exit node seems to be working fine and it's installed on the same SSD as proxmox. (Which may be relevant since my hdd jellyfin is installed on seems to make weird noises). The IP Adresses also don't seem to be reassigned since at least the IP Adresses of Proxmox and Tailscale show up as devices in my router. Does anybody have an idea what could've happened or how I could troubleshoot this? Thanks in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BroVival"> /u/BroVival </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ffr5ny/proxmox_and_jellyfin_suddenly_not_reachable/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ffr5ny/proxmox_and_</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ffr5ny/proxmox_and_</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
