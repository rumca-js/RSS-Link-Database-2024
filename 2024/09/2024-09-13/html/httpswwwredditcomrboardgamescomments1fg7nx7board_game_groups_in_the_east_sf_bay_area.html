I'm also open to starting a group at my place, but preferably would jump into something established.</p> <p>I'm 37, professional SF based work, with moderate experience playing games. Happy to chip in and bring food, beer, etc. My fiance also started playing recently and she may be open to coming along at times, space permitting.</p> <p>Anyone looking for a new member?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ezekielwhiskey"> /u/ezekielwhiskey </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fg7nx7/board_game_groups_in_the_east_sf_bay_area/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fg7nx7/board_game_groups_in_the_east_sf_bay_area/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
