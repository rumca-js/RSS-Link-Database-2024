Matrix and Owncloud doesn't share IP and I've opened all the ports that the services uses.</p> <p>I've also got a domain pointing to my public IP.</p> <p>Now. Matrix server is running fine, except for problem nr1</p> <p>* I cant use the matrix service if i'm on my local network, it runs fine if Im using for exemple cellular or vpn, I guess that's becuase Im contacting my service from the same Ip that the service use.</p> <p>* I can't log in to the synapse server, if I write my IP for the server or the domain name, it leads me to the pfsense admin page&lt;/p</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
