I came across Taiga and Openproject but before I sink time into these I would rather take some input from people who have some experience üòÅ.</p> <p>I would like to track some Due Diligence activity and then Integration work flows (after an acquisition is done). That means people from different teams doing different jobs at the same time (or sequentially as some jobs will need previous jobs to be completed). Ideally the work flows should be visualized as a Gantt chart.</p> <p>Anything better than the 2 I mentioned for this task? </p> <p>Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Choubix"> /u/Choubix </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ffox75/project_management/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ffox75/project_management/">[comments]&lt;/</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
