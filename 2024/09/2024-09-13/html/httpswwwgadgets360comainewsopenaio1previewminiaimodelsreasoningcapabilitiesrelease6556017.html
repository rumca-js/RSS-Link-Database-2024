The AI firm is calling these reasoning models for their advanced capabilities in solving mathematical and complex reasoning-based problems. There are two models — o1 which is available in preview, and o1-mini — in this iteration. The company said these AI models were trained to spend time thinking before they respond, similar to humans.</pre></div></body></html>
