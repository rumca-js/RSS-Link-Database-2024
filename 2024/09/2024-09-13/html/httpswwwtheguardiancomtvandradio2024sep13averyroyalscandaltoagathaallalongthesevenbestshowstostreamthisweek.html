Whether the world really needs another interpretation of Emily Maitlis’s 2019 interview with Prince Andrew is a fair question. But the background to the story is nicely rendered here. Wilson’s Maitlis is driven but brittle, straining against BBC propriety. Sheen, meanwhile, plays Andrew as a superficially avuncular but petulant and buffoonish individual whose lack of moral or practical purpose has left him twisting dangerously in the wind. The performances make overlooking the familiarity of the story just about worthwhile. <br/><em>Prime Video, from Thursday 19 September</em>&lt;</p></pre></div></body></html>
