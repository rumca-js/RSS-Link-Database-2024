Now I've got the tough decision between Game Toppers' cool, printed designs vs AllPlay's slightly thicker, uniform color design. Does anyone have experience with both? </p> <p>AllPlay says their edge stitching is inset so you can slide cards off of them easily. And they're 5mm thick. </p> <p>Game Toppers' mats are 3mm thick and have great designs, but they're about $20 higher and I don't know if they have inset stitching. </p> <p>Thanks in advance for any advice! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PantsUnderUnderpants"> /u/PantsUnderUnderpants </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ffmzkl/game_toppers_mat_vs_allplay_mat/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ffmzkl/game_toppers_mat_vs_allplay_mat/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
