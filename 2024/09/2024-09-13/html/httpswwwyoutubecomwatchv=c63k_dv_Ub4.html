The trailer also reveals Evotinction's theme song, "A Normal Life," performed by Donna Burke (known for tracks from the Metal Gear Solid series). Evotinction is available now on Steam, PS5 (PlayStation 5), and PS4 (PlayStation 4). 

Near future, in a remote research facility named HERE, the AI system controlling the facility got infected by a virus called RED, and subsequently went rogue, starting to attack humans. Dr. Liu decides to infiltrate this lost facility on his own to face the AI, uncover the truth, and save humanity.
