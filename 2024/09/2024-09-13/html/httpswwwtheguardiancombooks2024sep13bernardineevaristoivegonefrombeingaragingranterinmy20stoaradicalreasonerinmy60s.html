 I loved the novel Ballet Shoes by Noel Streatfeild, which I read when I was about nine. It was the only book I owned for many years as we couldn’t afford them. I relied on Woolwich library, but sadly the books had to be returned. I think Ballet Shoes spoke to me because it was about three sisters who felt like outsiders, and who lived in a large, eccentric home full of people, including boarders. Likewise, I grew up feeling like an outsider in a large eccentric house with eight children and two parents, as well as boarders– at one stage a family of 13 from Goa stayed with us – in the two attic rooms.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><br/>
