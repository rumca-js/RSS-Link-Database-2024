I originally was just kinda looking at Valheim, but I thought being able to switch games around might be nice. When I originally asked someone on <a href="/r/valheim">r/valheim</a> directed me <a href="https://www.valheimgame.com/support/a-guide-to-dedicated-servers/">here </a>which looks specific to Valheim. It got me wondering how I would do it for other games like Astroneer, Satisfactory, or Minecraft. I probably won't have more than 1 or 2 running at a time, but I would like to know how it would work for more than that as well, or just how to swap them around so we can easily switch games when we're done with them.</p> <p>I have two old laptops.
