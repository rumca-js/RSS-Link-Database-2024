Also playing Space Marine 2. I just finished reading Horus Rising as I remembered seeing that's a good place to start but something about starting there doesn't feel right. It feels like I've been dropped in the middle of everything with no good clear introduction to the universe. I was just wondering if there was a better book to start with. I already know a fair bit from the videos so I understood everything in Horus Rising, it just feels like a weird starting point is all. Is there a book where we get introduced to the universe and the primarchs and different legions and such or is Horus Rising just where I should continue from?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Just_Delta-">https://www.reddit.com/user/Just_Delta-</a></pre></div></body></html>
