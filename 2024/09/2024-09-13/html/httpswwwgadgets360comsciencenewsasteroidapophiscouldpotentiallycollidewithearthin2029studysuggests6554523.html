Although current data points to a safe pass, the risk remains, especially if another space object were to strike Apophis. The odds are extremely low, but a final verdict wonâ€™t be available until 2027, when Apophis comes back into view. This discovery raises new questions about asteroid impacts and how unpredictable space collisions can be.</pre></div></body></html>
