I'm not too unhappy with this setup as it gets the job done and has an easy to use web ui. However I'm rebuild one of my proxmox hosts right now and was wondering whether it makes sense to redesign my whole lab and isolate it from the consumer part of my network.</p> <p>Now I know there is multiple tools out there to get the job done and one that I've played with a little is OpnSense. Don't get me wrong I like it, but its bloated and complex and I'm not sure whether between Satisfactory 1.0 and my wife there is enough time to dick around too much with a full blown OpnSense.</p> <p>Are there similar tools just for DHCP out there? Something with a nice web interface to manage things? The cherry on top would be that it integrates with proxmox, but at the moment I'm just evaluating what</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
