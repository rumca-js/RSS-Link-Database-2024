I’m primarily interested in the ease adding new icons/links and groups. Dashy has been great for me but it could be a little easier when it comes to adding stuff and making changes.</p> <p>One thing I’m really looking for (potentially separate from Dashy or Glance) is something that I can use as my browser’s new tab/home page that just shows me lots of icons (and a simple “+” icon for adding new ones) for getting to sites I go to a lot. I have this currently (using Brave) in the default New Tab page - but it’s limited to just a few icons/links; I’d like something without limits. Groups would be very desirable as would the ability to change icon size (thereby increasing the density/number of icons within a row. I’m currently using LinkAce for storing/managing bookmarks but the UI isn’t great for my purpose and the login requirement is onerous.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit">https://www.reddit</a></pre></div></body></html>
