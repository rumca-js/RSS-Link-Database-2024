I just wanted some help in choosing between these two (I can only afford one of them for now) . I usually play solo when my group is not available and really enjoyed solo playthroughs of Cascadia, Search for the lost species and Final Girl.</p> <p>While our group enjoys games that are engaging and fun. Some of these are: Happy Little Dinosaurs, Unmatched, Sushi Go, Pandemic, and a laid-back game when it's getting late. </p> <p>Thank you in advance to those who will give any tips/advice!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Curious_Hetty"> /u/Curious_Hetty </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ffzgls/everdell_or_lost_ruins_of_arnak/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ffzgls/everdell_or_lost_ruins_of_arnak/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
