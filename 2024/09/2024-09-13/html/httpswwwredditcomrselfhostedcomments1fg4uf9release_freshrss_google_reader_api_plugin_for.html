I've been the <a href="https://github.com/DigitalDJ/tinytinyrss-fever-plugin/graphs/contributors?from=1%2F1%2F2020">top contributor to the Fever plugin</a> since 2020, and decided I'd rather develop a new plugin with more features. With the release of FreshAPI I hope that more folks will be able to use Tiny-Tiny RSS as their RSS reader of choice, with their client application of choice.</p> <p>If you give the plugin a shot</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
