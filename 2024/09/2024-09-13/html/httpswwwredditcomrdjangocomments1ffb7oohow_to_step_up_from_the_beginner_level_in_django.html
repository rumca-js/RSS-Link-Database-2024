While I’ve worked with Django, I’ve mostly done projects with JavaScript and React.js, and now Next.js. This shift has made me forget some Django and DRF concepts.</p> <p>I’ve been assigned a project as a Backend Developer for a mobile app, which involves concepts like notifications, time scheduling, and AI chatbot integration—areas I haven’t worked with before. I see this as a great opportunity to learn and build at the same time.</p> <p>I’m looking to deepen my backend development skills with Django. I want to move beyond the beginner level and apply what I learn to real-world projects. I’m considering <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/django-python-advanced/?couponCode=ST17MT91224A">advanced Django courses on Udemy</a> but want to avoid getting stuck in tutorial hell. My goal is to build and deploy</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
