By incorporating a rare earth element, erbium (Er), into the commonly studied cobalt oxide (Co3O4) catalyst, the team has demonstrated a new, cost-effective solution that surpasses the performance of many precious metal-free catalysts, offering an alternative to more expensive noble metal-based options.</pre></div></body></html>
