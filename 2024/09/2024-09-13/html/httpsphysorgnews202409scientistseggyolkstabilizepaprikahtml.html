However, its lipophilic nature and sensitivity to factors like oxygen, heat, and light restrict its use in water-based foods. While previous approaches, including emulsions and liposomes, have aimed to improve PO's stability, the results have been limited. These persistent challenges underscore the need for new stabilization methods for PO.</pre></div></body></html>
