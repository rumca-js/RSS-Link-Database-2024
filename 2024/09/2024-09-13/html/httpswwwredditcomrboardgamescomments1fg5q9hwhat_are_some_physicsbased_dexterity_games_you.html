We have a few outstanding members like <strong>Cube Quest</strong> or the recently kick-started <strong>KUGO</strong> and <strong>The Flames of Fafnir</strong>, the latter which is more involved than being solely a dexterity game.</p> <p>Playing with younger members, I enjoy games like <strong>Super Mario Blow Up! Shaky Tower Balancing Game</strong>, <strong>The Fuzzies</strong>, and the classic <strong>Don't Break the Ice<em>. With a casual adult audience, *</em>Jenga</strong> is a classic (we have The Donkey Kong Collector's Edition that adds some extra elements of gameplay, but really doesn't add too much and leans a bit on randomness for sure - still good fun for a casual time). Of course <strong>beer pong&lt;/stron</strong></p></div></pre></div></body></html>
