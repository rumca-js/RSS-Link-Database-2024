I am trying to remember the rules of this game.</p> <p>From what I remember, its 6 players, and its 2 teams of three. There is a deck of cards, and everyone takes turns asking a different person if they have a certain card. You are ONLY allowed to ask for a card based off of certain conditions about your own cards (I don't really remember those conditions, like same half of the suit maybe?). </p> <p>And if the person that you ask for the card has the card, then you get it? And if you have all of the cards in the same half suit, then you can reveal it put it down., and make your hand smaller.</p> <p>The entire goal of the game, if I remember correctly is to correctly guess all the cards that your team has. </p> <p>What is this game called? I remember it being really hard and fun!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ultimatefr"> /u/ultimatefr </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddi</span>">https://www.reddi</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
