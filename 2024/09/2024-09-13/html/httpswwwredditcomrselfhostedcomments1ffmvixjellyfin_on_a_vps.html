Basically a Netflix/Spotify with the media I own indefinitely rather than paying for the streaming license regularly.</p> <p>To those of you who do the same, I have a few questions.</p> <ul> <li>Do you use a server with a GPU for transcoding? If not, how big of a CPU did you choose? Jellyfin runs perfectly fine on a single-core $1 Netcup Mikro, but transcoding doesn't.</li> <li>Do you use hourly billing? The server is going to idle whenever I'm not streaming. Does it make sense to choose a subscription where I'm only billed on demand or is it not worth the hassle?</li> <li>At the moment I'm using a Hetzner Storagebox for backups. To get started, I mounted this read-only on my Netcup VPS. This surely isn't ideal, what storage solution do you use?</li> <li>I store my music in lossless quality, but for streaming this might be quite stupid.</li></ul></div></pre></div></body></html>
