(Just to clarify, I am using Raspberry pi OS 64 bits if your wondering)</p> <p>Where do you find such special frame buffering/ dispmanx settings in the RealVNC viewer? I tried to find them but to no avail. I found some old Raspberry pi forum posts in 2020 that told me its because of dispmanx / special frame buffering. I looked at it and it was complex code with no clear instructions and or instructions that were vague and didn't even show me where to find and configure it. If anyone has ever tried to view Kodi and other apps with Raspberry Pi 3B through RealVNC viewer and so on. Please let me know it would greatly help me and others alot! Thanks!</p> <p>Edit: I also found this &lt;a href="<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200708162408/https://help.realvnc.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002249917-VNC-Connect-and-Raspbe</p></div>">https://web.archive.org/web/20200708162408/https://help.realvnc.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002249917-VNC-Connect-and-Raspbe</p></div></a></pre></div></body></html>
