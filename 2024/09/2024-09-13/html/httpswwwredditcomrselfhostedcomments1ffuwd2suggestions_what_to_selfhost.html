I have some free azure credits and wish to use them to learn self-hosting and understand the problems that come with them, but I never felt the need for any such tool specifically.<br/> eg: I thought of self-hosting gitea but thought I already have github, so what would I do on gitea </p> <p>Would like to have some suggestions what I could self-host that would learning and the process fun. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vijard"> /u/vijard </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ffuwd2/suggestions_what_to_selfhost/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ffuwd2/suggestions_what_to_selfhost/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
