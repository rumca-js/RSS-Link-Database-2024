The War Within is the best World of Warcraft has been on all fronts in many years, and possibly ever. When returning franchise creative director Chris Metzen got on stage at BlizzCon and said it was time to come home, he really wasn't just stringing us along. The writing is strong. The gameplay is strong. The music and zone design are exceptional even by Blizzard standards. The endgame loop feels good and offers tons of satisfying ways to progress, including more appropriately difficult and rewarding solo content than ever. The level 80 experience has some wonky tuning and annoying bugs, but I trust Blizzard to get that ironed out in due time. Somehow, this two-decade-old MMO feels fresh and thrilling again.</pre></div></body></html>
