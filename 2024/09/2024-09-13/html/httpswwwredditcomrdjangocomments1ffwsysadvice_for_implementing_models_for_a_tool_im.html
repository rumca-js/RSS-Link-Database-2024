I'm new to the community, and relatively new to django (and coding in general). I'm an engineer, looking to develop a tool to streamline my design process.</p> <p>What I'm looking to do is establish tables for products that are commonly used in designs, which would store the products' manufacturer/ physical data.</p> <p>Then, the idea is to be able to select from these products to add to a project as a design element. The design element would retain all manufacturer/physical data fields from the product model and then add project specific data.</p> <p>Right now I have this implemented by having a Product model, and an Element model, where the element model has a product field which Is a foreign key to a Product object.</p> <p>The issue I have is that often times I don't need/can't specify specific products in the designs, and just use generic design elements. In these instances, I have no product object that I can pull </p></div></pre></div></body></html>
