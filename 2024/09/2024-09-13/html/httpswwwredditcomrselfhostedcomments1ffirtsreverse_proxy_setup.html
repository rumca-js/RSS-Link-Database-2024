I would like to have the map point directly to a domain that I have through squarespace.</p> <p>I currently have Nginx Proxy Manager installed and running, but I'm a bit confused at this point of where to go from here. If anyone could point me to some documentation/tutorials that would be awesome and would likely help me ask better questions in the future.</p> <p>Thanks a ton in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dendalen"> /u/Dendalen </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ffirts/reverse_proxy_setup/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ffirts/reverse_proxy_setup/">[com</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
