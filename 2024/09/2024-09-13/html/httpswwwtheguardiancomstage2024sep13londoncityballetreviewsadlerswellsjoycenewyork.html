Led by artistic director Christopher Marney, the dancers range from new graduates to one of the world’s leading ballerinas (Alina Cojocaru, guesting for these London dates), performing revivals of lost works and brand new commissions.<br/><br/>
 This is a 21st-century rebirth, but the dance itself isn’t going hyperspeed into the future – and that’s not a criticism. Arielle Smith’s new commission, Five Dances, is a good example. Set against saturated colours of tangerine and vermilion, it is easy-paced and un-showoffy, not tangled in technical trickiness but made with a cool, light touch, leaving space for the dance in a way that’s refreshing.<br/><br/>
 In Marney’s own piece, Eve, again the choreography is not mad</p></pre></div></body></html>
