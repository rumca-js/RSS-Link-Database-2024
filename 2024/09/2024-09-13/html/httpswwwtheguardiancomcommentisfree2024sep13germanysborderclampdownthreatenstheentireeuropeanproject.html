In France, they called for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/frexit-nexit-or-oexit-who-will-be-next-to-leave-the-eu">Frexit</a>; in Germany, it was <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/04/12/germany-s-afd-opposition-party-embraces-dexit-and-will-campaign-to-leave-eu">Dexit</a>. But recently these calls have quietened. The reason is not that far-right parties have become enamoured of the EU, but rather they now understand that instead of quitting, they can reshape the EU into a collection of “strong” nation states that will each enact their own rightwing anti-migration agenda.</p><p>Dr Maurice Stierl is a migration and border researcher at the University of Osnabrück, Germany</p> &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/c">https://www.theguardian.com/c</a></pre></div></body></html>
