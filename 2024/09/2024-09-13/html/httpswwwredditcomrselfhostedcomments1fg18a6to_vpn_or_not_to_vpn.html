The common refrain I hear in this forum is "Do not expose things publicly. Use a VPN." I have a VPN and can do that, but I still have some services that I want exposed publicly so that things like mobile apps can work without having to be constantly VPN'd in. (Constantly having the VPN running is not an option on my work laptop and not ideal on my phone.) I have settled on the following:</p> <p>Use a reverse proxy and expose as few web-based services possible to the public internet. Those that are exposed need to be as secure as possible including 2FA.</p> <p>For the rest of the services, require a VPN to access them.</p> <p>Is this a bad idea? Should I truly bite the bullet and block everything? What do you do?</p> <p>TIA!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JL_678"> /u/JL_678 </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="</span></pre></div></body></html>
