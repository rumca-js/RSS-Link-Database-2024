It operates over the TCP/IP protocol and is designed to facilitate the transfer of email messages between servers and clients. The key components of SMTP include:</p> <ol> <li><strong>SMTP Server</strong>: The central component responsible for sending, receiving, and relaying emails. It listens on port 25 and communicates with other SMTP servers to route emails to their destination.</li> <li><strong>Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)</strong>: Software that manages the email sending process. It forwards email messages from the sender's server to the recipient's server, handling tasks like queue management and retries if necessary.</li> <li><strong>Mail User Agent (MUA)</strong>: The email client or application used by the end-user to compose, send, and receive emails. It interacts with the SMTP server to send outgoing messages.</li> <li><strong>M</strong></li></ol></div></pre></div></body></html>
