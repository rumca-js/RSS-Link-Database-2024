Maybe deck builders like Dominion or Star Realms? What do you think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alex_Doppelganger"> /u/Alex_Doppelganger </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ffsdx9/modern_board_gamesc</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ffsdx9/modern_board_gamesc</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
