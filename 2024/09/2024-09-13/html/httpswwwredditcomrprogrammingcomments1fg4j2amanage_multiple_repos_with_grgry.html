I had the difficulty to manage manual changes over a larger amount of repositories like refactorings, new versions of services etc, so I wrote grgry. grgry is a simple CLI tool, which should support to clone, push and basically manage git repos en mass. Thus, an entire group or organization can be cloned with one command and desired git operations can be done over multiple git repos at the same time, of course all supported by a regex include/exclude.</p> <p>If someone has the same problem as me or just wants to try the tool it would be interesting to get feedback.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Yingrjimsch"> /u/Yingrjimsch </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="https</span></pre></div></body></html>
