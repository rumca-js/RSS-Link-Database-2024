Could they try to understand one another without the conversation breaking down?</p><p>Orna Guralnik and Christine<strong> </strong>met on the docuseries Couples Therapy in 2022. During filming, they respectively realised that while they both live in New York, Orna, the programme’s couples therapist, is Israeli, and Christine, who participated in the series with her partner, is Palestinian. They kept in touch after the show ended, and since 7 October, they have spent more than 30 hours, on video calls and in person, discussing their views and applying some of the frameworks of couples therapy to engage with difficult subjects without the conversation breaking down. In the process, they have also developed a friendship.<strong> </strong>This conversation is drawn from two of these exchanges, recorded in January 2024.</p><p>***</p> &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/c">https://www.theguardian.com/c</a></pre></div></body></html>
