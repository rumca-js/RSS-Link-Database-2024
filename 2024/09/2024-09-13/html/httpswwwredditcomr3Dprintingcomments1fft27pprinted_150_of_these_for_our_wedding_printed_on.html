I can fit 3 to a plate, with the plate taking about 7 hours to print (I likely could have cut this down a bit by messing w the file, but after much time playing with the settings, I was happy with this quality and didn't want to fuck with it any further since time is on our side). Each invite is about 10gs of filament including waste. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fioricascastle"> /u/Fioricascastle </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.co</span></td></tr></table>">https://www.reddit.co</span></td></tr></table></a></pre></div></body></html>
