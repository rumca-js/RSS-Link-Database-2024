Frostpunk 2 launches on PC on September 20, with Advanced Access for Deluxe Edition owners starting on September 17, 2024.

Will years of struggle and sacrifice be undone by ideological infighting? Or can the new Steward reconcile the political factions and inspire society to believe that New London can still stand strong?</pre></div></body></html>
