(Constantly having the VPN running is not an option on my work laptop and not ideal on my phone.) I have settled on the following:</p> <p>Use a reverse proxy and expose as few web-based services possible to the public internet. Those that are exposed need to be as secure as possible including 2FA.</p> <p>For the rest of the services, require a VPN to access them.</p> <p>Is this a bad idea?

So, why do QLC-SSDs seem great for selfhosting? The main weaknesses of QLC (in my eyes) are lower reliability and slow write speeds. However, readspeeds and random I/O are often on favorable levels. However, like most SSDs, QLC-SSDs makes up for slow writes by using pseudoSLC-Cache, with the size usually in neighborhood of 10 to 20 GB.
