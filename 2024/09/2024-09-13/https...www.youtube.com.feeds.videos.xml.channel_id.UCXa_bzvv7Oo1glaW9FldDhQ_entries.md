When you look at the stealth genre and its titles throughout the years, it hasn't been burgeoning with triple-A efforts. The likes of Splinter Cell and Metal Gear are seemingly far behind, though both are receiving remakes. From that perspective, Spikewave's Evotinction is an interesting title.

As part of Sony's Hero Project, it follows Dr. Thomas Liu and his efforts to defeat the RED virus in the high-tech facility HERE. Though his combat options are limited, Liu can utilize hacking tools to redirect and outsmart the rogue Genies roaming the facility. The visuals are pretty striking, thanks to Unreal Engine 5.

However, dig deeper, and problems emerge. Whether it's the characterization and script reading that doesn't get enough time to breathe, the performance issues, or the overall plot, Evotinction squanders much of its potential. The stealth mechanics stand out, but everything else leaves much to be desired.

The PS5 Pro has been officially unveiled, and though there's no shortage of discourse around whether or not the upgrades it offers over the base PS5 are enough to justify its eye-watering $700 price (or even to justify its existence, for that matter), it also goes without saying that, at the same time, there is going to be some excitement around seeing how different games will be able to leverage and benefit from the added capabilities that the mid-gen console is bringing to the table, from its faster rendering and its advanced ray tracing to the all-new PSSR and more. 

Here, then, we're going to go over a few games that we're hoping will be enhanced on the PS5 Pro, to the extent where it makes an actual, tangible difference.
