Hoskins spins a high fantasy tale full of conspiracies, schemes, and brutal back stabbings and betrayals that rivals even A Song of Ice and Fire\u2019s level of complex political drama. Here, treacherous tongues are wielded like weapons, and words soon prove more dangerous and deadly than any magical battle could ever be. Starting where most fantasy books end, The Council of Athyzia explores what would happen to a world when the dark lord has finally been defeated after 25 years of terror. Imagine a true historic peace conference like Vienna or Paris, except here we have elves, dwarves, creatures and different factions of humans coming together to forge a new path forward; can they set aside their personal goals to maintain peace and unity without a common enemy, or will tensions explode and history repeat itself? As someone who can get quite daunted by complex political fantasy narratives, I went into The Council of Athyzia equally curious and nervous.
