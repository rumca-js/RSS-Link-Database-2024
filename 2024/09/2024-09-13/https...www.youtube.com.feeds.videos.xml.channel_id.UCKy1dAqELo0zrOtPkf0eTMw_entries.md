Transformers One reviewed by Tom Jorgensen.

Transformers One’s core duo of Orion Pax and D-16 and the fallout of their broken friendship provide an occasional spark, but despite the efforts of its impressive voice cast and a standout performance from Brian Tyree Henry, this animated origin story rarely shows anything more than meets the eye. Its G1-inspired aesthetic is cool in small doses, but Transformers One regularly fumbles trying to follow its transforming robots through the action. Though the tragedy of Optimus Prime and Megatron’s storied rivalry could have felt larger than life, Transformers One is mostly content with half-hearted puns and barely legible Cybertronian battles that could have used some major transforming before rolling out.

World of Warcraft: The War Within reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC.

The War Within is the best World of Warcraft has been on all fronts in many years, and possibly ever. When returning franchise creative director Chris Metzen got on stage at BlizzCon and said it was time to come home, he really wasn't just stringing us along. The writing is strong. The gameplay is strong. The music and zone design are exceptional even by Blizzard standards. The endgame loop feels good and offers tons of satisfying ways to progress, including more appropriately difficult and rewarding solo content than ever. The level 80 experience has some wonky tuning and annoying bugs, but I trust Blizzard to get that ironed out in due time. Somehow, this two-decade-old MMO feels fresh and thrilling again.

NBA 2K25 reviewed by Nico Vergara on PlayStation 5, also available on Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

The more things change, the more they stay the same, and that’s never been more true than with NBA 2K25. Although the core gameplay feels familiar (and it most likely always will), a handful of improvements such as Go-To Moves, Rhythm Shooting, and Shot Timing Profiles also make it more novel and challenging. I love that the Heart of a Dynasty storyline and the return of Streetball highlight a renewed focus on single-player experiences that, I hope, mean things will be even better next year. Don’t get me wrong; microtransactions are still as pervasive and frustrating as ever. But spending money doesn’t always feel as necessary this time, especially in MyTeam, thanks to the return of the Auction House. So, although NBA 2K25 isn’t on the level of Michael Jordan’s splashy return in 1995, it can at least compare to his late-career stint with the Washington Wizards; you know wha
