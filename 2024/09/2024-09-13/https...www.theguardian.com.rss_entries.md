Exactly 100 years ago, the National purchased Van Gogh’s Sunflowers for £1,304, a bargain even for the times.</p><p>Far from a safe bet, guaranteed to bring in the crowds, Van Gogh was considered a rather risky addition in 1924. Slipping under the National Gallery’s 1900 cut-off date – later works go to the Tate – by just a decade, he is a visionary modernist among old masters. His paintings might be the stuff of a million tea towels today, but there is nothing dusty or cosy about Van&nbsp;Gogh.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

My husband and I devoured these fritters for brunch, and even offered a few to our baby (who we are happily weaning – he loved grabbing and mushing them in his mouth). They are quick to pull together, and the recipe easily multiplies, too. The key is to squeeze out the juice from the apples, but it doesn’t have to go to waste: you can drink it!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/sep/13/grated-apple-fritters-recipe-ravneet-gill">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Are there any combos that can beat the bloody mary?</p><p>In 1895, a British journalist called Guy Beringer made a case for brunch, a new meal that was “a corruption of breakfast and lunch”. He was referring to his portmanteau of the words “breakfast” and “lunch”, of course, but I love the idea of brunch as a corruption. It is, after all, a meal with an edge; a louche late start made possible by the weekend, and the acceptable face of drinking before noon.</p><p>Beringer made the point that brunch enables you “to prolong your Saturday nights, heedless of that moral ‘last train’”. It starts later, for a start, with more “solid attributes” on the menu than breakfast. He was writing, of course, for the hungover. So, what to drink at brunch? It makes sense that cocktails have become traditional, especially those that combine the enlivening properties of juice with the fuel of alcohol, such as the mimosa or the bloody mary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/sep/13/mina-

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells, London</strong><br>Recent graduates, former Ballet Black star Cira Robinson and guest Alina Cojocaru perform lost works and new commissions</p><p>Revived from the ashes after a 28-year absence, London City Ballet makes a convincing return to the stage. Led by artistic director Christopher Marney, the dancers range from new graduates to one of the world’s leading ballerinas (Alina Cojocaru, guesting for these London dates), performing revivals of lost works and brand new commissions.<br><br>
 This is a 21st-century rebirth, but the dance itself isn’t going hyperspeed into the future – and that’s not a criticism. Arielle Smith’s new commission, Five Dances, is a good example. Set against saturated colours of tangerine and vermilion, it is easy-paced and un-showoffy, not tangled in technical trickiness but made with a cool, light touch, leaving space for the dance in a way that’s refreshing.<br><br>

What started as a few paving slabs salvaged from a skip is now a thriving, pocket-sized courtyard filled with unusual, edible plants. Ussher introduces me to fruits I’ve not met before, such as Nepalese raspberries and the aronia berries he infuses syrups with. “This is my favourite flower in the world,” he says, pointing to the devil’s-bit scabious growing next to some wild ginger.</p><p>This space emerged during the Covid lockdowns, Ussher says, when he and his neighbour, Helenka, healed thei

## Time to retire the office trainers – grownup shoes are back | Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion

<p>Teeny-tiny heels are having a moment – and they are a genius (and comfortable) way to freshen up your work wardrobe</p><p>There is a saying that goes: you can judge a man by his shoes. Actually, that’s not true, there isn’t. The original proverb actually advises that you shouldn’t judge a man before you have walked a mile in his shoes. Which is almost the opposite, when you think about it, since it is counselling against snap judgments rather than in favour of them. Also, not really about shoes.</p><p>Both sayings – the real one and my version – are wise in their own way. Not passing judgment on a person until you have walked in his shoes – climbed into his skin and walked around in it, as Atticus puts it to Scout – is kind of entry-level humanity, really. But the idea that you can judge a man by his shoes also has a nugget of truth in it, if you swap the word judge (bit judgy) for the word read. You can read a person by their shoes, because shoes are where we give ourselves away.

## How scientists debunked one of conservation’s most influential statistics

<p>The factoid about biodiversity and Indigenous peoples spread around the world, but scientists say bad data can undermine the very causes it claims to support</p><p>The statistic seemed to crop up everywhere. Versions were cited at UN negotiations, on protest <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/tTnMZLR24uH8XYvbA">banners,</a> in 186 peer-reviewed scientific papers – even by the film-maker <a href="https://x.com/jimcameron/status/1576279712925564928">James Cameron</a>, while promoting his Avatar films. Exact wording varied, but the claim was this: that 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity is protected by Indigenous peoples.</p><p>When scientists investigated its origins, however, they found nothing. In September, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02811-w">scientific journal Nature</a> reported that the much-cited claim was “a baseless statistic”, not supported by any real data, and could jeopardise the very Indigenous-led conservation efforts it was cited in

Rachel (Natasha Lyonne), who lives there, spends her time betting on sports and smoking weed, which sets off prickly elder sister Katie (Carrie Coon) and puts Elizabeth Olsen’s more pacific Christina into the role of peacemaker. With the camera rarely leaving the apartment’s few rooms, it’s quite a theatrical setup – a hothouse of delayed grief, sibling resentment and fragile coping strategies.

Sorry – a clip of some young women interrupting a cuddling Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco on a picnic in a New York park. They didn’t ask about Gomez’s work or acknowledge her personal space, and instead went straight for what mattered: the photo. A vulnerably positioned Blanco, laid down in Gomez’s lap, seemed to dissociate, his hood pulled over his face. With someone filming the whole encounter, it was clear this wasn’t about the fans meeting an idol. It was about them maximising the potential of this moment as social media content.</p><p>Gomez has rarely complained about her fans, mostly urging them to maintain kindness and respect, which is the typical line from celebrities lest they bite the hand

<p>With the return of the group stage imminent, we cast an eye over eight of the competition’s emerging talents</p><p>In 2021 Norwich had high hopes of the Greek striker, signed from Paok Salonika for £8.8m. Tzolis started his Carrow Road career with two goals and a couple of assists in the 6-0 demolition of Bournemouth in the League Cup but rarely started after that. Dismissed as a flop, he was loaned to Fortuna Düsseldorf last summer. The tricky and speedy left-winger flourished, finishing as the 2.Bundesliga’s top scorer with 22 goals and nearly leading his club to promotion. Fortuna didn’t have the funds to keep Tzolis with the £3m buy option but it made sense to activate it in order to resell at a cool profit. Club Brugge were delighted to get him, and Tzolis has started brightly in Belgium .</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/13/tzolis-to-sucic-unheralded-players-to-watch-in-the-champions-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ruth Wilson and Michael Sheen take us on another outing to Pizza Express in Woking, and brace yourself for a witchy road trip with the brilliant Kathryn Hahn</p><p>Another trip along the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/nov/20/prince-andrew-scandal-show-bbc-amazon">well-travelled route</a> to Pizza Express in Woking, this time mapped out by a cast headed by Ruth Wilson and Michael Sheen. Whether the world really needs another interpretation of Emily Maitlis’s 2019 interview with Prince Andrew is a fair question. But the background to the story is nicely rendered here. Wilson’s Maitlis is driven but brittle, straining against BBC propriety. Sheen, meanwhile, plays Andrew as a superficially avuncular but petulant and buffoonish individual whose lack of moral or practical purpose has left him twisting dangerously in the wind. The performances make overlooking the familiarity of the story just about worthwhile. <br><em>Prime Video, from Thursday 19 September</em><

## Is Keir Starmer’s plan to help workers the start of a new era – or no big deal? | Andy Beckett

<p>Labour’s promises to ‘make work pay’ are short on detail, but delegates at the TUC conference were starting to believe</p><p>For 45 years, ever since Margaret Thatcher was first elected, Britons have had to get used to the idea that trade unions and workers’ rights are weakening. Changes in the economy and technology, in the mindset of employers and employees, and above all in government policy have left unions and workers in a weaker position here than in most wealthy democracies. The consequences of this relentless removal of power from the majority can be seen in this country’s precarious working culture and often low wages – a status quo around which rightwing politicians, thinktanks, journalists and business interests have erected great walls of justifying arguments and rhetoric.</p><p>So the notion that this seemingly permanent shift might be reversed, through Keir Starmer’s ambitiously named “new deal for working people”, can at first be quite hard to absorb. <a href="https:

<p>As he announces ‘understated’ fourth album Small Changes, the Mercury-winning musician explains how he went from ‘slight weirdo’ to wowing Glasto – and why more of us are turning to religion</p><p>At the start of the summer, Michael Kiwanuka played at Glastonbury. A warm-up show in Halifax aside, it was the first gig he had played in Britain for a couple of years, a chance to debut songs from his forthcoming fourth album, Small Changes. A malfunctioning vintage synthesiser notwithstanding, it all went perfectly, the sunshine and a cool breeze somehow potentiating the soft power of the music that floated from the stage: an idiosyncratic cocktail of soul, psychedelia, rock and singer-songwriter introspection that Kiwanuka has honed and reshaped over the 12 years since his debut album into something completely his own.</p><p>Kiwanuka and his band sounded as striking as anyone familiar with his back catalogue might expect. But they looked striking, too: Kiwanuka wore a Ugandan kanzu ro
