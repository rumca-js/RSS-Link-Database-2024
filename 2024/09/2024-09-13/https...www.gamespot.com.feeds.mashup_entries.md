<p>Marvel Studios has never been shy about making some changes to the source material, but things are going to be very different for Anthony Ramos' character, Parker Robbins, in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/anthony-ramos-joins-cast-of-marvels-ironheart/1100-6500534/">Ironheart</a>. For one thing, Parker's comic book counterpart doesn't really have any direct connection to Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne), the young woman behind Ironheart's armor. But according to Ramos, Parker's transformation into The Hood will be relatively true to the spirit of his character.</p><p>"I get to play this villain, The Hood, and Parker Robbins in the comics, he gets this hood, and it's too powerful for him," Ramos told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/anthony-ramos-ironheart-lin-manuel-miranda-advice-athletic-partnership-1236000374/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">In a recent interview, The Batman director Matt Reeves explained how close he came to directing an episode of The Penguin, a spin-off series starring Colin Farrell. Although he was deeply involved in the show's development, scheduling conflicts with The Batman sequel forced him to step away from directing. <a href="https://collider.com/the-penguin-why-matt-reeves-not-directing/">Collider</a> reported this during an interview with Reeves.</p><p dir="ltr">"The thing is that I really wanted to," Reeves said, explaining that his early conversations with Farrell made it seem possible. However, due to post-production work on The Batman and script duties for The Batman Part II, he was unable to commit to directing an episode. "There was a point where we realized… I really couldn't be also directing."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-matt-reeves-isnt-directing-the-penguin/1100-6526488/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>M. Night Shyamalan's 2016 thriller Split was supposed to star Joaquin Phoenix in the lead role, but the actor dropped out just two weeks before filming was due to begin. James McAvoy, who took over for Phoenix, discussed this unusual development in a recent interview.</p><p>Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoFchfFa0i8">Happy Sad Confused podcast</a>, McAvoy said Phoenix is an "amazing actor," and he would have played the character differently from the Scottish actor. Split tells the story of a man (McAvoy) who has 23 different personalities, so anyone could understand how preparation sounds like it might be critical to playing the role well. But McAvoy said coming in so late in the process was something of a relief because he couldn't over-prepare.</p><p>"I think he'd give a very different performance to the one I did. But I think he'd give an incredible performance. Sometimes coming in last minute is the best way," he said. "I think he ditched it like two

<p>PlayStation is not what it used to be; some of that, of course, is for good reason. You'd be hard-pressed to argue that Cloud Strife looked better when he was a pile of polygons, or that stealth-game controls peaked with 1998's Metal Gear Solid. Technology has evolved, bringing us not necessarily <em>better </em>games but games offering visuals and overall experiences that were previously unfathomable. And just as technology has changed, so have the companies implementing it--companies like Sony.</p><p dir="ltr">Originally a home for RPGs and platforming mascots, PlayStation has spent the past few decades intensely focused on cinematic single-player games, with narratives that eschew early-aughts whimsy in favor of morally conflicted anti-heroes. Despite the incongruity between those two styles, both were hugely successful for the company. But now, PlayStation is changing its focus yet again, only this time into an arena so competitive that there's no guarantee even this titan of v
