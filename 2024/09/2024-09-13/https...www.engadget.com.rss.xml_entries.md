## Meta hides warning labels for AI-edited images

<p>Starting next week, Meta will no longer put an <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-plans-to-more-broadly-label-ai-generated-content-152945787.html">easy-to-see label on Facebook images</a> that were edited using AI tools, and it will make it much harder to determine if they appear in their original state or had been doctored. To be clear, the company will still add a note to AI-edited images, but you&#39;ll have to tap on the three-dot menu at the upper right corner of a Facebook post and then scroll down to find &quot;AI Info&quot; among the many other options. Only then will you see the note saying that the content in the post may have been modified with AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Images generated using AI tools, however, will still be marked with an &quot;AI Info&quot; label that can be seen right on the post. Clicking on it will show a note that will say whether it&#39;s been labeled because of industry-shared signals or because somebody self-disclosed that it

<p>A European consumer watchdog has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/consumer-groups-denounce-video-games-manipulative-spending-tactics">filed a complaint</a> against Epic Games, Electronic Arts, Roblox and other game publishers over deceptive in-game currency practices, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/videogame-firms-hit-with-eu-complaint-over-tricking-consumers-2024-09-11/"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported. The European Consumer Organization (BEUC) said it has &quot;identified numerous cases where gamers are misled into spending money&quot; and called on authorities &quot;to provide consumers with safe gaming environments.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BEUC pointed out that consumers are unable to see the real cost of digital items price using in-game currencies, saying that in-game purchases should always be displayed in real money. It added that companies&#39; claims that gamers prefer in-game premium currencies are wr

<p>Last year, I experienced my first iPhone launch cycle at Engadget and the fanfare got to me. It seemed I couldn’t call myself a respectable member of the tech world if I didn’t own any of the shiny new tech. So I headed to the Apple store on the iPhone 15’s opening weekend and put my name in to buy one. As I waited my turn, I idly played with the display model. Holding it up to my iPhone 11, my enthusiasm dimmed. A bright grid of apps, softly rounded corners, one button on the right, two buttons and a toggle on the left… These two phones were the same. Sure, the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-14-pro-hands-on-dynamic-island-notch-always-on-display-price-specs-193543750-193543164.html"><ins>pill-shaped thing</ins></a> on the screen was new, but, so what?</p>

<p>The entire Annapurna Interactive team has left the company after its executives walked out, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. Apparently, the video game publisher&#39;s president, Nathan Gary, had been negotiating with Annapurna Pictures&#39; founder Megan Ellison to spin off Annapurna Interactive into its own entity. A company spokesperson confirmed to <em>Bloomberg</em> that the parties had explored the possibility of a spinoff, but their discussions broke down. Gary and the publisher&#39;s other executives had resigned and walked out as a result, and the team&#39;s other members had followed suit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;All 25 members of the Annapurna Interactive team collectively resigned,&quot; the team said in a joint statement. &quot;This was one of the hardest decisions we have ever had to make and we did not take this action lig
