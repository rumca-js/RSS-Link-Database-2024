Its G1-inspired aesthetic is cool in small doses, but Transformers One regularly fumbles trying to follow its transforming robots through the action.

Although the core gameplay feels familiar (and it most likely always will), a handful of improvements such as Go-To Moves, Rhythm Shooting, and Shot Timing Profiles also make it more novel and challenging. I love that the Heart of a Dynasty storyline and the return of Streetball highlight a renewed focus on single-player experiences that, I hope, mean things will be even better next year.
