My new film, "Am I Racist?", premiers in theaters this weekend. But shockingly, some of my co-stars in the film—the DEI grifters we exposed—are not happy about the movie. They have come out to denounce it as "Nazi propaganda," among other things. We'll discuss that today.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, my new film, "Am I Racist?", premiers in theaters this weekend. But shockingly, some of my co-stars in the film -- the DEI grifters we exposed -- are not happy about the movie. They have come out to denounce it as "Nazi propaganda," among other things. We'll discuss that today. Also, Donald Trump unveils a new tax plan, as Kamala still refuses to unveil any plans at all. And the Left's hysteria about the reports of Haitians eating cats has reached a fever pitch.
