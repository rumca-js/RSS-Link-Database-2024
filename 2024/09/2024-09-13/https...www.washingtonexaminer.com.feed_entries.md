When a radical right party wins a state election in Germany, the headlines write themselves. This month’s victory for the Alternative for Germany was greeted in much the same way across the world. CNN labeled AfD &#8220;the first far-right party to win since 1945.&#8221; London&#8217;s Daily Telegraph went with &#8220;first since the Nazi era.&#8221; Germany’s [&#8230;]

In literary circles, insofar as such still exist, for reasons I have never been able to grasp, I’ve often encountered disdain for “series” fiction of the kind particularly common in crime fiction and, to a lesser degree, science fiction.
