Symmetry is fascinating to the human mind and everyone likes objects or patterns that are in some way symmetrical. It is an interesting fact that nature often exhibits certain kinds of symmetry in the objects and phenomena in our Universe.\n\nWe have, in our minds, a tendency to accept symmetry as some kind of perfection. Yet it so often eludes us\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s look at code and see what interesting properties emerge from various kinds of symmetries. A quest for the \u2018Character of Code\u2019, following Richard Feynman\u2019s awe-inspiring take on physical laws.\n\nWe'll be looking to identify patterns in code, interested to see when such patterns exhibit some sort of symmetry that is advantageous in some way for reliability, performance, maintenance and discoverability.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2024/\nSponsored By think-cell\n---\n\nV", "id": 1139187, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj3bHPSBABo", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "source_obj__id": 421, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Rj3bHPSBABo/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Symmetry in Code - Should We Care? - Victor Ciura - ACCU 2024", "vote": 0}]
