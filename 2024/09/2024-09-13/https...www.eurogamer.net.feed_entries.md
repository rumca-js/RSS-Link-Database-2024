Following a difficult year for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/immortals-of-aveum">Immortals of Aveum</a> developer Ascendant Studios, a "core team" of around 20 employees has now decamped to Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser's Absurd Ventures, establishing a new studio that'll be known as Absurd Marin.
</p><p>
Immortals of Aveum, a "single-player first person magic shooter", launched to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortals-of-aveum-review">mixed reviews</a> last August, and it failed to make much of an impact commercially. As a result, just a month later, Ascendent Studios announced it had made the "painfully difficult, but necessary"  decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortals-of-aveum-studio-lays-off-45-of-staff-following-poor-sales">lay off 45 percent of its staff</a>, equating to around 40 e

Blizzard has shared more on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>'s previously announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> collaboration - which arrives as part of the MMO's 20th anniversary celebrations - confirming the event begins next Tuesday, 17th September.
</p><p>
Word of its start date arrives alongside a nifty new trailer featuring a first-person ride through a theme-park-style attraction called Blizzard World. As the trailer unfolds, a number of unseen Overwatch 2 characters comment on the ensuing crossover mayhem, and we're given a glimpse at the hero shooter's new World of Warcraft collaboration skins.

Those skins include Sylvanas Windrunner Widowmaker, Lich King Reinhardt, Thrall Zenyatta, and Diamond Magni Tor

</p><p>Christian Donlan called Toem a "cheerful modern classic" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toem-review-a-photography-puzzler-and-a-journey-filled-with-lovely-moments">his Essential review</a>, championing its "playful challenges and a warm sense of place".

If you're looking for something to sink your teeth into this weekend (apologies), you could do far worse than take a look at developer Stunlock Studios' acclaimed vampire survival adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/v-rising">V Rising</a> - which is free to play on Steam for the next few days.
</p><p>
V Rising launched back in May after two years of Steam early access development, presenting players (and their equally elegant friends) with a rich, more-ish game of isometric survival, where the goal is to assert your vampiric superiority across a gloomy, gothic open-world.
</p><p>
It's got a bunch of neats twists on the survival formula, all playing into the whole vampire <em>thing</em> - including a blood-sucking mechanic that gives you specific abilities depending on the creatures you drain, and progress that involves

This title is often CPU-limited, especially in levels where you're engulfing ripper swarms with flamers, but judicious settings choices can still claw back some extra performance.  </p><p>One of the most impactful settings is SSR quality, which can be set to off, default or high. Our testing shows around a 10 percent performance advantage from using the default setting rather than high, as measured on an RTX 4060 using DLSS native. This does produce noticeably lower-res reflections, but the extra performance is hard to pass up. </p><p>More of a free win is the volumetrics setting, which can b
