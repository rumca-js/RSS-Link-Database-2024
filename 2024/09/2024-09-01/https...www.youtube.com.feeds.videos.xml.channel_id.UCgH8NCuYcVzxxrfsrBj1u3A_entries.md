Today I'm wearing my Grandfather's vest once again and looking at what greeted Oasis fans when they tried to buy tickets for the upcoming reunion tour; long queues, crashed sites and rising prices. Why did it happen and is any of it right?

Apologies for the tiredness on show in this video; I had a very late night following a Shirtless Season festival performance in Jersey with The Darkness. I blame Texas. 

I will be returning with another Comments Day episode very soon, so please do deposit your thoughts below.
