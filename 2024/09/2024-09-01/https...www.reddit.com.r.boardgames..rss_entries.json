I&#39;m curious if anyone has any good recommendations on good post-apocalyptic board games. I&#39;m not into the really gritty kind (like Maximum Apocalypse or Waste Knights or something like that), and I don&#39;t care for the zombie apocalypse or dystopian future type. I&#39;m more into the kind where characters are making their way in a world where civilization is gone, maybe one involving more nature or where nature has reclaimed the planet. For example, I like Life in ReTerra, though the gameplay does not have to be at all the same, and it can be darker than that one in themes (since obviously that&#39;s a very light-hearted, family friendly game). I also like games that involve some component of journeying or adventure, and I&#39;m big on beautiful artwork. Not sure if there&#39;s anything out there that fits, or at least fits <em>some</em> of these ideas. Let me know what y&#39;all think; thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted", "id": 1059768, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1f68cl6/good_postapocalyptic_board_games_with_more_nature", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Good post-apocalyptic board games with more nature", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-01T06:41:52+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The objective of this board game is the players have to reach the finish point from starting point like snakes and ladders.

When a player&#39;s pawn reaches in a card tile the players have to roll dice 2nd time in their turn , if even then players receive a good and positive card which helps in faster progression but when the dice gives odd number the player receive a bad or negative card which slows their progression. For each bad card recieved player also get a token.
