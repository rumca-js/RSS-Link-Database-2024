I\u2019m slowly getting into self hosted and I have a question about torrent / vpn. I have my old computer running Ubuntu as I wanted an easy first build. On this Ubuntu I have downloaded deluge torrent client, emby and few other things. I\u2019m able to connect to these apps on my other computer just using the private ip and port combination. Everything was working as expected. But when I installed nordvpn client on Ubuntu and got it to connect, now I am no longer able to access ssh/deluge or any other app running on Ubuntu from my other computer. I wanted to install vpn to hide the torrent traffic. I tried using socks5 proxy from nordvpn but only worked for a day and now it just doesn\u2019t work. I read online and seems like socks5 is not reliable with nordvpn. So my question is how can I run nordvpn while it doesn\u2019t break lan connections? Or should I use something else to hide torrent traffic?
