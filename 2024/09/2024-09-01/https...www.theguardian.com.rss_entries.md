<p>Parliament was diminished and trivialised under Conservative rule.

The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/17/what-bills-are-included-in-the-kings-speech-and-what-will-they-do">king’s speech</a> in July set out an ambitious programme to change the way Britain is run: a new wave of devolution; new structures for the delivery and ownership of public services; new workers’ rights; and more.</p><p>This could be the most consequential session since the battle to settle the terms of Brexit. In their final years in power, the Conservatives ran out of ideas and were too divided to develop policies of substance.

<p>The nature of work is evolving rapidly, and many of us can benefit from more flexible and secure employment</p><p>In a digital age, getting away from the office is a necessary but not sufficient condition of being on holiday. Work encroaches on leisure time by multiple channels. The potential to be available by email can mutate into an obligation. Even when there is no direct pressure from bosses or colleagues, the psychological habit of logging on, spurred by fear of exclusion, can be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/12/parents-workplace-families-survey-flexibility">hard to overcome</a>.</p><p>This trend was established before the pandemic, but patterns of remote and hybrid working established in lockdown have further dissolved boundaries between work and home. That fluidity is mostly a benefit for employers and employees alike. It can widen labour market participation for people with disabilities or caring duties. There are good reasons why offices didn’

It was not, United so feeble, their first-half disaster-class epitomised by a horrible performance by Casemiro.

<p>Walter Salles’s first drama feature since 2012 tells the story of the Paivas, whose sunny 70s existence is wrecked by the arrest and disappearance of their father </p><p>The Paivas are a liberal middle-class household in sun-splashed Rio de Janeiro, generally joyous in the way of all happy families. They like laughing and dancing and playing volleyball by the sea. But it’s the early 1970s; Brazil is under military rule and anyone deemed a threat risks immediate arrest. When the Paivas (mum, dad, five kids) huddle together for a photo on the beach it’s a safe bet that what they are recording is the end of an era.</p><p>Possibly director Walter Salles makes a little too much of the family’s good cheer, emphasising the sunshine so that we feel more acutely the cold rain when it falls. The Brazilian film-maker knew the Paivas as a child and therefore his fact-based account of their plight is understandably compromised and prone to a streak of sentimentality. Nonetheless, I’m Still Here

With Mount injured and McTominay sold, he may now be Bruno Fernandes’s deputy as the No 10 – and he was sensational in that slot for Denmark against Slovenia at the Euros.</p><p><strong>“A lot of chat about Liverpool’s contract situation,” says DDJ Stephens,</strong> “a lot about how Slot’s style is similar but more calm and patient... all good, but why is nobody talking about Nunez not getting any game time under Slot yet, despite his professed desire to make him the big nine for Liverpool?” I think he did come on for the last 20 minutes or so against Brentford, but point taken.</p> <a href="https://www.thegua

<p>Lewis grappled with serious themes with The Day the Clown Cried, but as this documentary reveals, to the end he remained haunted by its failure</p><p>In 1971 Jerry Lewis, America’s most famous comedian, decided to swing for the fences and make his masterpiece. The Day the Clown Cried was a Holocaust tale about Helmut Doork, a hapless party entertainer who becomes a death camp pied piper. Lewis starred and directed, overseeing every aspect of a fraught shoot in Sweden, but the man misstepped badly and the film never saw the light of day. It has since become legend, buried forever and apparently for good reason.</p><p>Now along comes Michael Lurie and Eric Friedler’s flawed but engrossing documentary to pick over the wreckage, shine a UV lamp on the crime scene and – best of all – reveal extended segments of a picture that is destined to remain incomplete. For much of its running time, From Darkness to Light is a jerry-rigged cuttings job, lifting talking-head interviews from Ferne P

<p>When my father died my grief was deep – for him and the dad I wished he’d been</p><p>Grief is a thing with wings. It swoops in when and how it wants, often uninvited. When I think of my father, I think of sound. His laughter: a deep rumble from his slightly distended gut, ending with a sigh, as if he were reluctant to let it go. The gentle push of his windscreen-shaped glasses up the bridge of his nose. I think of 5am wake-up calls – me at five or six, my brother five years older, both of us trudging drowsily to the dining table for maths lessons. I think of his short afro, often patted into a near perfect square.</p><p>An ex-military man, his life was ruled by discipline. He both scared and fascinated me. I was in awe of his mind: brilliant with numbers yet complex, shielded by an impenetrable layer. I admired his style: beige and unremarkable, distinctly his. His personality was uninhibited, exuberant, vivacious. He loved entertaining, clinking champagne glasses at our home on Vi

## Going up: Can Britain’s empty department stores be brought back to life?

<p>With many branches of famous chains lying empty, work is under way to transform them into housing, hotels, offices, independent shops and more. Could this be the key to revitalising the high street?</p><p>Department stores, once palaces of delight and theatres of modernity, enclosed commercial town squares where you might meet, fall in love, get married and furnish your new home, are now none of these things. Empty, cold and bulky, they occupy town centres like fridge freezers that no one will take away, signs of the more general malaise of high streets, their long frontages of boarded-up windows sapping whatever life there still might be.</p><p>Yet there are signs of hope. Just as warehouses and workshops were turned into homes and studios when industry retreated 50 years ago, so might department stores. Their low values are provoking creative thinking about their future. The £25,000 Davidson prize, an annual design award for “transformative architecture of the home”, has this yea

<p>Jay Rayner became our restaurant critic 25 years ago. In this extract from his deliciously revealing new book, he shares memories – and recipes inspired by his favourite restaurant dishes</p><p>When I was eight or nine years old, my mother told me I&nbsp;had “the Greenspan arse”. I knew she meant it fondly. John Greenspan, who was stocky and bearded, was my mother’s first cousin, the child of a great-aunt I had never met. He was a regular visitor to our house, along with his brood; a sweet and funny man who treated us kids like people who were a part of the conversation. I liked him, which was good because he was also my childhood dentist, although I later concluded he was only marking time. John, who died in 2023, eventually moved from London to San Francisco, where he became an eminent professor of dental surgery and a world-renowned researcher into Aids/HIV. I did not share his academic prowess. Apparently, I&nbsp;only shared his arse.</p><p>My mother’s point was that a branch o

<p>Luckily his sister finds the concept rather easier</p><p>My son is extremely, perhaps miraculously, affectionate toward his sister. We avoided the landmines of sibling rivalry and brotherly contempt we’d seen in so many of our friends’ second or third kids – primarily, we think, because the four-year age gap between them negated any sense that he was in direct competition with this cute little pet we’d just ordered. He immediately embraced his baby sister as a novelty; a sometimes loud, smelly doll that captivated him and, better yet, earned him brownie points any time he was nice to it.</p><p>Within days of her being born, he was telling everyone she was ‘his’ baby, and would make a grand performance of fetching her things and patting her on the head. Though we largely took this to be performative, it became clear that his affection was in earnest when he started waking her in the night to stroke her face and ‘make sure she was all right’.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/

<p>Moving in small steps risks aggravating both Europhiles and Europhobes while doing little to help lift the economy</p><p>Every prime minister has their verbal tell-tales. “Reset” is a favourite Starmerism. When <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cz73yjned4xt">he visited Berlin last week</a> to pave the way to a bilateral co-operation treaty, the prime minister told us he was there as part of a “wider reset” in Britain’s relations with Europe.
