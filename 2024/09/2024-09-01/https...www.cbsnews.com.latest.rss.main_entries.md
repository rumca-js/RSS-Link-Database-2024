Correspondent Faith Salie talks with Joseph Weishaar, who was a 25-year-old architectural intern when his design for the memorial beat out more than 360 applicants from over 20 countries; and with artist Sabin Howard, for whom devising and sculpting the 60-foot-long sculpture dramatizing the horrors of war, titled "A Soldier's Journey," was itself a battle between those frequent belligerents: artist and bureaucracy.
