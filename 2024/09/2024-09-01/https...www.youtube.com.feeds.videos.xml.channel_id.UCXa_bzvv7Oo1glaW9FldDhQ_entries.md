Test Drive Unlimited 2 came out all the way back in 2011, but after 13 long years of endless waiting, the series’ hiatus is finally about to come to an end. Nacon and KT Racing will soon be releasing Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, and based on what we have seen so far, the open world racer is taking promising shape.

Few franchises spark debate and conversation to the degree that Metal Gear does, but even within the series, no game has done that quite the way that Metal Gear Solid 5 did.

Hideo Kojima left Konami under acrimonious circumstances shortly after development wrapped up, which capped off what had already been a long and eventful development cycle. Here, we’re going to talk about all of that and more, as we discuss the reveal, development, launch, and more for Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain.

Some of the most popular titles in the world are part of the first-person shooter genre. Whether it's competitive multiplayer titles played in front of thousands online, live service titles that earn millions in revenue, or even story-driven campaigns, they're widespread and extraordinarily successful.
