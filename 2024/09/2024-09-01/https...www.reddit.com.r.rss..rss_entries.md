<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;ve just switched back to using a chromium based browser. We all know that Google hates RSS. Although they still give it to Youtube.</p> <p>Does anyone know of a good extension that will show the correct feed URL, instead of the random crap that Chrome gives? I was using one a while ago but it seems to have gotten deleted. Oh yeah, I&#39;m mainly looking for a feed preview extension, like the one I have installed in Firefox. Not an RSS reader extension. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/unwaivering"> /u/unwaivering </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1f6ot3x/rss_extensions_for_chrome_that_show_the_corect/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1f6ot3x/rss_extensions_for_chrome_that_show_the_corect/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just wanted to ask if anyone here is writing their own blogs online?</p> <p>I occasionally write on Medium but am currently building my own website to host my blog there. It would be great to connect with others in the community and discover new blogs.</p> <p>If youâ€™d like to share, please drop a link and a brief description of what you usually write about.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ill_Connection_3017"> /u/Ill_Connection_3017 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1f6ldw6/anyone_here_writing_their_own_blog/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1f6ldw6/anyone_here_writing_their_own_blog/">[comments]</a></span>
