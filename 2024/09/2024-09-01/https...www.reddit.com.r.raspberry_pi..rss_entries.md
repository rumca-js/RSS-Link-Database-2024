<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m using a Raspberry Pi 4b to load a custom app website on several TVs. I used the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-raspberry-pi-in-kiosk-mode/">Official Kiosk Mode tutorial</a> and hit a few snags, but eventually got Wayfire autostart working on a TCL 32&quot; TV. The only thing that appears out of place is that the desktop initially loads with two taskbars, but apparently the larger one is running the fullscreen Chromium browser, so that&#39;s fine by me.</p> <p>On a larger Vizio 75&quot; TV, however, it seems to hang on the desktop and not accept any input. I plugged in a wireless keyboard/mouse and can&#39;t get the cursor to move. It stops after it says that it&#39;s connected to my local wi-fi. What might be happening here? Can a Pi 4b handle a larger screen? What logs would I check to see what happened? My Wayfire setup is below but it seems too simple to be the problem. Any ideas?</p> <p>EDIT: Fixed some Redd

But when I plug the ethernet cable into my computer and try to find the IP for Putty, it keeps connecting and then eventually disconnects. The man showed me it work so I think it is my fault tho</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Duuucki
