Data Oriented Design and Entity Component System Explained - Mathieu Ropert - ACCU 2024
---

Entity Component System (ECS) is an architecture paradigm used in several games to achieve performance by nudging programmers towards data oriented paradigms. But your project doesn't necessarily need to use ECS to benefit from the tech behind it!

In this talk, I will first explain and showcase the perks of Data Oriented Design, then explain how ECS arrange your data to optimize for fastest iteration (and reasonably fast lookup) speeds across one or several components and how you can reuse similar data structures in your program to achieve similar results.
