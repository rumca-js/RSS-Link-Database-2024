I picked up <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://play.date/games/electrolight/"><em><ins>Electrolight</ins></em></a> this weekend while looking for something in the same vein as the bite-sized puzzle/exploration game, <em>Eyeland</em> — cute, low-commitment, not particularly difficult — and found it to be utterly charming.</p>

<p>Apple’s M4 Mac mini will boast a ton of ports, but not a single one of them will be USB-A, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-01/apple-s-succession-strategy-m4-mac-mini-cheaper-ipad-magic-keyboard-m0jkdrx5?cmpid=BBD090124_POWERON" data-original-link="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-01/apple-s-succession-strategy-m4-mac-mini-cheaper-ipad-magic-keyboard-m0jkdrx5?cmpid=BBD090124_POWERON"><ins>Mark Gurman</ins></a>.
