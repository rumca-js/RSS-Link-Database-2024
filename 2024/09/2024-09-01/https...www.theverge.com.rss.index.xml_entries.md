  <p id="bcrFFb">US astronaut Barry Wilmore called NASA ground crew on Saturday, asking for help with a repetitive knocking sound that was coming from the Boeing Starliner craft. The interaction was captured by a <em>NASA Space Flight </em>forum member, who included a recording of it <a href="https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=61434.msg2620745">in a post</a> that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/09/starliners-speaker-began-emitting-strange-sonar-noises-on-saturday/">spotted by <em>Ars Technica</em></a><em>.</em></p>

  <p id="ItDaxO">It’s always sad when summer comes to a close. However, on the bright side, Labor Day represents yet another long weekend — not to mention an opportunity to save on a slew of goods before the holiday shopping season kicks off in earnest. Although Labor Day isn’t until tomorrow, September 2nd, many retailers are already offering steep discounts on a range of tech, some of which rival the Prime Day deals we saw in July.</p>
