We all know that Google hates RSS. Although they still give it to Youtube.</p> <p>Does anyone know of a good extension that will show the correct feed URL, instead of the random crap that Chrome gives? I was using one a while ago but it seems to have gotten deleted. Oh yeah, I&#39;m mainly looking for a feed preview extension, like the one I have installed in Firefox. Not an RSS reader extension.
