Dr. Jordan B. Peterson is a world-renowned clinical psychologist, Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto, and online educator known for his influential lectures on religious belief, narrative mythology, and personality analysis. In his latest DW+ series, Foundations of the West, Dr. Peterson travels to Jerusalem, Athens, and Rome to uncover the ancient roots of Western civilization. I was glad to join Dr. Peterson in the first part of the series, where we traversed the hills of Jerusalem and discussed the sacred stories at the heart of the West’s early flourishing. In today’s episode, Dr. Peterson shares a few behind-the-scenes anecdotes from the series’ filming, his personal religious journey, and his observations on the biblical themes of risk and sacrifice. Stay tuned and don’t miss Dr. Jordan Peterson’s latest insights, on this episode of the Sunday Special.
