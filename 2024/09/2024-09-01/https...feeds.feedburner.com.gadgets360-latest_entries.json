This field, hypothesised over 60 years ago, was observed during the Endurance rocket mission launched by NASA in May 2022. The ambipolar field, located in the ionosphere at around 250 kilometres above Earth's surface, plays a crucial role in balancing the forces between electrons and ions. This field helps regulate atmospheric density and influences the polar wind, which is responsible for stripping particles from the atmosphere and sending them into space. The measurements taken by the Endurance rocket revealed a minute electric potential change of just 0.55 volts, which, while small, is sufficient to account for the observed polar wind phenomena. This discovery not only confirms the presence of the ambipolar field but also offers new insights into how it affects Earth\u2019s atmosphere and potentially other planets with atmospheres.

Initially, NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Stephanie Wilson were part of the mission, but they are now eligible for future assignments. The decision to adjust the crew follows NASA\u2019s choice to fly an uncrewed Boeing Crew Flight Test, leaving two seats open on Crew-9. Joe Acaba, NASA\u2019s Chief Astronaut, made the decision to ensure a balanced and effective crew. Nick Hague will be on his third spaceflight, bringing valuable experience, while Aleksandr Gorbunov will embark on his first space mission.

Researchers from the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) in New York City have used AI to analyse extensive data from over 100,000 galaxies, observed through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This AI-driven approach allows for a detailed understanding of the universe's large-scale operations by examining small-scale galaxy distributions. The study's lead author, Chang Hoon Hahn from Princeton University, highlighted that this method achieves the accuracy of traditional analyses with significantly less data, enhancing data efficiency. This advancement could also help address the Hubble tension, a key issue in measuring the universe's expansion rate.

The company aims to revive extinct species such as the woolly mammoth by 2028. Their method involves transferring mammoth genes, which encode traits like shaggy fur and curved tusks, into the DNA of Asian elephants. Despite significant advances in genetic technology, this effort is not without controversy. Reviving these ancient giants promises to address ecological gaps left by their extinction. For instance, woolly mammoths played a crucial role in maintaining Arctic grasslands and their reintroduction could help combat climate change by restoring carbon-sequestering ecosystems. However, experts raise serious concerns about the feasibility and consequences of such ventures. The ecological balance could be disrupted if these creatures struggle to adapt or if they have unintended impacts on current ecosystems.
