The fourth entry in Tengo's 16-bit taste remake series, it's also arguably the most ambitious. Prior releases from Tengo Project, such as Pocky and Rocky Reshrined and The Ninja Warriors Once Again, were based on games that already existed in 16-bit form, making the transition easier to imagine - but this new game is based on an 8-bit NES game instead. As a result, everything needed to be completely re-imagined from the ground-up. From gameplay to visuals and audio, this is a masterpiece of pixel art action that simply must be experienced if you have any love for classic gaming.\n</p><p>\nTo refresh your memory, Tengo Project is a three-man group of creators that previously worked on classic Natsume games dating back to the 90s.
