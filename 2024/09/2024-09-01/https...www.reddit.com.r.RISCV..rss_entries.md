<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am selecting a topic related to RISCV for my final year project: 1. Regarding the bit-manipulation extension, I think the SweRV has Zbb and Zbs already. Shall I go for a full B-extension to the SweRV? Or shall I add B- extension to other core ( suggest if you know any). 2. Theres also a P-extension. Which open source core shall I add the P-extension to?</p> <p>If you have any other suggestions apart from the above two then do mention in the comments.

## Question on the pointer masking spec(Zjpm)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Community,</p> <p>In section 3.1 `<em>Ssnpm`</em> the spec states this for HLV/HSV instructions:</p> <blockquote> <p>In HS and M modes, pointer masking for these instructions is enabled or disabled `senvcfg.pmm` when their explicit memory access is performed as though in VU mode.</p> </blockquote> <p>I would have thought that this would be actually be controlled by the <em>Guest senvcfg.pmm (which is really vsenvcfg.pmm which is copied by the hypervisor into hstatus.pmm)</em> . This keeps with the tradition of PMM bits controlling the masking of the next lower privilege level.</p> <p>Or have I misunderstood something in the statement above? </p> <p>Thank you all. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dry_Warning_1950"> /u/Dry_Warning_1950 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1f61hrq/question_on_the_pointer_masking_speczjpm/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:/
