What we know on day 922</p><p><strong>Russia will make changes to its doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons in response to what it regards as western escalation in the war in Ukraine, state media quoted deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying on Sunday</strong>.<br>

<p>Lidded vessel is star object in rich Galloway Hoard and came from silver mine in what is now Iran</p><p>It is a star object of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/26/galloway-viking-hoard-acquired-by-national-museums-of-scotland">Galloway Hoard</a>, the richest collection of Viking-age objects ever found in Britain or Ireland, buried in AD900 and unearthed in a field in Scotland. Now a lidded silver vessel has been identified as being of west Asian origin, transported halfway around the world more than 1,000 years ago.</p><p>When it emerged from the ground a decade ago, the vessel was still wrapped in its ancient textiles, whose survival is extremely rare. Its surface could be seen only through X-ray scans. Since then, the textiles have been partially removed and preserved and the vessel has had laser cleaning to remove green corrosion over much of its silver surface. It has also undergone scientific analysis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/a

<p>Ahead of the publication of his book about leadership – definitely not aimed at Keir Starmer – the former prime minister talks about relinquishing power, why he’s not fazed about a second Trump term and being an AI evangelist</p><p>Were you to board an aeroplane piloted by a man who has never previously sat in a cockpit, you’d be alarmed. Were you to face surgery by a woman with no medical qualifications, you’d be frightened. Politics is the one profession that can put someone in a position of great power and responsibility without any prior experience or demonstration of ability. “It’s bizarre,” Tony Blair says. “In any other walk of life, that doesn’t happen.” When he became prime minister in 1997 he was in his early forties and an absolute neophyte at governing. He was much better at it, he believes, towards the end of his decade at No 10 than at the outset. So he’s written a book about the dos and the don’ts of leadership “because government is a science as well as an art”.</p>

<p>Just interrupt and say, ‘Sorry, I can’t bear film plots’</p><p><em><strong>The question </strong>I am a woman in my 30s and I notice I can find conversation unfulfilling. When I am with new people, I find myself either having a bit of commentary in my head or doing lots of listening to their problems, as they might overshare things and I </em><em>feel as if they are dumping on me. Such conversation feels unsatisfactory. This is not a feeling I get with older friends, where sharing and turn-taking is mostly natural and comfortable.</em></p><p><em>I notice that on dates someone might tell me anecdotes and I feel they aren’t connecting with me – sometimes a man will describe to me the plot of a film and I might be feeling desperately bored and be longing to be asked a question about myself or have a bit of back and forth about what is happening in the present moment. Do I have to push through that bit until I get to the comfortable conversation and parity stage?</em></p> <a href="http

<p>Satisfy your tastebuds with two recipes bursting with flavour </p><p>It is all over in seconds. A salty anchovy snatched from its tin; a jagged crumb of Parmesan, or a snaffled umeboshi plum. Sometimes it is the sour heat of a slice of vinegary cucumber, the one they call bread and butter pickle. I can conduct a hot and salty fridge raid in the blink of an eye. All too often it is the lid from the sushi ginger that gets unscrewed, the sweet heat of the satin-soft slices of root stopping me in my tracks.</p><p>But if I am looking for something a little more serious, it will be the homemade pickled ginger I head for, the one steeped in rice vinegar and orange, and whose ivory surface is shot through with the magenta of a few slices of stowaway beetroot. The introduction of the red root calms the ginger down, which tends to be much hotter and less sweet than the commercial versions. Use more sugar if you like a sweeter version. You could also cool the ginger down a little by using a l
