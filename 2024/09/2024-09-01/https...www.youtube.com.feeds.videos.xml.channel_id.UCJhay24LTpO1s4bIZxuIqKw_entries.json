But your project doesn't necessarily need to use ECS to benefit from the tech behind it!\n\nIn this talk, I will first explain and showcase the perks of Data Oriented Design, then explain how ECS arrange your data to optimize for fastest iteration (and reasonably fast lookup) speeds across one or several components and how you can reuse similar data structures in your program to achieve similar results.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2024/\nSponsored By think-cell\n---\n\nMathieu Ropert\n\nFrench C++ expert working on (somewhat) historical video games. Has a love/hate relationship with build systems but lately mostly focuses on performance and multithreading.
