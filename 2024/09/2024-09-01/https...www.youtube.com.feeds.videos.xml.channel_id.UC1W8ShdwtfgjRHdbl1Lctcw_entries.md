I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Italy 1940s, During the World War II, soldiers had the opportunity to visit places of historical interest. We start at Pompeii Soldiers visit the ancient city of Pompeii, with Mount Vesuvius visible in the distance. They explore the bustling streets and ruins, crossing crumbled buildings and ancient arches. Shots capture columns, palm trees, and a distant ruined staircase. A scene shows soldiers gazing over a massive ruin while smoking, as the camera captures panoramic views of the remnants of this city, devastated by the volcanic eruption.

Rome: soldiers stroll through a bustling square and admire the grand Roman structures. A Roman amphitheater or coliseum, currently used as a soccer field, is highlighted. Architectural details, such as a row of athletic statues and dramatic angles, are captured by the camera. The soldiers also explore the Catacombs of San Callisto and the iconic Colosseum, along with other landmark
