## The very simple reason I prefer physical over digital

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I own a Switch and try to buy most of my games for it physically. I can give you a bunch of reasons why, but here&#39;s the only reason it matters: price. </p> <p>I bought a cartridge copy of Paper Mario and The Thousand Year Door from an online seller for $50 flat. If I only had the option of buying digitally on the eShop, it would have cost me close to $90 with taxes where I live.</p> <p>I saved myself nearly $40 on a &quot;newish&quot; game that I never played before. If physical media wasn&#39;t a thing, I would have likely needed to pay much more or wait a long time for Nintendo to mark it down for sale (which they&#39;ll probably never sell for $50).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/abandonX4"> /u/abandonX4 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fkvl6t/the_very_simple_reason_i_prefer_physical_over/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/g
