<p>As a PC builder, I know you can’t beat the flexibility and utility of a full-sized, standard ATX build. But also… small form factor desktops are <em>just so pretty</em>. Fractal makes some of the prettiest SFF cases, including the super-compact Terra — and <a href="https://youtu.be/G_ZrS3HYOF8">PCWorld’s video team</a> got their hands on the latest Fractal Design, um, design, the Era 2.</p>



<p>The original Era SFF case was gorgeous with its curved metal exterior and wood-accented top (a trend we see continued on the North and others), but it was knocked for its poor cable routing and cooling options.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/era/era-2/charcoal-gray/">The new version of the Era SFF</a> keeps the original’s slick styling with a much more flexible interior. Dig the more capacious cutouts on the aluminum sides for bet

<p>Acer’s Nitro V is one of the most popular gaming laptops around because it’s a great deal — so much so that it’s consistently the best seller in its category on Amazon.</p>



<p>But right now, you can get one of these bad boys for an even better price of <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/266475158488">just $606.39 after discounts on eBay</a>. Snatch it quick if you’re in the market because this deal is going to go fast.</p>



<p>Two things to know before you check out: first, this is a refurbished laptop. But it isn’t your usual roll-of-the-dice-when-buying-refurbished piece of hardware! This one is sold directly by Acer (via the company’s official eBay account) and it comes with a two-year Allstate warranty included in the price. That’s about as good as it gets for a refurb deal.</p>



<p>Second, you’ll need to apply a coupon code (<a href="https://sli

<p>YouTube, you’re exhausting. While I spend more time watching YouTube videos than any of the video services I actually pay for, it’s so jam-packed with ads that I’ve spent a lot of energy trying not to see them. And now Google’s web video monopoly is going to show ads even when you’re not watching and the video is paused. Great.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248391/youtube-pause-ads-widely-rolling-out">The Verge reports</a> that YouTube is rolling out advertisements that show up when you pause videos, continuing experiments that the company started a year ago. A YouTube representative confirmed that the practice will now become commonplace “as we’ve seen both strong advertiser and strong viewer response.”</p>



<p>I can’t argue with that, but I’ll point out that retching up your Subway sandwich in response to salmonella poisoning

<p>As an objective journalistic observer of the tech and business world, I’d like to state the inarguable, quantifiable, unavoidable fact that LinkedIn sucks. It sucks <em>really hard</em>. LinkedIn is a terrible fusion of the worst parts of social networks, job boards, and office culture — and it’s about to suck even harder with the help of AI.</p>



<p>Like seemingly every large tech company these days, LinkedIn is injecting generative AI into its platform. (You may have already spotted it on prompts that “help” users write posts or messages.) But the Microsoft-owned website is now scraping its user data to train its artificial intelligence systems. Naturally, you’re opted into sharing your data with LinkedIn’s AI for free, without any kind of message or alert. (Unless you’re in the EU, where this kind of sneaky behavior is illegal.)</p>

<p>There are many ways to organize your workstation setup, but here’s an innovative one you probably haven’t seen before: a docking station for your laptop that doubles as a monitor stand and triples as a wireless charging pad for your phone or mouse. Whoa!</p>



<p>Right now, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Docking-Wireless-Charging-ThinkPad/dp/B0BNZ4D72B/">this Anker USB-C Docking Station is on sale for $200 at Amazon</a>, and that’s a great price considering that other USB-C docks — without the cool extra features — can cost more than twice that.</p>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-box-text inline-box">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You’ll see this dock is listed as $250, and that’s because the special deal price of $200 is only for Prime members. If you don’t have Prime, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">sign up for a free 30-

<p>Whether it’s Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, the browser is the program we use on a day-to-day basis. That said, most of us continue to use the same old browser even when there are better contenders out there. New York-based The Browser Company hopes to change that with the launch of Arc.</p>

<p>While I agree that most meetings could probably be emails, that doesn’t mean you can skip out on said meetings. And when it’s time to hop on a call, you’re gonna want a crisp webcam that not only makes you look your best but also comes with a built-in privacy shutter.</p>



<p>That’s why I really like the Logitech Brio 101 webcam, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Webcam-Meetings-Streaming-Built/dp/B0BXGFFSL1/">right now it’s on sale for a mere $25 on Amazon</a>. That’s a smooth 38 percent off.</p>



<p>This Logitech Brio 101 webcam has a 1080p resolution, which means your video feed will look clear and professional. It also has the ability to automatically adjust brightness levels and reduce shadows in low light conditions, ensuring that you really do look your best at all times.</p>

<p>Microsoft has invested heavily in increasing the security of Windows. The firewall, the automatically activated antivirus program, various security functions for protection against boot viruses and much more help to ensure that hackers and malware cannot simply hijack a Windows PC. </p>



<p> However, there is more to this than the standard configuration. For example, various functions that pose a security risk under certain circumstances can be deactivated. </p>

<p>I spend a lot of time searching Amazon listings. In addition to standard shopping for cheap tchotchkes, I have to find deals to show you, dear reader, pretty much every work day. And also “Prime Day,” which has somehow become <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2367019/amazon-prime-day-everything-you-need-to-know.html">multiple weeks every year</a>. I’ve noticed a funny trend: the “brand names” or store names for the third-party Amazon sellers are getting really frickin’ stupid. </p>



<p>There’s a reason for this. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shipping">Drop shipping</a>, the practice of opening a “store” that’s basically just passing along mass-produced generic items to shoppers through a unified online storefront, is now a massive and inescapable practice.
