This one was months in the making! If you’ve seen Effie Passero live on PMJ tour, you know that her brilliant, powerful voice has the rare ability to make an audience feel things they’ve never felt before. Here she is, front and center on one of our most ambitious remakes yet:  “It Must Have Been Love” — Roxette’s 1987 classic from “Pretty Woman” — complete with a strings-and-choir nod to the classic records from the 1960s “Wall of Sound” era.
