Divalent samarium compounds are important reagents for reductive transformations in organic chemistry. However, currently, a high amount of this reagent is required in most reactions, and it also necessitates the use of harmful chemicals. To address this issue, researchers have developed a visible-light-antenna ligand that coordinates with stable trivalent samarium compounds, which, upon exposure to visible light, are reduced to divalent samarium, enabling milder conditions and smaller amounts of samarium for reactions.

The team has taken a big step towards realizing its dream of separating hydrogen isotopes at room temperature at low cost.

## Lake ice quality degrading as planet warms -- skaters, hockey players, ice truckers on thin ice
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240919115157.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240919115157.htm)

Ice may look safe for a game of pick-up hockey on the lake, but as a new study has found, looks can be deceiving. Warming winters are not only affecting ice thickness and timing -- when a lake freezes and thaws -- but also quality, making it potentially unstable and unsafe. The problem, say researchers, is that the unpredictable and warmer winter weather is creating thinner layers of black ice and sometimes a corresponding thicker layer of white ice, the unstable kind. The two combined can make for treacherous conditions.

Rising temperatures are thought to reduce the number of ice crystals in clouds, leading to the formation of liquid-dominated clouds. However, a new study has found that Arctic warming is causing an increase in the emission of natural aerosols from snow/ice-free barren and vegetated areas in the Arctic. These aerosols can encourage ice crystal formation in mixed-phase clouds, potentially affecting cloud composition and the Arctic climate.
