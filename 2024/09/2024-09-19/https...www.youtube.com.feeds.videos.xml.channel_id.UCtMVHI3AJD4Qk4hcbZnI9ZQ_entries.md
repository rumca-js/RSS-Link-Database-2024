Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at what appears to be a patent lawsuit regarding Palworld from Nintendo. Game features and mechanics have at times been the discussion of patents and ultimately stifle actual innovation in the medium and this time it's interesting to see what Nintendo has apparently considered to be uniquely theirs after letting Palworld thrive for nine months. Thanks for watching!
