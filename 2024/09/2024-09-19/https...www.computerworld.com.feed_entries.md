<p>The UN Secretary-General’s Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence has released its <a href="https://www.un.org/ai-advisory-body">final report</a> — “Governing AI for Humanity” — detailing how AI can best serve humanity, especially people who are often underrepresented and left out of such discussions.</p>



<p>The report builds on months of extensive global consultation with more than 2,000 participants and the publication of a provisional report last December. The group behind the report is described as the world’s first and most representative collection of experts capable of reflecting humanity’s aspirations for AI.</p>



<p>The final report sets out a plan to manage AI-related risks and

<p>Beginning with the new year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wants his employees back in the office five days a week, returning to an office routine that was common before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the workplace.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-employees-blast-andy-jassy-113949840.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-employees-blast-andy-jassy-113949840.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backlash from employees was nearly instantaneous</a>, as they berated Jassy — and the return-to-work policy — and vowed to quit. Others demanded raises in exchange for in-office work requirements.</p>

<p>Europe’s bureaucrats continue to do their best to ensure Apple is forced to sell the world’s worst operating system, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_4761">announcing plans</a> to force Apple to open up its systems even more than it already has.</p>



<p>In a triumph of bureaucratic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublespeak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doublespeak</a>, the European Union doesn’t argue that it’s attempting to force the issue. Instead, it says it wants to “assist” Apple. “Today, the European Commission has started two specification proceedings to assist Apple in complying with its interoperability obligations under the Di

<p>The United Nations’ High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, created last year to address AI governance issues, has made seven recommendations to address the risks with this technology in its first report, just published.</p>



<p>The document, entitled <a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/governing_ai_for_humanity_final_report_en.pdf">Governing AI for humanity</a>, highlights the importance of creating a global dialogue — the European Union is one of the few to have acted with its <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3480307/eu-ai-act-sensible-guardrail-or-innovation-killer.html">EU AI Act</a> — by building a global fund that addresses differences in capacity and coll

<p>Google landed a major antitrust victory on Wednesday as the EU’s Court of Justice annulled a $1.7 billion (€1.49 billion) antitrust fine against the search giant.</p>



<p>The EU court stated that the European Commission failed to fully consider all relevant factors regarding the duration of the abusive contract clauses. The court, however, upheld most of the Commission’s findings.</p>



<p>“By today’s judgment, the General Court, after having upheld the majority of the Commission’s findings, concludes that that institution committed errors in its assessment of the duration of the clauses at issue, as well as of the market covered by them in 2016,” the court said in a statement.</p>

<p>As organizations continue to adopt generative AI (genAI) tools and platforms and explore how they can create efficiencies and boost worker productivity, they’re also grappling with the high costs and complexity of the technology.</p>



<p>The foundation of genAI and AI in general are <a href="https://builtin.com/data-science/beginners-guide-language-models" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">language models</a>, the algorithms and neural networks that power chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard.
