After Raiders of the Lost Ark and Temple of Doom, Indy came back for The Last Crusade, the third and final movie in the series. They never made another one. It just wouldn’t make sense to do that.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade definitely raises some questions, like how crazy is it that Indy got all his iconic items in like a 15 minute period on the same day? Why didn’t Henry warn Indy about his nazi girlfriend? What’s up with all the bad decisions made during chase scenes?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.
