## Too many ‘candid’ social media videos are obviously, agonisingly fake. So why are viewers laughing? | Rebecca Shaw

<p>Yes, I’m talking about silly clips – but if people think entirely staged pranks are real then I fear for us all</p><p>With advances in technology including AI and ChatGPT, and increasingly realistic fake images everywhere, media literacy is diving towards an all-time low. There are many areas where a lack of critical thinking has had and will have devastating effects on society. I’m here to talk about something that is not as serious but that does have one daily impact – annoying me.</p><p>It happens when I’m scrolling TikTok, or X, or Instagram (or one of the many other apps I use to make sure my brain is never alone with itself), and the algorithm serves me up a video it thinks I’ll like. It will be a video that lots of other people have watched, liked and commented on with a series of crying laughing emojis, or “LMFAO” or “omg so funny”. So with this forward sizzle, I click, excited and open-hearted, ready to laugh.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep

It would be nice to know where he thinks his first two games of this season stack up in the rankings.</p><p>The Broncos have started the season 0-2. Push the timeline back further and Denver have only won two of their last eight games, with both wins coming over a team quarterbacked by Easton Stick. Through two weeks this season, the Broncos’ offense has laid an egg in four out of eight quarters. Payton, once at the vanguard of offensive football, looks someone out of ideas – or at least out of time. His offense is stuck

Early in the year, Edgar suffered an eye injury that forced emergency surgery and slow recovery of full function.</p><p>“It’s getting better but it’s worse when I’m tired,” says the dramatist, 76.

<p>Concern around Tua Tagovailoa’s health is understandable.

As players, we are acutely aware of the risks we take every time we step on to the field.

Yet, that pain often brings back memories of treasured moments – the locker room camaraderie, the weight room grind and the battles on the field.

Despite the suffering, most of us continue to play the game we love while we still can, ac

<p>Provocatively disarranging its chronology, this gruesome shocker sports with misogyny but its technical brilliance is undeniable</p><p>Writer-director JT Mollner shuffles the narrative deck with this macabre, ingenious serial-killer horror whose chapters are shown out of linear order. Each storytelling card is dealt with insolent provocation, a swaggeringly unhelpful contribution to the issues of sexual politics that we see male and female arresting officers debate at the very end. It recalls the look of movies made four or five decades ago; shot on 35mm film by actor turned cinematographer Giovanni Ribisi, it is a grisly shocker sporting with misogyny and the final-girl trope. There’s something of Tobe Hooper her, with an eerie “split diopter” camera shot in the manner of Brian De Palma (showing a looming face in closeup and an equally focused figure way behind) and a terrified woman at the wheel of a 1978 Ford Pinto (the car featured in the 1983 Stephen King chiller Cujo).</p><p>
