The United States is already a global leader in traffic-related fatalities, with a&#160;thirty-percent jump in the last decade. That’s in contrast to&#160;every other developed country, which saw a decline. 40,000 Americans die every year in traffic fatalities. And while tech advancements have made life safer for drivers and passengers, the same can&#8217;t be true for [&#8230;]

As California edges closer to enacting SB 1047, the state risks throwing the entire AI industry into turmoil. The bill has already cleared the legislative process and now sits on Governor Newsom’s desk, leaving him with a critical decision: veto this ill-conceived policy or sign away the U.S.’ future in AI. While Newsom appears skeptical [&#8230;]

The FBI and DOJ have always felt comfortable going after Islamic extremists. That&#8217;s the sort of thing they like to do. They like it so much they&#8217;ll radicalize vulnerable people for the sole purpose of locking them up for multiple decades. A lot of digital ink has been spilled covering the FBI&#8217;s success rate in [&#8230;]

Automation and language learning models aren&#8217;t inherently bad. But when half-cooked automation is layered on top of very broken systems by greedy, incompetent people, it certainly can be. See, for example, the way brunchlords are using &#8220;AI&#8221; to cut corners or undermine labor in journalism, or the way insurance companies are using it to automatically [&#8230;]

Update: Annnnnnnnd&#8230; Cloudflare has already said it will isolate and block Brazilian IP addresses from reaching ExTwitter. Original story below. It appears that Elon has decided to take the Brazilian hornet’s nest he’d already kicked over the last few weeks and start slamming it with a baseball bat. It’s unlikely this will end well.
