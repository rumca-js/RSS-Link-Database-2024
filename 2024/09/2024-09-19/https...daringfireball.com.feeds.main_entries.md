<p>Still a little awkward for a tentpole marketing feature of the iPhones 16 arriving tomorrow, but a public beta is a notable milestone.</p>

<p>One of the many memorable moments in Steve Jobs’s 2007 introduction of the original iPhone was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/09/sj-buttons.jpeg">this slide</a> showing four of the then-leading smartphones on the market. Jobs explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, why do we need a revolutionary user interface? Here’s four
smartphones, right? Motorola Q, the BlackBerry, Palm Treo, Nokia
E62 — the usual suspects. And, what’s wrong with their user
interfaces? Well, the problem with them is really sort of in the
bottom 40 there. It’s this stuff right there. They all have these
keyboards that are there whether or not you need them to be there.
And they all have these control buttons that are fixed in plastic
and are the same for every application. Well, every application
wants a slightly different user interface, a slightly optimized
set of buttons, just for it.</p>

<p>And what happens if you think of a great idea six months from now?
You can’t run around and add a butt
