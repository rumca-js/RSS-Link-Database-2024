Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Gavin Newsom just signed a law in California banning "deceptive" memes. But what qualifies as deception? And who decides? Also, residents of another small American town are speaking out about the Haitian migration crisis. I debate the moon landing with Joe Rogan. Howard Stern confesses that he hates his own audience. And Australia is about to release its own version of the Office. Unfortunately, it looks like Australia is about as good at comedy as it is at breakdancing.
