The team needed a robust solution for its Hermes Fulfilment site in Haldensleben, Germany, where as many as 40,000 cartons of goods move through on peak days. Here, the Otto Group has become the first company in Europe to deploy the mobile case handling robot Stretch, which unloads floor-loaded trailers and containers. \n\nStretch supports associates by lifting and lowering heavy inbound cases, and frees them up to focus on other valuable work in the logistics center. The Otto Group has also deployed the Spot robot across three sites to support predictive maintenance efforts by collecting thermal images, conducting acoustic vibration detection, reading analog gauges, and detecting ultrasonic air and gas leaks.
