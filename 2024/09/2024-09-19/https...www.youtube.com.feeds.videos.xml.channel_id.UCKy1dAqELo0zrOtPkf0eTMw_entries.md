In today's Daily Fix:
Sony has revealed yet another PlayStation 5, but this one is a limited edition variant of the PS5 Slim and PS5 Pro. To celebrate the 30th Anniversary of the PlayStation 1, new throwback PS1-style PS5 Slims and PS5 Pros will be available for preorder on September 26th. And it's not just the conosles—the DualSense and DualSense edge are each getting PS1 variants, complete with the chunky connector where the USB-C plug is. These will be extremely limited, and will be released on November 21st, so get your pre-orders in once they become available. In other news, Nintendo has finally sued Palworld developer Pocketpair for copyright infringement. This has been anticipated by many in the games industry, every since Palworld was announced and everyone thought the game's "pals" looked an awful lot like Pokémon. And finally, game publisher KRAFTON may have received kudos for "saving" Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango GameWorks, but they admit they don't think a sequel will sell.

## These 30th anniversary PlayStation consoles and controllers look incredible. #ps5 #playstation

In our follow-up preview of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, we took a deep-dive into the comprehensive character creator and the combat in BioWare's big new upcoming RPG. The fourth Dragon Age game has so many more hair options than Dragon Age: Inquisition, which famously had some pretty static designs. The DATV character creator boasts up to 88 hairstyles for Rook, along with all kinds of tattoos, makeup, facial hair and more for humans, elves, dwarves and Qunari.

Seeing Solas and Varric again was a delight, even if Solas, the Dread Wolf, seems bent on tearing down the Veil. We’re returning to Thedas but this time to the north where we’ll be visiting Tevinter, Antica, Rivain and the Arlathan forest. Minrathous is one of our first big stops, home to characters like Dorian, Maeveris Tilani and Fenris from Dragon Age 2.

Picking up a week after where director Matt Reeves’ 2022 film The Batman left off, The Penguin tracks Oz Cobb as he schemes his way up the ranks of the Gotham City underworld. But it’s also a story about broken people in a broken city who are just trying to find their place.  

IGN recently sat down with cast members Colin Farrell (“Oz Cobb”), Cristin Milioti (“Sofia Falcone”), Rhenzy Feliz (“Victor Aguilar”), and Deirdre O’Connell (“Francis Cobb”) for an extended chat about the spin-off, including a discussion about why the Dark Knight doesn't appear in it and how the show compares to another HBO gangster series, The Sopranos.

The Penguin premieres on HBO on September 19th. HBO will re-air the series premiere multiple times over the weekend, including Sunday, September 22 at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT. Sunday nights at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT will be the debut day and time of all subsequent new episodes of the eight-episode series on HBO and Max, continuing with episode two on Sunday, September 29.

With the influx of digital card games gaining popularity over the years, it’s unsurprising to see a new one pop up here and there. With that said, seeing Pokemon releasing a new digital card game with Pokemon TCG Pocket has had some fans confused – including myself. With the existence of Pokemon Trading Card Game Live, the crossover is quite apparent, but the team at The Pokemon Company and Creatures have a different goal in mind for this new game. From what I’ve seen so far, Pocket is less about the competitive meta of the physical Pokemon trading card game and more about the collecting aspect of the beautiful cards fans know and love – and that’s not such a bad thing. Previewed by Mike Mamon.

Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster reviewed by Luke Reilly on PC. Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.

"Above all, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster preserves the iconic original’s experience while including some very logical and welcome modern adjustments, like auto-saving, a new navigation system, and NPCs that seem less inclined to serve themselves for lunch. Not all the new voice acting is an improvement – and there are a variety of other tedious flaws that have gone unfixed – but wading back into the Willamette Parkview Mall after all these years has been an effective reminder of just how brilliant the original Dead Rising was back in 2006. Coaxing as many hapless consumers as I can back through throngs of the festering undead is as compulsive as it was nearly two decades ago. At the very least, now that I’ve paused to actually package this review together, it’s still gnawing at me to return – and that’s the sign of any great game (or reasonably effective zombie, for that mat

Satisfactory is an open-world factory building game that lets you create sprawling builds across the planet. But you don't always start off with tons of resources to build whatever you want. You'll have to build your way across the land by mining natural resources and eventually automating all of your processes. Here's a look at what it's like to go from 8 hours in Satisfactory to 130 hours with sprawling train tracks.
