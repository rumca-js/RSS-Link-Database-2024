<p>The ripples from Concord’s seismic implosion are still fanning out since Sony decided to take the game offline earlier this month. Now, the game’s director has reportedly decided to bow out gracefully. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811"><em><ins>Kotaku</ins></em></a> reported that game director Ryan Ellis of Firewalk Studios told staff members that he’s stepping down from his position. Ellis, who cofounded Firewalk after a stint as the creative director of <em>Destiny 2</em>, will remain with the studio but only in a support role.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the staff at Firewalk are still waiting to hear what Sony plans to do with their underperforming game. Just two weeks after Concord’s release, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/concord-is-going-offline-two-weeks-after-its-ps5-and-pc-launch-163134728.html"><ins>Sony pulled the team shooter offline</ins></a> on S

<p>Get ready to question humanity’s control over the technology that surrounds us because another season of Netflix’s <em>Black Mirror</em> is in the works. Earlier today, the official <em>Black Mirror</em> X page revealed the cast of the new season coming next year along with some other interesting clues and Easter eggs.</p>
<p>The video features an old, flickering computer screen that appears to unload a complete data dump of the entire cast for season 7. Some of the names that jumped out at us includes Oscar nominee Paul Giamatti, <em>Doctor Who</em> star and Oscar winner Peter Capaldi (he won in 1995 with his live action short film <em>Franz Kafka’s It’s a Wonderful Life</em>), Awkwafina, Issa Rae, Tracee Ellis Ross and Rashida Jones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The original PlayStation console, otherwise called the PS1, came out in Japan in late 1994. So we are quickly coming up on the console’s 30th birthday. To commemorate the occasion, Sony just revealed nostalgia-tinged redesigns of both the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/19/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-with-a-nostalgic-look/"><ins>PS5 and the forthcoming PS5 Pro</ins></a>. They look like the original PlayStation, with that classic gray colorway and the old-school logo. Gamers of a certain age will have a hard time resisting these things.

<p>Google is rolling out a really useful update for Google Password Manager, allowing users to sync passkeys across their many devices. Up until this point, folks could only save passkeys to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/13168025?hl=en-GB&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;oco=1">Google Password Manager on Android</a>, so the cross-device utility was limited. It was possible to use the passkeys on other devices, but it would require users to scan a QR code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The update allows for passkey saving via Google Password Manager on Windows, macOS, Linux and, of course, Android. ChromeOS is currently being beta tested, so that functionality should come sooner rather than later. Google also says that iOS support is “coming soon.”</p>

The organization said that many social media sites and streaming services engage in “vast surveillance of consumers in order to monetize their personal information.” This mass surveillance impacts adult users, but also children and teens.</p>
<p>This isn’t exactly surprising. After all, the old saying goes “if you&#39;re not paying for the product, you are the product.” Still, the study suggests a level of surveillance that could shock even the most cynical among us. According to the FTC, these entities collect and “indefinitely retain troves of data.” The companies also engage in “broad data sharing” with “woefully inadequate” security measures.</p>

<p>With the iPhone 16 Pro, the big announcements were the cameras and Apple Intelligence. The problem is Apple Intelligence isn’t quite here yet. We can test some features in the developer beta, but that’s not necessarily what we’ll get when the update rolls out in October. So our focus is more on iOS 18 (deep dive on the beta <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-18-preview-waiting-on-apple-intelligence-for-the-true-upgrade-143059859.html">here</a>) and the hardware changes.</p>
<p>The big hardware change is the camera button. But it’s not just a button, really. Located on the right side of the device, it has touch and pressure sensors to give greater control with swipes and semi-presses. (That’s in addition to the Action Button, which is still on the left edge of the iPhone).</p>
