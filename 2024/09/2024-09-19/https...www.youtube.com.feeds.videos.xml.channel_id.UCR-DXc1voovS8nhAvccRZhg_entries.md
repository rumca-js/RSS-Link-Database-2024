But... it's a bit expensive! You can find the printer at https://www.positron3d.com

If you're just getting started or don't want to build your own tiny printer, I also recommend a Bambu Labs A1 Mini or Prusa Mini; they're much cheaper and you won't have to spend so much time building them.

But building a 3D printer is half the fun! Maintaining it is the other half :)
