<p>Rows over donations and the role of Sue Gray have exposed a disturbing lack of grip in Keir Starmer’s government</p><p>Labour’s conference next week will be a celebration of the party’s spectacular victory over the Conservatives in July. Understandably so. But warning signs for the future cannot now be brushed aside. Neither the government nor Sir Keir Starmer has enjoyed a political honeymoon since July. <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/fall-in-public-favourability-towards-keir-starmer-and-labour">Poll ratings</a> are increasingly poor. Something is failing in Labour’s way of governing. This needs to be addressed – and fast.</p><p>The big picture, Labour will insist, is that it takes time to undo the economic, social and cultural damage&nbsp;left by the Conservatives. That is undoubtedly&nbsp;true, and Labour was careful – to a fault – not to promise quick remedies during the election campaign. But the July manifesto could not have been&nbsp;more emphatic about Labour’s commit

## The Guardian view on the teacher shortage: flexibility and career breaks could help

<p>To tackle staff shortages, jobs in schools and other public services must be made more attractive</p><p>Without teachers, schools can’t do their job. Recognising the problems caused by shortages, Labour made the recruitment of 6,500 new ones a key plank of its education offer to voters in England – one funded by VAT on private school fees. Now a report from the charity Teach First, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/sep/19/teachers-in-england-offered-incentives-to-make-job-appealing">advocating flexibility</a> and an entitlement to career breaks, attempts to flesh out what improved working conditions in English schools might look like. Given the difficulties faced by recruiters and the alarming drop-off rate – one in four new teachers last less than three years – it is imperative that ministers pay attention to such efforts and come up with a plan.</p><p>The 5.5% pay rise agreed this summer should make a difference – although not to teachers in further education co

<p>The dawn of a new era of faster profits growth from overseas and ‘platform’ operations are among reasons for the retailer to be cheerful</p><p>Here is an absurdly mean-minded way to view <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/19/next-annual-profits-near-1bn-overseas-expansion-boosts-sales">Next’s advance towards annual profits of £1bn this financial year</a>: since the retailer achieved almost half a billion (£498m) as long ago as 2008, merely doubling over 17 years is not other-worldly. The annual compound rate of improvement works out at only 4%.</p><p>But that perspective would plainly be ridiculous for at least two reasons. First, Next, like everyone else, had to deal with the long recession after the financial crash and then the global pandemic; the retailing landscape was littered with the bodies of those who didn’t make it – BHS, Debenhams and more. Or look at the contrast with Marks &amp; Spencer, which hit the £1bn mark in 2008 and has never seen it again.

Starmer should have learned that from the antics of Boris Johnson. I’ve yet to meet anyone who thinks this government has got off to a good start.

<p>The Irish author explores bereavement and age-gap relationships in a breathtakingly intimate tale of two brothers and the women they turn to</p><p>If any few pages of Sally Rooney’s fourth novel blew through the streets on an autumn wind, many a chance reader would be sure who wrote them. They’d recognise the sentences precision-engineered for weight distribution like wide-span bridges. They’d find moment-by-moment emotion, coolly itemised; monosyllabic dialogue occasionally breaking the surface while immense currents of introspection flow beneath; breathtakingly intimate and properly sexy sex, felt from the inside and piously revered as a moral force. Here again, in short order and at great length, are qualities familiar from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/01/conversations-with-friends-by-sally-rooney-review">Conversations with Friends</a> (2017), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/01/normal-people-sally-rooney-review">Normal People</a> (2018)

<p>The prime minister promised a government a world apart from Rishi Sunak’s, yet the similarities are mounting</p><p>During the last election campaign it was hard to escape the impression that, whatever his other faults, Rishi Sunak just wasn’t very good at politics. The charge sheet included getting drenched announcing the election and leaving D-day veterans on the beaches. And insisting that black was white: that he was stopping the boats, that the economy was in good shape, that the Tories were on course for victory.</p><p>Just a couple of months later, it very much feels like Keir Starmer and Labour are saying: “Hold my beer.” Keen to prove that they, too, are amateurs at the political PR game.

In her current show in London, she cut the V10 engine from an Audi RS 6 into six imposing slices, or rather she got a man in Stuttgart with a massive bandsaw to do it. “These were once crazy, speedy machines,” Bircken says. But cleaned of oil and sliced up like a loaf, the engine has been stilled. Can those chains, wheels and axles really have propelled passengers so far and so fast? And what does it mean when a mechanism no longer works?</p><p>It’s a question posed by the show, which Bircken has named Gebrochenes Pferd, German for Broken Horse.

But while Edwards’ barrister said the former presenter “apologises sincerely” and acknowledged the “repugnant” nature of the images, the narrative that the defence team offered during the hearing sought to tell a less contrite and more familiar story.</p><p>You take with a pinch of salt the testimony of expert witnesses, of course.

<p>Jonathan Reynolds, business secretary, suggests Starmer himself did not decide pay for his chief of staff</p><p>Good morning. Yesterday the BBC broke <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx247wkq137o">the story</a> that Sue Gray, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, is paid £170,000 a year, which is about £3,000 a year more than the PM himself. It is not a typical BBC story (more on that later), and it would be a classic prosecution exhibit for anyone arguing that political journalists are too obsessed with insider processology. There is also a strong argument that ministers and officials at the very top of politics are paid relatively little anyway if you take into account the skill set required, the hours worked, and what they might earn in the private sector.</p><p>Yes, as <strong>Chris Mason</strong>, the BBC’s political editor has argued <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxgdgkew81o">in a blog </a>about the story, this is more than just a slice of Whitehall trivi

<p>Starmer and Davey need to seize the moment.

But there has never been a conclusive answer.</p><p>Today, as memories of the 2010-2015 Lib Dem-Conservative coalition fade, and following the two parties’ spectacular successes in July’s general election, a new version of the old question is on the agenda.

<p>If you were risking your life in the middle of the ocean, you’d want your shipmate to be a cheerful problem-solver. That’s me out of the running</p><p>Here are three of my favourite uses of figures of speech to describe the competence of footballers. Actually, there’s four, but one is too rude. Oh, to hell with it, I’ll share it anyway. It came from a caller on a post-match local radio phone-in and concerned a goalkeeper in an alarmingly lousy run of form. “He couldn’t keep a clean sheet on his honeymoon,” the caller said. If you don’t get it, probably best not to give it too much thought. Another one from a radio phone-in, related to me by the commentator and former athlete Steve Cram, was used to paint a vivid picture of an enthusiastic Sunderland full-back who did a lot of running with the ball without ever seeming to be fully in control of it. “He’s like a dog with a balloon,” wailed a despairing Sunderland fan.</p><p>The other two come from the same man, my late friend Jeff Fa

An absolute treat</p><p>The spin-off was surely ordained the minute Kathryn Hahn hit her first mark in front of the WandaVision cameras. She played the superhero couple’s nosy neighbour “Agnes”, who was in fact a Salem witch named Agatha Harkness bent on acquiring Wanda’s powers for herself.

<p>She’s been called a neo-fascist and a danger to Italy. But she has won over many heads of Europe, including the UK prime minister. Should we be worried?</p><p>In mid-June, Giorgia Meloni was in an exultant mood while hosting the G7 summit, a gathering of the world’s most powerful nations, in the southern Italian region of Apulia. After days in which she presided over meetings speaking English, French and Spanish along with her native Italian, one evening she danced the <em>pizzica</em> – a traditional Apulian dance – twirling and hopping to the trance-like rhythmic folk music often played at local weddings at a contagious 100 beats per minute. Meloni’s uninhibited performance expressed the self-confidence of an emerging political star, who, after a strong showing in the European elections just a few days earlier, was the hottest political leader in Europe. She took a selfie with Indian strongman Narendra Modi, which she posted on Instagram to her 3.5 million followers with the capt
