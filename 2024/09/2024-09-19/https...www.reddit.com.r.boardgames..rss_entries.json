Players can also block off certain paths and trap one another as another way to eliminate players and claim victory. There is a mechanism that allows you to claim all the resources from the player that you eliminate, which in theory accelerates the game after each elimination. There is also an alternative victory condition where a player accrues X amount of points to win the game.</p> <p>I&#39;ve done minimal playtests so far without this being an issue, but my main concern is that people might not want to play a game where players that are knocked out early have to sit around and wait for the game to finish.

I see the bending of these cards and my soul is crying.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Luxfiri\"> /u/Luxfiri </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fki2k4/shuffling_cards_without_damaging_them/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fki2k4/shuffling_car", "id": 1174058, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fki2k4/shuffling_cards_without_damaging_them", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Shuffling cards without damaging them", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-19T10:50:37+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>[Flip7] At the end of a round do your &#39;scored&#39; cards stay in front of you, or do they go into the set aside round cards and you make a note of your score elsewhere?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/willhowe\"> /u/willhowe </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fkhvnk/flip7_at_the_end_of_a_round_do_your_scored_cards/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fkhvnk/flip7_at_the_end_of_a_round_do_your_scored_cards/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1174059, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fkhvnk/flip7_at_the_end_of_a_round_do_your_scored_cards", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "[Flip7] At the end of a round do your 'scored' cards stay in front of you, or do they go into the set aside round cards and you make a note of your score elsewhere?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-19T09:22:14+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Does anyone have this combination and it fits?

It was a pretty simple game with a vertical web (think connect 4) with small holes scattered across it. Each player would have about 5 spiders with peg feet that would go in the holes. Each player would try to move their spiders to their opponents nest and step on it. The opponent could push your spiders feet pegs out of the holes and knock them off the web. </p> <p>The spiders were neon green and neon orange and the web was black plastic.</p> <p>I loved the game and would like to play it with my kids since they are now at an age to enjoy that type of entry level strategy game.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/acekjd83\"> /u/acekjd83 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fkcxgi/forgotten_spider_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bo", "id": 1172489, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fkcxgi/forgotten_spider_game", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Forgotten Spider Game", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-19T03:56:03+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Does anyone know how I can get my hands on the expansions exclusive to the steamforged website in Australia?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Firelord_Bppage\"> /u/Firelord_Bppage </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fkc17f/how_the_hell_am_i_supposed_to_get_steamforged/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fkc17f/how_the_hell_am_i_supposed_to_get_steamforged/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1172488, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fkc17f/how_the_hell_am_i_supposed_to_get_steamforged", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 473, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "How the hell am I supposed to get steamforged exclusive expansions in Australia?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-19T01:53:55+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fk9r64/scythe_painted/\"> <img src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/c4CgMUXxejCVz0UV94q9uuGuAVPXJLUflZ74fGqTFg8.jpg\" alt=\"Scythe Painted\" title=\"Scythe Painted\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Just finished up another one of my board games that I decided to paint.
