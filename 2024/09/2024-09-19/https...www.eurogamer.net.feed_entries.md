<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>'s doing alright for itself, what with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">franchise-best launch</a> and a whole load of critical acclaim, but developer Saber Interactive isn't stopping yet. The studio has now pledged a whole bunch of fan-requested fixes, starting with connectivity issues as a "top priority" and maybe even the introduction of an FoV slider if it really must.

Does this mean that the game's long-standing performance issues are finally solved, or are its fundamental challenges too great? We've tested the game on a range of hardware to find out and while there are some genuine performance improvements, fundamental problems we've discussed many times now are still highly problematic. </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-star-wars-jedi-survivor-patch-9-pc-fix">Read more</a></p>

(You know the ones which now go for hundreds of pounds on eBay?) It was a gift from my Dad and fully defied my Mum's 'No Pok&eacute;mon cards' rule. While she had accepted my new-found obsession with its yellow mouse, she believed the cards were a waste of money since there was no guarantee which ones I'd get, and completing my collection involved buying an awful lot of packs. Unfortunately for us both, she was right.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-focus-is-on-pack-opening-but-theres-a-promising-version-of-the-card-game-underneath">Read more</a></p>
