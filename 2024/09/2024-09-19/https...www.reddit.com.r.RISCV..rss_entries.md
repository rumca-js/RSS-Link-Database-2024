<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In general deadbeef means deadlock, so I&#39;m curious that if in the signature file spike writes deadbeef, then does it means a deadlock?</p> <p>So the question prompted in my mind when I was compliance testing my rv32imc core where I just implemented CSRs. So I have already passed the IMC compliance tests. Now I am running the privilege tests. The test reads the mtvec CSR saves the data in t0 and then there&#39;s a sw from t0 that dumps deadbeef</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TransitionOpen2287"> /u/TransitionOpen2287 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1fkkxm3/does_deadbeef_has_a_meaning_in_spike/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1fkkxm3/does_deadbeef_has_a_meaning_in_spike/">[comments]</a></span>
