MIT physicists and colleagues have created a new material with unusual superconducting and metallic properties, thanks to wavy layers of atoms only billionths of a meter thick that repeat themselves over and over to create a macroscopic sample that can be manipulated by hand. The large size of the sample makes it much easier to explore its quantum behavior, or interactions at the atomic scale that give rise to its properties.

Electricity-driven water electrolysis has garnered notable attention as an environmentally friendly method for hydrogen production, with high-purity hydrogen being crucial for addressing the energy crisis. Nonetheless, water electrolysis hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) typically require precious metals as electrocatalysts. This limitation has prompted researchers to focus on developing effective non-precious metal catalysts to enhance both the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of water electrolysis.

Hydraulic failure in tropical environments is expected to increase, according to new research published in New Phytologist. As weather patterns change and temperatures rise, plants will need to adapt in order to survive. Hydraulic failure occurs when more water is lost from transpiration than is taken in through the roots. If uncorrected, the xylem loses conductivity and the plant will not survive.

New NASA research reveals a process to generate extremely accurate eclipse maps, which plot the predicted path of the moon's shadow as it crosses the face of Earth. Traditionally, eclipse calculations assume that all observers are at sea level on Earth and that the moon is a smooth sphere that is perfectly symmetrical around its center of mass. As such, these calculations do not take into account different elevations on Earth or the moon's cratered, uneven surface.
