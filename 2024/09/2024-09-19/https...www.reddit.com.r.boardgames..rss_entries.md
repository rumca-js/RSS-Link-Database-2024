## Thoughts on games that have a player elimination / last player standing mechanism?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m currently designing a 4-player, free-for-all game that is focused on player combat through card effects and navigating through a board that contains tile triggers. Players can also block off certain paths and trap one another as another way to eliminate players and claim victory. There is a mechanism that allows you to claim all the resources from the player that you eliminate, which in theory accelerates the game after each elimination. There is also an alternative victory condition where a player accrues X amount of points to win the game.</p> <p>I&#39;ve done minimal playtests so far without this being an issue, but my main concern is that people might not want to play a game where players that are knocked out early have to sit around and wait for the game to finish. I am targeting a ~45 minute playtime.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/just_started_eating"> /u/just_started_eating </a> <

Cards.</p> <p>Current method: I always split deck for 4 stacks, overhand with some random variations of it, place all stacks together and again shuffle. In critical cases (when randomisation is still poor after many shuffles) I do riffle 4+ times and randomisation is great after that but....

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been trying to track down one of my favorite late 80s games without success. It was a pretty simple game with a vertical web (think connect 4) with small holes scattered across it. Each player would have about 5 spiders with peg feet that would go in the holes. Each player would try to move their spiders to their opponents nest and step on it. The opponent could push your spiders feet pegs out of the holes and knock them off the web. </p> <p>The spiders were neon green and neon orange and the web was black plastic.</p> <p>I loved the game and would like to play it with my kids since they are now at an age to enjoy that type of entry level strategy game.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/acekjd83"> /u/acekjd83 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fkcxgi/forgotten_spider_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bo

## Not a board game, but a social game played in school with friends.

## Shadows of Brimstone: random and thematic Weird Old West adventure

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Shadows of Brimstone seems to be a kind of dungeon crawling analogue of Eldritch Horror. It has low depth too (in dungeon you mindlessly throw buckets of dices at monsters until they die. In town you simply choose a location and throw a dice to learn what has happened according to table of events, and another event will randomly happen in travel phase according to another table of events). It has emphasis on storytelling too (thanks to abundance of events, as well as mutations and other nice features, sometimes really fun stories are getting generated). A table hog, too.</p> <p>Its biggest features are random storytelling and extensive character leveling system. Your character can not only advance but even mutate from magical brimstone, which is very cool. Mutations are both useful and potentially dangerous.</p> <p>Overall SoB is a good choice if you want simply to enjoy mindless adventure. But if you want to think at least a little, you&#39;ll have t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for advice for babyproofing a board game collection. My games are low to the ground and easy for my little crawler to reach. He can&#39;t really hurt himself. The shelves seem sturdy -- I tried pulling at them myself and wouldn&#39;t be able to pull them down without gripping them from the top, where he obviously can&#39;t reach.</p> <p>I feel like it&#39;d be fine if I could just get some rubber bands that keep the lids on, so he can&#39;t pull them down and get at the pieces. But I can&#39;t find any. Anyone have a link to something like that? I know BGG has some, but they&#39;re very expensive. I&#39;d be looking for a lot of them.</p> <p>Alternatively, I&#39;m open to other suggestions.
