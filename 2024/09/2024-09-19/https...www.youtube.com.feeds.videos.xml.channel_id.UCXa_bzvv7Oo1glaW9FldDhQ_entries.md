When considering social survival strategy titles, 11 bit studios is the developer that comes to mind, and Frostpunk is arguably its most significant work. Thirty years after the Great Freeze, New London is under new management, and the obstacles are far greater in Frostpunk 2.

However, it's more than just the first game with a bigger city and more expansive scale, where you measure time in weeks and growth by districts. It also offers more complex problems, such as the overall direction of progress, which of the many factions you'll side with, and how you'll prevail against the human condition.

While it can get overwhelming, especially when trying to solve squalor, disease, crime, and so on, and the interface requires some patience, Frostpunk 2 is a worthy follow-up. The "bigger picture" can desensitize you as much as the stories on the ground will inspire (or demoralize).

Correction: By mistake we added PS5 and Xbox Series X
