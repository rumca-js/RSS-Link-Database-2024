You can find the printer at https://www.positron3d.com\n\nIf you're just getting started or don't want to build your own tiny printer, I also recommend a Bambu Labs A1 Mini or Prusa Mini; they're much cheaper and you won't have to spend so much time building them.\n\nBut building a 3D printer is half the fun!
