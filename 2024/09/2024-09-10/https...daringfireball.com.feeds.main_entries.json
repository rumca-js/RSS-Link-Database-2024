The company has also removed existing FineWoven iPhone cases for older devices from its website, though FineWoven versions of the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MA7A4ZM/A/iphone-finewoven-wallet-with-magsafe-blackberry\">MagSafe Wallet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MA7J4ZM/A/airtag-finewoven-key-ring-dark-green\">AirTag Key Ring</a> continue to be available.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You know what\u2019s a great material for phone cases? Leather. Apple is so damn good at material engineering\u2009\u2014\u2009I truly expect them to, sooner rather than later, come up with a leather-like non-leather that\u2019s as good or better than actual leather.
