<p>Back at the end of August, Microsoft released a new Beta version with code KB5041881 for Windows Insiders. This update included several interesting improvements and new features, but one flew under the radar because it wasn’t mentioned in any release notes.</p>



<p>While Windows 11 already lets you pin apps to the taskbar by dragging-and-dropping icons from the Desktop or the Start menu, Microsoft is testing a new option: dragging-and-dropping from search results.</p>

<p>If you’re still using Kaspersky, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2381806/how-to-uninstall-kaspersky-antivirus.html">remove the app from your PC</a> and switch to replacement software that will continue to get regular updates.

<p>The new Apple Intelligence within the new Apple iPhone 16 provides a surprisingly practical approach to AI. It’s straightforward, helpful, and well, boring — a stark contrast to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2337930/meet-the-future-of-windows-copilot-pcs-feature-practical-ai-tools.html">Microsoft’s Copilot+ PCs</a>, which position themselves as the cusp of a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2375380/windows-copilot-ai-features-feel-like-early-tech-demos-at-best.html">revolutionary new era of computing</a>, complete with a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2191837/a-copilot-key-is-coming-to-your-pcs-keyboard.html">mandatory new keyboard button</a>. </p>

<p>Last month, Google quietly killed off Google Sky Maps. But there’s still another way to virtually explore most of the solar system a la Google Maps: it’s called <strong>Google Maps in Space</strong>.</p>



<p>Google Maps in Space allows you to zoom over the surface of the Earth like you can in regular Google Maps, except here you can also fly over Mercury, Venus, Mars, plus several moons — not just our own but also Ganymede, Europa, and even Pluto’s moon, Charon.</p>



<p>In all, you can explore 21 different heavenly bodies as well as the International Space Station with Google Maps in Space. (Google says that you can add the same interplanetary locations on <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/about/versions/#download-pro">Google Earth Pro</a>, but I tried and couldn’t find a way to explore them.)</p>

<p>The smart home makes many things more convenient within your own four walls, but also creates a number of additional technical problems — not least with regard to the security of your own data.</p>



<p>The market for smart home solutions is divided into two large groups:</p>



<ul>
<li>One includes control systems that are permanently installed by certified tradespeople.</li>



<li>The other group includes components from various manufacturers that can be easily retrofitted by non-professionals and transform simple lights or thermostats into smart devices. </li>
</ul>



<p>With the latter devices, there are a whole range of annoyances that most users don’t think about when buying. This short guide shows firstly how you can minimize the risks before you buy, and secondly how you can find and close weak points in existing devices.</p>
