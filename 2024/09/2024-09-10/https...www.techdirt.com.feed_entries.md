Earlier this year, we wrote about how Judge Kevin Newsom, on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, had explored how ChatGPT might actually be useful for a particularly narrow use in a court. Specifically, in judging whether or not the “ordinary meaning” of a phrase matched with what a party in the court argued was [&#8230;]

Well, here&#8217;s even more ugliness from America&#8217;s penis. The state of Florida &#8212; currently presided over by a bootlicker wearing boot lifts &#8212; has decided the best way to protect its war on women is to harass and intimidate residents who support reproductive rights. Florida is reportedly sending police officers to the homes of people [&#8230;]

Over the last few years, it’s felt like the age verification debate has gotten progressively stupider. People keep insisting that it must be necessary, and when others point out that there are serious privacy and security concerns that will likely make things worse, not better, we’re told that we have to do it anyway.
