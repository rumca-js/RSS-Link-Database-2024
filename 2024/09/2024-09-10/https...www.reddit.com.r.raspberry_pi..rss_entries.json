I am using a Pi compute module 4 with debian lite as an os and several (in theory) same costume PCBs. When i\u00b4m plugging the same cm4 into another PCB it works perfectly fine with about 3s kernal boot time. In the module i got now it takes about 30s more to boot. What kind of hardware issue can cause this? I\u00b4m happy for every hint i can get and try about this issue.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Krimalis\"> /u/Krimalis </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fdvq83/need_help_finding_hardware_issue_causing_long/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fdvq83/need_help_finding_hardware_issue_causing_long/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1121492, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fdvq83/need_help_finding_hardware_issue_causing_long", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "source_obj__id": 470, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Need help finding hardware issue causing long boot times", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-10T18:51:59+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Has anyone setup Muiskcube on a raspberry pi? </p> <p>I&#39;m following the guide here: <a href=\"https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/wiki/raspberry-pi\">https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/wiki/raspberry-pi</a></p> <p>But after I install it, and try to run musikcube I get /usr/bin/musikcube: 6: exec: ./musikcube: not found</p> <p>There are a lot of open issues on the github and I&#39;m not sure if people are responding as I&#39;ve asked a different question and got no response there. </p> <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ddraig\"> /u/Ddraig </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fdpnq4/problem_setting_up_musikcube_on_raspberry_pi/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fdpnq4/problem_setting_up_musikcube_on_raspberry_pi/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1120482, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fdpnq4/problem_setting_up_musikcube_on_raspberry_pi", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "source_obj__id": 470, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Problem setting up MusikCube on raspberry pi", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-10T17:01:04+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have a buddies Raspberry and installed LibreElec and kodi by his request.
