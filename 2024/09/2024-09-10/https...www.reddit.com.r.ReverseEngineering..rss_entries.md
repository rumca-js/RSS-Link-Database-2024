<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have an old Chinese intercom system that uses an mobile app called VDP Connect to connect to my intercom via SIP, the app allows me to unlock the door. I would like to be able to programatically unlock my door but I am unsure where to start. The app requires a few credentials. I have to create an local account (profile) by scanning a QR code with the configuration details on the intercom screen then when inside my local network I am able to view camera and listen to audio as well as unlock the door from the app. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vatoka"> /u/Vatoka </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://youtu.be/hbpJW0AJI2Y?feature=shared">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1fds9qp/reverse_engineering_sip_based_door/">[comments]</a></span>
