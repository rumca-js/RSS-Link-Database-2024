<p>Public cloud providers are expensive, and I’m not alone in that opinion. Civo, a company specializing in public cloud services, recently published a report on the state of the cloud market. Civo surveyed more than 500 professionals in the cloud industry to analyze current trends.

According to <a href="https://www.civo.com/cost-of-cloud-report-2024">their analysis</a>, this year’s cloud computing market now faces “significant challenges.” Prices are becoming more of a burden for enterprises than a cost-saving opportunity.</p>

<p>If you haven’t figured it out by now, I’m kind of an old gray-bearded guy. Well, getting there, anyway. Sure, I like to think I’m still 27 years old, but I’m not. I’ve been around. </p>



<p>I’m one of those guys who was lucky enough to get an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe">Apple ][e</a> for Christmas. I bought an IBM PS/2 Model 25 (with the upgrade to 640K of RAM!) when I started my first real job. I found the Internet in 1993 while at graduate school, and I remember the uproar when AOL announced that they’d be connecting all their subscribers.
