<p>The second-largest antitrust case of the century headed to trial Monday, with Google defending itself against claims that it has engaged in illegal behavior to maintain control of the ad tech market.</p>



<p>The US government is accusing Google of purposefully manipulating that market, snuffing out competitors and gobbling up key technologies through acquisitions.
