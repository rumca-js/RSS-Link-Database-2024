<p>Is insisting on ID really about safeguarding or just a habit we’ve fallen into after watching too much American TV?</p><p>My friend’s son, 16, sauntered into a pub at the weekend and came out with a pint. He wasn’t asked for ID, which she thought was outrageous, and I thought was fair enough because he looks about 25. Actually, if pushed, I’d say he looks like a highly competent 25-year-old, with life plans, a job, maybe even a pension. If I were working at a bar, not only would I not card him, I’d most likely give him a free pint, just for bossing at life.</p><p>Nevertheless, it was pretty unusual, since everyone is ID’d. My sister, who is 53, was asked for proof of her age buying those little non-alcoholic aperitivos you get in Lidl. She has always looked younger than her true age, owing to her glowing complexion and small head, but this was ridiculous.

<p>Virginia Gilbert’s film sees Juliet Stevenson and Jared Harris divided on whether to believe the young woman claiming to be their child</p><p>Novelist, short story writer and film-maker Virginia Gilbert has written and directed this carefully constructed, robustly performed drama, an intimate feature which in some ways resembles a stage play or even a radio play, yet none the worse for that; it’s the kind of grown up, approachable movie designed to be talked about afterwards over dinner. Jared Harris and Juliet Stevenson play John and Mary, a married couple – he’s an electrician, she’s a primary schoolteacher – whose daughter Clare vanished 10 years previously at the age of 14. For a decade, they have lived in a twilight of suppressed despair and clenched longing, a hibernation of the soul.</p><p>On the 10th anniversary of her disappearance, the police talk John and Mary into appearing at another agonised, televised appeal for information – and then a miracle.

It all began in 2006. She was working as an actor in Chicago, and coming out as queer. She kept “trying to reconcile being queer, being Muslim, and loving Bollywood romance”, a combination that struck her then as impossible. She started work on a video art piece that reflected on Bollywood classics through a queer perspective. A friend suggested they develop it into a short film.</p><p>“That was the beginning of my love affair with the film festival space,” she says over a video call from her study in Los Angeles, a busy bookshelf and the movie’s

<p>Elaine is a thwarted writer in 1950s upstate New York, on the brink of affairs and murdering her own child, in a claustrophobic novel full of Self’s stylistic mannerisms</p><p>“M<em>adame Bovary</em>, c’est moi,” Flaubert said. What would Will Self say of his new novel? “<em>Elaine</em>, c’est moi”? “<em>Madame Bovary</em>, c’est ma mere”? Described in the blurb as “perhaps the first work of auto-oedipal fiction”, <em>Elaine</em> is based, we’re told, on the diaries of Self’s mother, Elaine, so it promises just the sort of ping-pong game of identification and countertransference a writer so steeped in psychoanalysis is likely to revel in. It also puts a writer whose usual beat has been the grimy pubs and crumbling mental hospitals of London into the territory of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/17/biography.fiction">Richard Yates</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/john-cheever">John Cheever</a>.</p><p>It’s the mid-1950s, upstate New York.

<p>Nabhaan Rizwan is terrific as he faces the depressing realities and prejudices of trying to break into films in Naqqash Khalid’s brilliantly confident debut </p><p>A director is talking to a young British Asian actor. “You’re like the brown version of … what was his name again …?” By the end of the movie, this encounter feels familiar. We’ve watched the young actor grit his teeth through humiliating auditions. In Camera operates partly as a depressingly funny satire of box-ticking, quota-filling diversity in film and television, but with his brilliantly confident debut, film-maker Naqqash Khalid goes beyond exposing the stupid and cynical. With its dreamlike logic, looping around ideas and themes, In Camera is a disorientating film for disorienting times; opaque and enigmatic, scratching to get under the skin.</p><p>Newish-comer Nabhaan Rizwan is terrific as Aden, the actor trying to crack the industry. As a person, Aden seems lost. He’s clearly talented but he walks into auditions

The value of his 154, anchoring the first innings at the Oval, was demonstrated by the fact that nobody aside from Ben Duckett made 20. Even then, he needed a good helping of luck as he oscillated in and out of form almost from ball to ball, the cogs of his once classic defensive technique screeching. His trust in his charges led to some fine individual performances, but also an almost comically inept use of DRS, trusting advi

<p>Three brothers and their bullying father go on a fateful outing in this subtle and  twisty Scottish tale</p><p>Low-budget but relatively hefty in impact, this Scottish thriller revolves around three adult brothers and their father who go on a hunting trip none of them will forget. If you’re deeply spoiler adverse, stop reading now because the opening twist is pretty nifty; for those who wish to know a little more, here goes. Minutes into the film we work out that Don (Paul Higgins), the patriarch of the family, is an abusive bully who constantly belittles and humiliates his three boys, especially when they fail to prove their manliness by shooting defenceless forest animals. Middle son John (Brian Vernel) seems to crack and turns the rifle on Don, who promptly mocks him further, goading John to pull the trigger. Instead, eldest son Henry (Daniel Portman, good ol’ Podrick from Game of Thrones) shoots Don instead as the youngest, Vince (Calum Ross), Don’s favourite looks on.</p><p>Th
