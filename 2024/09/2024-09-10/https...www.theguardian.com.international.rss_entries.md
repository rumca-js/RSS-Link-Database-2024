It features lyrics about a teenage girl being “vapourised”; about how “the silly people sing Don’t Look Back in Anger / And the morons swing and say Don’t Look Back in Anger / I can assure you I will look back in anger ’til the day I die,” a reference to the street singalongs of the Oasis track in the wake of the bombing.
