<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has promised to introduce legislation that would prevent children under a certain age from using social media. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-plans-social-media-ban-children-2024-09-09/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a> reported that Albanese issued his statement in a TV interview on the Australian Broadcasting Corp. (ABC).</p>
<p>Albanese says the Australian government would start its social media initiative by testing age verification technology sometime this year. He also didn’t state a specific age limit but estimated he’d like the ban to be for children younger than 14-16 because “we know that social media is causing social harm.”</p>

<p>Every year, the calculus of choosing which iPhone to get feels increasingly frustrating. Do you opt for the standard iPhone? Do you splurge for the latest and greatest Pro model, something that might take two years to pay off completely? Or should you just buy a slightly older used or refurbished model to get the best deal possible? And of course, there's always the safest bet: Save your money and keep your current phone for as long as possible.</p>

<p>A SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying the four private astronauts of the Polaris Dawn mission has launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the early hours of September 10 after a few weeks of delays. The mission was scheduled to lift off at the end of August but was postponed first due to technical issues, then because of poor weather conditions forecasted for the crew’s return. On board are Jared Isaacman — the billionaire who funded the mission — retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Scott “Kidd” Poteet, and SpaceX engineers Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon.
