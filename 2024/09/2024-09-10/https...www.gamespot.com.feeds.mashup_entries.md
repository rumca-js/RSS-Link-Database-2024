<p dir="ltr">In my years of reviewing NBA 2K games, I've come to appreciate--and even expect--the game to feel like an authentic love letter to basketball in so many ways. This has been a consistent attribute of the series going back over a decade. NBA 2K doesn't just capture the culture of basketball; it helps shape it. No other game--not even Madden, despite the head start gifted to it by simulating Americans' unique obsession with football--offers a total package as immersive and rewarding as NBA 2K. That's why, in addition to my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k25-review-luxury-taxed/1900-6418281/">NBA 2K25 review</a>--and so as not to become too bogged down in the ins and outs of it there--I'm also taking a moment to address the unfortunate pay-to-win economy still infecting what is otherwise the perennial sports game of the year.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don't play NBA 2K, you may be unfamiliar with its woes in this regard, and if you do play it, you may have normal

<p dir="ltr">Like its past several installments, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nba-2k25/">NBA 2K25</a> is the best sports game I've played this year, but it still comes with a bolded, can't-miss asterisk. This year's basketball sim from Visual Concepts represents the latest in a series that has been lapping the competition in the sports genre--a group of games each seeking to be your live-service obsession. None justify their time commitment as well as NBA 2K25, which is in a league of its own--for presentation, gameplay, and overall immersion first and foremost--but the whole is actually less than the sum of its parts due to long-embedded pay-to-win tactics I fear will never be undone.</p><p dir="ltr">This year's biggest changes involve a new dribbling physics system that gives ball-control a more realistic feel. The impact of this is hard to explain but easy to recognize when you're playing it, aided by enhancements to the game's ProPlay animation system that converts real

<p>Apple introduced the iPhone 16 on September 9, promising a souped-up five-core GPU that can support hardware-accelerated ray tracing and play AAA games previously only available on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iphone-15-pro-is-best-game-console-apple-says/1100-6517793/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>. Here's what we know so far about the next iPhone's gaming capabilities.</p><p>While Apple's announcement for the iPhone 16 has a strong focus on generative AI, it also showed off how the device's five-core GPU will deliver higher performance for more demanding games.
