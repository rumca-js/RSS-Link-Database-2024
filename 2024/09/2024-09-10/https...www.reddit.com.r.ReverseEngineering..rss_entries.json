I would like to be able to programatically unlock my door but I am unsure where to start. The app requires a few credentials. I have to create an local account (profile) by scanning a QR code with the configuration details on the intercom screen then when inside my local network I am able to view camera and listen to audio as well as unlock the door from the app. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Vatoka\"> /u/Vatoka </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/hbpJW0AJI2Y?feature=shared\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1fds9qp/reverse_engineering_sip_based_door/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1120657, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1fds9qp/reverse_engineering_sip_based_door", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/.rss", "source_obj__id": 476, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Reverse Engineering SIP based door intercom/control system", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-10T02:21:42+00:00", "description": "&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pwntheplanet\"> /u/pwntheplanet </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ar4dZNL9rHE?feature=shared\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1fd79rt/reverse_engineering_a_kernel_driver_challenge/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1114621, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1fd79rt/reverse_engineering_a_kernel_driver_challenge", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/.rss", "source_obj__id": 476, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Reverse Engineering a Kernel Driver challenge", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
