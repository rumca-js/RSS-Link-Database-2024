You have a bigger box, like Blood Rage or Great Western Trail, and eventually the corner blows out. Do you just suck it up? Tape? super glue a piece of thin cardboard on the inside?</p> <p>I tried to doing the last one for a long time, but I found it very futile. It never kept, no matter how powerful the glue was. I&#39;ve resigned to clear packing tape and while not as aesthetically pleasing, I find myself fine with it. At this point, corners worn out that much are a sign of love. </p> <p>Curious about your solutions and preferences.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/StuTeacher82\"> /u/StuTeacher82 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fd4fh4/split_box_corners/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fd4fh4/split_box_corners/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1114130, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fd4fh4/split_box_corners", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Split Box Corners", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
