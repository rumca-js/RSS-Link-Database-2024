I&#39;d like to expand on the functionality by adding the ability to scrape the content behind links and then using an LLM API to generate a summary of the content within a folder. If some items are paywalled, nothing useful wil be scraped, but I assume that the AI can be prompted to disregard useless files. </p> <p>I&#39;ve never learned python or attempted projects like this.
