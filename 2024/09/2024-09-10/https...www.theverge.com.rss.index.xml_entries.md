  <p id="Eha69C">It’s hard to keep up with everything you come across on the web, such as an article you don’t have time to read at the moment or a video you’d like to run again later. Years ago, I started getting the better of this issue with Pocket, a well-known app that allows you to bookmark an article to a separate server and then retrieve it to read at your leisure. Since then, a number of similar services have appeared, offering a variety of features — and a variety of prices.</p>

After months of leaks, Sony just announced a more powerful PS5 console during a special <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X24BzyzQQ-8">technical presentation</a>. Mark Cerny, the lead architect of the PS5 console, says the PS5 Pro improves on the original console in three key ways: a larger GPU, advanced ray tracing, and custom AI-driven upscaling.</p>
<p id="ZhO7sw">The PS5 Pro will launch on November 7th, priced at $699.99, and it looks similar to the slim version of the PS5 — just like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231231/is-this-the-ps5-pro">recent leaks</a> suggested it would.

To the government, Google exerts too much control over every step in the way publishers sell advertising space online and how advertisers buy it, resulting in a system that benefits Google at the expense of nearly everyone else.</p>
