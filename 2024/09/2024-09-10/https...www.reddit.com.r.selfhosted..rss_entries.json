I know that there are many of us using Vaultwarden/bitwarden. iOS client for Bitwarden was recently updated with huge changes. This new Swift app is causing me trouble in case I start it while I\u2019m offline. I wonder if it is my phone\u2019s issue or do you guys experience anything similar. In offline/away from the server the client app either starts very slow or hangs altogether. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/joyfulmarvin\"> /u/joyfulmarvin </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdcpup/bitwarden/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdcpup/bitwarden/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1115759, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdcpup/bitwarden", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Bitwarden", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-10T08:01:37+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Is Contabo server is very slow in recent month?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Awkward-Pie2503\"> /u/Awkward-Pie2503 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdclk0/why_contabo_server_is_very_slow/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdclk0/why_contabo_server_is_very_slow/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1115760, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdclk0/why_contabo_server_is_very_slow", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "why contabo server is very slow", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-10T07:43:40+00:00", "description": "&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jeranism-dot-com\"> /u/Jeranism-dot-com </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdcd3w/can_i_use_a_subdomain_exampledomaincom_not_a_tld/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdcd3w/can_i_use_a_subdomain_exampledomaincom_not_a_tld/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1115481, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdcd3w/can_i_use_a_subdomain_exampledomaincom_not_a_tld", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "can i use a subdomain (example.domain.com; not a tld) for cloudflare tunnel?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-10T07:36:23+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Does anyone have a solution to get Instagram feed and only get post and stories from selected users?</p> <p>To email, RSS, any of the chat apps or some other way is fine, just that I wouldn&#39;t need to open and scroll the app to get updates on my gym classes schedule changes \ud83d\ude0e</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nasazh\"> /u/nasazh </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdc9yc/instagram_feed_scrapperparserfilter/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdc9yc/instagram_feed_scrapperparserfilter/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1115482, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdc9yc/instagram_feed_scrapperparserfilter", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Instagram feed scrapper,parser,filter", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-10T06:53:07+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Currently I am running truenas scale and hosting everything directly in that (jellyfin, traeffik, arr*, immich, ect.)
