The Salish Sea—the inland coastal waters of Washington and British Columbia—is home to two unique populations of fish-eating orcas, the northern resident and the southern resident orcas. Human activity over much of the 20th century, including reducing salmon runs and capturing orcas for entertainment purposes, decimated their numbers. This century, the northern resident population has steadily grown to more than 300 individuals, but the southern resident population has plateaued at around 75. They remain critically endangered.

Land was once set aside as Native American reservations because it was undesirable and low in resources, but now interested Native Americans may have economic leverage in the growing industry of clean energy. A team of researchers led by UW–Madison professors Dominic Parker and Sarah Johnston quantified the economic potential of wind and solar energy projects on these lands and discussed the regulatory barriers for tribes wishing to tap into it.

The word "atlas," may conjure images of giant books chock full of maps and a dizzying array of facts and figures. However, the new book "The World Atlas of Rivers, Estuaries, and Deltas" tells the story of these waterways long before human intervention and how they continue to evolve in the presence of—and often at odds with—human civilization. The new atlas is a highly visual guide to the most up-to-date research on the world's river systems, with an emphasis on the mutual relationship between people and these vital landscapes.

In the 20th century, whalers killed roughly 2 million large whales in the Southern Ocean. Some populations, like the Antarctic blue whale, were reduced by more than 99% and have been struggling to recover, even though most nations ended commercial whaling in the mid-1980s.

Bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum poses a severe threat to agriculture worldwide, affecting numerous crops. The pathogen's arsenal of type III effectors (T3Es) enables it to manipulate host defense mechanisms, aiding infection. One major challenge in managing bacterial wilt is understanding how these effectors interact with plant signaling pathways. This complexity underscores the need for detailed studies on effectors like RipAF1 to devise targeted strategies for effective disease management.

Here at UT, we've had several stories that describe the concept of a space elevator. They are designed to make it easier to get objects off Earth and into space. That, so far, has proven technically or economically infeasible, as no material is strong enough to support the structure passively, and it's too energy-intensive to support it actively.

Wide binary stars as direct probes of the nature of gravity at low acceleration weaker than about 1 nanometer per second squared have been hotly debated. The nature of gravity at such low acceleration is of utmost importance because the concept of dark matter, the gravitational dynamics of astrophysical systems, fundamental theories of physics and cosmology are all inextricably intertwined with it.

Urban flooding is increasingly concerning in Canada, where water drainage systems are at risk of being overwhelmed. Natural watersheds have been greatly altered by construction disturbing the natural ways that water flows from rainfall, across the land and into water bodies. The result is that drainage infrastructure must cope with increased water volumes at both higher speeds and flow rates, as well as deteriorated water quality due to pollutants such as oil and organic waste.

Scientists from the Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology (Leibniz IPHT) and the Universities of Jena and Ulm have shown that the properties of special iron compounds that absorb light can be influenced by small changes in their chemical structure. These changes affect the so-called second coordination sphere—a region of the molecule that is not directly bound to the iron atom but nevertheless influences its behavior. By adding protons, the iron compounds react differently to the light they absorb.

Aquatic plants in lakes and rivers are important refuges for animals, bring oxygen into the water and remove nutrients. However, they are not universally popular: some people find them a nuisance when swimming or doing water sports, and they also change the hydrology of aquatic systems. When aquatic plants grow in large numbers, they are often removed.

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a biological molecule with crucial functions in the genetics of organisms and plays a key role in the origin and evolution of life. With a composition quite similar to DNA, RNA is able to perform a variety of biological functions conditioned by its spatial conformation, i.e. the way the molecule folds in on itself. Now, a paper published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences describes for the first time how the process of RNA folding at low temperatures may open up a novel perspective on primordial biochemistry and the evolution of life on the planet.

For paleontologists who study animals that lived long ago, fossilized remains tell only part of the story of an animal's life. While a well-preserved skeleton can provide hints at what an ancient animal ate or how it moved, irrefutable proof of these behaviors is hard to come by. But sometimes, scientists luck out with extraordinary fossils that preserve something beyond the animal's body.
