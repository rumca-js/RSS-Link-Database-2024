In today's Daily Fix:

Sony finally unveiled the PlayStation 5 Pro in full: its design, specs, and yes, price. Gaming enthusiasts will need to cough up $700 for a PS5 Pro, and that doesn't include an optional $80 disc drive or a $30 stand (c'mon Sony, you could have at least thrown the stand in for free). It also comes with Astro's Playroom—you know, that one demo from the original PS5, NOT the new Astro Bot game that is apparently great and just came out. In other news, Star Wars Outlaws got its first major patch, addressing gameplay and technical issues. And finally, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 has landed on PC and consoles, and it's already breaking franchise records.

I Am Your Beast reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC.

"I Am Your Beast is a stirring, snack-sized shoot ‘em up that succeeds in spite of its simplified story and slightly punitive progression. Its supremely responsive controls and readily available arsenal of pick-up-and-slay weapons made me feel like a one-man army unleashed on groups of unsuspecting enemies, while its strict time-based goals and bonus objectives gave me reason to return to most of its levels to continually refine my approach. It may lack a truly unique hook to put it head and shoulders above the pack, but I Am Your Beast was still furious enough to sink its claws into me and keep me gripped to it throughout its short stay."
