<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys. I’m currently pursuing my btech in eee from a tier1 college in India. However, my interest lies towards digital design and computer architecture. I’m good with verilog, and basic C. I’ve done online courses for microprocessors (though not really helpful). How do I learn riscv, I do know the theory but how do I start implementing? Any suggestions are welcome . Also, please shed light on open source contributions. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MinuteSession1976"> /u/MinuteSession1976 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1fbi2v4/getting_started_with_risc/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1fbi2v4/getting_started_with_risc/">[comments]</a></span>
