As before, I couldn&#39;t find any other scans of it so I felt I needed to scan mine and get it archived so it&#39;s not lost.</p> <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/lords-of-the-rising-sun_202409">https://archive.org/details/lords-of-the-rising-sun_202409</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Star_Raider"> /u/Star_Raider </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fbcikw/poster_for_lords_of_the_rising_sun_1989_available/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/com
