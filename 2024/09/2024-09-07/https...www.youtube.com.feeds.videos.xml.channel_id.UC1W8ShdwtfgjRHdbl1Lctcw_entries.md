I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of San Francisco 1930s, View of Downtown, Market Street, iconic buildings, Street Cars, Cable cars, Opening Day of the Golden Gate Bridge

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound design only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
