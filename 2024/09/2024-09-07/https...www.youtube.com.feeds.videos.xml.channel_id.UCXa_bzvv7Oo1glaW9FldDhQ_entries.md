Warner Bros. Games' multiplayer-focused Harry Potter title arrives in a year with more live service misses than hits. Developed by Unbroken Studios, Quidditch Champions, as the name implies, is all about the fictional sport, with players creating an entire team from scratch to compete in various Cups or challenge other teams.

Prospects are less ambitious than they seem. The single-player portion of Quidditch Champions is pretty underwhelming, to say nothing about the significant change in rules, from the score limit and number of players per team to the Golden Snitch itself. While the gameplay is occasionally enjoyable, some aspects, like the Seeker, need finer tuning.

The same goes for multiplayer, which suffers from rubber-banding and no true 6v6 matches. Instead, three players take on two roles each, which is less exciting. Learn more about Quidditch Champions and why we're mixed on its offerings in our review.

Over the course of its long history, the Mortal Kombat franchise has produced a large number of characters that have enjoyed enduring popularity amongst the masses, but though those are obviously some of the most recognizable faces in the series’ roster, where veteran Mortal Kombat fans are concerned, some of the franchise’s best and most fascinating characters don’t necessarily fall in that upper echelon of sheer popularity. 

Sektor is one such character, a cyborg ninja who has traditionally served as a formidable enemy for many of the series’ heroes, and has continued to play an important role in the franchise’s story ever since his introduction many years ago. Ahead of the character’s reintroduction in Mortal Kombat 1’s upcoming expansion, Khaos Reigns, here, we’re going to go through the full story of Sektor, and what the expansion will have in store for the cyborg.

Until quite recently, the vast majority of us were convinced that Dead Rising wasn’t going to return to the limelight anytime soon, if ever, but that is no longer the case. 

The original game in the franchise – and arguably still the best one – is set to return in shinier, enhanced, and improved form with an imminent remaster in the form of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, and excitement surrounding its release is understandably palpable. 

From a host of promising gameplay refinements and quality of life improvements to a radical upgrade in terms of graphics and visual quality, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is looking like a meaningfully improved version of an all-time classic. Here, we will be talking about all of that and more.
