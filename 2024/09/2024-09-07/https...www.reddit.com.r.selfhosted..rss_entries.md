<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If I&#39;ve understood correctly, Lidarr takes all the info from Musicbrainz, which lists all the albums and songs in the original language, so in kana and kanji (e.g. なとりー劇場ーラブソング), but almost all indexers list it in either English or romanized Japanese (e.g. Natori - Gekijou/The Theatre - Love Song), and this difference usually causes there to be no results when searching for files to download. Is there any way to fix or get around this? Like 80% of my music is Japanese so this is very annoying and makes Lidarr pretty much useless.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pipipupumees"> /u/pipipupumees </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fb89sv/how_can_i_make_lidarr_work_with_japanese_music/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fb89sv/how_can_i_make_lidarr_work_with_japanese_music/">[comments]</a></span>
