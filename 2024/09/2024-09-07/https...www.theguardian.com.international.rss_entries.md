<p>As trends go, the double-breasted jacket is one of the easiest to try. Get ahead this autumn with our tips on how to wear it </p><p>If you’re looking to add a bit of swag and stature, a double breasted blazer is just the thing. Worn as a full suit, a double-breasted look adds gravitas and feels instantly pulled together. But its usefulness doesn’t stop there.

But it was a strange glory, coming as it did at a time when it was hard to see how English football, devastated by tragedy and disaster, could go on. Everton were – along with Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham – one of the “big five” clubs who led the Premier League breakaway in 1992, an event now widely regarded as having been a necessary step in the rebirth of the game.</p><p>But the move also led to football’s embrace of neoliberal economics: Everton’s only trophy since the breakaway is the 1995 FA Cup and, after three straight league defeats at the start of this campaign, they look like spending a fourth successive season battling relegation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/s

<p>The preservation of egg shells and nests for study and display has been going on for more than 350 years, and London’s Natural History Museum has one of the most comprehensive collections. Douglas Russell , an NHM senior curator and author of the forthcoming book Interesting Bird Nests and Eggs , explains: “While I sometimes chose familiar species, like the blue tit, I often highlighted lesser-known examples, such as a buff-spotted woodpecker nest built in a termite mound, collected in Cameroon in the early 1900s .” Perhaps the most surprising, he says, is a house sparrow nest built in the exhaust of a RAF helicopter at the beginning of the second Gulf war. “Nests are wonderful time capsules of the habitat the birds were living in at that moment.” </p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.nhmshop.co.uk/interesting-bird-nests-eggs.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqnis99E3s6Vp6PghwaCLm_baBjRa_pYwkXsjPCqzW1JLYpW3tk">Interesting Bird Nests and Eggs is published by the Natural History Museum ( £12.99)</a></l

The decision, however, was made at 3.30am and communicated via the media channels of World Triathlon, to which I am unfortunately not subscribed.

Somewhere in her journey to becoming a devoted fan of the band’s music, she’d developed a personal connection with the frontman and become convinced they were meant for each other. Their music was so important to her that she assumed there must be more to it. How could she feel this strongly and not be destined to know him personally?

The Swans were sure they’d got a touch but replays show clear air between ball and Blood. Great play by the Giants champion. He had the Swans at sixes and sevens there, too many men in red expecting a teammate to smother the Coleman medallist. But no one did and GWS surge two goals clear. Another sluggish start by Sydney. If they’ve had a weakness in 2024 that’s been it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/sep/07/sydney-swans-vs-gws-giants-live-updates-afl-qualifying-final-results-scores-kick-off-time-scg">Continue reading...</a>

After driving the Packers beyond midfield, Love was pressured by Jalen Carter and Josh Sweat. Love threw a backward pass to Josh Jacobs and landed awkwardly. He stayed down for several seconds before limping to the sideline. Love had signed a four-year, $220m extension this summer after leading the NFL’s youngest team to the playoffs last season, his first as a starter. Green Bay’s backup Malik Willis was sacked by Zack Baun on the final play of the game, preventing him from launching a Hail Mary from the Philadelphia 47. Packers coach Matt LaFleur had no

<p>Marianne Jean-Baptiste is exceptional as a woman in the terrifying endgame of depression in this deeply sober and compassionate drama, not without flashes of fun</p><p>Those two stark monosyllables in the title are a callback to Leigh’s debut from 1971, Bleak Moments: they lay down an uncompromising and yet also enigmatic challenge. This movie isn’t going to be an easy ride; of course not. But if it promises to reveal hard truths in their simplest and most irreducible sense, then what are these hard truths exactly?</p><p>Perhaps the hardest and most obvious truth is that the lead character is suffering from clinical depression and urgently needs to see a professional about it. But no one actually puts that hard truth to her, or maybe they did, long ago, and had it angrily thrown back in their face. And so the second hard truth is that no one can help someone who doesn’t want to be helped.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/07/hard-truths-review-a-mike-le
