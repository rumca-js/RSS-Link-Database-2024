<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Jeremy Saulnier’s supremely tense new Netflix movie <em>Rebel Ridge</em> sits firmly in the action category. But where stylized hit actioners <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23655445/john-wick-4-top-down-one-shot-fight-hong-kong-massacre">like the John Wick series</a> or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/3/21547951/high-low-movies-order-explained-best-action-movies-netflix">the HiGH&amp;LOW movies</a> get their mileage from over-the-top a

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">In <em>Closer the Distance</em>, my first inclination is to console Conny.

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the days after Angie’s death stretch onward — painfully slow at first, then so fast I’m anxious I won’t get everything done in the days before the funeral — I gain control of more of the smal

They’ve gone from discrete zones to massive open-world environments populated with smarter, more believable creatures. <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24168014/monster-hunter-wilds-open-world-gameplay-trailer-state-of-play">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></em> continues that evolution, with an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176506/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-impressions-summer-game-fest">emphasis on its ecosystem</a>, an ever-changing climate, and wildlife that feels more realistic than ever before.</p>
