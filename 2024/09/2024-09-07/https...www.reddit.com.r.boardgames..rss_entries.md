## What games have had successful reboots/remakes?(context: RoboRally)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>At the UK Boardgames Expo this year I was surprised to see a remake of RoboRally (2024). I still have the 2010 or 2016 edition and was intrigued to see if this one was much different. They showed me that the phrasing on some cards are clearer and they’ve re-designed it slightly but it’s basically the same game. To be honest, given they made a remake for its 30th anniversary, I’m disappointed they didn’t take any inspo from 90s editions that had way cooler / crazier maps. </p> <p>Robot Quest Arena (2023) was also at the Expo this year and it had a way bigger presence. I did a playtest of it and have played it since with a friend that bought the game. It is different to RoboRally but has a lot of the same features, so it instantly made me think of RoboRally before I realised they were even at the Expo. I don’t think the weighting of the player abilities are very good but it feels like the better choice of the two. </p> <p>This got me thinking… - Has the

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>I&#39;m going to use Ark Nova as an example. Big honkin deck of cards, but no insert to hold them. So I have them sleeved, floating around in the box. </p> <p>I do not like this.</p> <p>I&#39;ve heard some people use some sort of tape, others rubber bands, etc. I want a deck box / deck boxes. And, I want the deck box to fit inside the board game, without lifting the lid.</p> <p>Anyone found something for this? Every deck box I try is a bit too big.</p> <p>Of course, I could go with a small deck box. The issue with those is, there are a lot of cards, so the smaller the deck box, the more tedious it is to get all the cards in and out.</p> <p>So, I guess I&#39;m trying to find the best middle ground. The largest deck boxes that fit inside the board game boxes, without causing lid lift. </p> <p>Does anyone have suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/blind-octopus"> /u/blind-octop

Some would like to preserve dialects and regional languages in a variety of ways, but it’s clearly an uphill battle. </p> <p>When it comes to games, canasta and bridge and others have survived for generations, passed down through teaching from one generation’s gamers to the next’s. Here we are the generation of gamers who have a realistically infinite quantity of games, each with their own rules and components. My kids can play Eclipse, Root, and Pandemic, but have never played BS, Go Fish, or even checkers. </p> <p>Do we have a responsibility to pass the oldest classic games on to the next generation, or is it ok to let them fade into Wikipedia history pages while we table our more modern fare?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cheddar3210"> /u/Cheddar
