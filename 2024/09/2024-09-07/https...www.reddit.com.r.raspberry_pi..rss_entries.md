<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys. My Raspberry came today and I have some problems.</p> <p><code>vcgencmd get_mem arm</code> shows only = 1020M<br/> <code>vcgencmd measure_volts</code> shows only = 0.7200V</p> <p>Temperature is fine, volts is probably because of my bad power supply, which will be fixed when my original RaspPi power supply arrives. But the 1020M confuse me, because i have 8 gigs of ram and it should show about 8192M, right?</p> <p>I have downloaded Raspberry Pi OS, but that low ram would explain some performance issues i had. how do i troubleshoot?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/harvaze"> /u/harvaze </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fbgzgu/ram_problems_raspberry_pi_5_8gb_ram/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fbgzgu/ram_problems_raspberry_pi_5_8gb_ram/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My father is upgrading his RP4 to a RP5 and was going to give me his old one, but it looks like <a href="https://imgur.com/a/gyhm6g5">this</a>. It&#39;s most likely water damage, one of the header pins is broken and one of the PCB layers seems to be slightly delaminating. Can this be fixed? It also has a black aluminium case, which has some of those green/white stains and the brass screw hole looks rusty too.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GBember"> /u/GBember </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fbgsc6/rusty_raspberry_pi4_is_this_fixable/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fbgsc6/rusty_raspberry_pi4_is_this_fixable/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, that I bought a few years ago. I bought it as a replacement for my Raspberry Pi Zero W, that I was using as a Spotify Connect player, when raspotify stopped supporting the old Zero W.</p> <p>It worked fine for a few months, and then it just when to shit... 7 out of 10 attempts to play music through it resulted in the connect part crapping out and the song not playing. It would either &quot;play&quot; (the progress bar would move&quot;, but no sound was sent to my reciever, or the raspotify service would crash altogether. This would mean that I would have to try to reconnect, but often the reconnect attempts would just time out...</p> <p>This happened regardless if I was using raspotify, or Librespot itself, or even volumio.</p> <p>Since this had VERY low wife approval factor I ended up finding an old Chromecast Audio to use as a Spotify Connect device. This worked flawlessly (and still does...). Since the Chromecast Aud
