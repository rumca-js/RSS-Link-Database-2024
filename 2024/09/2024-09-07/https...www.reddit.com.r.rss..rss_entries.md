<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for some good suggestions to my RSS feed list (below). I&#39;ve put some comments where I think is necessary but not on most especially if it&#39;s obvious. Not seen a post like this for a while so hoping we can all share some blogs/sites around our interests: </p> <h1><strong>Games</strong></h1> <p>This isn&#39;t intended to be gaming news, more features and opinion pieces and the feed URLs reflect that, i&#39;d guess I read maybe 20% of these if it&#39;s related to a game I like or know etc - Not a big fan of blogspam news like IGN etc. They&#39;re all similar but with a different niche. </p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feed/features">Eurogamer.net - Features</a><br/></li> <li><a href="https://uppercutcrit.com/category/features/feed/">Uppercut - Features</a><br/></li> <li><a href="https://unwinnable.com/category/sections/gaming-sections/feed/">Unwinnable - Games</a><br/></li> <li><a href="https://www.polygon.com/rss/features/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>New to rss- actually used it years ago, briefly, but think it may be perfect for me now. I’m on MacOS and iPhone. Thinking NetNewsWire looks pretty good. I tried Feeder yesterday but it seems not very intuitive in terms of folders/collections and organizing feeds. I went through their lists and picked what seemed to be a good starter set. But they don’t make it easy to export them. I want my feeds independent of the readers, and I want to try different readers until I find one that I love.</p> <p>So what I’m thinking is to define my feeds somewhere that makes it easy and where I can either export easily or just load them directly to new readers.
