<p>Mattel&#39;s latest Polly Pocket collab is a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://creations.mattel.com/products/polly-pocket-stranger-things-hwp22"><em>Stranger Things</em> playset</a> that houses the fictional town of Hawkins and the Upside Down in a compact shaped like a walkie-talkie. The set, introduced this week, contains figurines of the characters Eleven, Mike, Dustin, Lucas and Will — plus a very non-threatening interpretation of the Demogorgon. Pre-orders for the $50 collectible are now open through Mattel Creations and major retailers, including Walmart and Target. It’s expected to start shipping later this month.</p>

<p>Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, has issued a recall for Ram 1500 pickup trucks from 2019 and 2021-2024 due to a software problem in the anti-lock brake system. The bug could cause the anti-lock brake system to “disable the electronic stability control system,” which in turn can increase the risk of a crash, according to a notice from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recall affects roughly 1.46 million vehicles worldwide, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-recall-about-12-million-vehicles-us-regulators-say-2024-09-07/?taid=66dc429fc3caea0001f9b167"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reports, with the vast majority of them being in the US.

<p>The Roku smart TV platform is an accessible way to watch your favorite streaming content in a centralized location – either built-in to TVs, or by adding affordable dongles or set-top boxes to older televisions. However, a common frustration for any smart TV or streaming service user is that some of the best shows and movies are inaccessible due to geo-restrictions.</p>
<p>Using a VPN is a common way to tackle this issue, but unlike Fire TV, Apple TV and other rivals, Roku systems don’t have native VPN support. But that’s not the end of the story: You can still use a VPN to access a wider range of programming via a Roku — you just need to use a workaround. We’ll show you how.</p>
