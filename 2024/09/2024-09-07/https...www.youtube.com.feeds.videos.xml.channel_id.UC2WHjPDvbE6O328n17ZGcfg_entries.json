Or just more mathematical thinking?\n\nNOTE: Allow me to clarify one thing, I said \"... he [Leslie Lamport] is the one stating programmers need more math\" but this is inaccurate. Leslie Lamport never said that. He is advocating for mathematical thinking and to broaden familiarity of logical operations since many programmers are intimidated by them even though they are no more complex than \"two plus two equals four\", just less familiar.\nWhat I intended was to use the hook to say \"programmers need more math according to Leslie Lamport\", then segue into saying \"well actually, what he was really saying is programmers need more mathematical thinking.\" But in doing so, I made a false statement. So just wanted to clear that up.\n\nI also talk about math's place in programming and the misconception that you need to be good at math to become a programmer. \n\nIf you're a developer, sign up to my free newsletter Dev Notes \ud83d\udc49 https://www.devnotesdaily.com/\n\nIf you're a st", "id": 1101307, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHRVhL1fZC0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2WHjPDvbE6O328n17ZGcfg", "source_obj__id": 118, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gHRVhL1fZC0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Programmers Need More Math", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
