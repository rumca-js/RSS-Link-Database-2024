Inside a small brick building, a dozen Gamblers Anonymous members help themselves to coffee, tea and miniature meat pies. The meeting is taking place in a suburb that has one of the city’s lowest median incomes, and highest levels of gambling losses. A fifth of the state of New South Wales’s 25 most profitable gaming clubs are here, according to <a href="https://www.liquorandgaming.nsw.gov.au/operating-a-business/community-involvement/liquor-and-gaming-data">government data</a>.</p><p>One of these clubs, Fairfield Returned and Services League (RSL), is just a two-minute walk away. It is a building totally at odds with the modest apartment blocks and shabby train station nearby. A pedestrian walkway inside is lined with palms and ferns, it has an elaborate fountain, a gran

Despite leading 20-3 early, a second half implosion saw Australia leak 64 points to Los Pumas and sink to a defeat that, while not quite rivalling their 53–8 to South Africa in Johannesburg in 2009, will nonetheless leave new coach Joe Schmidt fuming.</p><p>Rueing the loss of key front-rowers Angus Bell and Taniela Tupou in the second half, Schmidt admitted his side “fell off a cliff” as the Argentinians ran in nine hot tries, showing the slick play that shocked New Zealand in the TRC’s opening round.

Her latest, <em>Tell Me Everything</em>, unites two recurring protagonists from recent books – self-effacing author Lucy Barton and abrasive nonagenarian Olive Kitteridge – with sometime lawyer Bob Burgess, who first appeared in her 2013 novel <em>The Burgess Boys</em>, and is now set to be hauled out of semi-retirement by a murder case. As a New England winter finally yields to spring, pathos and dry humour gild tender reflections on loneliness and connection, and the redemptive power of storytelling.</p><p><strong>What made you want to bring all three characters together?<br></strong>

There was no grand pre-match introduction for Bellamy, who instead let his players broadcast the beginning of this exciting new story; much the same team but, as promised, a radical shift in style.

<p>Sabbaticals are now a top workplace trend, but before you take the plunge, here it what you need to consider</p><p>Maybe you can put it down as another post-Covid trend, such as working from home, but it’s clear something is going on. People working for a range of employers are increasingly hoping to take sabbaticals or extended time off, with many keen to improve their work-life balance by exploring the world for several weeks, several months or a year or more.</p><p>Surveys and articles have talked about the rise of the “middle-aged gap year”: AKA the “midlife gap year“; the “grey gap year”; and the “golden gap year”. The trend is fuelled by workers aged 50-plus who are often “empty nesters”, have paid off the mortgage and are keen to get off the hamster wheel for a bit, in spite of the cost.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/sep/07/golden-gap-year-how-to-make-a-midlife-break-work-sabbatical">Continue reading...</a>

 There’s no blanket “should” to most things culinary, and the short answer is, it depends. There’s personal preference: budget (extra-virgin olive oil is often a lot more expensive than regular olive oil, or indeed other oils); what you’re cooking and how; what role the oil is playing in the dish, and so on.</p><p>If something is being cooked above a certain temperature, for instance, many people will insist that you absolutely should <em>not</em> cook with extra-virgin olive oil. It has a lower smoke point than some other oils (for instance, a light, refined olive oil or a blended vegetable oil), and some of its flavour and health benefits

So how do you get to the very top?</p><p>One Saturday afternoon last February, a letting agent from Slough called Sundeep Jaswal sat down to watch Sheffield United play Aston Villa on TV. A lifelong Liverpool fan in his mid-50s, Jaswal had no interest in rooting for either team; but he did want one player, Villa’s Ollie Watkins, to perform as well as possible. Every year since the late 2000s, Jaswal had entered the Premier League’s annual points-gathering competition, <a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/">Fantasy Premier League</a>, or FPL, which runs concurrently with the top-flight English season and rewards armchair managers such as Jaswal for their foresight when it comes to anticipating which professional footballers will play well from week to week. For many football fans, the fantasy has come to assume as much importance as the reality. Jaswal was one

<p>With his Ibiza-set novel just out, the bestselling author recalls his drug-fuelled partying years, recovery, and the island’s complicated relationship with tourism today</p><p>The thing that might surprise you about Ibiza is the quiet. Even in August, there are pockets of tranquillity all over the island. Walking along the nature trail between and behind two of its most famous beaches – Es Cavallet and Ses Salines – you hear nothing but the chirp of cicadas and the soft whisper of the Mediterranean. You will also see, if you turn away from the dunes and pinewoods, the salt pans that dominate this southern tip of the island with an almost eerie stillness, a flamingo or two standing like ornaments on the mirror-like water.</p><p>As with many parts of Ibiza – from the hilly forests of the north to the views of the rocky islet of Es Vedrà in the south – it is easy to feel like you have passed into another world. Even more so if you catch them at sunset, when the sky becomes gold and wh

<p>His new film lampoons performative representation in showbusiness – and if it rubs people up the wrong way and ends up being his first, and last, movie? Well, he says, he’s OK with that</p><p>“I want to do Scooby-Doo. I will interview for that job. I would love to make a Scooby-Doo movie.” Sitting opposite me eating a watermelon salad and pitching for the (at the time of writing) theoretical gig of directing a new Scooby-Doo movie is Naqqash Khalid, film director and sometime academic. His new feature, In Camera, is one of the most original debuts in years, a sharp piece of work that satirises the film industry at the same time as being formally inventive and playful. But it’s not exactly an audition for a big studio gig, and though the Scooby-Doo pitch is probably 98% ironic, it’s hard not to wonder what Khalid’s arthouse version would look like, with the actors from In Camera in the lead roles and “every other role played, in multiple role casting, by <a href="https://www.theguar

<p>She made her name as the devil-may-care Samantha in Sex and the City, but her new CIA audio series tells a different story of female empowerment. She talks about life on screen, being childfree and finding love at the BBC</p><p>‘This could only happen on the radio,” Kim Cattrall says, from her home in Vancouver Island, of her new series Central Intelligence. “It would be much too expensive any other way.” She can say that again; the BBC Radio 4 podcast, with this incongruously glittering cast – Ed Harris also stars – tells the true story of the CIA, from its haphazard beginnings in the wreckage of postwar Europe, to 9/11, to the present day. Cattrall narrates as Eloise Page, nicknamed the “Iron Butterfly”, who became the first female station chief in 1978, but had been embedded in the agency since 1947, before it even had the name (previously, it was called the Central Intelligence Group). “It was a time when women were treated either as a mum, or as a secretary, which is just anot
