Games' multiplayer-focused Harry Potter title arrives in a year with more live service misses than hits. Developed by Unbroken Studios, Quidditch Champions, as the name implies, is all about the fictional sport, with players creating an entire team from scratch to compete in various Cups or challenge other teams.\n\nProspects are less ambitious than they seem. The single-player portion of Quidditch Champions is pretty underwhelming, to say nothing about the significant change in rules, from the score limit and number of players per team to the Golden Snitch itself. While the gameplay is occasionally enjoyable, some aspects, like the Seeker, need finer tuning.\n\nThe same goes for multiplayer, which suffers from rubber-banding and no true 6v6 matches. Instead, three players take on two roles each, which is less exciting.
