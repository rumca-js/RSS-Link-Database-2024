In this episode, The Babylon Bee discusses releasing the sausages in Gaza after the meme-worthy gaffe by the British prime minister. There’s also a few updates on the would-be Trump assassin and his son. Then the guys compare and contrast Puerto Rico, the island, to Puerto Rico, the board game. In the subscribers-only lounge, they wrap up with some love mail from Roman Catholics, discuss the necessity of works in salvation, and Jarret reveals another secret.
