The image above might have already given it away for you: Instead of only slapping key character headshots of the Straw Hat crew on dice and calling it a day, the game also includes Monkey D. Luffy’s iconic, trusty hat as the cup for juggling the dice. If you know of a One Piece fan in your life — or, perhaps, that fan is you — this title is available now at Amazon, costing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/YAHTZEE-Co
