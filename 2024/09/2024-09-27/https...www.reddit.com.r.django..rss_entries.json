I originally built it to slim down the CSS files of my Bootstrap-based theme, and I was able to reduce my main CSS file from a hefty 350KB down to just 20KB! </p> <p>The script works by using PurgeCSS to analyze your HTML files and remove any unnecessary styles, followed by compressing the result using GZIP for even faster load times. If you\u2019re looking for a way to optimize your CSS and speed up your site, give it a try!</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear any feedback or suggestions you have, and I\u2019m always open to improvements.
