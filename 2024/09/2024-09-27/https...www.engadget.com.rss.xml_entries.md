<p>If you booted up Steam in the last 24 hours, then you probably saw the pop up window asking you to agree to a new <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_"><ins>Steam Subscriber Agreement (SSA)</ins></a>. Valve laid out the changes in an official blog post on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4696781406111167992"><ins>the Steam Community forum</ins></a>, and notably, binding arbitration is no longer part of the SSA.</p>
<p>Binding arbitration is a requirement that disputes be resolved by a legal proceeding that takes place outside of courts. Instead of a judge, these disputes are overseen by an arbitrator, who is paid by the company for their service. You can imagine why there might be some conflict of interest inherent (or why companies love these things). Instead, the new SSA says customers should seek resolutions to any problems by first cont

<p>Blizzard is diving into the <em>StarCraft</em> shooter well once again, after two previous titles were canceled. This information comes from a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1754525624830484654">forthcoming book about the developer</a> by games journalist Jason Schreier and was discussed <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crazy-blizzard-stories-with-jason-schreier-unlocked-661"><ins>during a recent </ins><em><ins>IGN</ins></em><ins> podcast</ins></a>.</p>
<p>This time around, veteran developer Dan Hay is leading the effort to translate the world of <em>StarCraft</em> into a shooter. Hay certainly has the right pedigree for the job. He’s been involved with the <em>Far Cry</em> franchise since <em>Far Cry 3</em>, eventually becoming creative director of the series.
