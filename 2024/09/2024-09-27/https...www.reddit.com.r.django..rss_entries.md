## Optimize your initial page loads by cleaning up unused css styles!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Hey Django Devs!</strong></p> <p>I’m excited to share a little project I’ve been working on called <a href="https://github.com/DartLazer/djangocssoptimizer"><strong>Django CSS Downsizer</strong>.</a> It’s a Python script that helps optimize the load times of your Django projects by removing unused CSS styles. I originally built it to slim down the CSS files of my Bootstrap-based theme, and I was able to reduce my main CSS file from a hefty 350KB down to just 20KB! </p> <p>The script works by using PurgeCSS to analyze your HTML files and remove any unnecessary styles, followed by compressing the result using GZIP for even faster load times. If you’re looking for a way to optimize your CSS and speed up your site, give it a try!</p> <p>I’d love to hear any feedback or suggestions you have, and I’m always open to improvements. Feel free to check out the code and let me know what you think!</p> <p>Thanks in advance for your thoughts and input. 😊</p

Adding another database to DATABASES on my project&#39;s settings</strong></p> <p>When I tried this, I found a known problem with referential integrity, as the users on both system would be doing operations on their correspondent project database.</p> <p><strong>2. Replication</strong></p> <p>I tried directly thinkering on the database and I almost got it working but I think I was overcomplating myself a bit too much. What I did was a 2-way publication and subscription on PostgreSQL. The problem was that the users weren&#39;t the only data that I had to share between p
