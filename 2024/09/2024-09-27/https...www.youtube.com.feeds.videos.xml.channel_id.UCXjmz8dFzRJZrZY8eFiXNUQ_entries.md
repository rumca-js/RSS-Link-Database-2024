When most actors in Hollywood land their big break, very few risk changing direction.  For Bryan Cranston, it was a no brainer.  After an iconic turn in Malcolm in the Middle, Bryan Cranston wanted something different.  And Breaking Bad gave him that opportunity.  But before the highs of Malcolm in the Middle and Breaking Bad, Bryan Cranston had been a character actor appearing in small parts on dozens and dozens of shows.  Even post Breaking Bad, Bryan Cranston has proved you can't pin him into one archetype.  Walter White will forever be a man of change.
