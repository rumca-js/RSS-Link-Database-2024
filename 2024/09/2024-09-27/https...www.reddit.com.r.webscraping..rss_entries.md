<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After trying a few solutions that would scrape online API documentations like jina reader (not worth it) and Trafilatura (which isway better than jina) I&#39;m trying to find a way to convert the scraped HTML to markfown while preserving things like tables and generally page organisation. </p> <p>Are there any other tools that I should try? </p> <p>Yes, scrape graph is on my radar but bear in mind that using it with AI on a 300 pages documentation would not be financially feasible. In that case I would rather stick with Trafilatura which is good enough. </p> <p>Any recommendations are welcome. What would you use for a task like this? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Conscious_Shape_2646"> /u/Conscious_Shape_2646 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fqxsoq/html_to_markdown/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fqx

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m working on a data mining project focused on analyzing the reactions of international students to changes in <strong>IRCC (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada)</strong> regulations, particularly those affecting study permits and immigration processes. I aim to conduct a sentiment analysis to understand how these policy changes impact students and immigrants.</p> <p>Does anyone know if there’s an existing dataset related to:</p> <ul> <li>Reactions of international students on forums/social media (like Reddit) discussing <strong>IRCC regulations</strong> or <strong>study permits</strong>?</li> <li>Sentiment analysis datasets related to <strong>immigration policies</strong> or <strong>student visa processing</strong>?</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m also considering scraping my own data from Reddit, other social medias, and relevant news articles, but any leads on existing datasets would be greatly appreciated!</p> <p>Thanks in
