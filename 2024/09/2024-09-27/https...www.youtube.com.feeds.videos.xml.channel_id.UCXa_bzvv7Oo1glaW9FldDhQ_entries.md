Ubisoft is no stranger to controversy or concern, especially in the past year following the underwhelming performance of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars: Outlaws. Assassin's Creed Shadows seemed like the blockbuster that could ultimately improve things. However, it suddenly faced a delay to February 14th, 2025.

While the developer says it's to allow more time for polish, there have been some pretty big shifts in its overall release strategy. Assassin;s Creed games launching day one for Steam, removing the season pass model from Shadows, and everyone playing on the same day are just some of those changes.

It feels like the developer wants to ensure a better launch for more positive word of mouth (following the "soft" sales performance of Outlaws), potentially leading to more sales. However, with its titles having a reputation for being "fixed" later, this may all be an attempt to combat that notion.

Ask any gamer what their favourite thing to do in video games is and there's a high chance they’ll list shooting. There’s just something so tangibly satisfying about popping bullets into your enemies in games – it requires skill, it induces flow, it’s intuitive. 

There are other elements that underpin shooting’s satisfaction though, and FPS games from militaristic shooters to chaotic run and gunners all display these in their campaigns.

For instance, wonderfully realised settings that are well designed to support the shooting rank highly. Another is a well-paced, engaging story featuring a cast of meaningful characters. Campaigns which include one or more of these elements elicit emotion in players, and that can be just as endearing as the satisfaction shooting alone provides.
