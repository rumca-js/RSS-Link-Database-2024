<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had gotten my major in communications with a focus on advertising and doing the more creative elements of web design. I currently do not make enough to live on my own. I took an intro to programming class at a community college and loved it. I would love to go back to school for it but with as much as I have to work to afford basic necessities I feel like my only option is to try and learn these skills online. Are there any online places that aren&#39;t scams that give me a good shot at getting a job that pays relatively well. I&#39;ve never had trouble putting in the work, I just and go to school during work hours, but I feel like I can eke out 2-4 hours a day doing modules. Only problem being that all the ones that pop up first of google have been derided by others as being scams. Sorry for rambling, but has anyone managed to learn online at their own pace and secured themselves a good job at the end of it? -any advice would be so greatly apprecia
