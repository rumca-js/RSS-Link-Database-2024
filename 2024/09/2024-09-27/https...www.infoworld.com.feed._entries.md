<p>Now that the initial euphoria about generative AI’s capabilities has worn off, reality is setting in: Large language models without appropriate safeguards can be remarkably naïve and are all too willing to share all they know. That exposes applications built on them, and enterprises using them, to risks including hacking and lawsuits for copyright infringment. </p>



<p>To help enterprises mitigate some of those risks around the use of generative AI, Microsoft has added new safety tools to its application-building platform, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335851/azure-ai-studio-a-nearly-complete-toolbox-for-ai-development.html">Azure AI Studio</a>. The tools are intended to help ent

<p>Based on the hype, you would think that enterprises are scurrying off cloud platforms like rats from a sinking ship. The reality is much more nuanced. <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/Is-cloud-repatriation-the-only-answer">According to Andover Intel research</a>, only about 9% of enterprises have moved applications out of the cloud. They also found that less than 3% of enterprises see any reason for cloud repatriation other than cost, although more than half expressed some disappointment with higher than-anticipated cloud costs.</p>
