	If America is not the “greatest country in the world” why is everyone and their grandmas trying to come here? And why should we take on the world's burden if this is such an awful place? And if America is not the best, which one is?

	These are questions one may not ask during DEI training, as even mentioning America and its greatest will get you fired as the dean of students for a Colorado school district.

At best, the left wants to pretend as if she got to the “root cause” of migration, which is even more pathetic because no one gives a crap about “root causes” when all they have to do is enforce federal immigration law. Nonetheless, she never got to that “root cause” and America is still under an alien invasion. And because the situation is so bad Kamala has to pretend to

Who doesn't need a good laugh on Friday? </p><p>If you have been following the presidential race, you know that the left and the media (but I repeat myself) think Donald Trump being reelected would literally destroy America literally. Democracy? Gone! The Constitution? Shredded! Cats and dogs living together, people being forced to use the bathroom according to the gender they were born with (aka their gender), it would be chaos! </p><p>Just ask this guy: </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Ok, I think we have reached pea
