<p>Microsoft has released a white paper of sorts outlining what the company is doing to secure user data within Windows Recall, the controversial Windows feature that takes snapshots of your activity for later searching.</p>



<p>As of late last night, Microsoft still hasn’t said whether they will release Recall to the Windows Insider channels for further testing as originally planned. In fact, Microsoft’s paper says very little about Recall as a product or when they will push Recall live to the public.</p>



<p>Recall was <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2338891/windows-recall-could-solve-my-biggest-problem-in-tech.html">first launched back in May</a> as part of the Windows 11 24H2 update and it uses the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2388952/new-ai-windows-for-copilot-pcs-what-it-can-do.html">local AI capabilities of Copilot+ PCs</a>.

<p>I have two dogs and a cat in my home, and it’s not unusual for them to run, jump, and roughhouse with each other. They also nap a lot, and they’re bored when I’m not home. That’s just one of the many reasons why an indoor two-way-talk security camera can be useful.</p>



<p>Right now, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Pan-Tilt-Indoor-Cam-White/dp/B0CG2VS5FD/">Ring’s latest Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam is on sale for $50 at Amazon</a>, which is the best price we’ve seen for it so far. This is the latest in Ring’s line of indoor security cameras, introduced earlier this year, and it makes some improvements upon previous models.</p>



<p>The most notable feature is, of course, the 360-degree panning and tilting that lets you angle the camera all around to see any spot of the room it’s in. Using Ring’s app, you can adjust the angle however you want, wherever you w

<p>Gaming laptops are getting pretty amazing, with some even hitting in the same performance category as equivalently expensive desktops. But they’re not getting any cheaper, at least not without a good deal.</p>



<p>That’s where I come in. Today, I present to you this Lenovo LOQ gaming laptop with an Intel Core i5 processor and Nvidia RTX 3050 graphics card <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/166876329304">for just $641.06 on eBay</a>.</p>



<p>A couple of caveats. First, this is <em>refurbished</em> laptop. But as refurbs go, this is one of the best. It’s being sold directly by Lenovo’s corporate eBay account, and comes with a two-year warranty (which is better than the warranties on most new laptops).</p>



<p>Second, an RTX 3050 with 6GB of video RAM is definitely on the low end of modern graphics cards. This thing will be fine for <em>League of Legends

<p>Being able to use an app on my phone to start my car and warm it up ten minutes before I leave on a cold morning is some real “living in the future” stuff. I love it. But connecting everything to everything <em>does</em> open up a lot of potential risk, and security researchers just demonstrated that.</p>



<p><a href="https://samcurry.net/hacking-kia">A four-person team</a> recently discovered a way to remotely hack into almost every recent car made by Kia with little more than a mobile connection. They built a phone app that can scan the license plate of any car with Kia Connect functionality to gain almost total remote access to it.</p>



<p>The tool works on Kia models as far back as 2014, with newer cars opening up more and more capabilities. On the latest Kia models, for example, the tool was able to track a car’s location via GPS, start and stop i

<p>After Microsoft successfully acquired Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion about a year ago, it’s been interesting to see what the company would do with all the intellectual property that came with it, including franchises like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Diablo</em>, <em>Overwatch</em>, and <em>Spyro</em>.</p>



<p>Well, here’s one development that might turn some heads: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/456659/starcraft-game-pass-release-date">Polygon reports</a> that both <em>StarCraft Remastered</em> and <em>StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection</em> will be available on Game Pass starting November 5 (which follows <em>Diablo 4</em> being added to Game Pass back in March).</p>

<p>Any monitor can be used for PC gaming, but a display built for productivity will likely leave you underwhelmed. Limited contrast, blurry motion, and slow refresh rates still hold basic productivity monitors back in games. Fortunately, there’s no shortage of excellent gaming monitors available at a wide range of price points—and the best of them embrace cutting-edge technology unavailable in any other PC display. </p>

<p>Earlier this week, Microsoft released an optional Windows 10 update that makes a few improvements to the Start menu and fixes a login error that’s been lingering for months without a resolution.</p>



<p>If you want to take advantage of this patch, which has update code KB5043133, you’ll have to manually apply it. Otherwise, you can wait until October. (More on this at the end.)</p>

<p>If you don’t smoke and you have no idea what to do with your car’s cigarette lighter outlet — that big circular hole in the center console — then do this: turn it into a USB-C charging port!</p>



<p>Right now, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Adapter-Anker-Compact-Charging/dp/B0BPH6S4DN/">this Anker USB-C car lighter adapter is just $12 on Amazon</a> and it’s one of the best ways to level up your car, not just for yourself but for your passengers as well, particularly on road trips.</p>



<p>If you have an older car that doesn’t have any built-in USB ports, then this little adapter can be a godsend. But even if your car <em>does</em> have built-in USB ports, they may be in hard-to-reach spots, or they may have annoying auto-play behaviors that kick in when plugged, or they may just be outdated (either in USB-A form or just really slow).</p>

<p>If you’re looking to save some dough on a computer display, it’s a great time to hunt for monitor deals thanks to Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days event, and even competing sales events from other retailers. The actual event doesn’t start until October 8, but I’ve scoured the web for the best deals on the best screens right now.</p>



<p>PCWorld constantly reviews the latest monitor models with the newest tech. We also hunt for the best values if you don’t need all the bells and whistles. You can trust us to not just find the biggest discounts, but the discounts on the monitors that are actually worth buying in the first place. </p>
