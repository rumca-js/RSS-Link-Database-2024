I’m running <strong>Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)</strong> on <strong>Portainer</strong>, and I’m trying to set up <strong>AdGuard Home</strong> in Docker on the same server.</p> <p>Everything seemed fine until I tried to deploy AdGuard Home, and I got this error:</p> <p><code>Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint adguardhome (): Bind for</code> <code>:</code><a href="http://0.0.0.0:443"><code>443</code></a> <code>failed: port is already allocated.</code></p> <p>Turns out, <strong>Nginx Proxy Manager</strong> is already using port <strong>443</strong> for SSL, and AdGuard Home is trying to bind to the same port.

Occasionally, I also run a QNAP with its own set of containers. I manage everything through Portainer running on the Raspberry Pi as well.</p> <p>Most of the time, it works perfectly! I have a nice Homarr dashboard, everything runs smoothly on subdomains with certificates managed by Nginx. That is until once in a while (a few days or weeks), everything suddenly stops working...</p> <p>Even though I can still locally access my Raspberry Pi and all services, DuckDNS reports the correct IP, and entering the IP from DuckDNS shows me the Nginx welcome page, <strong>every subdomain gives me a timeout</strong>.
