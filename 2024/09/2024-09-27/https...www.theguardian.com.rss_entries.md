<p><strong>Rose theatre, Kingston</strong> <br>Nell Barlow is heartbreaking as the doomed heroine of the alt-reality boarding-school tale, expertly adapted by Suzanne Heathcote</p><p>Any dramatic adaptation of a well-known story has an inherent problem with tension. How can a script hold those who already know the outcome?</p><p>On the first night of this stage version of Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go – the Nobel prize-winning author watching warmly from the stalls – you could sense the apprehensive fascination of first-timers. Why are teenager Kathy H and friends at a rural boarding school where the students are encouraged to be as healthy as possible while paradoxically knowing that most graduates die in hospital in their 20s? What are the meanings – in this alt-reality version of late 20th-century Britain – of the euphemisms “carer”, “possible” and “completion”?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/sep/28/never-let-me-go-review-rose-theatre-kingston">Continue read

<p>Show framed designer’s new fragrance with clothes offering flashes of skin through sharp tailoring</p><p>While for many people the question of being dressed boils down to whether or not a pair of trousers is on the right way round or a matching pair of socks has been mustered from the laundry, for Victoria Beckham, the notion of being in a state of dress, or undress, is much less quotidian. She proved as much with her latest collection, a musing on the act of dressing, which she showed in a decidedly autumnal Paris on Friday night.</p><p>The collection made for a neat framing for the launch of her new scent. “I think that using this as an opportunity to launch our fourth fragrance, it was about our relationship with our skin, about how we dress ourselves, in our wardrobes,” she said to a small scrum of gathered press backstage. “This time it was about taking the clothes off.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/sep/27/victoria-beckham-muses-on-the-act-of-dressing-

The trendy types will have a&nbsp;new reason to go out and frequent pubs, though they will continue to ask someone if they fancy a beer.

This week Disney+ announced its “paid sharing program”, in which subscribers could add members outside their households for just five extra pounds a month.

<p>A manhattan-style cocktail made up of amaro and rye with a honey syrup</p><p>This drink came about because so many customers were ordering manhattans over something from our house cocktail list that I decided to develop a version that was unique to us, but would still satisfy people’s need for a manhattan-style cocktail. I wanted it to have more richness and complexity, and to use an amaro, too, because I’ve always felt that amari have a greater depth of flavour than vermouths. This all coincided with that time of year when everything gets (dreaded phrase) “pumpkin-spiced”, but I felt that, used in the right way, those seasonal flavours could accent the flavours of the amari. The drink’s name comes from an old nightclub that used to be on the same street as our sister restaurant, <a href="https://www.skua.scot/">Skua</a>. It burned down in the early 1990s, but it’s a great name for a drink, plus, with the Manhattan Rockefeller connection and the Cinderella-pumpkin link, it was just

Well, I am happy to report that, yes, according to industry stats, we reached the gin summit late in 2022, since when sales have been steadily declining and retailers are finally cutting back on their unwieldy ranges. Amen to that, I say.</p><p>What most of us actually want is a gin that tastes of gin, and London dry, which dates from the first gin craze in the 18th century, is the style we like best. It

A man forced his way into the cockpit, disengaged the autopilot and seized the controls.

<p>Whether it’s tomatoes, peas or courgettes, the key to gathering and storing seeds lies in having a good plan for where to keep them</p><p>As summer gives way to autumn, it’s a good time to think about gathering seeds from the year’s final harvest. If all goes well, you’ll be left with ones from your favourite crops in greater abundance than if you had bought them in a packet.</p><p>The way to collect tomato seeds is to scoop the insides out of ripe fruit – the seeds and all the gloop. Place it all into a jar with a little water then put the lid on and give the mixture a good shake. Leave this concoction to ferment for a few days to remove the germination inhibitor found in the juice around the seeds. Any unviable seeds will float to the top – where they can be scooped off – leaving the good stuff at the bottom of the jar. Give the viable seeds a gentle rinse in a sieve and leave them to dry completely on a piece of kitchen roll before storing them in a labelled envelope.</p> <a hre

<p>This fling may have been consensual – but let’s spare a thought for all the other women in media tainted by unfair association</p><p>Anyone who is not a moralist or kidding themselves will admit that a good piece of gossip is one of life’s greatest pleasures. Gossip exposes the false sanctimony of the powerful: it reveals the smug and self-righteous to be grubby, selfish and embarrassing – just like the rest of us. If the pronouncements of politicians make history, and the reporting of the media shapes that history’s official narrative, gossip runs along behind them, like a bratty younger sibling, filling in their omissions to tell a truer story. “You left out this part.” “That’s not what you told <em>me</em>.”</p><p>Maybe this is why media gossip about journalists and politicians carries such a frisson of transgressive delight: it breaks their monopoly on narrative authority.

Working as a hospital porter, helping sick people in need, he probably never expected to become a patient himself: at 50, he was still fit and healthy. But then he strained his back at work, and so began a long, downhill slide. He was given physio exercises to follow online, but couldn’t access them, and before long he was in such pain he was signed off work for good. Unable to keep active, and putting on weight, Jamie was referred to a diabetes prevention programme; but by now his back hurt too much to drive to the clinic, and public transport was a struggle.</p><p>Overwhelmed and isolated, he ended up retreating inside his damp, mouldy council house.

<p>We should be celebrating the revival of the bluefin tuna – but a ravenous fishing industry, backed by government and ‘science’, is already licking its lips</p><p>Over the past three weeks, I’ve been watching one of the greatest natural spectacles on Earth, here in south Devon.

This is the first of Greenwell’s novels to be set in the US, in a hospital in Iowa. Set against the beginning of the Covid pandemic, it asks poignant questions about care, connectivity and community.

<p><strong>(Because)</strong><br>There are flashes of brilliance in this roughly-hewn album, but also flaws hidden by production flourishes.

As fans decried his lack of involvement in the endless water-based procession, the French art-pop practitioner hinted at having been in talks to partake but said he was “weakened and bored by their system” (he would later perform during the closing ceremony of the Paralympics). Seemingly emboldened by this realisation, he added: “I might act drastically in the upcoming few days.”</p><p>In the end, fans didn’t need to wait that long.

Here’s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br></strong>When Elizabeth Taylor was 12, she put herself on a protein-rich diet in an attempt to gain enough inches to be cast in National Velvet. This story speaks of a single-mindedness that is evident throughout this three-part series, executive produced by Kim Kardashian. From taking on the sleazy Louis B Mayer to bridling at being screen-kissed by adult men at 16, this is a portrait of a woman who always fought her corner and knew her own value. <strong>Phil Harrison</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/27/tv-tonight-kim-kardashians-powerful-ode-to-elizabeth-taylor">Continue reading...</a>

 “That man is the most terrifying man I have ever met,” says middleweight boxer Chris Eubank of his first bout of organised unpleasantness with Nigel Benn 34 years ago. Benn, then the world middleweight champion, went by the nickname the Dark Destroyer. “I’m dark and I destroy,” he explains for the dimmer bulbs of Prime Video’s demographic.</p><p>He had one aim that night in 1990 at Birmingham’s NEC: to prove that Eubank’s ring walk song, Tina Turner’s Simply the Best, was predicated on an imposture.
