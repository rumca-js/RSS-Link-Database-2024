Assassin's Creed Shadows seemed like the blockbuster that could ultimately improve things. However, it suddenly faced a delay to February 14th, 2025.\n\nWhile the developer says it's to allow more time for polish, there have been some pretty big shifts in its overall release strategy. Assassin;s Creed games launching day one for Steam, removing the season pass model from Shadows, and everyone playing on the same day are just some of those changes.\n\nIt feels like the developer wants to ensure a better launch for more positive word of mouth (following the \"soft\" sales performance of Outlaws), potentially leading to more sales. However, with its titles having a reputation for being \"fixed\" later, this may all be an attempt to combat that notion.", "id": 1225256, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrvfv660KTU", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Nrvfv660KTU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Assassin's Creed Shadows - What The Hell Is Going On?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-27T13:30:05+00:00", "description": "Ask any gamer what their favourite thing to do in video games is and there's a high chance they\u2019ll list shooting.

Another is a well-paced, engaging story featuring a cast of meaningful characters. Campaigns which include one or more of these elements elicit emotion in players, and that can be just as endearing as the satisfaction shooting alone provides.", "id": 1224400, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QbLzmERNiA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/9QbLzmERNiA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "15 Superb First Person Shooter Campaigns You Can't Afford To Miss", "vote": 0}]
