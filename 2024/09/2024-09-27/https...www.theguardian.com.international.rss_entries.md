Similarly, if men were removed from the franchise, Kamala Harris would be swept into the Oval Office in an even bigger earthquake.

In ways that go deeper than mere politics, and with implications for the world beyond the US, the presidential election is increasingly looking like a war between men and women.</p><p>The numbers are stunning.
