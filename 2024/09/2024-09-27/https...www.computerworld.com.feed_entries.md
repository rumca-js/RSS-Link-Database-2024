<p>With more and more companies <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3535579/whats-behind-the-return-to-office-demands.html">wanting to bring employees back to the office,</a> I pointed out last week the ill-kept secret that there’s a widespread <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1616612/the-open-office-floor-plan-re-thinking-an-awful-idea.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1616612/the-open-office-floor-plan-re-thinking-an-awful-idea.html">aversion to open office floor plans</a> — or activity-based workplaces, as they have often evolved into today — and that it partially explains why many employees want to continue remote and hybrid work. </p

<p>An unbootable PC is every remote worker’s nightmare. It usually means they need hands-on support that they’re not likely to find in their home office or neighborhood Starbucks.</p>



<p>Now there’s hope that even that catastrophe can be corrected remotely. At its Imagine event in Palo Alto, California on Tuesday, HP announced what it calls the industry’s first out-of-band diagnostics and remediation capability that will enable remote technicians to connect, diagnose, and fix problems, even if the PC won’t boot.</p>



<p>The service, launching Nov. 1, lets a technician, with permission from the user, connect to a virtual KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) under the BIOS/UEFI to run diagnostics and ta

<p>With the promise of greater office worker productivity, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1629974/m365-copilot-microsofts-generative-ai-tool-explained.html">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a> generated a lot of business interest even before it launched last November. (It was also for a while renamed Copilot for Microsoft 365; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235634/microsoft-copilot-event-satya-nadella" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that changed earlier this month</a>.)</p>



<p>That initial enthusiasm prompted many Microsoft 365 customers to put the generative AI (genAI) assistant into the hands of employees. But for many organizations, those rollouts have been larg

<p>If you happen to be, or know, an open-source advocate who’s fallen into Apple IT management, here’s some welcome news: all-remote, open-source device management platform <a href="https://fleetdm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fleet</a> has introduced iOS device support to supplement its existing Mac, Windows, and Linux device management capabilities.</p>

<p>Intel is on the verge of finalizing an $8.5 billion funding deal with the US government, under the CHIPS and Science Act, as part of an effort to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing amid growing global competition, a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ff0ca77d-ad35-45ba-a493-201a26932efb">Financial Times report</a> said.</p>



<p>The deal, which has been in negotiation for months, would represent the largest subsidy package awarded to date under the act, which aims to reduce US reliance on foreign chip production and strengthen the country’s semiconductor supply chain.</p>



<p>According to the report, the deal could see a closure by the end of the year as the discussions were “at an a

<p>Body-worn cameras, or “body cams,” are cameras attached to a person. </p>



<p>Body cams have become ubiquitous in US law enforcement, with all police departments serving populations of more than 1 million implementing them by 2020. Nationwide, 79% of officers work in departments that use body cams. And in 2022, US President Joseph R. Biden Jr. signed an executive order in 2022 <a href="https://www.politico.com/sponsored/2024/06/body-worn-cameras-build-transparency-and-trust-for-law-enforcement-across-the-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mandating them for federal officers in specific roles</a>.</p>
