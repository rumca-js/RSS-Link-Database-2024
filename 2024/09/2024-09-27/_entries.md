## Trimer complex TaNF-Y balances grain yield and quality in wheat: Study

Breeding efforts have focused intensively on improving grain yield and quality in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Content and composition of grain starch and seed storage protein (SSP) are two critical factors that determine grain yield and quality. Starch content is closely related to grain weight, while SSP content and composition directly affect the quality of flour. However, there is often a negative correlation between SSP content (quality) and starch content (grain yield).

Hurricanes and other extreme weather events are expensive in lives and money. From 1980 to 2023, weather and climate disasters caused about $2.6 trillion in damages in the U.S., according to NOAA estimates. In 2022 alone, the U.S. experienced 18 disasters individually costing $1 billion or more. Worse, U.S. hurricanes from 2000 to 2021 took almost 2,000 lives. As climate change continues to intensify these storms, accurate forecasting becomes ever more crucial.
