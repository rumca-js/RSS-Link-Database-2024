<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. I have a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Raspberry Pi OS 32 Bit (last herd) and Picamera V3 and i&#39;m making a project. Camera was working correct. Then i disconnected picamera and i put on a cover. (Cover printed with 3d printer) Then i reconnected camera to raspberry pi but it doesn&#39;t work. I runned &quot;rpicam-hello&quot; command in terminal but it gave me this output:</p> <p>[0:06:01.547634718] [1779] INFO Camera camera_manager.cpp:316 libcamera v0.3.1+50-69a894c4</p> <p>Made X/EGL preview window</p> <p>ERROR: *** no cameras available ***</p> <p>When i reconnected the camera. There were too many electrical leaks on raspberry pi. Could this be why the camera&#39;s hardware is broken? I tried with another raspberry pi and another sd card, i updated and upgraded system but camera doesn&#39;t worked. Can I fix it or do I need to buy a new camera?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/step0ner"> /u/s
