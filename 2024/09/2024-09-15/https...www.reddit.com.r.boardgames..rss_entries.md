It would be a place for individuals and families to play/test out games before buying them while they wait for their food. In our area, there is a big need for another restaurant and activities. I have written a business plan, and a space has opened up (we are doing a tour this week). We have a private investor lined up. There is also a locally themed board game that I am working on which will eventually be sold exclusively at our location (this is a heavy tourist area with multiple cryptid legends which we will be basing a series of board games on).</p> <p>The main thing that I am having trouble with is finding game wholesalers with the specific games that I want. I&#39;ve looked at Faire, GTS Distribution, funexpress and some others. There are just some games that I would like to carry, but haven&#39;t been able to find them yet. Do you have any suggesti

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have played a dozen rounds of my Cities Collection Edition of Hamburg to this point and wanted to share a few thoughts. I went back and forth over buying it due to so many negative comparisons to the original Burges and the language independent cards. I do not have Bruges though and it is out of print so a comparison is really a moot point for me, I can only judge the game on its current merits.</p> <p>Overall, I completely love this game and I‚Äôm glad I landed on getting it. Yes, the language independent cards were not the best idea but there is a very organized easy to use appendix. There should have been more than one in the box as not all the symbology is intuitive. This is a valid criticism. That said, after a few rounds we started to only look at the appendix a few times and its quite quick - all the cards are numbered as is the appendix so its not overly onerous. </p> <p>I love the multi-use cards, the choices on offer, the fact that you wont

The issue I am running into is that to me personally, I feel as if having a movement mechanic makes the game feel more alive and more like the intention of the game. Not only this, but I feel like the mechanic allows for another layer of strategic depth.

## Resident Evil Deck Building Game would have been Better as an LCG like Arkham Horror. What defunct game do you think would be better as a related but mechanically different system?

Also possibly Shadowrun Crossfire and D&amp;D Dragonfire would have been better as an LCG instead of the exercise in frustration that they currently are. Maybe even like Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. </p> <p>Honestly, I can only think of a few Non Tableau building DBGs that I think Mechanically and Thematically Work. Even if they are a bit of a butt to setup. I relatively liked the Transformers DBG, but the characters are not terribly balanced well and it is very slow going at the start.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EngineeringDevil"> /u/EngineeringDevil </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fh4oof/resident_evil_deck_building_game_would_have_been/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fh4oof/resident_evil_deck_building_game_would_have_been/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! Looking for board/card game recs with some strategy for a 5.5 year-old hyperlexic AuDHD kiddo who can read and do pretty advanced math. He would love anything that involves counting/math and that is easy to explain but fun and involved to play. So picture fluent reading and math but the attention span of probably a three or four-year-old. It just dawned on me that we should be playing some actual board games with him (we&#39;ve played things like candyland and the Richard Scarry city game and Hiss in the past but I bet he&#39;s ready for more!)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently got Patchwork in a game trade, originally not thinking much of it.</p> <p>Yet, over the past week I have spent more time playing patchwork on Board game arena than working. Every game still provides new discoveries and layers of depth. The balancing act of filling out your board and button economy is endlessly compelling.</p> <p>Now, I own the original edition, but online i much prefer the look of 10th anniversary edition. I am planning on buying it as well as soon as I can. Hopefully I can keep it unopened for a good while, playing the original to get maximum value out of it. </p> <p>Patchwork works. Every turn is meanigful, mentally stimulating, and actually slotting the perfect piece onto your board is so satisfying. Sometimes I even forget all about my opponent, just enjoying the beauty of the design.

But she‚Äôs learned how to sleep the whole night and we want to get back into our campaign games. Here‚Äôs the rub: we need to put the games up so we can use the table during the day. Has anyone found something that they can play on, and then it packs up keeping the game relatively ready to play. Setting up and packing away campaign games would eat up half of the time we have to play. I‚Äôve tried getting my wife into TTS, but she doesn‚Äôt like it.
