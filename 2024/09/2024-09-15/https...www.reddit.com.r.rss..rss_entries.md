<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there,<br/> I just pushed <a href="https://github.com/piqoni/cast-text">CAST-Text</a> - a very simple to use (only arrows or hjkl is all you need) terminal app to read articles in full. It&#39;s also very fast, not only because its a terminal app, but also it prefetches the adjacent articles, so everything is instant. By default it will open BBC, but you can pass any rss/atom feed to it. </p> <p>Let me know what you think, or if you think of a good feature that I can add.<br/> Thanks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/el_piqo"> /u/el_piqo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fhg3nf/casttext_a_zerolatency_fulltext_article_reader_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fhg3nf/casttext_a_zerolatency_fulltext_article_reader_in/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few years ago, I bought Reeder 5 for MacBook but haven’t used it much. Now, I’m hoping to start using it to build a personal knowledge hub (including videos, podcasts, journals, and magazines). I plan to use it across both iOS and MacBook.</p> <p>I saw that Reeder’s latest version just launched, and it looks great, though it seems like its features still need some polishing. </p> <p>Should I spend $5 to buy Reeder 5 for iOS, or is it better to subscribe to the new Reeder version for $10 a year and get cross-platform access? Would love to hear from anyone who&#39;s used either one!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MerrilyAshes"> /u/MerrilyAshes </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fh8wyf/new_reeder_or_classical/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fh8wyf/new_reeder_or_classical/">[comments]</a></span>
