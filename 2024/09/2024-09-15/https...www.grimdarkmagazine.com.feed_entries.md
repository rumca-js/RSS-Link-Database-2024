<p>We return to T.R. Napper&#8217;s wider neon-soaked cyberpunk future in the stand-alone novel, The Escher Man (Titan, 17th September), a brutally barnstorming, mind-bending tale of revenge, memory manipulation, and the downtrodden sticking their middle fingers up at the world order. Endel &#8220;Endgame&#8221; Ebbinghaus is a cartel enforcer in Macau, cashing cheques and breaking necks as required by his terrifying boss, Mr. Long. He&#8217;s a violent man, but he&#8217;s also a family man, and with this being his last day on the job, it&#8217;s time for him to get out. But in a world where control goes beyond a contract and into the deepest kind of manipulation possible&#8211;your memories&#8211;getting out from under the thumb of one of the most vicious men in Asia is not going to be simple, or painless, or without a very tall stack of mangled bodies piling up. The Escher Man is an exciting approach to storytelling. Amongst the things you&#8217;d expect in a cyberpunk novel&#8211;p
