It&#39;s also very fast, not only because its a terminal app, but also it prefetches the adjacent articles, so everything is instant. By default it will open BBC, but you can pass any rss/atom feed to it. </p> <p>Let me know what you think, or if you think of a good feature that I can add.<br/> Thanks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/el_piqo\"> /u/el_piqo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fhg3nf/casttext_a_zerolatency_fulltext_article_reader_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fhg3nf/casttext_a_zerolatency_fulltext_article_reader_in/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 1149435, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fhg3nf/casttext_a_zerolatency_fulltext_article_reader_in", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/.rss", "source_obj__id": 482, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "CAST-text: A zero-latency, full-text article reader in terminal.", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-15T09:49:21+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A few years ago, I bought Reeder 5 for MacBook but haven\u2019t used it much.
