The Antec Flux Pro is the new top performer in our thermal testing, outranking or tying the Fractal Torrent in every test that we ran. The Antec Flux Pro has an overall "standard" or familiar case layout with few major risks and deviations from the norm, but excels in thermal performance, build quality, and basics in a way that lands it on our list of regular recommendations for cases in its performance and price class. We think the closest modern competition would be the wood-fronted Fractal North XL (with the non-XL competing most with the Antec Flux non-Pro), Antec's own C8, the Fractal Torrent, and if you went dual-chamber, something like the Montech King 95 Pro (though it is not as strong of a thermal competitor).
