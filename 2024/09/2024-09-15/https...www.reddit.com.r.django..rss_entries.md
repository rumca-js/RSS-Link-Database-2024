<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there,</p> <p>I&#39;m making a website that displays a lot of dynamic tabled data. After doing a bunch of research, I&#39;ve sort of settled on Datatables - a JS library for displaying the tables that looks quite &#39;modifiable&#39; and that&#39;s to my liking.</p> <p>I&#39;m using Django and Tailwind, and I&#39;ve now noticed that Datatables overrides and messes up the Tailwind styling on my page even if I put the Tailwind CSS after the Datatables but I suspect because I&#39;m loading in my tables with HTMX and initializing them after the swap that it reloads the DT CSS.</p> <p>What does everyone else use when it comes to displaying tables? I like DT because it gives easy sorting and column highlighting and searching and all that jazz which is sort of what I&#39;m after.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zpnrg1979"> /u/zpnrg1979 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments

## What is everything I need to know for testing AsyncWebsocketConsumers from Django Channels

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When you test Django Channels consumers, all of your test methods need to be async if you are putting them in a django.test.TestCase class like I want to do. In that case, how do I make the setUp function work with that? I always seem to get errors.</p> <p>Also, how do I make ConsumerClass.scope work during a test? It seems like it doesn&#39;t contain anything but I still need to access it all across my consumer.</p> <p>So what is everything I need to know to test an AsyncWebsocketConsumers with a class inheriting from TestCase? If you have any piece of information you think could be helpful, please tell it to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Affectionate-Ad-7865"> /u/Affectionate-Ad-7865 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1fhn7pu/what_is_everything_i_need_to_know_for_testing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1fhn7p

This works perfectly fine, but when I adjust the age range to &quot;23-30&quot; for instance, it is not being updated in the actual post (post_detail.html).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, whats your honest opinion on Ruby on rails vs Django vs Laravel ?</p> <p>Personally i have used all three of them just because of curiosity, what i have learned is:</p> <ul> <li>Ruby on rails -</li> </ul> <p>If you use linux then i recommend learning ror because some of the gems or installation errors is pain in windows.</p> <p>The scaffolding is just amazing. You only need one command to create crud which gives you both json for api and web routes.</p> <p>Nowdays it uses hotwire which comes deafult. Its just like ajax so your website feels lil bit like SPA.</p> <p>Best for - Livestream websites, very fast developement and get your product to market compared to django or laravel, hard to find good developers.</p> <p>Downside i faced - No good tutorials, errors in windows, no community.</p> <ul> <li>Django -</li> </ul> <p>The App is amazing like you can just create a feature and use it in any other project.</p> <p>The Admin is very useful im impres
