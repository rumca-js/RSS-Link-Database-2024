Napper&#8217;s wider neon-soaked cyberpunk future in the stand-alone novel, The Escher Man (Titan, 17th September), a brutally barnstorming, mind-bending tale of revenge, memory manipulation, and the downtrodden sticking their middle fingers up at the world order. Endel &#8220;Endgame&#8221; Ebbinghaus is a cartel enforcer in Macau, cashing cheques and breaking necks as required by his terrifying boss, Mr. Long. He&#8217;s a violent man, but he&#8217;s also a family man, and with this being his last day on the job, it&#8217;s time for him to get out. But in a world where control goes beyond a contract and into the deepest kind of manipulation possible&#8211;your memories&#8211;getting out from under the thumb of one of the most vicious men in Asia is not going to be simple, or painless, or without a very tall stack of mangled bodies piling up. The Escher Man is an exciting approach to storytelling. Amongst the things you&#8217;d expect in a cyberpunk novel&#8211;p", "id": 1147169, "language": "en-AU", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-the-escher-man-by-t-r-napper", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 137, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "REVIEW: The Escher Man by T.R.
