Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur, and Sarah Gillis, a SpaceX engineer, have achieved the first private spacewalk, stepping out of the SpaceX Dragon capsule 435 miles above Earth. This historic event demonstrates the potential for private companies in space exploration, using innovative EVA suits and a unique approach without an airlock. The mission marks a significant milestone in commercial space travel.

Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A Star), the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, is spinning in an unusual way, and scientists now believe they may know why. Based on new data from the Event Horizon Telescope, researchers suggest that this cosmic giant likely merged with another black hole billions of years ago. This colossal collision would explain the black hole's rapid, misaligned spin, which differs from the rest of the galaxy's orientation.

A powerful X1.3-class solar flare erupted from the sun on 12 September 2024, potentially boosting aurora visibility across the US this weekend. The flare, which caused a geomagnetic storm rated at G3, also disrupted radio signals in various regions. NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center is closely monitoring this solar activity as more flares are expected, creating further chances for aurora displays and potential impacts on communication systems.

## Indian Researchers Find a New Technique to Control Defects in MOF-Based Supercapacitors

Researchers at the Institute of Nano Science and Technology (INST), Mohali, have developed a new laser-based method to precisely control defects in MOF-based supercapacitors. This technique significantly enhances energy storage performance without altering the MOF’s crystal structure. By adjusting laser power, scientists increased the electrode's surface area and ion accessibility, offering a quicker, safer, and eco-friendly alternative to traditional defect-creation methods. This innovation, published in ACS Materials Letter, may lead to advancements in energy storage technologies.

## Google Pixel 9 Review: Matured Design, But Still Gets Hot

Google's Pixel 9 offers a refined design, a brighter display, and enhanced AI features. The camera system, led by a 50-megapixel sensor, captures stunning photos, and the ultrawide lens adds versatility. Battery life is improved, but the Tensor G4 chip's performance is underwhelming, causing the phone to run hot. Should you buy the Pixel 9? Read our review to find out.

## El Nino and Massive Volcanic Eruptions Triggered Mass Extinction of Life 250 Million Years Ago

The worst mass extinction in Earth's history, 250 million years ago, was triggered by extreme El Niño events and volcanic eruptions in Siberia. These eruptions released vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, causing severe climate changes. The warming environment led to the death of 90% of species on land and in the oceans. While this event occurred millions of years ago, it has significant implications for the modern climate crisis.
