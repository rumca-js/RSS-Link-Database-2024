<p>Experts say ‘baffling’ lack of equivalent to fuel duty means motorists are more strongly taxed than private jet owners</p><p>Campaigners have urged the chancellor to start taxing jet fuel – with a report showing that charging duty at the same rate paid by motorists would raise up to £6bn a year for the public finances.</p><p>An analysis by the thinktank Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E) UK said introducing a “fair” equivalent to the fuel duty paid in other sectors could raise between £400m and £5.9bn a year, based on the 11m tonnes of kerosene consumed by planes taking off from the UK in 2023.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/16/jet-fuel-tax-could-raise-6bn-a-year-in-the-uk-says-thinktank">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Would a fully honest portrayal of what has happened in Gaza this year be unbroadcastable? This film is full of unforgettably harrowing moments – but still, so much more should have been said</p><p>Making a documentary about Gaza for British television must be a daunting task. It was ever thus – any contentious assertion will be met with unusually fierce criticism – but now film-makers have to contend not only with the sheer size of the current crisis, but the fact that it has already played out in real time via social media, in a way that previous flashpoints have not. It may well be that a fully honest portrayal of what has happened in Gaza in the past year would be deemed unbroadcastable, but if you fall short, informed viewers will know.</p><p>Into the Abyss, a new feature-length documentary by Robin Barnwell, suffers from the same fundamental problem as the BBC’s The Darkest Days, shown in April. It does a fine job of conveying the scale of the horror and terror inflicted on Is

A lot of the limitations of their squad were clear, but Eddie Howe took decisive action with a triple substitution at half-time and had his reward as one of the players he brought on, Harvey Barnes, scored a brilliant winner, cutting in from the left and smashing a 25-yard drive inside the far post.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/15/wolves-newcastle-premier-league-match-repor

After the White Stripes dissolved in 2011 he really did move on: country rock, synths, Q-Tip collaborations. Only now, with his sixth solo album, No Name, has he returned to the well of raw and riotous blues-rock delivered in the style of a possessed carny, and bagged his best reviews in years. Even his hair has regressed from an aqua-blue quiff to that old crow-black mop. True to the album’s guerrilla release campaign, he’s playing the kind of venues he outgrew around 9/11.</p><p>It has to be said White is not messing about. His band – drummer Patrick Keeler, bassist Dominic Davis and keyboardist Bobby Emmett, who looks like a defrosted Ramone – is one he might have formed back in 1997 if not for Meg White and conceptual purity: more conventional but thrillingly feral in the mode of his Detroit forebears t

<p>From sweet to savoury dishes, the chef behind Indonesian supper club Spoons loves to use the leaf for its fresh green colour and flavour</p><p>Pandan, thought to originate from Indonesia’s Maluku Islands, is used across south-east Asia. It has a vanilla-esque aroma, notes of rose or coconut, and fresh leaves have that grassiness you get with matcha. You can get it fresh from south-east Asian grocers, and it freezes well.</p><p>It’s a trending ingredient in desserts and drinks. But in Indonesian cuisine, and others, it’s used a lot in savouries. I make coconut rice and throw in lemongrass and pandan for the aromas.

<p><strong>O2 Academy Brixton, London</strong><br>Harlem rapper’s raw and eclectic performance has the whole venue bouncing</p><p>The balcony at Brixton Academy is shaking with the volume of 5,000 people screaming “IMMA RUIN YOU CUNT” at the tops of their lungs. It’s the second date of Azealia Banks’s first UK tour in more than five years, and the Harlem rapper has the crowd eating out of the palm of her hand like she’s working a basement club.<br><br>
 With a career spanning 16 years and just one official album to her name, Azealia Banks usually makes more headlines for her controversies and commentary than her music. This has undoubtedly held her back career-wise, at least by traditional metrics, but even posting Instagram stories from a Trump rally in Florida hasn’t managed to override her reputation as one of the most talented performers of her generation.<br><br>

<p>Juicy fruits, lamb steaks and crispy buns bring lingering joy as summer wanes</p><p>The smell of baking still lingers. Toasty and warm. On the table, a tray of choux buns, small, crisp and walnut brown. I have already eaten three and I really shouldn’t, because guests are coming to tea. The buns are more crisp than usual, baked at a high heat to give them a shell that contrasts with the softly whipped clouds of lemon curd cream inside. There’s passion fruit in the filling, too, because it is gorgeous with anything citrus.</p><p>You could make neat little buns if you have a piping bag in the kitchen. I prefer them to be less uniform. I made my first batch of choux buns at cookery school in Paris and was given the absurdly difficult task of piping them full of strawberry sorbet. Glorious to eat if you were quick – and we were – but imagine the mess. So now I stick to cream and the occasional flavouring.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/sep/15/nigel-slaters-r

<p><strong>National Gallery, London</strong><br>Gathering together 61 of Vincent van Gogh’s masterpieces from around the world, the National Gallery’s once-in-a-lifetime show lets the art speak for itself</p><p>At the National Gallery’s vast new Van Gogh exhibition, visitors will be able to see a painting of 1889 whose title, <em>Undergrowth</em><em>, </em>speaks not of sunflowers, but of untrammelled weeds – and by extension, perhaps, of the dense scrub of the unconscious. Born of his fascination with the raggedy garden of the hospital at Saint-Rémy, to which the artist had admitted himself after several breakdowns, this picture is covered all over by ivy – a rapacious thug of a plant, sinister and bullying. The ground has long since been carpeted, and now the trunks of the trees, clustered together here as if in solidarity, are also on their way to full colonisation, the vines creeping ever upwards. Some small patches of the scene are miraculously dappled with sunlight, but the feel

<p>A Thousand Feasts is a collection of stories and insights from the Observer’s food writer. Here, he reflects on simple joys that can arrive anywhere, from a beach half a world away to his own kitchen</p><p>There is so much to feast on. The sight of a wave of snowdrops under the gnarled branches of an oak tree; the crisp pages of a new diary; a battered wicker basket of dumplings fresh from the steamer. I feast on the pleasure of packing for a trip away from home; tucking into an impromptu picnic of bread and cheese; the scent of a bunch of home-grown sweet peas and the satisfaction of a neat pile of fresh ironing. Tiny feasts, but as enriching to me as a laden table with a gathering of boisterous and much-loved friends. These diminutive pleasures are there if we care to look for them, little joys illuminating an increasingly darkening world. They feed the soul and nourish the spirit. Or at least they do mine.

A model since childhood (first for her father, a keen amateur snapper, then as a fashion model, then as a muse and artistic collaborator with the surrealist artist Man Ray), Miller learned about photography from both sides of the lens. She knew from experience that taking a picture can be a kind of theft, a one-way transaction in which the subject gives a part of themselves but receives very little in return.</p><p>This sobering, serious-minded partial biopic, which focuses on Miller’s stint as a war correspondent during the second world war, makes a case that her insight into the power dynamics of photography contributed to <a href="https://www.thegua
