Fundamentally the game migrates to CryEngine 5.11, complete with a suite of visual upgrades, DirectX 12 support, and most crucially, a release for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S. At last, this means that consoles receive real time lighting via SVOGI -  Sparse Voxel Octree Global Illumination - in an enhanced form that allows both diffuse lighting and a simulation of light across rougher, specular materials. There's improved hair rendering, noticeably in the game's loadout menu. We have support for upscaling technologies like AMD's FSR and Nvidia's DLSS - where FSR2 in particular is used on con

## Star Wars Outlaws played in first-person VR is a force to be reckoned with

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/b1_x2Ovpam.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>The first time I crawled into a vent in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and the camera changed from third to first-person, I thought to myself, "why can't the whole game be like this?". The level of detail to the scenery, props and the many alien life forms that inhabit the games' multiple planets is incredibly impressive and it makes the areas you explore feel alive and, most importantly, in-keeping with the Star Wars universe. </p><p>Even though I enjoyed looking it at all from my third-person perch above Kay Vess' shoulder, I was dying to inspect the assets in closer detail. It's such a well built world that I wanted to be <em>in</em> it, rather than observe it. While I haven't been able to manage that officially as, sadly, it's not an option in Ubisoft's game, that's exactly what I was a

## Periphery Synthetic is playable by sound alone - is it the next step in accessibility for the blind and visually impaired?

It's an exercise we've all tried: navigating through touch, memory, and educated guesses. Invariably, we panic and open them immediately or run into something we were sure wasn't there. You can do the same in a video game and have a similar experience of playing chicken with obstacles, both real and imagined, in your path. Though that is the closest many sighted players will come to the realities of blind and visually impaired gamers.</p><p>A clutch of games exist, however, in which this is not the case. It's not a crowded field, but it received a new entry last month in Periphery Synthetic. A nonviolent, undemanding space exploration designed as, according to its <a href="https://shiftbacktick.itch.io/periphery-synthetic-ep">developer shiftBacktick</a>, "primarily an auditory experience to be playable without seeing the screen."</p>
