Probably too much thinking and not enough doing, so I&#39;m asking for your opinions.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for something to backup my and my gf&#39;s photos/videos from our android phones, have them accessible remotely, and sync separate folders from our computers to the phones.</p> <p>Also looking at the possibility of client encryption so the admin(myself) cant access user files.</p> <p>Thus with all the above, I&#39;ve currently got nextcloud running. Its been fine, other than a bit slow, and the android app has had some problems syncing large (10GB, 150 folders) nested folders where I had to go to each folder and tell it to sync, and that still de-sync sometimes.</p> <p>I tried seafile, love the idea of the fast DB backend (and I would do a file-based backup to a client) but immediately didn&#39;t like the android app - its quite primitive and wouldn&#39;t run a sync on command, or automatically after a day

I&#39;ve been poking around for a solution to this problem I&#39;ve been having for a while and I think this is the community I need to ask questions of to put me on the right track. My DnD group records our sessions (online play; I screen record in OBS) for personal use only. We are not interested in streaming/publicizing our games, we just like having them for posterity and memories. Currently, I record 3 different games that have been running for at least 4 years with each video being ~2 hours long (4 hour sessions with a break in the middle). They&#39;re generally anywhere between 1.5GB and 2.5GB for each file. I used to upload all of these into my personal Google Drive account to share with the rest of the group (between each of the games, about 12 people have access to these videos) but paying for Google Storage is getting less and less defensible to me as the tech landscape evolves, and also Google Drive&#39;s video playback feature

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am using (a shared) iCloud Photo Library on my iPhone. My partner does too. But I want an offline copy as back-up (or maybe as a main library). But the choice of apps is overwhelming. Comparing those is difficult, because they don’t go deep enough (for me).</p> <p>I tried a few in the past but the one problem is sync: at some point manual copying (for new items) is to time consuming. And exporting previous photos is too. Especially when I want high quality so unmodified photos I export as is and modified photos I export as ‘new’.</p> <p>Any advise from people who tried (multiple) photos solutions? For me, this important:</p> <p>* Self hosed in docker on Synology.</p> <p>* iOS app, but also Apple TV and Mac.</p> <p>* Easy solution to sync photos made on iPhone. What option?</p> <p>* Handles meta data automatically, like location, faces, and (preferably) keywords.</p> <p>* Support for heic/heif, Live Photo and dolby video videos (and other Apple stuff

## ISP has terrible routing paths, considering setting up a VPS with a VPN for better routing

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Background: I&#39;ve noticed while playing a lot of multiplayer games, I get way higher ping than I should. I decided to take a peak with <code>tracert</code> on some IPs of servers I connect to and found that it takes horrible pathing. For example, I am in southern California, but connecting to servers in Denver will route through Chicago first. What I discovered is that if I turn on my VPN (ProtonVPN in this case), it takes a near direct route, which cuts my ping in half.</p> <p>What I want to do: I&#39;m considering setting up a dedicated VPS that I can use as a VPN, probably using WireGuard, to take advantage of their routing. I know that many large VPS providers have agreements to provide near direct routing to eachother. </p> <p>Is this the best way to do this? I&#39;d appreciate others thoughts on this</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Astronaut-Remote"> /u/Astronaut-Remote </a> <br/> <span><
