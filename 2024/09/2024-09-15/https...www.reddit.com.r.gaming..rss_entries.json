Most of the &quot;stealth&quot; in modern games is exceptionally boring (Spiderman 2) or lacking in depth (Ghost of Tsushima). 10 years ago we had the Arkham games, prime Assassin&#39;s Creed, Dishonored, Splinter Cell, Metal Gear but now the well runs dry. These games sold well! They were amazing games and had very good stealth.

Pretty mind-blowing level of immersion and content (granted I&#39;m the &quot;explore every damn alley and air shaft&quot; type of player). I only maxed 60ish hours in each of the Mass Effect games, and topped 160 in Cyberpunk with Phantom Liberty which is massive in scale compared to Deus Ex.
