I decided to put eStarland to the test by buying some retro consoles and sending in a couple of my own for repairs. What I discovered was a mix of surprises, from impressively restored classics to a few head-scratchers along the way. Despite some delays and one unfixable console, I came away feeling pretty positive about the experience overall.
