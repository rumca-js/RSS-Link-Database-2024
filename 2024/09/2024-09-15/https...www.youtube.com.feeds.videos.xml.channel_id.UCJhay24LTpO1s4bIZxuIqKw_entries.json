Symmetry is fascinating to the human mind and everyone likes objects or patterns that are in some way symmetrical. It is an interesting fact that nature often exhibits certain kinds of symmetry in the objects and phenomena in our Universe.\n\nWe have, in our minds, a tendency to accept symmetry as some kind of perfection. Yet it so often eludes us\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s look at code and see what interesting properties emerge from various kinds of symmetries. A quest for the \u2018Character of Code\u2019, following Richard Feynman\u2019s awe-inspiring take on physical laws.\n\nWe'll be looking to identify patterns in code, interested to see when such patterns exhibit some sort of symmetry that is advantageous in some way for reliability, performance, maintenance and discoverability.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2024/\nSponsored By think-cell\n---\n\nV", "id": 1150531, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRAGV60PWBM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "source_obj__id": 421, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/sRAGV60PWBM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Symmetry in Code - Should We Care? - Victor Ciura - ACCU 2024", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-15T12:00:07+00:00", "description": "ACCU Membership: https://tinyurl.com/ydnfkcyn\n---\n\nIntroduction to Lock/Wait Free Algorithms - Defining and Understanding the Terms - Jeffrey Mendelsohn - ACCU 2024\n---\n\nThe goal of this talk is to provide a working understanding of what it means for an algorithm to be lock/wait free. A brief recap of computer hardware design will motivate the need for concurrent algorithms. Without too much detail, the problems with typical synchronization primitives will be reviewed to introduce the desire for algorithms that do not use these primitives. Simple, working, easy-to-understand definitions for lock/wait freedom will be provided, and then compared and reconciled with common and exacting definitions. Use cases, implementation techniques, and common issues will be discussed with the intent of providing additional background information.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2024/\nSponsored By think-cell & Bloomberg Engineering\n---\n\nJeffrey Mendelsohn\n\nJeffrey Mendelsohn is currently a", "id": 1148631, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKBhtwIY_bU", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCJhay24LTpO1s4bIZxuIqKw", "source_obj__id": 421, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/JKBhtwIY_bU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Introduction to Lock/Wait Free Algorithms - Defining and Understanding the Terms  Jeffrey Mendelsohn", "vote": 0}]
