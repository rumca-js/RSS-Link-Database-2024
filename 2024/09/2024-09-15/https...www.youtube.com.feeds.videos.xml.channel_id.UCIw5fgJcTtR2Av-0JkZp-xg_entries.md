Lyrics: 
Rearview sunsets, tears in the warm night sky  
Too young to notice, didn’t know how to say goodbye  
Radio waves, filling up the empty space  
Echoes of a time we had new fears to face  

We were fourteen; between  
No longer kids and swimming upstream  
The shimmer of a light beam, it seemed  
No better than a daydream, to me  

Cracks on the pavement, feelings and cars rush by
Your hand on my shoulder, got me asking why
So many questions, wondering what it’s all about
Cos something changed, and I never quite figured it out,   
  
We got our laughter stolen
Unspoken promises broken
But hey that’s just the way it’s played,
It’s still the same today

We were fourteen, between
No longer kids and swimming upstream
The shimmer of a light beam it seemed
No better than a daydream, to me  

I was fourteen, feeling  
Like a kid and I was swimming upstream  
The promise of a light beam, it seemed  
No longer just
