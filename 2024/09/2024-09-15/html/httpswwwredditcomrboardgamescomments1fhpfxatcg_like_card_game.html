I liked epic quite a but but was wondering if there were more games like it. Preferably a 2 player game where each player has hp and you try to kill each other (like mtg and such) and under 50$. Anyone have any good suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Randomusic13"> /u/Randomusic13 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fhpfxa/tcg_like_card_game/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fhpfxa/tcg_like_card_game/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
