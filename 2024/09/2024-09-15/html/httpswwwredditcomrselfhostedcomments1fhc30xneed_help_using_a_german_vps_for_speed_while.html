The goal is to ensure that my traffic appears to come from a Moroccan IP address for access purposes but routes through Germany for improved performance. (Note The website only gives access to Moroccan Ips but the website server exists in Germany) this solution is for having chance to get responses from the website server when being in High Traffic situations. Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sa7tout7"> /u/sa7tout7 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fhc30x/need_help_using_a_german_vps_for_speed_while/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fhc30x/need_help_using_a_german_vps_for_speed_while/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
