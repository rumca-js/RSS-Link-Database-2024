Also possibly Shadowrun Crossfire and D&amp;D Dragonfire would have been better as an LCG instead of the exercise in frustration that they currently are. Maybe even like Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. </p> <p>Honestly, I can only think of a few Non Tableau building DBGs that I think Mechanically and Thematically Work. Even if they are a bit of a butt to setup. I relatively liked the Transformers DBG, but the characters are not terribly balanced well and it is very slow going at the start.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EngineeringDevil"> /u/EngineeringDevil </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fh4oof/resident_evil_deck_building_game_would_have_been/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fh4oof/resident_evil_deck_building_game_would_have_been/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
