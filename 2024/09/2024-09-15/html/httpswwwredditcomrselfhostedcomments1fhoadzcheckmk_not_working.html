I have portainer installed on a ubuntu server vm running on proxmox and I past the docker install command there and it installs but I get the port is already allowcated so I go into portainer and duplicate it but delete the 8000:8000 port and change the 8080:5000 to 8081:5000 and that works and the container starts with no issues. I go into the consol in portainer and I create a site by doing omd create &lt;site name&gt; and it creates it now my issue is when I type that the site name it gives me it says that the site cant be reached. I have no idea what I did wrong or what I should do to fix it. If someone could help that would be great.</p> <p>It does say when creating the site that it could not mount --tmpfs</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nategames64"> /u/Nategames64 </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
