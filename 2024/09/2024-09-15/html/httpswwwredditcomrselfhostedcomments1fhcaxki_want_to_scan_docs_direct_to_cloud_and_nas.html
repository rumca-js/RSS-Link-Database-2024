Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheLVP"> /u/TheLVP </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fhcaxk/i_want_to_scan_docs_direct_to_cloud_and_nas/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fhcaxk/i_want_to_scan_docs_direct_to_cloud_and_nas/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
