Sometimes I'll watch anime on my break. However I find myself to not be refreshed sometimes I do that. So I was wondering if there were any games that either</p> <p>You can only play for 15 mins a day or</p> <p>1 session is only 15 mins. </p> <p>People have suggested hades online so maybe I'll try that. I personally have been playing Pok√©mon sleep which just doesn't have things to do so you only spend like 15 mins at best a day on it. I've also been playing games like connections and wordle but have gotten slightly bored from them now. </p> <p>Also if yall have any good non gaming study break alternatives lmk.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/YammaTamma"> /u/YammaTamma </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fhankm/games_that_i_can_play_for_15_mins_duri</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fhankm/games_that_i_can_play_for_15_mins_duri</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
