I deployed LinkDing as it seemed to be a crowd favorite and that was easy enough, but the ios support is clunky. The Linkdy doesn’t seem to work through cloudflare tunnels.</p> <p>Anyone have any better luck with LinkWarden with ios, Mac and Windows? I have ios phone, Mac laptop and at work Windows and a Linux box. </p> <p>After digging more, I found ArchiveBox and Readeck. Those seem a lot heavier weight than just bookmarking. Does anyone use those in combination? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/j1ruk"> /u/j1ruk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fhhcng/organizational_tool_issues/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fhhcng/organizational_tool_issues/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
