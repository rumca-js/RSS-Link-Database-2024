I have voted Labour for 60 years, but these aren’t my people. Whatever Rachel Reeves may achieve, she will always be known for this, her “Thatcher the milk snatcher” moment (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/sep/08/rachel-reeves-winter-fuel-payment-pensioners">This ‘iron chancellor’ faces an early challenge to her authority over winter fuel payments</a>”, Comment).</p><p>My housing benefit has gone down, my rates have gone up, as have my fuel bills. I have become a taxpayer again on my tiny private pension, due to tax threshold changes. I have lost my free TV licence. Ours is the generation who send Christmas cards, give to charities, support high street shops. Don’t be surprised when this spending goes down.</p> &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2024/sep/15/in-ending-the-winter-fuel-allowance-t">https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2024/sep/15/in-ending-the-winter-fuel-allowance-t</a></pre></div></body></html>
