He stated he would only return if voters affirm his honesty. This decision has stirred political discourse and speculation regarding AAP's interim leadership and electoral strategy. Kejriwal further indicated that his deputy Manish Sisodia will also return to office only after the people give a verdict in his favour. The BJP has termed the announcement a "PR stunt".</pre></div></body></html>
