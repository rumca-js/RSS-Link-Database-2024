Now, I’m hoping to start using it to build a personal knowledge hub (including videos, podcasts, journals, and magazines). I plan to use it across both iOS and MacBook.</p> <p>I saw that Reeder’s latest version just launched, and it looks great, though it seems like its features still need some polishing. </p> <p>Should I spend $5 to buy Reeder 5 for iOS, or is it better to subscribe to the new Reeder version for $10 a year and get cross-platform access? Would love to hear from anyone who's used either one!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MerrilyAshes"> /u/MerrilyAshes </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fh8wyf/new_reeder_or_classical/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1fh8wyf/new_reeder_or_classical/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
