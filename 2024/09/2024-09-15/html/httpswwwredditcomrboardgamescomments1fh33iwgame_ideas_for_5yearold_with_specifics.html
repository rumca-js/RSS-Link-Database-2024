Looking for board/card game recs with some strategy for a 5.5 year-old hyperlexic AuDHD kiddo who can read and do pretty advanced math. He would love anything that involves counting/math and that is easy to explain but fun and involved to play. So picture fluent reading and math but the attention span of probably a three or four-year-old. It just dawned on me that we should be playing some actual board games with him (we've played things like candyland and the Richard Scarry city game and Hiss in the past but I bet he's ready for more!) Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MilkThistleGenus"> /u/MilkThistleGenus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fh33iw/game_ideas_for_5yearold_with_specifics/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fh33iw/game_ideas_for_5yearold_with_specifics/">[comment</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
