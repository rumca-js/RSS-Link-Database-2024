You only need one command to create crud which gives you both json for api and web routes.</p> <p>Nowdays it uses hotwire which comes deafult. Its just like ajax so your website feels lil bit like SPA.</p> <p>Best for - Livestream websites, very fast developement and get your product to market compared to django or laravel, hard to find good developers.</p> <p>Downside i faced - No good tutorials, errors in windows, no community.</p> <ul> <li>Django -</li> </ul> <p>The App is amazing like you can just create a feature and use it in any other project.</p> <p>The Admin is very useful im impres</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
