The flare, which caused a geomagnetic storm rated at G3, also disrupted radio signals in various regions. NOAAâ€™s Space Weather Prediction Center is closely monitoring this solar activity as more flares are expected, creating further chances for aurora displays and potential impacts on communication systems.</pre></div></body></html>
