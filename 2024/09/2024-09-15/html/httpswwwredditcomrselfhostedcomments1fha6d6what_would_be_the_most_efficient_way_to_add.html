Manually adding them is out of the question due to the amount of songs. Should also mention, a huge portion of those songs are in Japanese, so lyrics might be a bit harder to find (I'm fine with both romanized and native lyrics since I can read Japanese)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pipipupumees"> /u/pipipupumees </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fha6d6/what_would_be_the_most_efficient_way_to_add/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fha6d6/what_would_be_the_most_efficient_way_to_add/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
