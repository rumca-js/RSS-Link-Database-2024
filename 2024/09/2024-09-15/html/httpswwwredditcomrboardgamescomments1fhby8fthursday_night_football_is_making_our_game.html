Need recommendations </p> <p>Our normal Thursday night board game sessions are much harder to concentrate during when a good game is on (tried to play A Feast For Odin during the chiefs game and it went poorly). </p> <p>There’s quite a few good matchups this year so I’m trying to find some Filler-esque games to play that don’t require full attention at all times.</p> <p>The other hiccup is our group ranges from 4-7 players any given week so I’d need suggestions on each player count.</p> <p>Currently we have:</p> <p>-Nidavellir</p> <p>-Furnace</p> <p>-Scout</p> <p>-War Chest</p> <p>-Nocturne</p> <p>-Splendor</p> <p>-7 Wonders</p> <p>-The Crew</p> <p>-Skull</p> <p>I realize this list is big, but the issue is when we get over 4-5 players and that list shrinks to 7 Wonders lol</p> <p>I’d love to hear new recommendations for larger groups that are lightweight but still have some yuspa. Like party game +&lt;</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
