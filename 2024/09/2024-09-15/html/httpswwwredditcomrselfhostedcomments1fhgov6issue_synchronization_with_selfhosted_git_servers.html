One important feature for me is proper issue management, as I plan to mirror my self-hosted instance to a public platform like GitHub or GitLab.</p> <p>Of course, self-hosted solutions like Gitea, Forgejo, or GitLab allow for issue creation, but by nature, issues aren't part of the actual git repository. Thus, they don't synchronize with the public mirror (e.g., GitHub). </p> <p>Issues are an important part of my workflow, and I'd like them to be available on both my self-hosted instance and the public mirror.</p> <p>How do you manage issues in a way that allows synchronization between your self-hosted git server and public mirrors?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/4bjmc881"> /u/4bjmc881 </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhoste</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhoste</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
