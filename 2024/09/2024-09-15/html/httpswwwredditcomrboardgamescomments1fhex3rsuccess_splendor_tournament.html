People had a lot of fun. Top prize was $200. We hope to do it again next September!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ben_Manda"> /u/Ben_Manda </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fhex3r/success_splendor_tournament/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fhex3r/success_splendor_tournament/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
