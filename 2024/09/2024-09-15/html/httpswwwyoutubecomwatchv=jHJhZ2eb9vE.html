It brings everything available in the PS5 version along with a few features catered to PC players, including a 240 fps cap, support for various upscaling options, and numerous graphical options. 

You won’t have to guess whether your machine can run the game, as the developers have released the minimum and recommended specs to aim for, and if that’s not enough, a demo is available which allows you to test out the game on your PC.

The demo is quite long, though that’s not a problem, as the save data will transfer to the final retail version of the game.</pre></div></body></html>
