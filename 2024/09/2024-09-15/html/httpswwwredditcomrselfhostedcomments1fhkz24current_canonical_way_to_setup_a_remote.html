I wanted to be able to control music through my pc/phone/tablet without having to deal with the hassle of pairing unpairing with the system. </p> <p>I am thinking about installing a client like Feishin that supports web GUI onto a raspberry pi with POE. Then connect that RPI to the DAC of the hifi system. </p> <p>I found that there are some tailored made solution for this use case like Volumio but I don't know what nuance I might be gaining/missing with the options on the table.</p> <p>I would love to hear your opinions and experiences with this.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nanithedata"> /u/nanithedata </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/s</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/s</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
