We currently play Love Letter (Batman edition) and Sushi Go, though one of my kids isn’t fond of Sushi Go. </p> <p>I’m looking for a game that can be played from the time we get in until food comes, so about 10-15 mins… maybe 20 if the restaurant is slow. Can be a board game, but something easy to pack up when food comes, and something easy to continue later would be best. </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/imawesometoo"> /u/imawesometoo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fhp9wt/games_to_play_at_restaurants/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fhp9wt/games_to_play_at_restaurants/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
