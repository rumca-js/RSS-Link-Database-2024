From a narrative perspective, he hasn’t ever really been at the forefront of things, playing a secondary antagonistic role every now and then at best, but in spite of tcche fact that he isn’t necessarily among the more prominent Mortal Kombat characters, his shadowy and enigmatic persona has certainly endeared him to a great many fans. 

When Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns launches not long from now, Noob Saibot will be stepping into the limelight once again, and ahead of his return to the grand stage, here, we’re going to go over his entire story over the course of the Mortal Kombat franchise.</pre></div></body></html>
