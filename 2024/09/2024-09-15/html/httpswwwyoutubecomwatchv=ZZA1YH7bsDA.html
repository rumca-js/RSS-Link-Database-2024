This isn’t just some lazy port. The team at Ballistic Moon ensured that they pulled out all the stops to add substantial enhancements and additions to the cult horror hit. 

Perhaps the biggest addition is the new over-the-shoulder camera. You can now fully control camera movement around your characters, a huge change from the original’s static camera. Facilitating this new camera are the new collectables, as well as new locations for every previous collectible. 

Fans are going to have a field day searching every nook and cranny within the gorgeous newly lit environments. Graphics are also built from the ground-up with Unreal Engine 5 replacing the Decima Engine. All of these enhancements make for an enticing new experience, whether you’re a longtime fan of the branching narrative arcs or a new player trying it out on PC.</pre></div></body></html>
