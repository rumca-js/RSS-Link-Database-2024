You start out with lots of Heat already on your engine, and as you drive harder the Heat comes into your hand (discard) and if there’s no more Heat on your engine that’s when you overheat and spin out. Which is totally backwards! I have to think about it in terms of the Heat cards being something like “Heat Management Units” for it to make sense. </p> <p>Or have I got it wrong? Does it make thematic sense to anyone else?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jcsehak"> /u/jcsehak </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fhe6mf/heat_core_mechanic_feels_backwards/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fhe6mf/heat_core_mechanic_feels_backwards/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
