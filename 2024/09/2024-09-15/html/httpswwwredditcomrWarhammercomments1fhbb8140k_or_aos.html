I'm now in my early 40s so thought I'd have another go. </p> <p>Turns out I'm really enjoying the modeling and painting aspect. I'm in the UK and there's some good local clubs near me that play a variety of GW games. </p> <p>When I started back up I started with a GK squad and the battle sister combat patrol for 40k. I've enjoyed and painted these models but now looking to actually get a army together to join the game nights. </p> <p>But honestly it's very intimidating. Most 40k people are playing 1000 and 2000 point games that can take hours and there's so much to learn. My concern is that I just dont have the time to dedicate to 'getting into' 40k actual games at the moment let alone actually finding 4-5 hour</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
