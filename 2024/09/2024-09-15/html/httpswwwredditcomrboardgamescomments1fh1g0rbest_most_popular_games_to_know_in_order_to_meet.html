What's a similar game to get into if I wanted to show up somewhere to play a game others loved? In mainstream media I see people talk about DnD, Warhammer and Magik (Magic?)a lot, but it isn't brought up that often here. What game is good to go out and play with other people? I play Risk, but on the internet. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bot-2_Point_0"> /u/Bot-2_Point_0 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fh1g0r/best_most_popular_games_to_know_in_order_to_meet/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fh1g0r/best_most_popular_games_to_know_in_order_to_meet/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
