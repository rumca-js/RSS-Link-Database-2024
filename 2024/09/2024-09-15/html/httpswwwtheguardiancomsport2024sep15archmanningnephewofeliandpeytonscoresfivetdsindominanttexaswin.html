 The kid from one of the most famous families in football delivered an immediate hit.<br/><br/>
 Manning threw for four touchdowns and ran 67 yards for another score after taking over for Ewers in the second quarter, leading the No 2 Longhorns to a 56-7 win over UTSA on Saturday night.</p><p>Texas (3-0) led 14-0 when Ewers left with what coach Steve Sarkisian called strained abdominal muscles. Manning threw a 19-yard touchdown to DeAndre Moore on his first play, then broke off the long sprint for another touchdown on Texas’ next possession, as several UTSA (1-2) defenders chased him.<br/><br/>
 “When the adrenaline kicks in, it helps you run a bit faster,” Manning said.</p> &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/15/arch-manning-nephew-of-eli-and-peyton-scores-five-t">https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/15/arch-manning-nephew-of-eli-and-peyton-scores-five-t</a></pre></div></body></html>
