Toasty and warm. On the table, a tray of choux buns, small, crisp and walnut brown. I have already eaten three and I really shouldn’t, because guests are coming to tea. The buns are more crisp than usual, baked at a high heat to give them a shell that contrasts with the softly whipped clouds of lemon curd cream inside. There’s passion fruit in the filling, too, because it is gorgeous with anything citrus.</p><p>You could make neat little buns if you have a piping bag in the kitchen. I prefer them to be less uniform. I made my first batch of choux buns at cookery school in Paris and was given the absurdly difficult task of piping them full of strawberry sorbet. Glorious to eat if you were quick – and we were – but imagine the mess. So now I stick to cream and the occasional flavouring.</p> &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/sep/15/nigel-slaters-r">https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/sep/15/nigel-slaters-r</a></pre></div></body></html>
