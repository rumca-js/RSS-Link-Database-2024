(unraid vs proxmox RAID10)</h1></a><div>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss</div><div>2024-09-15 08:55:53+00:00</div><div><pre><!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Guys it's 4:52am,<br/> I am going through some growing pains at the moment as I was hitting the storage ceiling on my existing NAS box, for background that's a 21TB RAID6 (8*4TB) QNAP TS-869U-RP. This was actually a 7*4TB array with a hot-spare, but I brought the last drive online to extend the array. In addition, I'm actually running an old buffalo tera station that's a 4x4TB RAID 0, just to house disposable data like downloads before they are processed.</p> <p>I bought a 12 bay LFF PowerEdge server to replace these two seperate NAS boxes and the 1u Ryzen 1400 box I'm using for my compute/server tasks. In the poweredge I've got 12 x 8TB 10k SAS drives and 2 x 1TB 2.5in drives on the H730p mini. All mechanical drives. The plan, as it started, was to offload all the data on my existing NAS boxes to the poweredge, with a RAID10 array yielding 48TB of usable storage in the main pool, then throw proxmox on a separate RAID1 array on</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
