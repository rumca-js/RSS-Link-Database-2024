My wife gifted me some Sternguard for my current project (Knights of Blood) and I'm wondering how to pick what helmet color for them since I've never painted them before? Is it required for them to change their helmet color?</p> <p>I know for the Ultramarines it's white, and Blood Angels it's gold, but unsure what I would go with for the KoB. Would I just go gold since they're a BA Successor, or am I still okay to keep their helmet red like their normal Marines?</p> <p>Thank you in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DustierSaturn"> /u/DustierSaturn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1fh6g7i/how_to_pick_sternguard_helmet_color/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1fh6g7i/how_to_pick_sternguard_helmet_color/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
