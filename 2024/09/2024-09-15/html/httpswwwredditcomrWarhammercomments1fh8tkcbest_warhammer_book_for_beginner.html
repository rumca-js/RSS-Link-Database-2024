Well technically listen because I personally have a hard time reading a normal book that isn't a graphic novel. So I am getting the audiobooks, I would love to know some recommendations. I am not 100% new I do know some stuff from lore videos but still I would like something that I don't need vast knowledge on the lore to understand. One that did peak my interest was "The fall of Cadia" should I start with that one? If not any that I should start with. I also really like Yarrick and the salamanders so any with them I would love to listen too as well but If they aren't in the ones i should start with that's fine :).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Organic_Ad_1324"> /u/Organic_Ad_1324 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1fh8tkc/best_warhammer_book_for_beginner/">[link]&lt;</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
