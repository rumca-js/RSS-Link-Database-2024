The curse of continuous 2nd place against GG is finally over! From incredibly death defying plays from Boxi - having 5% hp or less to Nisha's immortal Puck to 33's crazy Visage and his insane impact. HUGE congratulations to <strong>Team Liquid</strong> and shoutout to qojqva and Blitz &lt;3 !&lt;</p> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WisdomDota"> /u/WisdomDota </a>   to   &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.red">https://www.red</a></pre></div></body></html>
