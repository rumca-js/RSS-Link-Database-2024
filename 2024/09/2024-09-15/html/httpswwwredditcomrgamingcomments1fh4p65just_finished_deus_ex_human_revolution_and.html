I played these right after finishing my 4th run in Cyberpunk (with PL), and I went in expecting a palette cleanser of a similar-if-dated couple of games but goddamn they were <em>amazing</em>. Scratched every "explore ALL the ways to approach a mission, go stealth or kill everything that moves, find all the hidden areas, all the different ways to solve a problem, and get totally immersed in the story along the way" itch I have. </p> <p>93 hours in Human Revolution, and 120 hours (inlcuding DLC) in Mankind Divided. Pretty mind-blowing level of immersion and content (granted I'm the "explore every damn alley and air shaft" type of player). I only maxed 60ish hours in each of the Mass Effect games, and topped 160 in Cyberpunk with Phantom Liberty which is massive in scale compared to Deus Ex. So glad I got to experience them, and so damn sad we probably won't have any more in the near future.</p> </div>&lt;!-- S</pre></div></body></html>
