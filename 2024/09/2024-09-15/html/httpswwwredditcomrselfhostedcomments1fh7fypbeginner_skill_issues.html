I am a Arch linux and i3-wm user for about a 3 years (it is relevant), but I have never worked with any NAS system. I don't know how to connect to it and how to mount it in my system. I am really bad with drives and mounting them. I have tried some ways, but it never worked... I tried nfs connection even smb and I cannot still access the server or find a way to login.<br/> How do you do that if there is someone that is in simullar situation?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gun3kter_cz"> /u/gun3kter_cz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fh7fyp/beginner_skill_issues/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fh7fyp/beginner_skill_issues/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
