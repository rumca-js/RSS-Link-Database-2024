That role that you're always excited about getting? It doesn't matter if it's an "innocent/good team" role or an "impostor/bad team" role.</p> <p>Mine would be the lovers/siblings archetype. That role that gives you special info about only one person so that you both know you can always trust each other. </p> <p>Also any role who's special ability activates when the player gets eliminated, that sweet last breath resource sure makes it to my top 2. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aurahdz"> /u/Aurahdz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fh0oz8/favorite_archetype_in_social_deduction/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fh0oz8/favorite_archetype_in_social_deduction/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
