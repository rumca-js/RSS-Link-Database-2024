I have the option to purchase a local language (Japanese) version of Kemet: Blood and Sand here in Japan at a very reasonable price.</p> <p>It looks as though BGG has the game as "No necessary in game text", but in the details screen 54% of people claimed that, while others said "some in game text."</p> <p>If I have the English manual PDF, will that give me everything I need to know OR would I (and other players who may not read Japanese well) need to be able to read card text or other component text in-game in Japanese? Are there parts of the game that require reading tiles on the in- game components? (E.g. player aids, cards with important text etc.)</p> <p>Most of the images I found look like the cards and components all rely on iconography rather than text.</p> <p>Thank you in advance to anyone who has a copy of the game (in any language other than English) who can provide info!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by &amp;</pre></div></body></html>
