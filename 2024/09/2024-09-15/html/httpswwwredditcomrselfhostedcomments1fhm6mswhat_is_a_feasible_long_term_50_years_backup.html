I think this kind of fits the selfhosted spirit, hopefully I can find people that have the same problem in here.</p> <p>Currently my backup strategy relies heavily on CMR 8TB HDDs in a RAID, because those seem to be the only ones reliable long enough to have at least some form of guaranteed data retention rate.</p> <p>Now I wanted to go with an additional optical backup redundancy, and the only thing available to me in Europe is the M-Disc format. Archival Discs (Panasonic japan) doesn't seem to be sold to outside markets, and prices are ridiculously high (~3500EUR for a burner/writing device).</p> <p>My software stack heavily relies on Linux. Arch for development machines, Debian for servers, and probably the backup machine, too.</p> <p>The idea for long-term preservation is to also have a copy of the source codes of the software necessary to restore embedded together with the M-Dis</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
