I'm new to web scraping, but my experience with rate limits has been that a webpage will often outright say when I've hit the limit, and sometimes even says exactly what that limit is (or it's in the Network tab). </p> <p>I can usually only run my script once or twice before it lands on a screen like the screenshot attached, which leads to a timeout even if I'm really generous with my waiting times. Am I correct in assuming this is Yahoo's way of rate limiting? Is this unusual? In general, what steps should I be taking in this situation where I need to work</p></div></td></tr></table></pre></div></body></html>
