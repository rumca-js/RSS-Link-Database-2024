In that case, how do I make the setUp function work with that? I always seem to get errors.</p> <p>Also, how do I make ConsumerClass.scope work during a test? It seems like it doesn't contain anything but I still need to access it all across my consumer.</p> <p>So what is everything I need to know to test an AsyncWebsocketConsumers with a class inheriting from TestCase? If you have any piece of information you think could be helpful, please tell it to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Affectionate-Ad-7865"> /u/Affectionate-Ad-7865 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1fhn7pu/what_is_everything_i_need_to_know_for_testing/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1fhn7p</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1fhn7p</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
