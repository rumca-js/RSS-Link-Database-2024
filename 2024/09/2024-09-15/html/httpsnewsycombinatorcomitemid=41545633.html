<p>I recently read The Mom Test, and I learned something critical: before investing in your idea, talk to potential customers to see if anyone wants it or not.<p>While this might seem obvious, it wasn’t to me. The first time I started something in my 20s, I was so enamored with the idea and its potential that I didn’t validate it!<p>So, The Mom Test is obviously crucial reading.<p>There are so many other books and resources out there. Which of them would you consider crucial? Which contain crucial lessons?</p>
