This technique significantly enhances energy storage performance without altering the MOFâ€™s crystal structure. By adjusting laser power, scientists increased the electrode's surface area and ion accessibility, offering a quicker, safer, and eco-friendly alternative to traditional defect-creation methods. This innovation, published in ACS Materials Letter, may lead to advancements in energy storage technologies.</pre></div></body></html>
