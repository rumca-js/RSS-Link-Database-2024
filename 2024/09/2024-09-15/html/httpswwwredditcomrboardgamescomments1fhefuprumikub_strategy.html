A couple of weeks ago, he held on to most of his tiles, then played them all at once. It pissed me off and I told him that isn't fair and gave him a bit of shit about it.<br/> Since then he hasn't been doing it, until last night. I could tell he was holding back and he kept denying it. He'd play a tile or 2 onto played tiles, but didn't start any groupings. I'd call him on it and he insisted that he just didn't have tiles to play. He finally went out after playing 18 tiles. I got pissed off and started gathering my things to head back to my home. We discussed that this was just a bump in the road and are fine this morning.<br/> I'm wondering if this is a legitimately way to play the game and I'm being the jerk. Your thoughts, please?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ThatTravel5692"> /u/ThatTravel5692 </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a hre</span></pre></div></body></html>
