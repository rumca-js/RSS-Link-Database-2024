<p>I am sorry to announce that long-time HN contributor DanBC died last month after a prolonged period of ill health. May his legacy continue to inspire, and his contributions to this place and the wider world be remembered. Rest in peace, Dan.<p><a href="https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/media/53jhyy44/neurodiversity-in-gloucestershire-summer-2024.pdf<p>"Sadly">https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/media/53jhyy44/neurodiversity-in-gloucestershire-summer-2024.pdf<p>"Sadly</a> Dan Beale Cocks, the wonderful Co-Chair of the Mental Health and Wellbeing Partnership Board died on 21 August 2024 after a long illness. Dan made a fantastic contribution to improving mental health and
coproduction in Gloucestershire for many years and he will be greatly missed.<p>Before Dan died, we asked if we could plan an annual Dan Beale Cocks Celebration of Best Practice in
Coproduction and he was delighted with the idea. It is intended to take this forward in collaboration with
the other Partnership Boards."<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=DanBC<p>https://medium.com/@dan.bealecocks<p>https://twitter.com/DanBealeCocks<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>">https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=DanBC<p>https://medium.com/@dan.bealecocks<p>https://twitter.com/DanBealeCocks<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></a></pre></div></body></html>
