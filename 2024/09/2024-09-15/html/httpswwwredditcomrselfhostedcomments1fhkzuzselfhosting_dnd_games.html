I've been poking around for a solution to this problem I've been having for a while and I think this is the community I need to ask questions of to put me on the right track. My DnD group records our sessions (online play; I screen record in OBS) for personal use only. We are not interested in streaming/publicizing our games, we just like having them for posterity and memories. Currently, I record 3 different games that have been running for at least 4 years with each video being ~2 hours long (4 hour sessions with a break in the middle). They're generally anywhere between 1.5GB and 2.5GB for each file. I used to upload all of these into my personal Google Drive account to share with the rest of the group (between each of the games, about 12 people have access to these videos) but paying for Google Storage is getting less and less defensible to me as the tech landscape evolves, and also Google Drive's video playback feature </p></div></pre></div></body></html>
