I recently had a baby and with it comes adjustments. We had to get rid of the table that we play games on(it turned into a baby station) so now game nights are moving onto the dining room table. This is fine for most of the time; me and the wife set up the game, play, store. We’ve been playing shorter games because baby. But she’s learned how to sleep the whole night and we want to get back into our campaign games. Here’s the rub: we need to put the games up so we can use the table during the day. Has anyone found something that they can play on, and then it packs up keeping the game relatively ready to play. Setting up and packing away campaign games would eat up half of the time we have to play. I’ve tried getting my wife into TTS, but she doesn’t like it. Anybody have any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/therobotisjame">https://www.reddit.com/user/therobotisjame</a></pre></div></body></html>
