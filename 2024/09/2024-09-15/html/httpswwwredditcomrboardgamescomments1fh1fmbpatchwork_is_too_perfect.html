Every game still provides new discoveries and layers of depth. The balancing act of filling out your board and button economy is endlessly compelling.</p> <p>Now, I own the original edition, but online i much prefer the look of 10th anniversary edition. I am planning on buying it as well as soon as I can. Hopefully I can keep it unopened for a good while, playing the original to get maximum value out of it. </p> <p>Patchwork works. Every turn is meanigful, mentally stimulating, and actually slotting the perfect piece onto your board is so satisfying. Sometimes I even forget all about my opponent, just enjoying the beauty of the design. Bravo, Uwe.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheAmazingSlowman"> /u/TheAmazingSlowm</a></pre></div></body></html>
