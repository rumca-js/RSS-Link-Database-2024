Probably too much thinking and not enough doing, so I'm asking for your opinions.</p> <p>I'm looking for something to backup my and my gf's photos/videos from our android phones, have them accessible remotely, and sync separate folders from our computers to the phones.</p> <p>Also looking at the possibility of client encryption so the admin(myself) cant access user files.</p> <p>Thus with all the above, I've currently got nextcloud running. Its been fine, other than a bit slow, and the android app has had some problems syncing large (10GB, 150 folders) nested folders where I had to go to each folder and tell it to sync, and that still de-sync sometimes.</p> <p>I tried seafile, love the idea of the fast DB backend (and I would do a file-based backup to a client) but immediately didn't like the android app - its quite primitive and wouldn't run a sync on command, or automatically after a day</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
