I decided to take a peak with <code>tracert</code> on some IPs of servers I connect to and found that it takes horrible pathing. For example, I am in southern California, but connecting to servers in Denver will route through Chicago first. What I discovered is that if I turn on my VPN (ProtonVPN in this case), it takes a near direct route, which cuts my ping in half.</p> <p>What I want to do: I'm considering setting up a dedicated VPS that I can use as a VPN, probably using WireGuard, to take advantage of their routing. I know that many large VPS providers have agreements to provide near direct routing to eachother. </p> <p>Is this the best way to do this? I'd appreciate others thoughts on this</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Astronaut-Remote"> /u/Astronaut-Remote </a> <br/> <span>&lt;</span></pre></div></body></html>
