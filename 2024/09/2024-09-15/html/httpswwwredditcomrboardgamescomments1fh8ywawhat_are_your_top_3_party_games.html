So, generally party games are what we go for, but I'm getting bored of playing the same ones over and over again. I tend to lean towards word association and social deduction games, such as:<br/> - Just One - Taboo - You Can't Say Umm - Spyfall (the online version) - Telestrations - Fake Artist Goes to New York - Tapple - Cluedo - Anomia - 5 Second Rule </p> <p>Do you have suggestions for similar (or other types of) party games not currently on the list? What are your top 3? I'd love to discover and add some new games to the list. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/reigndrops17"> /u/reigndrops17 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fh8ywa/what_are_your_top_3_party_games/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href</span></pre></div></body></html>
