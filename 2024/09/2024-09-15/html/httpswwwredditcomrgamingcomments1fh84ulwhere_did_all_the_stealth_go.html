Most of the "stealth" in modern games is exceptionally boring (Spiderman 2) or lacking in depth (Ghost of Tsushima). 10 years ago we had the Arkham games, prime Assassin's Creed, Dishonored, Splinter Cell, Metal Gear but now the well runs dry. These games sold well! They were amazing games and had very good stealth. What happened?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mr_P3"> /u/Mr_P3 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fh84ul/where_did_all_the_stealth_go/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fh84ul/where_did_all_the_stealth_go/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
