The charges cover four areas: a failure to give “a true and fair view of the club’s financial position”; a failure to “include full details” of player and manager remuneration; breaches of national and continental financial fair play regulations; and a failure to “cooperate with, and assist, the Premier League in its investigations”. The counts will be heard by a three-person independent commission, starting on Monday, in what is thought to be a London location.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-manchester-citys-hearing-and-charges">Conti</a></pre></div></body></html>
