I recently dove back into it, and honestly, it’s still one of the most unique puzzle experiences I’ve ever had. </p> <p>The way it messes with your perception of space and logic is genius, and it’s such a refreshing break from the usual game formula. I’m surprised more people don’t talk about it. Did anyone else play this back in the day, or has Antichamber been flying under the radar for most gamers?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alarmed_Feet336"> /u/Alarmed_Feet336 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fhbuwp/i_just_replayed_antichamber_after_years_and_its/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fhbuwp/i_just_replayed_antichamber_after_years_and_its/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
