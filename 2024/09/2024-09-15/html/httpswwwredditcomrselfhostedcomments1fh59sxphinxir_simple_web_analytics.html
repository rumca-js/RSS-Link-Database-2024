I was running an app that had ~350k pageviews at the time but was only making $80 from ads so paying $50 a month for analytics sounded silly. The actual cost of running this is only a fraction of that, so I built my own tool to use!</p> <p>I made Phinxer open source! It's built with an Express backend, React app, Postgres for general data and ClickHouse for events. I used <a href="https://vike.dev/">Vike</a> which is based in Vite for this project and was very pleasantly surprised, it's what I always wished Next.js was!</p> <p>Code here: <a href="https://github.com/gnardini/analytics">https://github.com/gnardini/analytics</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pplcs"> /u/pplcs </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
