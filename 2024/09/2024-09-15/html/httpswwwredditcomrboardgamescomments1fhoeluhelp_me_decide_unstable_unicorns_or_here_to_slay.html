I'm trying to choose between two games, and they're both the same price, so I can't decide!</p> <p>The options are:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Unstable Unicorns</strong> with expansions: <em>Legends, NSFW, Dragons</em>, and <em>Rainbow Apocalypse</em>.</li> <li><strong>Here to Slay</strong> with expansions: <em>Warriors &amp; Druids</em> and <em>Berserkers &amp; Necromancers</em>.</li> </ol> <p>I love fun, strategic card games, and both of these seem right up my alley. For those who have played either (or both!), which one would you recommend and why? How do they compare in terms of gameplay, replayability, and overall fun?</p> <p>Also, if something sounds strange, I used AI to translate this because I speak Spanish, and my English isnâ€™t great. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submi</pre></div></body></html>
