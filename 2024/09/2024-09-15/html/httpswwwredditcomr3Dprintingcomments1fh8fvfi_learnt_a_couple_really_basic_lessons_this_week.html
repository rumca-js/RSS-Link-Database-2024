I went through the manual doing all the maintenance I could find, lubricating axes, cleaning the nozzle, only to find some helpful reddit posts all saying "have you tried washing your plate?". Shock surprise, it worked.</p> <p>2 - Let cool before removing supports.<br/> Feel really dumb about this one lol. I'd take them off while warm thinking "it's most malleable when it's still warm" but actually letting it cool and become brittle makes for a way better (and more satisfying) removal experience.</p> <p>Don't be dumb like me, kids.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Certainlynotagoose"> /u/Certainlynotagoose </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1fh8fvf/i_learnt_a_couple_really_basic_lessons_this_week/">[link]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
