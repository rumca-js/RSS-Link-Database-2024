It tracks your device's location history and allows you to review your past trips. I use it all the time to geotag the photos from my mirrorless camera and to search for locations from my past trips.</p> <p>It worked great, but it has recently been Googled to almost complete uselessness.</p> <p>I'd like something that can just run on my phone (Android) in the background and then upload GPS tracks to my server every day. I don't need anything advanced from it, just simple tracking and uploading.</p> <p>My main requirement is reliability, I want it to just sit there and work with minimum amount of fuss.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CyberaxIzh"> /u/CyberaxIzh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fhpj6s/google_location_history_alternative/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="https:</span></pre></div></body></html>
