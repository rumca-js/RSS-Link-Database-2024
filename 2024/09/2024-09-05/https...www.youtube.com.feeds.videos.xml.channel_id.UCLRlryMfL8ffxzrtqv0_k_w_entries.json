The city of New Rome must change, which leads to conflicts between the brilliant artist Cesar Catilina (Adam Driver) and his adversary, the mayor Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito). While one dares to take the leap into a utopian, idealistic future, the other clings to a backward-looking status quo characterized by greed, vested interests and partisan warfare. Between them stands Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel) , the mayor's daughter, whose love for Caesar has divided her loyalties and forces her to find out what she believes humanity really deserves.\n\nMegalopolis rent/buy \u27a4 https://amzo.in/movie/00h/megalopolis-2024\nMost popular movies right now \u27a4 https://amzo.in/bestsellermovies\nMost wanted movies of al", "id": 1087934, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAw9iAUmz8E", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCLRlryMfL8ffxzrtqv0_k_w", "source_obj__id": 173, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/LAw9iAUmz8E/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "MEGALOPOLIS Final Trailer (2024) Aubrey Plaza, Adam Driver", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-05T12:36:19+00:00", "description": "Official Arcane Series Trailer 2024 | Subscribe \u27a4 https://abo.yt/ki | Hailee Steinfeld Series Trailer | Netflix: 2024 | More https://KinoCheck.com/show/wli/arcane-2021?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=description\nAmid the stark discord of twin cities Piltover and Zaun, two sisters fight on rival sides of a war between magic technologies and clashing convictions.\n\nArcane rent/buy \u27a4 https://amzo.in/show/wli/arcane-2021\nMost popular movies right now \u27a4 https://amzo.in/bestsellermovies\nMost wanted movies of all time \u27a4 https://amzo.in/wishlistmovies\n\nArcane (2024) is the new animation series starring Hailee Steinfeld, Ella Purnell and Kevin Alejandro.\n\nNote | #Arcane #Trailer courtesy of Netflix International B.V.. | All Rights Reserved. | https://amzo.in are affiliate-links.
