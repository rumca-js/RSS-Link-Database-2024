Among the many questions observers had following this week's shock shutdown of PlayStation 5v5 shooter Concord (albeit not necessarily at the top of their list) was if the now-defunct live-service title would still make an appearance in Amazon's upcoming animated video game anthology series Secret Level - and the answer, according to a new report at least, is yes.
</p><p>
Secret Level, if you haven't been following along, is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">15-episode series from the creators of Love, Death &amp; Robots</a> that'll feature original stories set in the world of games. More specifically, it'll include episodes centred on Armored Core, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, PAC-

A recently leaked image purportedly showing Sony's heavily discussed but still officially under-wraps PlayStation 5 Pro appears to have received corroboration from an unexpected source. A near-identical design has now been spotted in the background of Sony's newly unveiled official PlayStation 30th anniversary artwork.
</p><p>
Last week, prolific leaker bilbil-kun <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-design-reportedly-leaks">shared details of Sony's still unannounced PS5 Pro</a>, alongside an illustration of its outer shell. While it mostly retained the PS5's familiar open-shirt design, it included one notable change: in place of the single diagonal stripe found on the body of the PlayStation Slim, the leaked PS5 Pro design featured three diagonal ridged lines.

Keep that in mind as we now hurtle forward in time to the presen

This December marks 30 years since the Japanese launch of the original PlayStation, and Sony has now <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/05/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-my-first-gt-digital-soundtracks-shapes-of-play-collection-and-theres-more-to-come/">revealed</a> how it plans to celebrate the brand's big three-oh - with the likes of digital soundtracks, PlayStation-themed toys, and more on the way.
</p><p>
Sony's celebrations begin later this month, with a free online multiplayer event and esports tournament running from 21st-22nd September. For the duration, it'll be possible to play online multiplayer in any PS4 or PS5 game without having a PlayStation Plus subscription.

Way back in March, Ubisoft's shared its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-roadmap-includes-boss-rush-permadeath-story-dlc">post-launch roadmap</a> for the excellent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, and six months later we're almost at its end. Its final content drop - the paid Mask of Darkness story DLC - launches on 17th September, and Ubisoft's has now <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/gruqIEXvoTx23RRPtHBLJ">revealed</a> at least some of what players can expect to see when it arrives.

Mask of Darkness introduces a "sizeable" new biome known as Radjen's Mind Palace, promising "fresh traversal elements, traps, enemies, and more". It'll unlock once players have escaped the Depth

As of earlier this week, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> is officially, and slightly alarmingly, ten years old. And coinciding with that impressive milestone, EA has unveiled the life sim's latest seasonal roadmap, which includes a life-and-death-themed new expansion arriving this Halloween.
</p><p>
EA's roadmap is admittedly pretty light on specifics right now, with more to be share as each release nears, but we do know The Sims 4's latest content season - collectively presented under the name To Be Continued - kicks off on 19th September with two new Kit packs.

PlayStation 5 launched four years ago, shipped with a pack-in game known as Astro's Playroom - a brilliant platform game full of heart and creativity that captured the imagination of new PS5 owners. Many of us dreamt of a full-blown sequel that could expand these ideas into a larger adventure and that dream has finally been fulfilled with Astro Bot. Let me say this up front - Astro Bot is so good, it single handedly reminded me why I enjoy video games in the first place. This is a game that celebrates the entire history of video games and one of the few 3D platform games I've played that truly goes toe to toe with the best Nintendo has to offer. It's that good, putting Team Asobi up there with the greats.

Astro Bot is an explosion of colour and creativity that constantly flips your expectations on its head. When it hits, you'll feel the urge to

## Phantom Blade Zero is speedy, stylish, and absolutely not a Soulslike

It's a bit of a running joke now, really. Everytime a new action game is revealed, it's instantly compared back to FromSoftware's work with the question: "yeah, it looks great, but is it a Soulslike?" It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-is-a-brilliant-boss-rush-but-is-it-a-soulslike">happened with Black Myth: Wukong</a>. And it's happened again with Phantom Blade Zero, so much so the developer had to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-has-dark-souls-inspired-non-linear-map-but-developer-still-insists-its-not-a-soulslike">release a statement refuting the game is a Soulslike</a>. In an interview, it even admitted that, as a new studio, it doesn't "have the privilege of FromSoftware to make you frustrated while you're playing".

That's not to say there isn't an influence, of course. Developer S-G

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Astro-Bot-Announce-Screenshot-19.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Fans of bits and pieces are going to absolutely love Astro Bot. It's made of bits and pieces. Lots of these bits and pieces are nostalgia: you pick between old memory cards when choosing a save file, you're rewarded at the end of a boss fight with a spell of Ape Escape monkey-netting fun. Look close at most surfaces and you'll see some variation of the DualShock face buttons imprinted on it. Look in the sky and you might catch a passing reference to Fantavision.</p><p>All great. But what I really love about Astro Bot is that it's also just filled with <em>bits and pieces</em>. Stuff to roll around in, stuff that forms little piles that can be kicked about. I'll punch a tree and end up showered in falling fruit. I'll open a chest and there will be lumps of gold rolling around at the bottom. In one completely dazzling level I was given a mag
