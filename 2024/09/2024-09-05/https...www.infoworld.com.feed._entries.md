<p>Vue 3.5, an update to the popular “progressive” <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3441178/what-is-javascript-the-full-stack-programming-language.html">JavaScript</a> framework, emphasizes improvements to the platform’s reactivity system, for better performance and improved memory usage.</p>



<p>Vue 3.5, described as a minor release with no breaking changes, was announced <a href="https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-5#reactivity-system-optimizations">September 1</a>. However, the release includes a major refactor of the reactivity system that boosts performance and significantly improves memory usage (-56%) with no behavior changes, Vue creator Evan You wrote in a <a href="https://blog.

<p>Microsoft’s much-delayed <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2337328/copilot-runtime-building-ai-into-windows.html">Windows Copilot Runtime</a> is a step closer with the release of <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2024/08/29/directml-expands-npu-support-to-copilot-pcs-and-webnn/">a developer preview of the Arm build of its DirectML AI tool</a>. It’s still not production-ready, but it’s now possible to start experimenting with local AI applications using the Copilot+ PC’s Qualcomm Hexagon neural processing units (NPUs).</p>



<p>Bringing AI to the edge requires accelerator hardware, and the Arm-based Copilot+ PCs promised developer access to their built-in 45 TOPs AI ac

			<p>In a previous <strong>Java 101</strong> tutorial, you learned <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2162629/core-java-classes-within-classes.html">how to better organize your code</a> by declaring reference types (also known as classes and interfaces) as members of other reference types and blocks. I also showed you how to use nesting to avoid name conflicts between nested reference types and top-level reference types that share the same name.</p>
			
<p>Along with nesting, Java uses packages to resolve same-name issues in top-level reference types. Using static imports also simplifies access to the static members in packaged top-level reference types. Static imports will save yo

<p>In the spring of 2020, it really mattered to me what the definition of “software supply chain security” ought to be. I was working at <a href="https://b348659d.streaklinks.com/CF3f2COoqEETQQBWNgDoLUhf/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iqt.org%2F">In-Q-Tel</a>, a strategic investor for the US intelligence community, and co-authoring a research paper that attempted to measure the frequency of software supply chain attacks. We picked a definition that emphasized instances of malicious software being widely distributed through an existing distribution channel. Almost as soon as the paper was published though, the definition broke down, repeatedly.</p>



<p>Now, writing in the summer of 2024, several major software

<p>It’s well documented that software development efforts that incorporate <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a> include mistakes that are radically different than what any human programmer would ever make. And yet, most enterprise plans for remediating AI coding mistakes rely on simply inserting experienced human programmers in the loop. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kS-vk9mPR8">Cue train wreck</a>.
