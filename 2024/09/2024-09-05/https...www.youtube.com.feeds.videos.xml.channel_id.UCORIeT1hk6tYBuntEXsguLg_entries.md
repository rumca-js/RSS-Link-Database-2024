For the past seven years, Sunny Holiday has worked beyond the scenes as a creative with PMJ, contributing all things visual on our videos and tours — everything from wardrobe to choreography to overall stage direction, set design, and even cover art. If you've ever watched a PMJ video and thought, "Wow! That looks amazing!" -- that's Sunny's doing. She is truly an “old soul” — and she also happens to be a truly fantastic vocalist! Here she is taking center stage on our version of the beautiful 1937 Rodgers & Hart classic recorded by Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra and many others, “Where or When.”
