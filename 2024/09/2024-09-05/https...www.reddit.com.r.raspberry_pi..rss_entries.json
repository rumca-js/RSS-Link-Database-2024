So recently, I have been developing a Rubik&#39;s solving machine throughout the year. But the one thing that has set me back quite a bit is to get the motors turning to the desired location.

It turns out that it hasn&#39;t been very easy xD (but fun nonetheless). I would like some help getting them to work as desired, if possible.
