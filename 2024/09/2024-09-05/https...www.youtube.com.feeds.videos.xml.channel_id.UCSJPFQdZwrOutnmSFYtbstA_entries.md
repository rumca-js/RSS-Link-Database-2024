If you've missed Guyladriel girlbossing her way through enemy armies, then wait no longer because Rings of Power episode 4 has you covered. Also, we laugh as Concord, Sony's $100 Million flagship game crashes and burns in barely a week. And Terminator Zero turned out to be surprisingly good. Join me, MauLer, Space Ice, Nerdrotic, Grummz and Echo Chamberlain as we discuss it all.
