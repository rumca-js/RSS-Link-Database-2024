<p>An AI usage treaty, negotiated by representatives of 57 countries, was unveiled Thursday, but its language is so overarching that it’s unclear if enterprise CIOs will need to do anything differently to comply.</p>



<p>This mostly European effort adds to <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3484326/genai-compliance-is-an-oxymoron-ways-to-make-the-best-of-it.html">a lengthy list of AI global compliance efforts</a> on top of many new legal attempts <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/05/california-gov-gavin-newsoms-desk-is-overflowing-with-ai-bills/">to govern AI in the United States</a>. The initial signatories were Andorra, Georgia, Iceland, Norway, the Republic o

<p>Apple is reportedly developing a new AI digital assistant expected to be integrated into its upcoming robotic devices. Based on generative AI (genAI) and more advanced than Siri, the new assistant will have a “human-like” AI “personality.”</p>



<p>The new assistant could replace Siri on HomePod, iPhones, iPads, or Macs and, most likely and intriguingly, on a new robotic desktop screen that follows and faces you while interacting or while you’re using it for a FaceTime call, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-14/apple-pushes-ahead-with-tabletop-robot-in-search-of-new-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman</a>.

<p>One of the ongoing issues in enterprise IT is the gap between perception and reality. But when it comes to generative AI (genAI), vendors are about to discover that there is a big price to pay for overpromising. </p>



<p>Not only are corporate execs dealing with disappointment and a lack of meaningful ROI, but the same senior non-tech leaders (think CFOs, CEOs, COOs, and some board members) who pushed for the technology before it was ready are the ones who will quickly resist deployment efforts down the road. The irony is that those later rollouts will more likely deliver on long-promised benefits. A little “AI-sales-rep-who-cried-wolf” goes a long way.</p>
