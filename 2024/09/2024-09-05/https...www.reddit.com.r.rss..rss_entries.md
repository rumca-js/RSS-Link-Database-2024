You can try it out here: <a href="https://lighthouseapp.io/tools/feed-finder">https://lighthouseapp.io/tools/feed-finder</a></p> <p>Granted, in &gt;90% of cases the standard way of checking meta tags is enough to find the feeds. But my goal for this tool is that it finds feeds regardless if they&#39;re linked somewhere or not. So if this feed finder doesn&#39;t find a feed, no feed exists.</p> <p>It&#39;s a big goal and admittedly not there yet, but it does a few things that are a step in that direction.</p> <ul> <li>Checks meta tags of parent pages (sometimes the article itself doesn&#39;t have the meta tag, but the main blog page does)</li> <li>Checks common suffixes like <code>/rss</code>, <code>/index.xml</code> and many others (sometimes the feed exists but isn&#39;t linked)</li> <li>Checks the sitemap</li> <li>Checks all links on the page</li> <li>Checks 3rd party feeds (OpenRSS for now, w

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As a non-technical person, I managed to &quot;develop&quot; a pretty decent RSS aggregation tool generating html/javascript by prompting Claude. It generates Google News feeds from keyword input, allows addition of RSS feeds from URLs, combines all the resulting feed items and sorts by date.</p> <p>However, there are some issues:</p> <ul> <li>There are often fewer items in my feed than in the source RSS URL</li> <li>Comparing vs. the source URL, I often find newer items that don&#39;t appear in my feed for some time, even after reloading the browser.</li> <li>I often get errors fetching feeds...checking the console log, it seems to be a 429 error stemming from &quot;Too Many Requests&quot;</li> <li>Sometimes I set a timeframe operator to a Google feed (e.g. past 7 days), yet I still find items that are older than 7 days</li> </ul> <p>Looking into the code, there is the use of a 3rd party API and the provider&#39;s site mentions limits to free accounts
