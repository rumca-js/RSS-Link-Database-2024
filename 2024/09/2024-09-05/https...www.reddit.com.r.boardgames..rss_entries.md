<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just discovered [[Planet Unknown]] on BGA and I enjoy it as a solo puzzle.</p> <p>However, after a half dozen plays, it seems like the best strategy is to <span class="md-spoiler-text">simply take the smaller of the two polygon options. You always get to advance two tokens, so the more turns you get (<em>by playing smaller tiles</em>) gets you more advancement opportunities. Smaller tiles also seem to make meeting your secret objective so much easier.</span></p> <p>Did I ruin the game? Am I missing something?

## Need Help Identifying Card Based Game

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to remember the name of a card-based board game I played recently, which featured a bespoke deck of numbered cards (1 through to 12 or possibly 13) albeit no board in the traditional sense. It involved dealing the entire deck out evenly to everyone. The first person would place down a matching set of cards (e.g. three 10s) and the following person would then place the same quantity of a lower value (e.g. three 9s or three 4s), passing if they are unable to do. When no-one else can go, whoever played a card last then leads the next round and gets to choose how many cards that everyone has to play on the next round. All played cards are discarded and whoever runs out of cards first wins. I think the 13 numbered cards were possibly wildcards and could be played in addition to other cards to complete a set (e.g. two 3s and one 13 would be the same as three 3s).</p> <p>If anyone has any idea what this game is please, I&#39;d be very grateful

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really enjoying my first base set , but I generally dislike the randomness of dice rolling. Like, getting a 5 when rolling for max 20. I know some people like dice chucking, and sure, probably tends to even out odds, but I prefer feeling more control.</p> <p>This might be a silly question, as I can&#39;t seem to think of one, but are there viable alternatives? Like maybe using the median number for dice rolls (eg. assuming a 10 when rolling for max 20)? I&#39;ve looked around and most recommendations focus on replacing dice with another random number generation mechanic.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MoshpitBrain"> /u/MoshpitBrain </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1f9jjwk/pathfinder_acg_alternatives_to_dice/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1f9jjwk/pathfinder_acg_alternatives_to_dice/">[comments]</a>

Sure, you are battling other people for points as such, but everyone at the table is also embattled with themselves given how the end game condition is similar to Ark Nova; taking one set of points, and money, comparing and using the least. </p> <p>Then you add bonuses if they exist. Also, money is secret information in this game.</p> <p>I love it. There are literally 4 ronde&#39;s in this game, for some reason, but it all works. </p> <p>That is all without going into how damn amazing the theme shines through. Especially with some music in the background and all the deluxe bits. Shout out to the best metal coins in the industry. They put everything from Stonemaier to shame, and that is hard to do.</p> <p>I&#39;m rambling. Maybe, just try the game. And if you didn&#39;
