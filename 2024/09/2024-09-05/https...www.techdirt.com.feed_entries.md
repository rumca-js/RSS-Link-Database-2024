Company executives apparently thought it would be a good idea to use half-cooked automation to create fake journalists and lazy clickbait without telling [&#8230;]

Far too many states have decided to engage in censorship, urged on by an alarmingly large voting bloc that truly appears to be on the side of fascism, so long as that fascism appears to be on their side. Since this is, for the moment, still the United States of America, home of several enshrined [&#8230;]

Last November, Maine residents voted overwhelmingly (83 percent) to&#160;pass a new state right to repair law&#160;designed to make auto repairs easier and more affordable.
