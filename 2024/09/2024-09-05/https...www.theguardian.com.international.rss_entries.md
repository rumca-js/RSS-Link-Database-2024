She has a lot in her portfolio but, understandably, most of the questions were about the Grenfell Tower fire report out yesterday. Here are some of the main lines.</p><p><strong>Rayner said the report highlighted the “disgraceful” treatment of social tenants. </strong>She told the Today programme she wanted to see a “cultural shift to empowering people”. She went on:</p><p>I think the people of Grenfell were dismissed and not listened to and were not empowered as tenants.</p><p>And I think that we’ve got to make sure that greed and profit is not put above safety …</p><p><strong>She said she wanted to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service as “as quickly as possible” to bring people to justice over the fire, but she said it was an “incredibl

<p>In the third Paula Spencer novel, set during lockdown, mother and daughter are haunted by a history of violence, but revel in some late-life freedom</p><p>Roddy Doyle’s new novel, The&nbsp;Women Behind the Door, follows 1996’s The Woman who Walked into Doors and 2006’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/03/fiction.roddydoyle">Paula Spencer</a>, together narrating Paula’s life from adolescence to her 60s in north Dublin. Here, Paula speaks at last from a position of relative and hard-won security, living alone and holding on to recovery from alcoholism as she negotiates the lifelong effects of domestic violence, addiction and poverty on herself and her children and grandchildren.</p><p>Like its precursors, The Women Behind the Door is set at about the time of writing, playing with the challenges of contemporaneity, which for the past few years has meant writing about Covid, or at least, for writers as committed to realism as Doyle, not pretending that Covid didn’t h

<p>The Conservative leadership race reveals a party still banging the same old drums. Natural Tory voters are looking on askance</p><p>Two months on from the Tories’ worst election result in its history, none of its prospective leadership candidates inspire confidence in a fast bounce-back. Research by <a href="https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/media/r4hodhtk/conservative-leadership-election-focus-groups-media-briefing-2-sept-2024.pdf">More in Common</a> found that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/sep/02/voters-beginning-to-think-conservatives-are-weird-research-suggests">70% of the public</a> either didn’t know who could win the next election for the Tories, or thought none of them could. James Cleverly, second place in Wednesday’s vote among MPs, did best: 8% of respondents believed he could turn things round. Results are starkest for Mel Stride (still in the contest by the skin of his teeth): 1% of general voters and 1% of 2024 Conservative voters polled thi
