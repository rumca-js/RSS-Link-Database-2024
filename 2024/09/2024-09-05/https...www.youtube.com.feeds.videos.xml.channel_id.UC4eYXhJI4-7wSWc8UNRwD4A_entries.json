A heavy rain drenched the Aspen Ideas Festival campus two hours before we were scheduled to record with Alynda Segarra, a.k.a. Hurray for the Riff Raff. Thankfully, the sky dried out so Segarra, tourmate Johnny Wilson and our production team hiked up a grassy hill and down to this fragrant sage-filled meadow to record five stunning songs.\n\nThe setting was apt. Segarra\u2019s music can be sweet and tender, like the leaves that blur parts of our camera shots, but their personal stories told through song are as wide-screen as the Elk Mountains in the background. What\u2019s really impressive is how full this music sounds with only two guitars and the occasional harmonization from Wilson, who sings at just the right moments and complements Segarra\u2019s melodic lines with perfect intonation.\n\nOur Field Recording features stripped-down songs of love, loss and vulnerability from Hurray for the Riff Raff\u2019s ninth album, The Past Is Still Alive, one of our favorite", "id": 1086517, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r952qoBX1ng", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "source_obj__id": 225, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/r952qoBX1ng/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Hurray for the Riff Raff: Field Recordings x Aspen Ideas Festival", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
