The biggest difference this year is Treyarch's new movement system, which further adapts the fluidity and pace of the typical Black Ops multiplayer experience.\n\nOmnimovement allows you to sprint, slide, and dive in any direction. Whereas previous entries limited you to just forward dives and sliding, you can now go prone and spin around 360 degrees, making for epic moves that allow you to live out your own John Wick-style action-hero fantasy. Further improving the action is the new Intelligent Movement system. These are optional game settings, which are turned off by default, but I highly recommend everyone try these out.
