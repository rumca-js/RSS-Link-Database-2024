I am wondering if that means the EVEN CIA I lifted and replaced in the socket with the switcher and then back on top might have some connectivity issues (corrosion or pin issues). Going to take it apart again and check everything but be useful to know if that is what was being indicated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesyUK30"> /u/JamesyUK30 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1f9vain/amiga_a500_issue_black_screen_loading_games_off/">[link]</a

Ich probierte wirklich alles aus, sogar ein Redakteur von AmigaFuture war interessiert an meinen Fortschritten dort, da er es ebenfalls nie 100% durchspielen konnte und ehrlich gesagt vermute ich sogar, dass das Ende unspielbar ist, wegen eines Bugs.</p> <p>Vielen Dank fürs Durchlesen und bin neugierig, ob hier irgendjemand zumindest mal von diesem Spiel gehört hat?

I have removed them and the SCSI card and now am prompted with the system wanting a floppy. </p> <p>Further questions:<br/> I am curious what floppy do I need and how do I make one?<br/> Also if the floppy drive has issues can I use one from an old PC? If I have to regrease the floppy, is Lithium Greece still the best solution?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FuzzyOddball"> /u/FuzzyOddball </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1f9rmjl/help_getting_my_amiga_200_working/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1f9rmjl/help_getting_my_amiga_200_
