## Someone‚Äôs trying to kill cheap resin

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There was a thread sharing a petition to regulate resin manufacturers shared here a few days ago (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/s/GzujA5ozJ4">https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/s/GzujA5ozJ4</a>) It got pretty soundly downvoted, but the OP came back today and seemed pretty fanatical. It made me curious so I looked at their post history and it‚Äôs a pretty typical account hack. Nothing related to 3D printing previously, then nothing but for he last several days.</p> <p>User is <a href="/u/Parking-Hope5105">u/Parking-Hope5105</a>. Look at their post history. There‚Äôs definitely some shenanigans going on. Best guess I have is that it‚Äôs a large manufacturer trying to drive the cheaper options out of the market. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mortifine"> /u/Mortifine </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1f9ae52/someones_trying_to_kill_cheap_resin/">[link]
