Treyarch introduces more fluidity and freedom with the new omnimovement system in a game that still feels very much like Call of Duty: Black Ops.

Black Ops 6 definitely feels like a Black Ops game with its fast-paced action, arcade style, and vibrant maps. The biggest difference this year is Treyarch's new movement system, which further adapts the fluidity and pace of the typical Black Ops multiplayer experience.

Omnimovement allows you to sprint, slide, and dive in any direction.

I like most of those games and find the praise they receive in many cases to be well-earned, but Astro Bot is a reminder of another side to the PlayStation DNA. Not only does it feel like a revitalization of an important part of the brand, but it also feels like a spotlight shifting to a character who has been lurking in the background, previously unable to see over the hulking Kratos, the war-ready Aloy, or the tortured Joel. Team Asobi's Astro Bot quickly, consistently, and joyously launches its titular hero into the pantheon of all-time greats, both in its first-party family and genre, with a platformer whose incredible ambition is matched by its brilliant execution.
