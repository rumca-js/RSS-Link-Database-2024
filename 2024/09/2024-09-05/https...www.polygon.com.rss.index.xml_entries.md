<p class="has-text-align-none">A few months back, I was looking for a way to update my living room without replacing my TV entirely — something I’m hoping to do probably around Black Friday / Cyber Monday. What I found instead was Govee’s TV backlight set, which uses a small, mountable camera to read the colors on your TV and extend the lights past the screen itself. It’s an added bit of luxury ambience that I adore, and right now through Sept. 7, you can get a full <a href="https://howl.me/cm1yekH63lC">Govee Dreamview TV backlight and light bar kit</a> from Best Buy for just $89.99 (was $139.99). That’s less than I paid for my own setup, and I’ve been very happy with it.</p>
