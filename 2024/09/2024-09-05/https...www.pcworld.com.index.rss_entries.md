<p>Lenovo likes to show off concept devices at trade shows — earlier this year at MWC 2024, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2245163/this.html">it exhibited a laptop with a transparent display</a>. Fast forward to IFA 2024 in Berlin, and I’ve got my hands on Lenovo’s ‘AutoTwist’ laptop which can adjust the screen for you depending on what you’re doing. </p>



<p>This proof of concept is ‘AI-powered’ — what isn’t these days? — and sees Lenovo using artificial intelligence for something different to the countless image generators and ChatGPT clones that are out there. There’s a more luxurious feel to the AI here that’s more akin to getting optional extras on a new car that mean the trunk will close for you or even reverse parallel park without you having to touch the steering wheel. </p>

<p>Today at IFA in Berlin, Lenovo announced the newest iteration of its tried-and-tested ThinkPad X1 Carbon laptop. Not only does it sport the latest Lunar Lake processor from Intel, but it also boasts a bunch of interesting AI features, including posture alerts and attention timers.</p>



<p>In addition to the Carbon, Lenovo introduced an AutoTwist design that allows you to swivel the laptop display back and forth. It’s still in its proof-of-concept phase, so it won’t be available to purchase anytime soon.</p>

<p>Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon has proven its worth over the years, time and time again. Now in its 13th generation, Lenovo might just have made it into the most opulent AI-powered laptop money can buy. </p>
