Project 2025 - you've probably heard about it. It's a roadmap from the conservative Heritage Foundation for the next Republican president.It's also been a major talking point for Democrats on the campaign trail. Donald Trump, meanwhile, has tried to disavow it and distance himself. That's because the plan has attracted negative attention over the ultra conservative policies it endorses like overhauling and eliminating some government agencies, firing thousands of civil servants and a mass deportation campaign. Project 2025 was created to help the next Republican President execute an extreme conservative agenda. Now it's also become an attack line for Democrats.
