<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I created a Chrome Extension that would scrape A user&#39;s Indeed webpage and attempt to apply to jobs for them. Everything was working fine, however I noticed the website stopped allowing me to scrape and now when I navigate to <a href="http://Indeed.com">Indeed.com</a>, I can&#39;t right click or left click on anything on the page.</p> <p>I used an Incognito browser to check to see if I can navigate around, and looks like that works fine. So, they must have banned my account from doing anything on the page. </p> <p>I created this in hopes that other users could automate their job applications too, but it doesn&#39;t look like this is possible? Is there a workaround for this?</p> <p>Please note that I was scraping through the chrome extension and not using a Headless browser scraper library such as Puppeteer</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Berkoooooo"> /u/Berkoooooo </a> <br/> <span><a href="htt
