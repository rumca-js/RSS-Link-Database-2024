We got our first look at the Minecraft movie, and there’s a lot to parse out here for Minecraft fans. The opening shot of the trailer features some sort of portal, not quite sure what type of portal it is. Definitely different from a Nether or End Portal, unless the movie is reinterpreting the portals in another way. And then we see glimpses of Overworld! You see small towns, villages, mountains, a pink sheep, and the villainous Piglins! Everything looks like it was run through RTX, enhancing all the textures and fidelity. Take a look at the Piglins, because it seems as if they’ll be one of the main antagonists in the film, causing all kinds of havoc. Piglins are monstrous creatures who dwell in the Nether, which is an underworld filled with all sorts of monsters. They likely won’t bother you in-game if you have full gold armor. In fact, they’ll allow you to mine gold if you’re wearing it, and get that Gold Rush buff on. The Piglins seem to have chained up those Ghast creatures. Ghast

In Today’s Daily Fix:
Concord Players desperately grind for platinum trophies to secure a piece of gaming history before the game officially goes offline September 6th, 2024. Instead of playing the game as intended, they’ve adopted the unique method of tossing themselves off of platforms to gain experience in their trophy grind. Scalpers scramble to recoup their losses in the meantime, selling their copies of Concord as an “unplayable collector’s item.” Some sellers are going so far as to list their price three times higher than the original. Star Wars Outlaws and Xdefiant both tank Ubisoft’s shares to a near 10 year low after both suffered from poor performance. Ubisoft saw a 12.6% loss in share price after Star Wars Outlaws’ release on August 27th. In lighter news, No Man’s Sky has added fishing to its game in the new Aquarius Update, which was inspired by a community member’s fan art. This update arrives today, bringing new technology, recipes, a diving suit, and of course, fishing
