  <p id="ySuGlN">Eufy, the smart home product company under Anker, is launching new smart lights, including new permanent outdoor lights that can change color depending on who is walking up to your house. It works by communicating with Eufy’s video doorbells and security cameras and can be set to turn into, say, a welcoming soft white light for your family member.</p>

  <p id="c7ZZ4t"></p>
<p id="v0m48r">Philips Hue is finally getting into smart under-cabinet kitchen lighting. But as it's Hue, they are doing it in the most expensive way possible, and it will be at least a year before it comes to the US. Still, the new fully integrated smart lighting solution looks a pretty sweet solution if you hanker for full-color lighting to go with your avocado and toast — with no plugs or wires in sight. </p>
<p id="aHZiM1">This week at the IFA tech show in Berlin, Philips Hue’s parent company, Signify, announced a partnership with <a href="https://www.nobilia.de/en/company/">No

<p id="cQ6QdM">Smart home company Aqara has announced the Voice Mate H1 — a home automation voice control system activated by picking up a small puck rather than its microphone always listening for its wake word. The company is also launching its first outdoor camera, the Camera Hub G5 Pro, which, like its other cameras, will work with Apple’s HomeKit Secure Video. </p>
<p id="eTWcQJ">These products, along with a new garage door controller, smart valve shut-off device, and new smart switches (for Europe only), were announced at the IFA tech show this week. Aqara hasn’t pro

  <p id="KpvwvW">A coalition of consumer protection and anti-waste groups wants the Federal Trade Commission to go after “software tethering,” or the practice of tying hardware’s functionality to external software — which often renders products unusable after software updates stop.</p>
<p id="rtcsuK">The groups, including Consumer Reports, iFixIt, US PIRG, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Center for Economic Justice, and Californians Against Waste, have signed onto a letter asking the FTC to “create clear guidance” on software tethering. “While the FTC has taken some limited actions with regard to this issue, a lack of clarity and enforcement has led to an ec
