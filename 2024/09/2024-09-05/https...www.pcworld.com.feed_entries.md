<p>“The best charger is the one that shipped with your laptop” is old advice that needs updating because there are often superior options available either as your principal laptop charger, as a spare, or as a flexible travel charger.</p>



<p>You know that the charger that came with your laptop will work, but it won’t do much else and there are third-party USB-C chargers available that do much more.</p>



<p>Some laptops still ship with their own cumbersome AC power brick and barrel-shaped DC connector, but most premium laptops today also or solely charge via USB-C—including all the models in our roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">the best laptops</a>.</p>

<p>VPNs, or virtual private networks, are one of the most effective ways to stay safe online. Not only do they allow you to stay anonymous, but they can help keep your data private and keep intrusive trackers at bay. Plus, they allow you to get around region blocks on streaming services and avoid speed throttling by ISPs. However, you usually have to pay for a VPN subscription and adding an extra monthly expense to an already tight budget isn’t ideal. That’s where a free VPN can come in handy. They can provide you with a similar level of security for no cost at all. But not all free VPNs are built the same.</p>



<p>With many free VPNs you’ll encounter a lot of restrictions such as speed constraints, bandwidth caps, or a limited country network. These restrictions can add up, making the experience of using a free VPN feel pointless. That’s why it’s important

<p>I mean, right now you can get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-130MB-UHS-I-MB-SC128K-AM/dp/B09B1DL14V/">this 128GB Samsung Evo Plus SDXC card for just $10 on Amazon</a>, which is 38 percent off its normal price. And this is the newer model with noticeably faster transfer rates!</p>

<p>Gigabyte’s GS34WQC 34-inch gaming monitor is one of our favorite budget picks here at PCWorld. It’s already a good deal at its retail price of $400, and it often goes on sale for around $300.</p>



<p>But today, the price has never been better thanks to this Newegg deal that’s offering the ultimate bang for your buck: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-gs34wqc-34-wqhd-120hz-oc-135hz-va-black/p/24-012-067">grab this Gigabyte ultrawide monitor for just $250 right now</a>.</p>

<p>Integrated graphics are still nowhere near as powerful as discrete laptop graphics card, but they’re getting shockingly beefy these days. For example, AMD laptops with their “APU” configurations are the heart of the Steam Deck and its gaming handheld competitors.</p>



<p>And now, Intel says the new Xe2 integrated graphics on upcoming Core chips are a step above the competition. Xe2 graphics will be built into Lunar Lake devices, laptops with Core Ultra Series 2 CPUs coming later this year and into 2025.</p>

<p>If you don’t need a powerhouse gaming rig or the portability of a laptop, the best bang for your buck might just be a mini PC. The benefits are many and you get more power per dollar spent.</p>



<p>And right now, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ACEMAGIC-AD08-i7-11700B-1165G7%E3%80%91-Computers/dp/B0CY296GG6/">this Acemagic mini PC is on sale for $319 on Amazon</a>, which is a sizable discount off its normal $449 price.</p>



<p>For starters, this mini PC has a vertical design that doesn’t take up much space and it’s basically 6 x 3 x 3 inches around.

<p>The woman, an American, snapped photos of Acer’s new Nitro V 14 gaming PC, but she was clearly irritated.</p>



<p>“What, girls don’t get a 4090?” she asked of a pair of foreign journalists, who stared blankly. “Why aren’t we good enough for a 4090?”</p>



<p>A few dozen minutes ago, Acer had announced the Acer Nitro V 14 on stage at a press conference attached to IFA, Berlin’s consumer electronics show. I wasn’t paying attention too closely, but the Nitro V 14 — clothed in a rather fresh-looking white plastic chassis, apparently was being marketed at women. One of Acer’s promotional images showed what was apparently a gamer girl clutching the Nitro V 14.</p>



<p>If it’s true that the Acer Nitro V 14 is being marketed at women — and no one at Acer’s booth specifically told me it was — the irritated influencer may have had a point. The Acer Nitro V 14 (

<p>Intel previously said that the upcoming Core Ultra chip, Lunar Lake, won’t be manufactured internally. The company is now saying the same for its next-gen desktop chip, Arrow Lake, as well.</p>



<p>Will the decision affect Intel’s ability to release the chip on time, its features, or its clock speeds? Almost certainly not. But working with “external partners” to produce Arrow Lake will entail higher manufacturing costs than using Intel’s own factories — costs which may or may not be passed along to consumers.</p>



<p>It’s also a matter of pride as Intel has been manufacturing its own chips for decades. But Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger said that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2355435/intels-lunar-lake-is-actually-made-at-tsmc.html">Lunar Lake would break that streak</a> and make all of its high-profile chiplets at TSMC.

<p>Chromebooks and Google’s ChromeOS that runs them are getting a long-overdue PC-like feature: Snap groups, which allow you to “snap” app windows to various sides of your screen.</p>



<p>The new feature is part of ChromeOS M128, the stable version of the operating system. It should automatically roll out to all Chromebooks soon, including yours, if it hasn’t already.</p>
