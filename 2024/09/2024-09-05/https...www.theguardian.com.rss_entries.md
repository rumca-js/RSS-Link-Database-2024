<ul><li>Rider claims second consecutive stage win in Barnsley</li><li>Alaphilippe and Sutton threaten in rainy conditions</li></ul><p>Steve Williams tightened his grip on the Tour of Britain on the uphill finish in Barnsley, extending his lead with a 10sec time bonus by winning stage three. It was a second stage win in two days for Williams at the end of a pulsating four hours of racing across Yorkshire. It was far from plain sailing, however, with first Julian Alaphilippe and then Louis Sutton giving the Welshman and his Israel-Premier Tech team a torrid time.</p><p>On a murky day, with the cloud hanging low over the hills on the edge of the Peak District, Alaphilippe was on the offensive immediately, spending the first 70km out front in a four-rider group. The Frenchman had started the stage in third, just 16sec behind Williams, so the Welshman’s team were forced to chase hard to keep him within reach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/sep/05/cycling-tour-o

<p>The award-winning artist is reinventing the way landscapes are depicted in art – not least by pointing out that human bodies are made of the same stuff</p><p>Teresita Fernández is a landscape artist – but these are not landscapes as we know them. Rather than a spot on a map, her understanding of the term extends from the depths of the Earth to the cosmos, and from the cellular to the psychological. Her vast mosaic panel sculptures and wall reliefs of cartographies evoke galaxies, weather systems, oceans, and archipelagos, which appear to be continually in flux. “I think of landscape as being very expansive,” says Fernández, 56, who was born in Miami to Cuban exiles who had fled the 1959 revolution, and is now based in New York. “I’m drawing parallels between the movements of the sea and the cosmos, a flow that is also replicated in our bodies’ circulatory system.”</p><p>While Fernández’s work encompasses installation and film, she regards her practice as largely sculptural.

<p>What happens to our hearts when we are encased in a field of malevolence and hatred that daily threatens our stability and peace?</p><p>I have been thinking about fascism long before I even knew I was thinking about it. I lived for years inside the mind, the home, the terror of my tyrannical father who used violence as the methodology to sustain his power over every aspect of our existence. In order to achieve that power he separated and divided us. He isolated us, used us against each other and made us lonely.</p><p>Hannah Arendt wrote about loneliness in the Origins of Totalitarianism, published in 1951: “What prepares men for totalitarian domination in the non-totalitarian world is the fact that loneliness, once a borderline experience usually suffered in certain marginal social conditions like old age, has become an everyday experience.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/sep/05/loneliness-political-instability-democracy-fascism">Continue readin

Her experience of terror was physical. She struggled to breathe.

<p>From McCartney to Dylan and the Stones, this portrait of rock longevity mixes fascinating detail with rash claims – but is never less than entertaining</p><p>In July 1985, David Hepworth was one of the anchors for the BBC’s coverage of Live Aid. Nearly 40 years on, he suggests that the day wasn’t just a huge charity event, but the start of a sea change in rock history. Rather than diehard music fans, it attracted an audience of “regular people”. The show’s biggest successes were largely not the “new&nbsp;pop” groups who’d come to prominence in punk’s aftermath, but those more experienced artists whom punk had supposedly rendered irrelevant: who’d take Spandau Ballet bullishly debuting a previously unheard track from their forthcoming album over Queen or Elton John rolling out the hits?</p><p>Here, Hepworth suggests, lurked the seeds of what he calls Rock’s Third Act, in which the belief that music is strictly a young person’s game has been subverted. It started in Live Aid’s wake,

<p>Vincent Cassel and Gianni Capaldi complete an improbable trio on the hunt for a serial killer in this absurd police procedural – one for the so-bad-it’s-good genre</p><p>Here is what appears to be an authentic so-bad-it’s-good crime thriller, set on the mean streets of Edinburgh and starring the improbable trio of Gianni Capaldi (Blood of Redemption), Samuel L Jackson (Pulp Fiction) and Vincent Cassel (L’Élève). If you’ve ever wondered what a British police procedural television show inexplicably starring this combo of actors would feel like – and why wouldn’t you? – this is the movie for you.</p><p>As is traditional, matters begin with a pre-titles cold open featuring a grisly murder: a woman answers the door of her Edinburgh flat to a caped and hooded maniac who proceeds to dismember her. (Per the rules of the subgenre, you don’t see all that much of the murder itself, but you do get all the gory details during the subsequent crime scene photography sequence.) “Why do serial kill

I tend to forget this, but now with the last days of summer still perfect for a swim, I decide to drive an hour out of Berlin to a lake – and I’m instantly reminded of it. The first things I notice: idyllic nature, clean air – and a lot of neo-Nazis. It’s not even hard to recognise them: in many parts of eastern Germany they stroll around with a puffed-out chest and unambiguous symbols tattooed on their arms, printed on their shirts or stuck to their cars.</p><p>Of course, in Berlin we have neo-Nazis, too, but their presence is more subtle.

The life and work of James Lovelock is proof&nbsp;that this is neither possible nor desirable.
