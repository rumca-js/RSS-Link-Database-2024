I've been away working on a new album with The Darkness but I caught up with my favourite band, The Lemon Twigs for a "chatty chat" in Brighton. We talked music, towels and 19th century stained glass. What's not to like? 

Thanks to my friend Gareth Parker for riding with me. 

'Dreams on Toast' - the new Darkness album - comes out in March - when we'll be embarking on a UK tour!
Pre-sale begins on the 25th:  https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/officialstore
