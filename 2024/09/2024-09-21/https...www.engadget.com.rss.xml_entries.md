<p>X is reportedly reversing course after weeks of refusing to comply with conditions set by the Brazilian Supreme Court that would allow it to operate in the country again. According to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/world/americas/elon-musk-x-brazil.html" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/world/americas/elon-musk-x-brazil.html"><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a>, the company’s lawyers said in a Friday court filing that X has named a legal representative in Brazil as demanded by justice Alexandre de Moraes and removed accounts that the judge had identified as a threat to democracy, along with paying the fines it owed. But, the publication also reports that the Brazil Supreme Court has said X did not submit all the necessary paperwork, and now has five days to do so.</p>
<p>The paperwork X failed to submit is that which would prove it formally appointed a l

<p>OpenAI could undergo massive changes next year, which include getting a brand new logo. According to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/20/openai-staffers-unhappy-new-logo-design-ominous/"><em>Fortune</em></a>, though, staff members were less than enthused when they got a sneak peek of its supposed new logo at a recent company-wide meeting. The company&#39;s hexagonal flower symbol, which has become pretty recognizable thanks to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-has-doubled-its-weekly-active-users-to-200-million-233037951.html">ChatGPT&#39;s popularity</a>, is gone. Instead, it&#39;s replaced by a large black &quot;O&quot; or a simple ring or circle that staffers reportedly found to be devoid of creativity — ominous, even.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on how the publication&#39;s sources described it, the new logo sounds like the complete opposite of OpenAI&#39;s current one, which was designed to represent &quot;precision, poten

<p>Amazon Prime Big Deal Days is back this year, returning on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-announces-the-return-of-prime-big-deal-days-on-october-8-and-9-050356758.html">October 8 and 9</a>. The “fall <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Prime Day</a>” of sorts has served as the online retailer’s unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season for the past few years.<br><br>We expect most of the deals to be Prime exclusives, meaning you must be an active Prime subscriber to get the discounts. There are always a couple of deals available for everyone, though, so it’s worth perusing Amazon’s site even if you don’t pay for Prime. It’s also worth doing so now because we’ve found a number of solid early Prime Day deals already available. These are the best of the bunch; we’ll be updating this post regularly in the lead-up to October Prime Day, so check back for the latest deals.</p>

## Meta Connect 2024: The cheaper Quest 3S, AI, smart glasses and everything else to expect

<p>It used to go by at least two different names —<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-26-oculus-quest-mixed-reality.html"> Oculus Connect </a>and then <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-connect-170026683.html">Facebook Connect</a> — but whatever the moniker, Meta’s fall event is still a big showcase for the company’s latest and greatest achievements in the virtual reality and mixed reality space. Much like last year, we can likely predict the biggest news coming out of Meta Connect 2024 with just two acronyms: AI and AR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like every other big tech firm this year, Meta will be desperate to demonstrate how it plans to stay relevant in a future powered by AI.  And now that we're seven months beyond the launch of Apple's Vision Pro, which arrived alongside a short-lived spike in interest in augmented reality (AR), Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is likely eager to show off his own plans to make AR a reality.</p>
