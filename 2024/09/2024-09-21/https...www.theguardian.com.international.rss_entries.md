<p>They could very easily have beaten Crystal Palace, and yet left more questions piling up about their manager Erik ten Hag</p><p>The good news for Erik ten Hag and Manchester United is that it was better than last season. But if his mission this season is to improve a little on every equivalent fixture from the last campaign, this was the easy bit. A 4-0 defeat at Crystal Palace in May was probably the nadir of a season that had many lows. Saturday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">goalless draw</a> probably does represent progress, but the picture is far from clear.</p><p>United were by far the better side before half-time and, but for the woodwork and Dean Henderson, would have had a comfortable lead; in the game as a whole, Henderson made seven saves with a combined xG of 1.65. There is an alternative universe not very far removed from this one in which United scored with one of their early ch

<p>The Northern Irish frontman talks embarrassing love stories, legal run-ins and meeting royalty – both musical and literal</p><p><strong>What’s the first rule of patrolling the snow? Is it: don’t eat yellow snow?</strong></p><p>The first rule is don’t talk about patrolling the snow. We were originally called Polar Bear. I was at Dundee university and saw a friend of mine on the street who said, “How’s your band going? How’s Snow Patrol?” I was like: “Man, we’re called Polar Bear. I don’t know where you got that from.” A week later, we had to change the name of the band because one of the guys in Jane’s Addiction had just started a band called Polar Bear and his lawyers said we had to choose a new name. I’ve never met a polar bear, but I think I would love to, up until the point where it ripped my head off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/sep/22/snow-patrol-the-forest-in-the-path-album-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A goalless draw at the Etihad last season cast Arsenal as frontrunners but they need to better balance aggression with defence</p><p>It is the nature of the modern Premier League, in which 90 points has come to feel like a basic minimum to win the title, that analysis of how the league was won tends to focus on where it was lost. Manchester City’s excellence has become so relentless that the assumption is they will surpass 90 points. The question is less about anything they have done than whether other teams could have done anything to overhaul that total.</p><p>In that context, the mind goes back to the final day of March last season, and Arsenal’s trip to Manchester City. Liverpool had beaten Brighton earlier in the day, giving them a three-point lead over Arsenal and four over City, having played a game more. Arsenal were content to frustrate City, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/31/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">drawing 0-0</a>.</p>

<p>The US presidential election is neck and neck. But only one candidate has been compared to Adolf Hitler. Is it an exaggeration or based in fact?</p><p>Is Donald Trump really a fascist? It’s a question that has been bubbling away since he first announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2015 after a years-long campaign to brand Barack Obama an illegitimate occupant of the White House. Back then his questioning of Obama’s citizenship appeared overtly racist (“When I was 18, people called me Donald Trump. When he was 18 @BarackObama was Barry Soweto”). So were his comments about Mexican immigrants at his campaign launch: “They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” Trump’s early indications that he would not accept the results of any election he did not win made him sound like an anti-democrat. And he told Hillary Clinton in their first presidential debate that if he became president, she would end up in jail, which is wher

<p>Emily and Sophie were sent out to dinner in the grip of a heatwave. But 34C temperatures and even a scoring blunder couldn’t stop the romance …</p><p>Like all great love stories, this one begins with sweat-patches. It was July 2018, and London was in the grip of the kind of heatwave that melts tarmac. At 7.21pm, Emily Lewis stumbled off the train in a state of panic. She was meant to be attending a Guardian Blind date in exactly nine minutes, but her T-shirt was soaked with sweat.</p><p>Spotting a Gap store across the road, Emily dashed in and bought a new top almost at random, hiding her wet shirt at the bottom of her rucksack. With three minutes to go, she power-walked to the restaurant, but at the door she faced another hurdle – the hostess had never heard of the Guardian, let alone Blind date. Sweating through her new top, and almost ready to give up, Emily felt a tap on her shoulder. A woman with dark hair was smiling at her, looking cool and unruffled. “I’m Sophie,” she said.

But it was a revelatory choice, sparking in the novelist an explosion of curiosity and joy that has come to creative fruition over half a century later in his 14th novel, Playground. “I just thought, the world is actually huge and mysterious and ancient and out there, and I can’t get to it,” he tells me from his home in the Smoky Mountains, where he is surrounded by forest in every direction as far as the eye can see.</p><p>In the event, he didn’t have to wait that long to access the ocean for real – the following year, the family followed his father’s job as a school principal from Chicago to Bangkok, and Powers found himself

She is almost never seen in any colour but black, and clothes have been Donatella’s channel of communication with the world ever since she started working with her brother in 1976, so this was a strong statement. “I feel like I need to bring positivity,” she shrugged. “This is a terrible moment. War is tearing the world apart. What else can I do but try and bring joy?</p><p>To locate that elusive joy, she revisited the late 1990s. “It was a very Versace time. I was smoking, all the time!
