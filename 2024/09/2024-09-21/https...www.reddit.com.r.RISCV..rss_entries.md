## Will it ever be possible to add extensions as coprocessor chips?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So one of the big upsides of RISC-V is that it isn&#39;t one ISA but a meta-architecture with multiple base ISAs and then standard extensions on top so you can mix and match things to fit your use case. That&#39;s a major step up from what we have with other ISAs where you just have to take what you&#39;re given. However, once a chip is made, that&#39;s the end of any and all customizability. </p> <p>What I want to know is if it&#39;s possible to make a hardware platform that has a socket for a standard RISC-V CPU say using the RV64GC ISA and then have some kind of slots or sockets for adding coprocessor chips to add even more extensions if you want to or otherwise upgrade the machine. The only thing similar to this that I can think of ever existing was way back in the i386 days with the x87 floating point coprocessors. </p> <p>Fast forward to today, if you want to build a DIY computer x86 is practically your only choice except the CPUs themselves are

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have had this error a lot recently. Usually when I needed to reboot it but back then it was just about continiously plugging the power out and in for a while and it would eventually boot. Now, however, it seems entirely stuck.</p> <p><code> dwmci_s: Response Timeout. BOOT fail,Error is 0xffffff </code></p> <p>Any idea what it means with <code>dwmci_s</code>?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IngwiePhoenix"> /u/IngwiePhoenix </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1flqmsm/is_my_visionfive2_dead/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1flqmsm/is_my_visionfive2_dead/">[comments]</a></span>
