<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just upgraded from a Pi 2 to a Pi 4. On the Pi 2, the SD card would click into place when inserted, and you’d push it to release it. But on the Pi 4, the card just slides in without clicking, and you have to pull it out to remove it. Is this normal, or could mine be broken? I tried looking this up but couldn&#39;t get a solid answer.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nujac21"> /u/Nujac21 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fmea3c/sd_card_slot_pi2_to_pi4/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fmea3c/sd_card_slot_pi2_to_pi4/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I ran a quick full-upgrade command on buster, as I intended to upgrade to bookworm. I was soon met with an &quot;authentication error: is your account locked?&quot; when trying to run any Sudo command. After rebooting I can&#39;t even login as Pi, as it can&#39;t find my pi user account. Is there something I can do to get back into the main user?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gubba_Monster"> /u/Gubba_Monster </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fmaie7/cant_login_after_upgrading/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fmaie7/cant_login_after_upgrading/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I want to setup HA on a raspberry pi with a touchscreen dashboard. I have a lot of devices to control, such as lawn mower, ring, hue, thermometers, thermostats, oven, washing machine etc. </p> <p>I also have a large music library on a plex server, but I’m considering moving to foobar or Asset Upnp. Does HA support this?</p> <p>I already got HA to work as an OS, but then I only get the terminal on the touchscreen. As far as I understand, I have to run the dashboard in a browser on the touchscreen, so the way to go is installing HA through docker. I followed <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi-other/">this guide</a> from Home Assitant</p> <p>So this is what I’ve done, and docker says the installation was succesful, yet when I try to run it nothing happens. What do I do from here? Am I doing something wrong?</p> <p>I would like to have HomeAssistant running, and use the touchscreen dashboard to control it.</p> <p>Th
