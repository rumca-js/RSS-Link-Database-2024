<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello good folks. Now that the game has been out for some time, what are your thoughts about the characters vs those of the OG (including Ix) ? I haven&#39;t played Uprising much yet, but at first sight, I&#39;m disappointed : first, thematically the leaders are all over the place, and some of them shouldn&#39;t be able to do all the things we can do in play : own a signet ring/command troops/have diplomatic influence and send spies. Folks like Staban Tuek - shouldn&#39;t have that much authority - or Gurney - shouldn&#39;t have a ring - or Chani in the upcoming expansion - she shouldn&#39;t have anything. And it feels weird to visit your own faction as the Emperor and be forced to pay to receive benefits !</p> <p>Second, gameplay wise, the roster doesn&#39;t seem super balanced, perhaps less than in the OG. There are, yet again, characters who have a one-time-per-game power - it&#39;s not fun, I wish the devs had gotten rid of those - and there seem

It is noted to a ”successful” campaign and is now taking “late pledges” with an anticipated shipping date in Feb 2025. There is a very tempting looking deluxe version. I have never had anything to do with Kickstarter before…I gather you aren’t “purchasing a game” so much as speculating on a potential game but if its been ‘successful’ does that mean I’m likely to get the product? I only found out about the game as I saw it on a list of things being released at Essen Spiel. I don’t really know what that means for it being more widely released for purchase? Has anyone heard of this company?</p> <p>I’ll just add - there are a few videos of people who have a copy on youtube - Rahdo for example did a review of the prototype, if that helps. I don’t see it for pre-order anywhere.</p> <p>Any advice for someone new to this realm of gaming?</p> </div

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a copy of sniper elite board game and been finding any party that plays as defender having a hard time finding and killing the sniper player... </p> <p>if sniper is being very careful, or uses card that causes no movement to be detected due to a card play that allows that, it&#39;s SUPER hard to find it&#39;s location... Usually it&#39;s till the very end round of 10 round counter that sniper pops up killing an enemy or/and completing an undefended objective.</p> <p>I always found it quite frustrating to play as defender against sniper, and have seen others feel the same.</p> <p>What suggestions or tips be made to play better as defenders/or any house ruling.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Acceptable-Drink7987"> /u/Acceptable-Drink7987 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1flr6z0/best_tips_to_play_as_defender_in_sniper_elite_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <
