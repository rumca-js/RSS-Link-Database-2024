Vivek Ramaswamy is an American business leader, New York Times bestselling author, and former Republican presidential candidate whose standout performances on the debate stage and the campaign trail have made him a mainstay commentator on topics ranging from the latest electoral trends to the economy, Big Tech, and higher education. In his latest book, "Truths: The Future of America First," Vivek criticizes the Republican Party‚Äôs shortcomings and lays out a positive vision for the future of American conservatism. In this episode of the Sunday Special, Vivek and I discuss how the Trump campaign can win this election season, the failures of neoliberalism, and the need to redefine ‚ÄòAmericanism‚Äô in support of our country‚Äôs founding ideals.
