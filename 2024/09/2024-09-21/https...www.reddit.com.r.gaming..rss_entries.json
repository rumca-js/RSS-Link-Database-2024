I really think we need an Uncharted Golden Abyss + Drake&#39;s Fortune(1) combined Remake. Which can have the title of &quot;Origins of Thieves&quot;. I am a huge Uncharted fan but I don&#39;t own a Vita so couldn&#39;t play Golden Abyss and while Drake&#39;s Fortune is still a great game it&#39;s very much an aged title these days. So throwing that into the mix made sense to me.</p> <p>We already have Legacy of Thieves Collection as well bundling in 4 and Lost Legacy. So for 2 and 3, we can have a simple Remastered collection like &quot;Adventures of Thieves&quot;, &quot;Trials of Thieves&quot; or something else. Both can come to PS5 and PC and I think it makes a lot of sense.

Another reason is because I had to share the Xbox with my brother and despite the console not being his he doesn&#39;t let me play multiplayer because I&#39;m going to ruin his stats. I stopped playing video games on a regular basis around about 2017 but fortunately my brother stopped playing video games in 2021 because he got sick of COD because you have to be sweaty at the game and because the internet we use isn&#39;t the best. He sold the Xbox and now all he does is watch people play in the eSports competition. I&#39;m not convinced that call of duty black ops gulf war would be good because Activision will try to put microtrantions inside a game that cost $100AU at launch. The gameplay might just be like modern warfare but with slightly different graphics and weapons.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://", "id": 1185321, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1flsp2v/what_made_you_stop_playing_call_of_duty", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 492, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "What made you stop playing call of duty?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-21T01:17:42+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1flroza/the_company_behind_a_mental_health_action_shooter/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/SWAKo_Yw_-X90LSdN-6BHE2f8AnpLQ6kgctTK06RajQ.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6bd664050d769ddae38668501e0a81e6ceae7a7\" alt=\"The company behind a 'mental health action shooter' envisions a health insurance-funded 'golden age' for gaming, and it just got FDA clearance to treat stress\" title=\"The company behind a 'mental health action shooter' envisions a health insurance-funded 'golden age' for gaming, and it just got FDA clearance to treat stress\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TylerFortier_Photo\"> /u/TylerFortier_Photo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/deepwell-dtx-videogame-therapy-fda-clearance/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1flroza/the_company_behind_a_mental_health_ac", "id": 1185180, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1flroza/the_company_behind_a_mental_health_action_shooter", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 492, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://external-preview.redd.it/SWAKo_Yw_-X90LSdN-6BHE2f8AnpLQ6kgctTK06RajQ.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e6bd664050d769ddae38668501e0a81e6ceae7a7", "title": "The company behind a 'mental health action shooter' envisions a health insurance-funded 'golden age' for gaming, and it just got FDA clearance to treat stress", "vote": 0}]
