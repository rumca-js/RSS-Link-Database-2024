<ul><li>Former champion suffers fifth-round knockout</li><li>Dubois keeps his IBF heavyweight title</li></ul><p>Anthony Joshua suffered a shocking knockout loss to Daniel Dubois, his far less celebrated British rival, on an extraordinary night at Wembley Stadium. It was a crushing defeat for Joshua who was knocked down in the first round and then utterly dominated and sent repeatedly to the canvas. The brutal end was finally sealed in the fifth round when, just as Joshua tried to turn the tide of a one-sided beating, Dubois landed two shattering right hands which resulted in a conclusive stoppage.</p><p>Even though Dubois was the nominal IBF world heavyweight champion, he walked to the ring first in a clear sign that he was meant to play a supporting role to the Joshua Show in front of 96,000 fans. Dubois had never experienced such a searing atmosphere before but he looked composed and determined as he climbed through the ropes. But he had a long wait before his more exalted rival joi

<p>Chinese aggression in the South China Sea forcing countries such as Japan to increase defences and talk up an ‘Asian Nato’</p><p>Whoever declared that in this world “nothing is certain except death and taxes” plainly led a sheltered life.

<p>Claude Monet visited London three times between 1899 and 1901, when he became fascinated by the views of the Thames from the balcony of his suite at the Savoy hotel. In an attempt to capture the light at specific times of day, he painted the views towards Waterloo Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and Charing Cross Bridge, later completing the paintings when he was back in France. “The blurring, or merging, of water and sky created by the fog fascinated Monet,” says Karen Serres, curator of a new exhibition bringing these works together in London, as the artist intended, for the first time, just 300 metres from where many of them were painted. “He would remember this blurring for his famous water lily paintings, which he began after his return from London.”</p><ul><li><a href="https://courtauld.ac.uk/whats-on/exh-monet-and-london-views-of-the-thames/">Monet and London: Views of the Thames is at the Courtauld Gallery, London WC2, from Friday to 19 January 2025</a></li></ul> <a href="

<p>The tech firm’s federal approval to turn its earbuds into hearing aids is one in the eye for the monopolistic US healthcare agency</p><p>Like many professional scribblers, I sometimes have to write not in a hushed study or library, but in noisy environments. So years ago I bought a set of Apple AirPods Pro, neat little gadgets that have a limited degree of noise-cancelling ability. They’re not as effective as the clunky (and pricey) headphones that seasoned transcontinental airline passengers need, but they’re much lighter and less obtrusive. And they have a button that enables you to switch off the noise cancellation and hear what’s going on around you.</p><p>I remember wondering once if a version of them could also function as hearing aids, given the right software. But then dismissed the thought: after all, hearing aids are expensive, specialised devices that are often prescribed by audiologists – and also signal to the world at large that you are hard of hearing.</p> <a href="h

<p>The grey wolf expert on the incredible distances the predators travel, why dogs are a kind of dumbed down wolf – and her most hair‑raising close call</p><p>The grey wolf (Canis lupus) has generated fear and hatred. Seen as a danger to livestock and people, the once widespread predator was nearly completely eradicated from western Europe and most of the contiguous US in the 19th and 20th centuries. Pro- and anti-wolf groups now duel over how the species should be managed as populations have rebounded in places over the past few decades. American wildlife biologist Diane Boyd, 69, has spent 40 years studying the recovery of wild wolf populations in remote north-western Montana and Glacier national park. When she started in the late 1970s on the University of Montana’s Wolf Ecology Project (WEP) – which she later co-led – she was the only female biologist in the US trapping, radio-collaring and following their trails through the snow for research.

<p>Surge in participation requires game to keep pace in providing suitable and welcoming environments for women and girls</p><p>As the new Women’s Super League season kicks off with a bang this weekend, it’s set to give joy to fans who are turning up to matches and watching them at home in numbers we used to only imagine. These numbers are growing at an exponential rate and these teams are inspiring a new generation of women and girls up and down the country to lace up their boots and play our national game.</p><p>It is incredible to think that more than four million women and girls now play football in England; with more females playing football than males and females play rugby.

This rapid growth has made it clear that the grassroots system and the game needs to change just as quickly, and be ready for the fact that by 2030, one in five fo

<p>A thoughtful, witty and warmhearted journey through children’s literature</p><p>If you were lucky enough to grow up loving books, the world of childhood reading may now feel like a lost paradise. I remember mine as a swirl of djinn, trolls, rabbits, pointy-hatted witches, smoking caterpillars, rogue elephants, hot-air balloons, underground rivers, volcanoes, monkeys, treasure-maps and Mississippi rafts, all consumed by me with an uncritical delight that is harder to achieve in adult life.</p><p>Delight, as Sam Leith argues in this splendid survey of children’s literature from Aesop to Philip Pullman, lies at the very heart of the genre. A good children’s book thrills its readers with&nbsp;ripping adventures and strong characters; it evokes mental images that can stay imprinted for ever. It revels in words: think of Dr Seuss’s stories, or Rudyard Kipling’s perfect ear&nbsp;in lines such as: “Go to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-tree
