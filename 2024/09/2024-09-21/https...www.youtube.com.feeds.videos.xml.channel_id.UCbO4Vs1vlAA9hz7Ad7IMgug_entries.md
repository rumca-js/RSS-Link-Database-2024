One of the two launch teams for the Bheta-Decima season of the last edition of Kill Team, the Scout Squads are the Astartes offering from this wave of Datacards. Mixing close up and far ranged combat with a medium amount of melee models, this flexible team can go from close assault to ranged combat and back. Likely the most beginner-friendly of the Kill Teams out now, this plastic kit easily makes all the options for the Team. Let's check them out!

If you'd have told me shotgun-toting, trenchcoat-wearing Squat Adventurers were going to be on my 2024 Painting List for 40k five years ago, I wouldn't have believed you. Definitely wasn't on my 2024 Bingo Card.... but here we are. Let's check them out!

Hailing from last season's Bheta-Decima team roster, the Mandrakes are the bane of heavy-armour kill teams. With unsurpassed mobility around Heavy terrain pieces and changing out Armour saves for rolling under APL with theri ranged attacks, these shadow-monsters hit hard up close and then dash off into the shadows.
