<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here’s a Python function I wrote to invert matrices over rings of the form Z_n. I searched online for similar implementations but couldn&#39;t find any, although I’m sure there are some out there. I needed this for a project because matrix multiplication in the ring was inefficient, which is why I had to write this myself instead of using libraries like NumPy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Maleficent_Call840"> /u/Maleficent_Call840 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/cmcdev-code/InvertMatrixZmod_n">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1flu06u/inverting_matrices_in_rings/">[comments]</a></span>
