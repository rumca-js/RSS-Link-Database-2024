Rooftopping is the art of climbing sky scrapers. We're in Caracas, Venezuela to put it all on the edge and climb 2 of it's tallest towers. The first will be the notorious Torre David. A 45-story building that was never finished because of a financial crisis in the 1990s. Squatters moved in and turned it into a home for thousands of people. It became a symbol of Venezuelaâ€™s struggles and the people's ability to create their own community.

Parque Central is a complex of 5 towers with the tallest tower standing 56 stories high. It was built as a major residential and commercial center. The taller tower became a symbol of modern urban development in Venezuela but also faced challenges like fires and economic decline over the years. The east tower is abandoned from halfway up.
