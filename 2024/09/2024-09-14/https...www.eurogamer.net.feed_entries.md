<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Dawntrail-FMV-13.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Final Fantasy XIV's first graphical overhaul since the release of version 2.0 in 2013 is here with version 7.0, including changes to lighting and ambient occlusion (AO), the addition of DLSS upscaling on PC, 120Hz support on current-gen consoles and a 30fps cap most useful for last-gen machines. It's a substantial effort that even includes reworked textures, models and shading work for some (but not all) characters and environments, helping the game feel a little closer to its modern contemporaries. </p><p>Most of what's here is impressive, but there are some definite trade-offs with some of the new options - alongside some features that don't seem to be working as intended as of version 7.05. This piece summarises the highlights and lowlights of the new changes, and offers some recommendations for the best balance of performance and visual fidelity on di

Even with only the relatively modest population of Gold Edition purchasers, the servers crumbled faster than a
