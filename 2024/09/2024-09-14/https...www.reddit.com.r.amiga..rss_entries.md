<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!</p> <p>Wondering if you guys can help me ID a game I played when I was very young. I can&#39;t remember many details about it, and not 100% it was even on the Amiga. I&#39;d say I&#39;m about 90% sure it was.</p> <p>All I remember is that it was a sidescroller and perhaps a shooter game. MAYBE a woman as the character or she was one of a few.</p> <p>The stage I remember was a kind-of forest or woodland, with conifer trees like cyprus trees or something.</p> <p>I remember the stage having quite a lot of verticality, so the screen moved up - sort-of like parallax?</p> <p>All else I remember was some kind of box or computer thing on the ground, not much bigger than the player character, and either on that box or somewhere near the word &#39;OZONE&#39; or words &#39;OZONE LAYER&#39;.</p> <p>I realise this is a long-shot perhaps but it occasionally pops into my head and I just want to put it to rest haha</p> <p>Cheers and I&#39;d be fucking surprise
