We're in Caracas, Venezuela to put it all on the edge and climb 2 of it's tallest towers. The first will be the notorious Torre David. A 45-story building that was never finished because of a financial crisis in the 1990s. Squatters moved in and turned it into a home for thousands of people. It became a symbol of Venezuela\u2019s struggles and the people's ability to create their own community.\n\nParque Central is a complex of 5 towers with the tallest tower standing 56 stories high. It was built as a major residential and commercial center. The taller tower became a symbol of modern urban development in Venezuela but also faced challenges like fires and economic decline over the years. The east tower is abandoned from halfway up.\n\nWANT TO VISIT VENEZUELA? Message @furia-tv  on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/vidafuria\n\nBig love my boy Fplus a famous rooftopper in Caracas.
