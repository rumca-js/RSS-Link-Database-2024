I'm sure there's a good reason for this but it does feel quite limiting sometimes so does anyone have any good board game recs for 6 players?</p> <p>I will look into anything that fits the player requirement because as a group, tastes are slightly eclectic!! We play everything from pretty simple card games to 5+ hour strategy games, depending on how we're feeling on the night. One of us tends to struggle with focusing on epic long games - but she can be persuaded to get involved in the long ones if either the theme/artwork are super cute or the game is cooperative.</p> <p>Games we've played and everyone really likes (not all necessarily 6 players):</p> <ul> <li>Libertalia</li> <li>Flamecraft</li> <li>Wing/Wyrmspan</li> <li>Doomlings </li> <li>Eldritch Horror</li> <li>Firefly</li> <li>The Witcher</li> <li>Smallworld&lt;/li</li></ul></div></pre></div></body></html>
