Well now we have Mualai and Neuv who are both stronger dps so they will sell better, and then Childe, who, while oder than Ayato, is a Fatui Harbinger, which gives him appeal to a larger fan base..........so if I had to guess, I wouldn't be surprised to see Ayato not rerun until 5.6-5.7, or maybe even Snez</p> <p>Same thing with Cyno</p> <p>Why rerun Cyno, when have the archon rerun of Raiden coming up, we still need Clorindes second banner, Iansan is coming down the pipe, and aggravate as a team in general is kind of falling off&lt;/</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
