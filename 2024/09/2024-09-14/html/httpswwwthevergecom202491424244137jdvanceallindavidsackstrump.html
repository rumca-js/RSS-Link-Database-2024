<p>JD Vance’s appearance at the <em>All-In</em> Summit was easily the most comfortable I’ve seen him, but then he was with the people he understands best: other VCs.</p>
<p>The <em>All-In</em> podcast appearance was what business leaders refer to as a display of synergy. Cohost David Sacks’ and Vance’s political fortunes are tied together — if Trump wins, Sacks looks like a kingmaker and has a vice president who owes him favors and will take his calls. If Vance loses, remaining close to his <em>real</em> community — venture capitalists — gives him a valuable network to tap into for future campaigns.</p>
