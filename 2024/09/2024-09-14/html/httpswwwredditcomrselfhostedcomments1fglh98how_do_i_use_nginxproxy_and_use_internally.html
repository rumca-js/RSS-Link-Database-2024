I am playing with Immich for some photo storage currently, and I am loving it. Got nginxproxymanager all setup too.</p> <p>So, I have <a href="http://pics.domain.com">pics.domain.com</a> setup in proxy with lets encrypt and works exactly how I need it to me. But im running into issue where if Im inside my network (via wifi) and I have Immich setup to use <a href="http://pics.domain.com">pics.domain.com</a> it won't work. More specifically, if I go to <a href="https://pics.domain.com">https://pics.domain.com</a> it comes up with my opnsense router interface. So I know this has something to do with DNS of some sort, as its trying to got out, but its in at the same time.</p> <p>How do I make that part work like I want it to?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jdlnewborn"> /u/jdlnewborn </a> <br/></pre></div></body></html>
