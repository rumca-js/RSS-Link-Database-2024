Sort of like these "hyper casual" games. </p> <p>I noticed I listen really well when my hands and eyes are occupied, with a simple game. It does wonders for listening to hard/boring stuff like lectures, books etc. These are way better than fidget toys. </p> <p>Android / iOS / PC / console, doesn't really matter. I'll cling to anything.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/G3mipl4fy"> /u/G3mipl4fy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fgcr34/games_for_fidgetingadhd/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fgcr34/games_for_fidgetingadhd/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
