Anything that’s similar to whatsapp, slack, discord, etc would work. Just need to be able to send DMs, create groups, upload media, etc. My top requirement is to be able to add the web app PWA to home screen and receive push notifications. </p> <p>I tried rocket chat but push notifications only work in desktop chrome. Push notifications don’t work in ios safari when added to home screen (PWA). I don’t want to use their cloud push gateway for push notifications. I don’t want any data to leave my network. </p> <p>I looked through ONCE Campfire and it looks like it has everything I am looking for including ios PWA push notifications. But it’s not OSS. </p> <p>Are there other OSS solutions out there that I should try?</p> <p>Requirements:</p> <ul> <li>DMs</li> <li>Groups/Channels</li> <li>Share images, videos, etc</li> <li>PWA that supports iOS push notifications</li> <li>Good</li></ul></div></pre></div></body></html>
