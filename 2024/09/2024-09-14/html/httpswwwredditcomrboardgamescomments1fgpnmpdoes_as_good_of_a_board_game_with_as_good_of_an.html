For the first six months of playing it I only knew it as a board game and didn't realize it has such a solid app so naturally I could only play when I got enough people willing to play. Now that I know about the app, I play so much more and I love it because it really lets me test different strategies and understand the game so much better. </p> <p>Are there any other top tier board games that also have great apps? I find that with more complex board games (even though wingspan is still decently light) it is tough to get a good grip on the game without playing many times. I also know my friends just aren't willing to have board game nights nearly as often as I am, so for a good board game I want to explore fully, having an online component where I can play people is huge for me.</p> <p>The other best option I know of is dominion, which is very solid. I know of online catan, and I enjoy </p></div></pre></div></body></html>
