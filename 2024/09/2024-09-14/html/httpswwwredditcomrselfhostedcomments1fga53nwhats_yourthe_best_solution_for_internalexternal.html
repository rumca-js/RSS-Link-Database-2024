Due to certain reasons (mainly Google's fault), I need SSL to a few of them, most importantly to Home Assistant, without going outside my network (or even letting the local services know my external IP). I also have a number of services that require external access, such as my Matrix (Synapse) server.</p> <p>I would like to put all of these onto the same proxy to handle SSL wrapping, and also to avoid having to remember IP addresses. I also have my own FQDN which I'd like to use both internally and externally.</p> <p>So, a few scenarios to describe this:</p> <ul> <li>I'm on my home WiFi, in my local network range, and want to access homeassistant.my.fqdn - my internal DNS server points this request to my proxy server's internal IP, which proxies 10.0.0.homeassistant with SSL.</li> &lt;l</ul></div></pre></div></body></html>
