No stringing. No artifacts. Smooth finish. All with basically default settings. And dirt cheap. </p> <p>Do no overlook this brand just because they are inexpensive. I am switching all my PLA over to this brand as I need to buy more. Highly recommended. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/freshggg"> /u/freshggg </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1fgtbyn/holy_cow_anycubic_pla_is_the_highest_quality_pla/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1fgtbyn/holy_cow_anycubic_pla_is_the_highest_quality_pla/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
