I just want to know your opinion on which of these games are better in terms of gameplay, immerson, and replayability. My main concern would be replay value of the game.</p> <p>Thank you very much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FirstFlight_25"> /u/FirstFlight_25 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fgqp5j/help_me_decide/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fgqp5j/help_me_decide/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
