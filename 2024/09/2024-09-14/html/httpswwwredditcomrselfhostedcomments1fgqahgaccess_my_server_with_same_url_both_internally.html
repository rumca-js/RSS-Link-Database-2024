But how do I make it to work as app.servername.local i.e. the same way I access internally.</p> <p>I tried playing around with Magic DNS and NameServers settings. But I couldn't make it to work the way I expect.</p> <p>Is this even possible?</p> <p>P.S: I have domain and cloudflare setup. But as Cloudflare TOS is against using Jellyfin, I thought of using Tailscale to access my Jellyfin externally. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ExceptionOccurred"> /u/ExceptionOccurred </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgqahg/access_my_server_with_same_url_both_internally/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgqahg/access_my_server_with_same_url_both_internally/">[comme</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
