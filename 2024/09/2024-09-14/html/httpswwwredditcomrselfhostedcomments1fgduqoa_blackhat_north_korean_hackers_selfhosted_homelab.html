(Warning this is a LONG post). For the next few months to a year I want to make A BlackHat North Korean Hacker's Self-Hosted Homelab. The game plan is to eventually sell it to someone who is very passionate about it. I'm coordinating this project in 7 parts:</p> <ul> <li>brainstorm (gathering ideas from everyone on what the homelab includes)</li> <li>agenda (have everything planned out ready to go on step 3)</li> <li>blueprint (a layout to what parts and components I need to complete the project as well as a visual representation of what it would look like and what software it's constructed of)</li> <li>build (self-explanatory)</li> <li>setup (self-explanatory)</li> <li>troubleshoot (self-explanatory)</li> <li>sell (self-explanatory)</li> <li>What I need from everyone now is to flood the comments with id</li></ul></div></pre></div></body></html>
