There is a game called Soiled that I fell in love with over at Kickstarter but I am not sure if it will achieve its goal or not.</p> <p>Would love for you all to check it out and give it a chance!</p> <p>It is a "take that" style of a board game with fun powers and some lighthearted fun! You will get to plant, water, and harvest plants each with their own abilities that could either help your garden or ruin the others!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xCinemato"> /u/xCinemato </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnenglert/soiled-0/description">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fgxpm0/soiled_board_game_kickstarter/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
