We missed last year's but we were there two years ago and really enjoyed it! </p> <p>We only went for Saturday and Sunday and we made a lot of rookie mistakes in hindsight (impulse buying without any research and demo playing, walking around without a specific plan etc etc). </p> <p>This year we will be there from Friday morning and we want go in with more of a plan. So my question is: what's this year's current hype for Spiel? The ones that you have to check out and possibly demo play? </p> <p>I read quite a bit already and continue to do some research but curious what people on here are excited for? </p> <p>Also, if anyone is looking to meet up during the later hours to play their newly purchased games, me and my partner would really enjoy it! Send my a private message or something. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Grandpa-shark"> /u/Grand</a></pre></div></body></html>
