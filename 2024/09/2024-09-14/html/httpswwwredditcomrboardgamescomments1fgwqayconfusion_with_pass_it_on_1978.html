(See photos) if you need to move your yellow tokens but the space is empty (and therefore you can’t put a yellow into it)— does that mean you can’t move, or do you just put it into the next available slot? Because if it’s the latter, it seems like there’s no strategy and it’s just a race to see who can empty their slots first and whoever goes first will win. Then again, we tried to play it 2-player and maybe that’s just not an ideal playing arrangement, even though it’s technically possible. Apparently this is a version of mancala. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> </td></tr></table></pre></div></body></html>
