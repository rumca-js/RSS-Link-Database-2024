I want to surprise my sister by getting a bunch more 3D printed but can't find an STL (3D printer recipe) for them. I found something slightly different that could work, but I want the pieces to be the same size as the originals and I can't ask my sister to measure one for me without ruining the surprise (she owns the game). Would any of you fine people be able to either throw a quick measurement my way, or send me an STL file if you have one?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_Robot_toast_"> /u/_Robot_toast_ </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fgyha1/i_need_help_from_someone_who_owns</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fgyha1/i_need_help_from_someone_who_owns</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
