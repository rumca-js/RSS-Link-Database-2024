It was advertised as no X-2 included because it’s a download code, but I figured it was a decent price so I’d pick it up and deal with no X-2 when the time came. Got out to my car and saw that they’re actually was a piece of paper with a sticker on it and a code for X-2. Logged into the Nintendo website and entered the code and it worked!</p> <p>Stoked to give this game a shot, I’ve heard great things about it</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/qaasq"> /u/qaasq </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fgpe3l/small_wins_at_gamestop/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fgpe3l/small_wins_at_gamestop/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
