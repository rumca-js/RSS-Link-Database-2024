<p>If LLM do actually help engineers become significantly more productive what could explain that, for instance, in the open source community:<p>- We are not fixing bugs faster<p>- We are not developing features faster<p>- We haven't seen an explosion of new projects<p>- We haven't seen an explosion of vulnerabilities being discovered<p>Maybe I am missing something but to me everything looks the same (except for an increasing amount of useless customer service chatbots and garbage LLM generated books on Amazon)</p>
