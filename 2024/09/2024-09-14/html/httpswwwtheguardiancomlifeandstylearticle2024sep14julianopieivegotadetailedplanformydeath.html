My mentor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/michael-craig-martin">Michael Craig-Martin</a> [the artist and painter] always said: “Fuck ’em!” Just focus on what you’re doing yourself. It tends to see you through.<br/><br/><strong>I won </strong><strong>an art prize</strong> with a bar of soap. I was always drawing as a kid. Aged 11, I’d forgotten about a school art competition until the last morning. I grabbed some soap and carved it into a kind of abstract 1950s-style Henry Moore or Barbara Hepworth shape, partly as a joke, but I won. I thought, “Wow, you can get away with this?”<br/><br/><strong>My mum taught me</strong> how to look. My father taught me perseverance, to keep hammering away, to not ever give up. </p></pre></div></body></html>
