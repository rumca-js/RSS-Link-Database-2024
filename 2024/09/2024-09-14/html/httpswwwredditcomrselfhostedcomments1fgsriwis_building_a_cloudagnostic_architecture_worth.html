I'm planning to launch several small projects, some of which may scale over time, while others may not.</p> <p>The idea is to avoid being tightly coupled to a specific cloud provider by designing a decoupled architecture that allows for easy migration between services like AWS, Hetzner, and others based on needs and cost. This would involve clean architectures, minimal dependencies on provider-specific services, etc.</p> <p>Has anyone here evaluated or worked with cloud-agnostic setups? Does the flexibility of easily moving between cloud providers outweigh the complexity and potential performance trade-offs? Or is it more practical to just go all-in with something like AWS, taking advantage of the strong integration between their services? I'd love to hear about your experie</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
