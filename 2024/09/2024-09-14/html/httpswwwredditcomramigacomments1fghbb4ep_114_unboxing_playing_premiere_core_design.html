The player takes the role of Clutch Gabble, a young film editor, who had the reels for his film stolen from him on the night before the film's premiere. The goal is to get to six different levels, represented as movie sets, and return the film. After each level the player has to deal with a boss stage that is represented in a form of a mini-game or arcade sequence.</p> </div></td></tr></table></pre></div></body></html>
