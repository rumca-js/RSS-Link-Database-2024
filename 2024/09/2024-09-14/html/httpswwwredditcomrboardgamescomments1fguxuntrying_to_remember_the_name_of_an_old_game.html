Spaceship strategy game played I think on hex board. There were multiple races and lots of prebuilt scenarios. Pieces were cardboard tokens and you would track your ships on paper. There were different classes of ships with larger slower more powerful ships and like little fighters and corvettes etc.</p> <p>Each ship could have shields, armor, weapons, maybe hull? You would write each component as a letter in a line and it was destroyed right to left ..</p> <p>HHHWWAASSS or something like that.</p> <p>There were multiple games, I can't remember if they were expansions or just new versions of the game, my dad had maybe 2-3?</p> <p>Anyone remember this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JokerSp3"> /u/JokerSp3 </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fguxun/trying_to_r</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fguxun/trying_to_r</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
