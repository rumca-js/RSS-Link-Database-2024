My first board game I really loved was Catan. I think that was my first non mainstream game that I played and it was good. I kind of lost interest in it now though. My cousins are really into board games so they’re always introducing me to new games but we don’t see each other all the time. These days though I do weekly online board game sessions with them on boardgamearena which is really good. It’s made me crave more. I don’t have lots of friends but one of my friends has really got into games as well. I’d like to think I help influenced him. We have agreed we should meet up more for board games. My wife doesn’t mind a board game but I don’t think she’s passionate about it at all. She does enjoy some but I dont think she’s ever overly enthusiastic to play. She is happy to play occasionally though. So overall I probably play twice a week if you include the online</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
