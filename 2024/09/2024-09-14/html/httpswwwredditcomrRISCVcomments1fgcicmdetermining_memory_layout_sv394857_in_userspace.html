One of mimalloc's tricks to improve performance on a 64-bit system is to give mmap a page-aligned hint in a part of the virtual address space that is unlikely to be in use. At the moment, it's using the 2TiB+ range for this. But on a RISC-V system with an <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/arch/riscv/vm-layout.html">SV39 MMU</a>, the 2TiB range is unusable.</p> <p>This causes mmap to pick a different address, one that is likely <em>not</em> aligned, and that triggers a fallback in mimalloc. This wastes time on (almost) every allocation, so it's counterproductive.</p> <p>My question is: is there a reliable way to determine the size of the usable virtual address space at either build- or run-time? Basically it'd be nice to have a special case for SV39 that either uses a different range, or at least doesn't waste</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
