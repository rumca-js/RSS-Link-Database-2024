It’s a good concept(?) but it’s so frustrating to execute. </p> <p><strong>1. I keep accidentally exiting the Dolphin Stance.</strong></p> <p>Let’s take a look at Sayu, a 4 star character. Hold down her skill: she’ll enter her “rolling mode”, hit her skill button again: she’ll <strong>do a quick spin attack</strong> before returning to her normal state. </p> <p>Mualani. Tap her skill: she’ll enter Dolphin Stance. While in Dolphin Stance, run through enemies to mark them with Dolphin Kisses. Once you’ve marked an enemy or more with 3 Dolphin Kisses, press the normal attack button to unleash a devastating bite, and a barrage of small Dolphin Bombs. Neat, right? But what would happen if you tap the skill button while Mualani is in her Dolphin Stance? &lt;</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
