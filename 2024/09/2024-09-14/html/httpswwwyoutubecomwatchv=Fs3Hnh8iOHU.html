When you’re flying around the pitch, Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions can be a blast. Each position has a lot of depth to it, whether you’re harassing the other team’s Seeker as a Beater, drifting to keep up with the Snitch as a Seeker, faking out a Keeper to score as a Chaser, or making the perfect save yourself. Quidditch Champions makes smart rule changes to make this fantasy sport more fun while capturing the look and feel of the Wizarding World. There just isn’t much here off the pitch to keep you playing long term, and co-op progression issues mean you can’t easily take on its career mode tournaments or grow your collection of unlockables with friends. Quidditch Champions did the near-impossible by turning quidditch into an actual competitive game, but I just wish there was a little more bristle on the end of this broom.</pre></div></body></html>
