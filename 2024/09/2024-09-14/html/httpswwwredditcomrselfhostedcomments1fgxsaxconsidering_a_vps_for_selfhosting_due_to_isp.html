After doing some research, I’ve found two potential solutions:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Cloudflared Tunnels</strong>: <ul> <li><strong>Video Streaming Issues</strong>: I’ve heard Cloudflare Tunnels may block or throttle video streaming services like Plex, which concerns me as I use it for remote access.</li> <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: It doesn’t seem like an ideal long-term solution for hosting multiple apps, especially with services that require higher bandwidth or more direct control over the network.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>VPS with Traffic Redirect to Home Server</strong>: This option seems like the better choice. I can use a VPS </li></ol></div></pre></div></body></html>
