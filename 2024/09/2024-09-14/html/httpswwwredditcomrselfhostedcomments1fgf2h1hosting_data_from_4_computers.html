He has his data in form of documents snd videos on 4 different computers and wants a system in place for compiling them all. He also mentioned for videos he wants to use mega or YouTube and also has an HP server I'm assuming he has windows installed in his systems. He has no technical expertise but i guess wants a secure system in place Any suggestions on how to do this and how much time would it actually take I have 0 experience in this but I’m guessing he wants to self host so that’s why I’m posting here Thanks in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Waaun_waaunwakawaaun"> /u/Waaun_waaunwakawaaun </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgf2h1/hosting_data_from_4_computers/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgf2h1/hosting_data_from_4_c</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgf2h1/hosting_data_from_4_c</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
