I am looking for innovative ways and maybe Buyer Personas for my <a href="https://apify.com/glitch_404/ultimate-news-scraper">apify actor</a> that I developed with my friend.</p> <p>brief summary: news scraper to scrape up to 10K news articles from over 10 000 news sources in less than 13 minutes news from over 20 categories .e.g. Crypto news, World News, Latest News, Celebrities News, and a lot more. you can get news from websites like Fox News, BBC News, CNN News, Crypto and Cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>We are currently enrolled in the marketing discussion. We are well aware of the capabilities of our scraper and that nothing else on the apify platform can match it. It is a bold statement, but i invite everybody who is insterested to try it. We have a free plan.</p> <p>Anyways, I would appreciate your ideas on who might find this useful , and would like to spend 10-20 USD on it.</p> <p>Thanks in adva</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
