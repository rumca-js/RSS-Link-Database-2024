He went for a free taster session at the Warhammer shop and he LOVED building the figures! He's since asked me several times for Warhammer for his birthday BUT I have no idea what I'm doing! </p> <p>He's not hugely interested in playing the game (I don't think) but he wants to build and paint them. </p> <p>Is getting him an introductory set that includes 16 minis and some paints the best idea? Will that be enough if he wants to 'battle' just me and him? </p> <p>Also, should I get Age of Sigmar or 40k?</p> <p>Many thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/notheranymore2"> /u/notheranymore2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1fgu9kg/advice_for_8_year_old/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1fgu9kg/advice_for_8_year_old/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
