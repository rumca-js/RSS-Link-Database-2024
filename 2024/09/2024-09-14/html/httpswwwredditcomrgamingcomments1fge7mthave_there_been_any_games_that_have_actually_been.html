Games like Overwatch, which was called the "TF2 killer" and failing and now recently with InZOI being called a "Sims killer." I'm wondering if there has actually been a case of a game that took inspiration from an older game of the same genre and successfully surpassed its original inspiration and actually killed off the older game. Has this ever happened before, or is it not possible for some legacy games?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/whamorami"> /u/whamorami </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fge7mt/have_there_been_any_games_that_have_actually_been/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fge7mt/have_there_been_any_games_that_have_actually_been/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
