Which should be first? Should I use PEMDAS (Parentheses, exponent, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction)? 2) there is a card of the pythoness that says somethings like “take out from the bag 4 ingredients, choose one and evolve it into the next number of that ingredient, if you can’t do it take one green ingredient” it’s kinda confusing cause… lets say… I took 4 ingredientes level 4, so I won’t be able to take evolve any of them… so… am I able to take a level 4 green ingredient or must be level 1? </p> <p>Sorry if my translation doesn’t use same vocabulary as game… but I guess even if that you will be able to understand my doubts</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.c">https://www.reddit.c</a></pre></div></body></html>
