And jellyfin merges them into one filename (broken) and ignores part 2 completely. Moreover, all the episodes' names are offset. Each name belongs to the next episode. Description and metadata included, as well as the episode counting. How do I solve this? I looked around in the library and told it to prefer embedded titles over filenames, rescanned the entire data, activated the automatic metadata refresher. Nothing so far </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/blackmoi"> /u/blackmoi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgw58t/for_all_the_jellyfin_users_here_how_do_i_solve_a/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgw58t/for_all_the_jellyfin_u</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgw58t/for_all_the_jellyfin_u</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
