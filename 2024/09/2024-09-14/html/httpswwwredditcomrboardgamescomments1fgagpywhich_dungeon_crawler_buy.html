I have doubts on which game buy: in one hand I saw Sword &amp; Sorcery and call my attention by its complexity but in the other hand I saw the dungeons and dragons Board Game, either Wrath of Asharladon and The Legend of Drizzt. The thing is The DnD I see its more simple but I think its the best option for my groups of friends that they like mid complex games. But Sword and Sworcery really calls me but im worry about its replability.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/snachtj23"> /u/snachtj23 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fgagpy/which_dungeon_crawler_buy/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fgagpy/which_dungeon_crawler_buy/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
