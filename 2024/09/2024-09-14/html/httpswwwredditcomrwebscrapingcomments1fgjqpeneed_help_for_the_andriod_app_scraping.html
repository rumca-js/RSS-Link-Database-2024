I hope everyone is doing great.</p> <p>I'm currently learning web scraping, and I heard that scraping mobile apps allows you to discover hidden APIs, which are often stable and don’t change frequently. I’m looking for a way to scrape mobile apps to find these APIs and test them for automation.</p> <p>For example, in a gym app where the owner posts images and videos, some videos may not be easily accessible. If I can get the API link to those videos, downloading them becomes much easier.</p> <p>Does anyone have any ideas on how to scrape mobile apps?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Opposite_Bowl_8781"> /u/Opposite_Bowl_8781 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fgjqpe/need_help_for_the_andriod_app_scraping/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fgjqpe/need_help_for_the_andriod_app_scraping/">[comments]&lt;/a</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
