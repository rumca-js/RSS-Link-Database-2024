She likes fair bit of crafty stuff but never miniature models, she knows I love warhammer and entertains me when I go on rants about cool things going on in the hobby. I started to laugh and just said "absolutely" currently searching for a space marine as it'll be slightly easier being bigger. She went out of her way to say "only if you have a spare or one you don't want" no matter what it's going to be one of the centerpiece for my display, just for her wanting to get involved and try with what I love, means the world and it'll be my most precious one.</p> <p>It's very lucky that we're getting married next year ðŸ˜‚</p> <p>Bit soppy but very meaningful day</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Noodle_Boi"> /u/The_Noodle_Boi </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="https:/</span></pre></div></body></html>
