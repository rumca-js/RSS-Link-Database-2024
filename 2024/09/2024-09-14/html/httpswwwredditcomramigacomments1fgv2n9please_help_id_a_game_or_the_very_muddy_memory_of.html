I can't remember many details about it, and not 100% it was even on the Amiga. I'd say I'm about 90% sure it was.</p> <p>All I remember is that it was a sidescroller and perhaps a shooter game. MAYBE a woman as the character or she was one of a few.</p> <p>The stage I remember was a kind-of forest or woodland, with conifer trees like cyprus trees or something.</p> <p>I remember the stage having quite a lot of verticality, so the screen moved up - sort-of like parallax?</p> <p>All else I remember was some kind of box or computer thing on the ground, not much bigger than the player character, and either on that box or somewhere near the word 'OZONE' or words 'OZONE LAYER'.</p> <p>I realise this is a long-shot perhaps but it occasionally pops into my head and I just want to put it to rest haha</p> <p>Cheers and I'd be fucking surprise</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
