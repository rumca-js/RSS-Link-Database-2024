When I connect to a different router and activate the VPN, I cannot access my services I host at home. The problem is that both routers use the same 192.168.1.x range.</p> <p>I use Nginx Proxy Manager with my own domain ("A" record pointing to internal address 192. ...) to access the services. I don't want (can't) change the settings on the new/old router, and I would prefer to avoid changing the device's settings (as the device is owned by someone who doesn't understand much about VPNs).</p> <p>What solutions do I have, so I can continue using my services locally on my network and also through the VPN with the IP conflict? A link to an article would be very appreciated, but I can also search it myself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MxxPuig"> /u/MxxPuig </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comm</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comm</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
