Has anyone installed single node OKD into proxmox? I have followed the documentation here: <a href="https://docs.okd.io/4.16/installing/installing_sno/install-sno-preparing-to-install-sno.html">https://docs.okd.io/4.16/installing/installing_sno/install-sno-preparing-to-install-sno.html</a></p> <p>I have openwrt as my router, and I have configured its dnsmasq to point apps.domain.com to the vm IP and hostname set by dns. </p> <p>I'm having an issue with certificates and it seems the install isn't proceeding because of that, I can't seem to get it working past that.</p> <p>Has anyone installed okd on their servers? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ddrjm"> /u/ddrjm </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/s</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/s</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
