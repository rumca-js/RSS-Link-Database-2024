The former won't work because client will cache the dns request, the latter can only be done by having access to the physical network infrastructure. </p> <p>Can anyone explain? thx.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Chillseashells"> /u/Chillseashells </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgey1g/cant_figure_out_how_load_balancer_is_not/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgey1g/cant_figure_out_how_l</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgey1g/cant_figure_out_how_l</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
