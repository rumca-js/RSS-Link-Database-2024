My mom and I have been playing Sorry! since I was a kid, and we've always disagreed about one rule: when you have pawns both on the track and in Start, and you draw a one or two, are you required to prioritize moving the pawn out of Start over moving a pawn already on the track (assuming both are not blocked and can accomplish the move)? All the rules sets I found online are all pretty vague about this; I have yet to find a rules explanation that specifically says "you DON'T have to prioritize moving a pawn out of Start" or something to that effect. Thanks in advance for any help</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/emanresu187"> /u/emanresu187 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fgyjg1/help_settle_a_3decade_old_debate_about_the_rules/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fgyjg1/help_sett</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fgyjg1/help_sett</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
