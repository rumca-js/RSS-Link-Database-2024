What is the best solution for this? I’m running proxmox with nginx proxy manager to create actual urls and get SSL. I’ve considered tailscale and wireguard and have also tried to set up a cloud flare tunnel with no success. (I was trying to tunnel to nginx and couldn’t get that working, haven’t tried with individual services yet.)</p> <p>Happy to provide any further information about my homelab.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/smoochii"> /u/smoochii </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgywom/best_option_to_get_access_to_vaultwarden/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgywom/best_option_to_get_access_to_vaultwarden/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
