I swear to God the thing was fully painted last night, came back to it today and it's like there's little chips missing on edges and such? </p> <p>Also where can I get some good IF transfers? </p> <p>Anyway, this has been a blast, can't wait to get the dice clickity clackin</p> </div>&lt;!-- </td></tr></table></pre></div></body></html>
