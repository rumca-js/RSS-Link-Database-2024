It's also smaller, lighter, and less expensive. This has been the case with every playstation console except PS5. </p> <p>This generation has seen prices stay the same or even increase in some areas (North America did not see a price increase for PS5 while other areas did). </p> <p>Controllers have also gotten more expensive and less reliable with every generation, starting with the Xbox 360 and PS3. I've gone through so many controllers over the years and I don't even game that much anymore. It's all more expensive but they break more easily. Games are also more expensive despite not really doing anything different than previous generations. Just more shiny.</p> <p>What gives? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GalacticShoestring"> /u/GalacticShoe</a></pre></div></body></html>
