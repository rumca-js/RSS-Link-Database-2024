On many Tvs you actually need to decrease color from 50 default value to 44. On mine it's 25 default had to decrease all the way down to 19. Turn off anything artificial like dynamic contrast, and don't use native color space as that ruins the intended picture developers want you to see. Always use a warm color temperature setting either Warm 1 or warm 2, the others are too cold looking and produce too much blues and improper pastey whites which isn't natural. </p> <p>I'm not forcing anything on anyone who prefer a saturated picture. It's your display and you get to do whatever you want with it. But for the majority of people who are looking for a solid real accurate picture, I highly doubt your seeing it right now.</p></div></pre></div></body></html>
