Can't find an official FAQ on rules so curious to know other people's opinions. </p> <ol> <li><p>Destination cards: Friend says that if you have used a destination card to claim a route of the same name, you must keep the card and can't burn it to claim another route of the same icon, different name later on. His stance was that you keep it to show you have that route.<br/> I disagreed with my view being that, why would I keep it permanently as "evidence" when, if I use a destination card to claim a route with a different name but the same icon, it's discarded and I can't "evidence" I used the card.<br/> He then said it makes the keeping/burning aspect pointless. You might as well claim whatever you like with via the icon rather than waiting for the correctly named card.</p></li></ol></div></pre></div></body></html>
