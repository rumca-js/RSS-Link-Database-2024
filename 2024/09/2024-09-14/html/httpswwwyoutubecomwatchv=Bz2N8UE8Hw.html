While it maintains a sumptuous art style and epic soundtrack, the combat is more beat 'em up focused while the goal is earning better loot.

As a newly-resurrected Ace, players take on missions from the Belfry to venture out into the ruined world and take on all threats, including Gobos, Merks, and everything in between. Players can choose from four classes, and upon exploring the map, they'll uncover bit by bit via clearing hex tiles.

Several current features, like combat, difficulty, loot, objective design, and narrative, need further polishing, even with some solid fundamentals. Nevertheless, the current vision, especially when playing alongside others, is intriguing and backed by some addictive gameplay. Even if the live service approach is worrying, I'm still curious how Towerborne will evolve as it enters PC early access.</pre></div></body></html>
