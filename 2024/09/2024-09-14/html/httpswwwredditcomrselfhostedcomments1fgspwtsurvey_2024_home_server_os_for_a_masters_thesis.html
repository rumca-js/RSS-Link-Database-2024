My study aims to evaluate how well an operating system meets the various needs of home server users, including data storage, media servers, virtualization, and more.</p> <p>I’ve created a short survey (just 3-5 minutes) to gather insights users like yourselves. Your responses will be invaluable in helping me better understand the practical applications.</p> <p>All answers are anonymous and will be used solely for academic purposes. I would greatly appreciate your participation and feedback.</p> <p>Thanks so much for your time and input!</p> <p>Here is the link (please delete the space before the dot): soscisurvey .de/heimserver2024/</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UnraidFollower"> /u/UnraidFollower </a> <br/> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/s</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/s</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
