I'd love to be able to run my own LLM that I can train using existing documents and related prompts/instructions. I'd like to be able to directly import PDFs but they could be OCR'd and copy pasted in if necessary. I've tooled around with LM Studio and some 7b models and was not very impressed but I was running it on less capable hardware and wasn't really trying to optimize it. Any suggestions on what to look into or consider?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/leadbread"> /u/leadbread </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgnbo5/best_selfhosted_ai_modelservice_for_technical/">[link]</a></span> <span>&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgnbo5/b</span>">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fgnbo5/b</span></a></pre></div></body></html>
