Teams like Canada and France will have a say in if that becomes the reality next year but, with the display put on at Twickenham on Saturday, you can see why many are speaking about the potential of a sixth World Cup final being contested between the two giants of women’s rugby.</p><p>An extremely physical match saw the Red Roses come out on top with the wing Abby Dow starring. Early on she put in two storming hits in defence, subsequently made some cracking breaks and finished off a phenomenal solo try. New Zealand also had impressive performances on display, in particular Ayesha Leti-I’iga who lit up the pitch whenever she received the ball. The wing was returning after almost two years away from international rugby because of injury.</p> &lt;a href="<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/spor">https://www.theguardian.com/spor</a></pre></div></body></html>
