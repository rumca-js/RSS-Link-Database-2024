I have 3 docker hosts and I wanted to add redundancy to NPM since it's a crucial part of the network. Right now I have a script that basically clears out the secondary and tertiary node data and then copies over the data from the primary node. Not the best solution but works for now since I don't add new entries very often to NPM. </p> <p>To learn more about databases and clustering in general I was trying to see if I could get NPM to work with MariaDB and then have HA configured with a galera cluster.
