The foundation is investigating the development of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) model for the Rust language, including the design and implementation for a PKI CA and a resilient Quorum model for the project to implement, and the report says that language updates suggested by members of the Project were nearly ready for implementation. 
Following the XZ backdoor vulnerability, the Security Initiative has focused on supply chain security, including work on provenance-tracking, verifying that a given crate is actually associated with the repository it claims to be. The top 5,000 crates by download count have been checked and verified. 
Threat modeling has now been completed on the Crates ecosystem. Rust Infrastructure, crates.io and the Rust Project.
