Deluxe or not ?</h1></a><div>https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss</div><div>2024-09-14 07:39:56+00:00</div><div><pre><!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>I'm wondering what are your criterias to decide to pledge a game on a crowdfunding platform. I'm currently thinking of getting three games but all three are very expensive (more than 100€): - Puerto Rico on gamefound - Râ on KS - Keep the heroes out, late pledge on Hive </p> <p>I looked into the gameplay of each and I'm pretty confident that I will like those games and I will be able to play them with my wife and/or kid's. But still I think it's a little bit odd to spend around 500€ in one month into games. Knowing that I already have around 10 games coming in the next 9~12months.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KaoMac-20"> /u/KaoMac-20 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fggw08/pledge_or_not_deluxe_or_not/">[link]</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fggw08/pledge_or_not_deluxe_or_not/">[comments]</a></span></pre></div></body></html>
