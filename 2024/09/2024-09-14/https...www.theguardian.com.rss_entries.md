<ul><li>USA 10-6 Europe</li><li>Home side need four and a half points to win Solheim Cup</li></ul><p>On a Saturday evening at Medinah in 2012, Europe’s male golfers discovered their pulse. A seemingly unassailable 10-4 deficit became 10-6 by close of play. Everyone knows what happened next, as Europe turned the tables on an epic Sunday against the US.</p><p>For Sergio García, Luke Donald, Ian Poulter and Rory McIlroy, read Carlota Ciganda, Emily Pedersen, Charley Hull and Georgia Hall. Victories for two European fourball pairings has provided faint hope of retaining the Solheim Cup in Virginia. The US need four and a half singles points for victory. The ghost of Medinah means Stacy Lewis and her home team will not be celebrating quite yet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/14/europe-looking-for-minor-miracle-as-usa-maintain-advantage">Continue reading...</a>

As the Chelsea soap opera takes its latest plot twist, it turning out this club ain’t big enough for two billionaire egos, Maresca’s team put in a performance just as dysfunctional as goings-on in the boardroom. And yet Christopher Nkunku’s late strike stole the points.</p><p>Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth, as well-coached and energetic a team as can be found in the Premier League had the better chances, and played much the more progressive football. But a game that might be best recalled for an inordinate amount of yellow cards would not fall to the Basque’s team despite many a near-miss. Instead, the Frenchman, shaking off Bournemouth defenders, bundled home a winner that really should have been beyond a malfunctioning Chelsea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/14/bournemouth-chelsea-premier-leagu

<p>More goals are being scored from inside the box because of better pitches and shifts in tactical thinking</p><p>Last season, only 11.5% of goals scored in the Premier League came from outside the penalty area, the lowest figure Opta has recorded since the Premiership broke away from the Football League in 1992. That’s not a one-off: there have been fluctuations but the general trend over the past two decades has been a decline in the proportion of goals scored from long range. Which raises the obvious question of why? Is this the most clearcut evidence of the impact of data on football?</p><p>Its exact impact on how football is actually played at the highest level is difficult to measure, not least because clubs are so keen to obfuscate any advantage they do derive from analysis to preserve their competitive advantage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2024/sep/14/scorcher-scarcity-is-not-datas-fault-players-are-passing-more-and-shooting-less">Continue reading.

<p>Singer’s backing could sway undecided voters in key states, but Tay Tay should beware – political endorsement can backfire</p><p>Will Taylor Swift’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/11/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement-instagram-post">recent endorsement</a> of Kamala Harris affect the US presidential election? It certainly can. I’ve been a researcher of celebrity involvement in American politics for several years. The research shows that for most American voters a celebrity endorsement won’t make a difference. Voters have strong partisan allegiances and very few Americans are in the undecided category. Recent polling from YouGov suggest that about 5% of Americans are undecided between Trump and Harris. However, these 5% can be the difference between winning and losing. The same YouGov poll shows <a href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econTabReport_k1paNHZ.pdf">Trump and Harris tied at 45% each</a>.</p><p>The research I have seen sug

<p>While Netflix’s show takes aim at the 1%, the top 10% of earners also hoard opportunities on a mass scale</p><p>It’s hard to satirise the super-rich. Not that we don’t enjoy trying. The most recent attempt – <em>The Perfect Couple</em>, a murder mystery starring Nicole Kidman set around a mansion in Nantucket, has been at the UK’s top spot on Netflix since it came out last week. <em>The White Lotus</em> is to return for a third season; <em>Glass Onion, </em><em>Triangle of Sadness,</em><em> </em><em>The Undoing</em> and <em>Big Little Lies</em> were all runaway hits.</p><p>These satires are curious things, though, all of the same pattern. They don’t focus much, for example, on where the money has come from.

<p>Since the mid-2000s, enigmatic French artist JR has been bringing large-scale photographic projects to cityscapes around the world. His public installations range from trompe l’œil optical illusions to series raising awareness about the plight of refugees, foregrounding the experience of marginalised or oppressed communities. His work has been collated in a far-reaching monograph, originally published in 2015, with a revised edition including 140 new images and a foreword by film-maker George Lucas. “I take photos of people, of places,” says JR in the book. “And I paste them on trains, on floors, on walls, on buildings, houses. Sometimes I even have people carry them. What really matters is to make the stories travel; I see my work as a message in a bottle thrown in the ocean. I never really know where it will go.”</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.phaidon.com/store/art/jr-can-art-change-the-world-9781838668570/">JR: Can Art Change the World? is published on 26 September (Phaidon, £3

Located right in the centre of the bitter turf war between the ­historic rivals Arsenal and Tottenham, even on a sunny Friday lunchtime its leafy parks and terrace-lined streets drip with menace. Take a wrong turn, or catch the wrong eye, and nobody can really say what will happen next. A King Charles spaniel yowls ferally on the approach to Clissold Park. The blood on the pavement outside the bakery turns out, on closer inspection, to be jam from a doughnut.</p><p>Such is the omertà around this 111-year feud, which resumes on Sunday afternoon at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, that local business owners feign impartiality or even ignorance of the forthcoming fixture, presumably wary of reprisals from rival fans. “Is it Spurs v Arsenal this weekend?” says a woman

Four games into the season Ten Hag appeared embattled but after an awkward opening half hour, well-taken goals by Matthijs de Ligt and Marcus Rashford allowed United to runaway with things with victory with uncharacteristic ease. The substitute Alejandro Garnacho capped the scoring in style, lashing United’s third into the net in the 96th minute.</p><p>Southampton did not muster a shot on goal from the moment Cameron Archer’s rebound from a 33rd-minute missed penalty ended up in the gloves of André Onana and, to make matters worse for the Saints, Jack Stephens was shown a straight red card for a high challenge on Garnacho.

<p>Caring for your infant can be magical and mind-expanding, but it’s labour too. We all need respite from the rat race </p><p>Maternity leave is not a holiday. It is not a break, a sabbatical, a retreat, a period of respite. It is not “checking out”, time off, a gap year, a lull, a hiatus, or a breather. It is not “<a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a60715854/non-maternity-year-childfree/">a stop-off</a> on the side of the road during life’s long journey”.</p><p>Maternity leave is a legally mandated and protected period of time given to a mother to recover from the physical ordeal of childbirth (if she has given birth), care for and bond with her baby. It is not even, for many women, a “career break”, because if you work freelance, have your own business, work casually, are the higher earner, have a partner who takes the bulk of the leave, or work in a career where there is pressure to return, you may not take very long at all.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardia

When I say tiny, Moore’s chihuahua, Pilaf, is a thing unimaginable until you see her. Thimble small. How-is-that-even-a- dog small. Moore is overseeing an introduction to Bruno, a puppy belonging to one of the comms team I’d met earlier and who was, until Pilaf, the smallest dog I’d seen. Bruno now looks like the Hulk.
