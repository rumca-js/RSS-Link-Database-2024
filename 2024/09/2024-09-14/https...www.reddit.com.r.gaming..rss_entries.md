## I just realized that the PS5 did not get a price cut. The slim model costs the same as the base model 4 years ago.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For like 30 years now, the slim model redesign of a playstation usually means the console is quieter, cooler, and runs on less power. It&#39;s also smaller, lighter, and less expensive. This has been the case with every playstation console except PS5. </p> <p>This generation has seen prices stay the same or even increase in some areas (North America did not see a price increase for PS5 while other areas did). </p> <p>Controllers have also gotten more expensive and less reliable with every generation, starting with the Xbox 360 and PS3. I&#39;ve gone through so many controllers over the years and I don&#39;t even game that much anymore. It&#39;s all more expensive but they break more easily. Games are also more expensive despite not really doing anything different than previous generations. Just more shiny.</p> <p>What gives? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GalacticShoestring"> /u/GalacticShoe

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>You ever play a video game and get disappointed on the colors not fitting it&#39;s dark theme or setting? well that&#39;s because you haven&#39;t calibrated your tv/monitor for games especially reducing the color value. On many Tvs you actually need to decrease color from 50 default value to 44. On mine it&#39;s 25 default had to decrease all the way down to 19. Turn off anything artificial like dynamic contrast, and don&#39;t use native color space as that ruins the intended picture developers want you to see. Always use a warm color temperature setting either Warm 1 or warm 2, the others are too cold looking and produce too much blues and improper pastey whites which isn&#39;t natural. </p> <p>I&#39;m not forcing anything on anyone who prefer a saturated picture. It&#39;s your display and you get to do whatever you want with it. But for the majority of people who are looking for a solid real accurate picture, I highly doubt your seeing it right now.
