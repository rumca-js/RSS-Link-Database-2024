My mom and I have been playing Sorry! since I was a kid, and we&#39;ve always disagreed about one rule: when you have pawns both on the track and in Start, and you draw a one or two, are you required to prioritize moving the pawn out of Start over moving a pawn already on the track (assuming both are not blocked and can accomplish the move)? All the rules sets I found online are all pretty vague about this; I have yet to find a rules explanation that specifically says &quot;you DON&#39;T have to prioritize moving a pawn out of Start&quot; or something to that effect.

I have doubts on which game buy: in one hand I saw Sword &amp; Sorcery and call my attention by its complexity but in the other hand I saw the dungeons and dragons Board Game, either Wrath of Asharladon and The Legend of Drizzt. The thing is The DnD I see its more simple but I think its the best option for my groups of friends that they like mid complex games.
