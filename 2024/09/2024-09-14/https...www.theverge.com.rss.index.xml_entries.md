  <p id="eoosHh">The iPhone 16 lineup has 8GB of RAM, from the base model to the 16 Pro Max, and it’s all thanks to Apple Intelligence. Apple VP of hardware tech Johny Srouji confirmed as much in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmsNxBkemp0">interview with Geekerwan</a>, published yesterday, that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/13/iphone-16-ram-apple-intelligence/"><em>9to5Mac</em> spotted</a>. </p>
<p id="yRDnJ7">Srouji explained in the interview that “DRAM is one aspect” when it comes to deciding hardware characteristics needed for Apple Intelligence, saying that the feature “led us to believe we need to get to 8GB.” He added that the extra RAM would also “help immensely” for tas

  <p id="tnxtga">JD Vance’s appearance at the <em>All-In</em> Summit was easily the most comfortable I’ve seen him, but then he was with the people he understands best: other VCs.</p>
<p id="yQw90z">The <em>All-In</em> podcast appearance was what business leaders refer to as a display of synergy. Cohost David Sacks’ and Vance’s political fortunes are tied together — if Trump wins, Sacks looks like a kingmaker and has a vice president who owes him favors and will take his calls. If Vance loses, remaining close to his <em>real</em> community — venture capitalists — gives him a valuable network to tap into for future campaigns.</p>
