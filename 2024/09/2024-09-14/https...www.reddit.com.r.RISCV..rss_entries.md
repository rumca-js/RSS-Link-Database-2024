<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Flanders (in Belgium) has an initiative to give every high school student a laptop that they can use during their studies. There have been some problems with it ( <a href="https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2023/12/12/digisprong-tekort-aan-laptops-op-school/">https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2023/12/12/digisprong-tekort-aan-laptops-op-school/</a> ): some schools forced students to buy expensive laptops and put an additional charge on the school&#39;s bill. The laptops should last 4 years and then be renewed. So my question is not about this period (where they have already bought laptops) but already thinking about next time.</p> <p>They have 510 euros per student for a laptop. I thought that was rather high considering that in principle students mostly need to be able to browse the internet, use some text processing/markup tool and use some spreadsheets for calculations. But okay, google earth might also be handy, and a few students will learn some CAD-tools du

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m troubleshooting an issue with <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc">mimalloc</a> on riscv64. One of mimalloc&#39;s tricks to improve performance on a 64-bit system is to give mmap a page-aligned hint in a part of the virtual address space that is unlikely to be in use. At the moment, it&#39;s using the 2TiB+ range for this. But on a RISC-V system with an <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/arch/riscv/vm-layout.html">SV39 MMU</a>, the 2TiB range is unusable.</p> <p>This causes mmap to pick a different address, one that is likely <em>not</em> aligned, and that triggers a fallback in mimalloc. This wastes time on (almost) every allocation, so it&#39;s counterproductive.</p> <p>My question is: is there a reliable way to determine the size of the usable virtual address space at either build- or run-time? Basically it&#39;d be nice to have a special case for SV39 that either uses a different range, or at least doesn&#39;t waste
