<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>stto: a simple line of code counter (like tokei, scc, gocloc etc.) written in go.</p> <p>Recently ran on a local codebase with over 70k files scattered over 19k subdirectories, tokei took 1 minute 52 seconds to provide output whereas stto took just 6 seconds. Though stto is no way near a more established option like tokei, but it managed to outperform tokei due to its concurrent file reading.</p> <p>Have a look at the repo: <a href="https://github.com/mainak55512/stto">https://github.com/mainak55512/stto</a></p> <p>** Stars, pull and forks on github are greatly appreciated 👍</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mainak1224x"> /u/Mainak1224x </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qb3WLqT3A6Zi3yu82Uj_BfDB7kbjlREY/view?usp=drivesdk">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1f7tody/stto_repost/">[comments]</a></span>
