<p>Sony announced this morning that the game would be taken offline on September 6, and said it will issue refunds to the few people who chose to buy it. The team-based shooter was one of a scant few new first-party PlayStation games scheduled for release this year.

## Instagram Stories are getting comments

<p>Instagram is rolling out comments for Stories. Previously, the short-lived Stories could only be replied to in direct messages. This new feature offers a more visible way for users to interact with their friends' posts. The original poster will not receive the comments in a DM; a rep from Meta said that "comments live only on your Story."</p>
<p>Story comments can be turned on or off for any individual post. If enabled, comments can be seen by anyone following an account, but only mutuals can leave comments. As with the Story post type, the comments will disappear after 24 hours. Small profile images of the commenters will appear at the bottom of a person's Story icon, so you'll know there are comments attached before you tap to view the post.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>People can still choose to respond to Stories with a DM if the user has their account set to accept those messages. There's also an option to send a DM in response to a Story comment, which you can

The desktop device allows you to set up all manner of commands and shortcuts that you can trigger with the press of a button.

<p>We’re used to hearing about new Android versions during Google Pixel smartphone launch events, but Android 15’s source code is finally out at the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://source.android.com/">Android Open Source Project</a>. It was strangely missing from the Google Pixel launch event last month, but it’s better late than never.

<p>Android 15 will be available on select Pixel models soon. Some devices from Samsung, Honor, iQOO, Lenovo, Motorola, Nothing, OnePlus, Oppo, realme, Sharp, Sony, Tecno, vivo and Xiaomi will receive support in the coming months. Some of the more interesting features are smart volume adjustment and dynamic range compression for apps with AAC audio content containing loudness metadata.

<p>Growing up. It’s something we all do, and devices do too. While there’s been very little innovation in mainstream smartphones lately, foldable phones have been maturing over the last few years and finally seem to be coming into their own. It’s like they’re in the young adult phase of their lives, while the conventional “candybar” handset has largely been figured out. At least, on the outside, anyway.</p> 
<p>If foldables are the products, then companies like Samsung and Google are the parents, and each of those two has taken a different approach. Samsung has been more experimental, letting its baby flail around in the playground, falling off swings and cracking its face. Google appears to have been more careful, perhaps sheltering its product before releasing it for the first time last year. And let’s not talk about the elephant in (or missing from) the room — Apple is probably waiting till its foldable is mature enough to skip straight to high school before exposing it to the worl

<p>While you can do pretty much anything on your phone or tablet, sometimes having a dedicated device is the way to go. Opting for an ereader can help reduce eye strain compared with looking at a smartphone screen for hours on end. The battery will last longer too, and you won't have notifications popping up to distract you. So if you're someone who reads digital books and hasn't picked up an ereader yet (or you're tired of lugging around bulky paperbacks), it's worth considering Amazon's entry-level Kindle.</p>

The release explains that Clearview created &quot;an illegal database with billions of photos of faces,&quot; including Dutch individuals, and has failed to properly inform people that it&#39;s using their data. In early 2023, Clearview&#39;s CEO claimed the company had <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/clearview-ceo-claims-companys-database-of-scraped-images-is-now-30-billion-strong-174921576.html">30 billion images</a>.&nbsp;</p>

In an <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/hopoogames/status/1830763153942290516">announcement</a> on X/Twitter, the company has announced that its co-founders Paul Morse and Duncan Drummond, &quot;alongside many other talented members at Hopoo Games,&quot; will now be working for Valve. The company is stopping the production of an unannounced game called <em>Snail</em> as a result, and it&#39;s not quite clear if it will ever pick up from where it left off in the future. Hopoo also didn&#39;t say how many of its staff members are joining Valve and how many chose to leave or had been left out of the deal.  &quot;...[F]or now — sleep tight, Hopoo Games,&quot; one of the company&#39;s tweets reads.&nbsp;</p>

Yet, Hewlett-Packard is continuing its UK lawsuit, seeking up to $4 billion in damages —&nbsp;just against his estate instead. In a statement, HP said it intended &quot;to follow the proceedings through to their conclusion.&quot;</p>
<p>Lynch and HP have been at odds since the entrepreneur sold his company, Autonomy, to HP <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-11-30-autonomy-ceo-talks-about-hps-future-promises-really-stunning.html">for $11 billion in 2011</a>. One year later, a new management team at HP valued the company at only $8.8 billion and accused Lynch of inflating sales, accounting improprieties and misleading HP overall. In June, a US jury found Lynch not guilty on all 15 counts of fraud.&n

<p>No stranger to heady prices, Bang &amp; Olufsen is taking its high-end design (and price multiplier) to headphones with the Beoplay H100. Following the $999 Beoplay H95, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bang-and-olufsen-debuts-beoplay-h100-headphones-that-cost-1549-070041891.html"><ins>the H100 is over 50 percent more expensive, at $1,549</ins></a>.</p>
<p>In B&amp;O tradition, the Beoplay H100 is made of premium materials, with lambskin leather pads and a scratch-resistant glass touch interface on the outside of the ear cups. The company says it was inspired by fine jewelry for the black, sand and apricot color options. B&amp;O says it doubled the active noise cancellation (ANC) performance of the H95 for this set, with 10 microphones to help offer an improved transparency mode.</p>
<p>The company says the H95 has been its “most successful headphones to date,” but it didn’t specify whether that was units sold or sheer insane profit margin
