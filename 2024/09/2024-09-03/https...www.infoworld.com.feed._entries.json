Initial expectations were high with the launch of Amazon S3 in 2006 and similar services. Providers promised the ability to migrate workloads across different service providers seamlessly. Oh, what a lovely world it would be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The services suggested a future where enterprises could effortlessly switch to providers that offered better pricing or enhanced capabilities. Despite the initial excitement surrounding the public cloud model being \u201cas a service\u201d and \u201con demand,\u201d true portability has proven elusive and costly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/2254128/is-clou", "id": 1072731, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3500969/cloud-application-portability-remains-unrealistic.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.infoworld.com/feed/", "source_obj__id": 468, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Cloud application portability remains unrealistic", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-03T08:30:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"remove_no_follow\">\n\t\t<div class=\"grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"article-column__content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>All IT projects go through phases and <a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html\">generative AI</a> is no different in that respect. Initial pilot projects are used to test out how technology or software works, and determine whether you get the results that you want to achieve or what the vendor or developer promised. Once these pilot phases are complete, it is time to scale. However, while you might think that scaling up new projects will simply involve deploying more resources, the challenge is that you can find yourself encountering new problems. For generative AI, these scaling issues can be very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IT ", "id": 1072442, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3493255/dealing-with-day-two-issues-in-generative-ai-deployments.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.infoworld.com/feed/", "source_obj__id": 468, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Dealing with \u2018day two\u2019 issues in generative AI deployments", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
