<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So my family has been hitting me up for commissions lately. The usual 3d printing requests, or &quot;I need 20 custom models for an event at work&quot; or &quot;I need this plastic part replaced on my car&quot; my usual fee is a roll of whatever filament I&#39;ll be using plus what they feel like paying me for the design, if I need to design something for it. </p> <p>My problem is I usually buy the lowest price cheap as shit filament, except when I&#39;m printing a commission, so up until recently all my rolls came in vacuum bags that were <em>not</em> resealable. I have stabbed through four nice mylar bags at this point. Every time, I inspect the bag first, and every time I can&#39;t find the zipper until after I&#39;ve stabbed the damn thing. I swear they&#39;re growing zippers after I stab them. I&#39;m mostly irritated because I have plenty of use cases for airtight mylar bags, and ever bag I have, has a giant hole right through the center. </p> <
