<p>Intel’s plunging stock price, which as of noon New York time on Tuesday was the lowest it has been since 2010, could cost the chip giant its coveted spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).</p>



<p>It comes at a very difficult time for Intel, as it is trying to maintain its enterprise relevance in the face of more effective generative artificial intelligence (genAI) campaigns from the likes of Nvidia.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/intels-dow-status-under-threat-struggling-chipmakers-shares-plunge-2024-09-03/">Reuters reported</a> that Intel, which was the second technology company to join the DJIA in the late 1990s, was “likely to be removed from the Dow” becaus

<p>In another interesting move that hints at a symbiotic relationship, ChatGPT maker OpenAI has reportedly followed Apple to <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/12926/8200070?from=edn_subcatelist_cate">become a lead customer for TSMC processors</a>. Given the industry lead Apple has achieved with Apple Silicon, the move could be seen as tacit enthusiasm, rather than symbiosis, but follows reports <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3499138/apple-might-take-a-stake-in-openai-as-it-gets-intelligent-on-ai.html">Apple might stake an investment in OpenAI</a>.</p>

<p>The European Semiconductor Industry Association (ESIA) has urged the European Union to expedite financial support, develop a revised “Chips Act 2.0” package, and appoint a dedicated envoy to advocate for the semiconductor sector.</p>



<p>In a statement, the organization emphasized the need for policies that prioritize competitiveness, enabling the sector to expand and invest further in Europe.</p>



<p>“The adoption of the [current] EU Chips Act has been a fundamental building block,” ESIA said in the statement. “Its implementation and further development will be decisive for the EU’s success in championing the global race for technology leadership. To not lose momentum, ESIA advocates for an

<p>Multinational consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) expects to spend billions of dollars to build out its use of artificial intelligence (AI) and focus more of its client services on the technology.</p>

<p>The Windows 11 2023 Update has been released, but behind the scenes, Microsoft is constantly working to improve the newest version of Windows. The company frequently rolls out public preview builds to members of its Windows Insider Program, allowing them to test out — and even help shape — upcoming features.</p>



<p><a href="#latestbuilds"><em>Skip to the builds</em></a></p>



<p>The Windows Insider program is divided into four channels:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>Canary Channel</strong> is where platform changes (such as major updates to the Windows kernel and new APIs) are previewed. These changes are not tied to a particular Windows release and may never ship at all. Little documentation

<p>China’s sophistication in some of its chip technology is approaching three years behind that of top chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. (TSMC) despite the best efforts by the US to delay advancements through a broad strategy of <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1630648/china-bans-export-of-metals-needed-for-semiconductors-amid-us-china-chip-war.html">trade restrictions</a>.</p>



<p>Analysis done by a Tokyo-based company called TechanaLye found a processor from a new Huawei smartphone released in April rivals TSMC chips in processing capability, according to the findings <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/China-s-chip-capabilities-just-3-years
