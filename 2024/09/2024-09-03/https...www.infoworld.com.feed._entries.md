<p>NoSQL document-oriented database provider Couchbase is adding columnar support to its managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS), Capella, on AWS.</p>



<p>Here columnar support refers to the columnar database management system, which is typically <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2260280/what-is-nosql-databases-for-a-cloud-scale-future.html">NoSQL</a> in nature and is implemented for complex analytical tasks and queries.</p>



<p>In contrast to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2164252/relational-database-as-a-service.html">relational databases</a>, columnar databases or database management systems store data in columns instead of rows. This is done in order to reduce storage cos

<p>Cloud portability once seemed like a groundbreaking advancement in the digital infrastructure landscape. Initial expectations were high with the launch of Amazon S3 in 2006 and similar services. Providers promised the ability to migrate workloads across different service providers seamlessly. Oh, what a lovely world it would be.</p>



<p>The services suggested a future where enterprises could effortlessly switch to providers that offered better pricing or enhanced capabilities. Despite the initial excitement surrounding the public cloud model being “as a service” and “on demand,” true portability has proven elusive and costly.</p>

<p>All IT projects go through phases and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a> is no different in that respect. Initial pilot projects are used to test out how technology or software works, and determine whether you get the results that you want to achieve or what the vendor or developer promised. Once these pilot phases are complete, it is time to scale. However, while you might think that scaling up new projects will simply involve deploying more resources, the challenge is that you can find yourself encountering new problems. For generative AI, these scaling issues can be very different.</p>
