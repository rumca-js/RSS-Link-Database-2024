<p>Scientists at the SLAC-Stanford Battery Center have discovered a way to significantly increase the durability and lifespan of rechargeable batteries. In their research paper, which was <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/abstract/S2542-4351(24)00353-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2542435124003532%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">published in the French journal <em>Joule</em></a>, they explain how this new process works.</p>

<p>In this study, lithium-ion batteries were given high-formation charge currents immediately after production in order to test what effect this would have on the service life of the batteries.</p>



<p>The result? Battery cycle life was extended by an average of 50 percent, with some extende
