<p>MSI is hoping that you aren’t yet tired of hearing about “AI” in consumer PCs, as the company’s lineup of high-end laptops and monitors at the German trade show IFA is jam-packed with artificial alleged-intelligence.</p>



<p>Most of it includes the usual bumps up to the latest processors, but a few products caught my eye — like a wacky desktop PC with a huge built-in screen for its dedicated AI-powered chatbot.</p>

<p>The MSI MEG Vision X AI is a desktop PC that’s truly thicc. It’s filled with the latest parts, of course, built around either an AMD Ryzen 9000 or Intel Arrow Lake CPU, with your choice of Nvidia or AMD graphics card. But none of that is what’s giving this desktop PC its bulk.</p>

<p>One of the problems with AI apps that run locally on the PC…is a lack of apps that run locally on the PC. To solve that problem, Intel released <a href="https://game.intel.com/us/stories/introducing-ai-playground/">AI Playground</a>, a one-stop shop to run apps specifically on a Core Ultra.</p>



<p>Dan Rogers, who runs Intel’s client performance marketing lab, highlighted the app at Intel’s Berlin launch of its Core Ultra Series 2 or<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2444869/lunar-lake-unveiled-intel-strikes-back-with-new-laptop-cpus.html"> “Lunar Lake” processor</a>. which now has enough TOPS to qualify as a Copilot+ PC. </p>

<p>Today, Dell announced the latest iteration of its XPS 13 laptop. Not only is it ridiculously lightweight at just 2.6 pounds, but it also boasts the latest Lunar Lake processor from Intel. And that’s just the start of it.</p>



<p>Dell’s XPS line of laptops are known for their premium feel and eye-catching (usually minimalistic) design, so much so that they stand in well as MacBook alternatives. The newest model follows much of the same design blueprint as its predecessors, but this one’s more AI-focused.</p>

<p>If you’re wondering <em>why</em> you need Intel’s latest Core Ultra laptop processors, code-named Lunar Lake, the answer isn’t a simple one. But if you want to <em>buy</em> a Lunar Lake laptop, however, you’ll probably understand the differences between the various chips almost immediately.</p>



<p>Intel unveiled what it’s calling the Core Ultra Series 2 at a launch event in Berlin on Tuesday. In total, there are nine new Lunar Lake processors, which will begin shipping inside laptops from PC makers like Acer, Asus, HP, and Lenovo very soon: September 24. Preorders begin now. </p>

<p>Tech YouTuber Roman Hartung (aka “der8auer”) just pointed out in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uXBOCO5yng">one of his recent videos</a> that elaborate CPU fakes are currently in circulation, and he personally came across a counterfeit AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D that looks deceptively real if you aren’t looking closely.</p>



<p>Hartung acquired the CPU from one of his viewers, who contacted him directly about it. The CPU was originally purchased on OLX, an online marketplace that’s comparable to platforms like Facebook Marketplace, for about €300 (a nice discount off the CPU’s normal €400).</p>



<p>After the viewer had installed the CPU in his PC, it didn’t start — so it was obvious that there was something wrong with the CPU. Upon closer inspection, the CPU turned out to be a fake.</p>

<p>Excel responds to certain letter and number entries with automatic formatting.<strong> </strong>This makes sense in most cases, but sometimes it can be very annoying, as the user then has to switch back to the desired formatting via <strong>Start > Format > Format cells</strong>. Thankfully, Excel now includes a number of options that you can use to deactivate the unwanted automatic functions. </p>

<p>A lot of PC users aren’t keen to transition to Windows 11, and gamers seem to be one of the biggest groups of holdouts. But <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">according to the latest Steam survey results</a>, more Steam players are now using Windows 11 than any other operating system.</p>



<p>Specifically, 49.17 percent of the installed Steam user base is on Windows 11 versus 47.09 percent for Windows 10 (as of August 2024). All versions of Windows combine for almost 97 percent of the market, with Linux installations (presumably including SteamOS on the Steam Deck) accounting for 1.92 percent and macOS trailing at 1.3 percent.</p>

<p>It achieves this in a number of ways, including independent multi-hop routing of all connections, decentralized blockchain technology, anonymous payments, open-source code, among other things.</p>



<p>At signup, NymVPN uses what’s known as zero-knowledge identity verification technology to allow users to register for the service without ever disclosing any personal information. Essentially, a Nym blockchain issuing authority provides you with anonymous credentials that you can then use to redeem for service usage.</p>

<p>Not long ago, I tackled the long-overdue tech project of cleaning out my computer’s “Pictures” folder. It had grown ever more unwieldy after years of backing up my phone’s photos and dumping the contents of my DSLR’s memory cards, so I decided it was finally time to eliminate duplicate photos, blurry shots, useless screengrabs, and other assorted detritus. That allowed me to sort the remaining contents into albums without much hassle.</p>



<p>Why did my Pictures folder get so messy? Mostly, I blame Google Photos, which makes searching through old pictures so easy that I was content to just ignore my hard drive’s backup folder, knowing that it existed mainly for safekeeping.</p>



<p>But when unlimited Google Photos <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394607/5-things-to-do-before-google-data-cap-hits-june-1.html">went away</a>, I decided it was time

<p>It’s the same thing every vacation: The photo collection grows and grows and grows, with dozens of photos being added every day. The easiest way to back up your photos is via cloud storage; you can then store them in Apple’s iCloud, on Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or in the online storage of a third-party provider. </p>



<p>However, this is only a temporary solution, because after your vacation you should review the pictures on your home PC, sort out duplicates and unsuccessful ones, and edit the others if necessary. If you only have the limited data quota of free storage available, you will have to move files saved online to your PC from time to time anyway and archive them there.</p>
