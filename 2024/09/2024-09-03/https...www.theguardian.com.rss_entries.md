Nearly 12 months since the Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, bullishly said that English rugby was “on the cusp of something spectacular” the time has arrived to demonstrate why. The much vaunted Professional Game Partnership is set to be unveiled, the agreement that governs how club and country coexist and cooperate, but amid the triumphalism we can expect at Twickenham on Wednesday, there is trepidation too.</p><p>These eight-year agreements are not easy to formulate but that said, progress has been painstaking of late. There is a degree of cynicism from within the Premiership that it has taken until a few weeks before the season begins for clarity to emerge, and concerns that negotiations with players over their enhanced contracts have hit roadblocks along the way. “Slow, slow” was how E

<p><strong>Venice film festival</strong><br>Dastardly deeds are afoot in an imagined medieval village with unscrupulous landowners in this directionless study of inauthenticity </p><p>Hopes were high at Venice for this film, the English-language debut for the formidably talented Greek New Wave director Athina Rachel Tsangari, based on the novel by Jim Crace. Sadly, it’s a tiresome folk non-horror set in a quaintly imagined medieval village on the Scots-Mummerset border with plenty of golden-hour landscape shots and dreamy insect closeups: a pastiche bucolic non-place with rural-effect activities.<br><br>
 These are smudgy-faced folk preparing for the titular harvest sporting various funny hats and Dionysiac masks and the children are forced at a certain age to ritually hit their heads against a local rock to learn not to get above themselves and learn never to leave the district – an entirely preposterous tradition which takes us very close to Lars von Trier territory.<br><br>

<p>Juliette Gariépy’s disquieting performance overcomes the more unbelievable elements of this tale of snuff-movie murder rooms</p><p>A lead performance of pure sociopathic intensity is what makes this serial-killer horror stand out. It is a movie which never shows the horrific violence on screen and prefers to stay largely within the rhetorical limits of courtroom procedural, though with a shiver of revulsion that could put you in mind of Cronenberg or Refn. Canadian film-maker Pascale Plante writes and directs, and relative newcomer Juliette Gariépy is genuinely unsettling as Kelly-Anne, a fashion model who has become obsessed with the ongoing trial of an alleged serial killer (Maxwell McCabe-Locas). Nicknamed the Demon of Rosemont, he is accused of kidnapping and torturing three teenage girls in a so-called “red room”, an urban-mythic place on the dark web where livestreamed snuff porn can supposedly be watched in exchange for cryptocurrency payment.</p><p>Kelly-Anne camps out all

<p>We can now endlessly outsource our small tasks, from shopping to DIY. But I really would rather do them myself</p><p>A few months ago I saw an excellent fight at my local jeweller. The owners, as well as much of the clientele, are big characters. Spats often break out. This time a customer demanded a written statement that the necklace she had brought in would be stored in a safe. The jeweller told her they don’t provide this, and so the customer grew irate. “You don’t trust me, is that it?” said the jeweller. The woman protested: she did! The jeweller had been highly recommended. “So you know who you’re dealing with then,” said the jeweller, proudly. The woman handed over her necklace.</p><p>It was a brilliant spectacle. I wanted to cheer. Instead I asked to see the gold chains (I like the ceremony of seeing them displayed on a velvet cushion).

<p>‘Outstanding, ‘good’, ‘requires improvement’ … none of the labels meant what they were supposed to. But so much depended on them</p><p>Ofsted’s one-word ranking system for schools won’t be missed, because it never made sense: “outstanding” couldn’t possibly mean “outstanding”, because anything less than that meant “not good enough”. You could call it Orwellian, but that would suggest it was merely a simplification of existing language; it was more of a system of anti-meaning, where “outstanding” meant “fine”, “good” meant “rubbish”, “requires improvement” meant “run by idiots” and “inadequate” meant “poses an active danger to children”.</p><p>Teachers, being teachers, broadly knew what the words meant and had been saying this for years. Politicians and the media tended to write that off as the cavilling of slackers who didn’t like to be held accountable, because if there is one thing both sectors understand, it’s that slackers don’t like to be held accountable.</p> <a href="https:/

While Futura has reached the heights of his chosen medium, now boasting high-level collaborations with the likes of Virgil Abloh, Uniqlo and Nike, he spent years struggling to break into the art world and build a name for himself. His exhibition, Breaking Out, represents a new milestone and an achievement of validation from the New York art world that has long proved elusive to him.</p><p>The artist first began creating work in the early 1970s as a part of the graffiti scene that was flourishing in his home borough of Brooklyn.

It’s about the plight of carers, beginning straightforwardly enough in social realist mode with frazzled full-time carer Sadie (Shian Denovan) and her disabled sister Emily (Meg Fozzard) struggling to get by.

<p>It disconnected my mobile number and I was left without it for nearly a month</p><p><strong>When O2 transferred my pay-as-you-go phone service to a pay-monthly contract, an agent wrongly deactivated the number. It says the number will be given away to another customer if they can’t fix the issue within 30 days. I’ve had the number for more than 20 years, since I was 13.
