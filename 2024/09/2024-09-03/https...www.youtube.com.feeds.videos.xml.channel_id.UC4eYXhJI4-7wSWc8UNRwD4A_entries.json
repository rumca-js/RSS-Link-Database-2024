Sounds perfect, right? But when we tried to find a place to record Jonathan Scales\u2019 steelpans, the landscape actually presented a challenge.\n\nScales\u2019 instruments were once authentic oil barrels that were pounded, finished and tuned just for the Fourchestra.

Our team spent a lot of time trying to find a shady spot to capture this Field Recording and we finally found a nook protected by a strand of Aspen trees. \n\nJonathan Scales Fourchestra has been performing for 17 years, and in the process he\u2019s established the steelpans as a signature jazz instrument.
