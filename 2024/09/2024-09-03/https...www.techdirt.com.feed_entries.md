Well, here&#8217;s a not-so-fun new twist in the search-and-seizure narrative. Car owners are being deprived of their vehicles just because cops think footage of a crime may have been captured by the car&#8217;s on-board cameras. Tesla&#8217;s vehicles carry more cameras than most. Added to the cars as a way to protect owners &#8212; either by [&#8230;]

All told, 30 states are considering [&#8230;]
