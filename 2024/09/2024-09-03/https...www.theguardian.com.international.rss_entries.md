<p>Fans in Paris have embraced the competition but this showcase will not mean anything unless we bring sport along after Games</p><p>Ahead of these Games, one of the things we were all worried about was whether they’d have the crowds. Whether Paris could deliver that same energy and enthusiasm we remember from London. I think we now know the answer. On Monday I was at the para-badminton semi-final between Krysten Coombs and Charles Noakes, and it was like: wow. There were 7,000 people there, they were raising the roof, they were singing the Marseillaise, they were on their feet waving flags when their guy came in, they had giant pictures of his head.</p><p>I have to say, I really felt sorry for Coombs. He came into this cauldron of noise where all the warmth was for the French athlete and I could see he was thinking: ‘How do I manage the crowd?’ That’s something we’re not taught as Paralympians. Often our sports are just not played in front of big crowds. The Paralympics is only ever

<p>Contrary to popular belief, adopting a plant-based diet doesn’t mean eating less, nor does it mean meals will be bland</p><p>I grew up in a multicultural household – my father is Norwegian, my mother Bulgarian and Danish – and spent my early years in Tanzania, where, in the 1980s, processed foods were practically nonexistent. If we wanted pizza, we made everything – from the base to the sauce – ourselves.</p><p>My mother made fresh butter and yoghurt, and I also spent a lot of my time with my “green-fingered” grandmother who lived in Sweden. When we weren’t at the local farmers’ market, we were either in the garden, pickling, or making seasonal jams. So this hands-on approach to food became ingrained in me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/sep/03/a-drizzle-a-dollop-and-a-crunch-the-secret-to-plant-based-eating">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Venice film festival<br></strong>The documentary-maker loses some nuance but he is tackling big issues, as Samantha Morton picks through post-apocalyptic ruins in a sombre futurist reverie</p><p>Asif Kapadia takes on big subjects in a vehement drama-doc fantasy of just 85 minutes: climate change, corporate fascism, the global erosion of democracy. And if the result feels occasionally strident, or redundant, or choir-preaching, then maybe that is just a function of the vast and implacable importance of what he’s talking about.</p><p>This is the elephant in the room, the insidious gradual diminution of our freedoms, and addressing it head-on like this (which is probably the only way to address it) is arguably to sacrifice subtlety and nuance and the more calibrated filmic language that has made Kapadia’s films, about pop-culture icons such as Diego Maradona and Amy Winehouse, more approachable. And yes, those films worked better on their own terms, but that’s not to deny the

<p>The new zero-emission train, known as Zemu, will run through an area that has long suffered from poor air quality. Will it be the start of a clean energy rail movement in the US?</p><p>There’s a new train pulling into the station in San Bernardino, a southern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> city about 60 miles from Los Angeles. From the outside, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgeg9ANyULY">it looks like</a> any other commuter train, with three passenger carriages, blocky windows and a colourful blue exterior.</p><p>But inside, it’s unlike anything the region – or the country – has seen before. The $20m Zero-Emission Multiple Unit, known as Zemu, uses a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell and battery system to propel the train and run other onboard electrical systems. The only byproduct of the fuel cell is water vapour, a welcome change in an area known as the Inland Empire that suffers from some of the worst air quality rates in the country.</

Probably originating from the Moors, they’re essentially small kebabs made by threading marinated lamb on to skewers, or <em>pinchos</em>. The accompanying <em>mojo verde</em>, meanwhile, hails from the sun-drenched Canary Islands off the coast of north-west Africa and is a simple green sauce that also pairs brilliantly with small baked and salted potatoes (the best ones just so happen to come from the Canaries, too).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/sep/03/pinchos-moruno-mojo-verde-recipe-lamb-skewers-jose-pizarro">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Slippery and unsubtle, Zia Anger’s film about a film-maker is saved from self-indulgence by its sly humour</p><p>Rising star Odessa Young brings just the right amount of spontaneity, youthful exuberance and charisma to keep this hyperdimensional little ouroboros of a story about the actual director’s film-making experiences from seeming insufferably self-indulgent. So credit should also go to director Zia Anger herself for decent helming and casting instincts, because it all sort of works, even if it feels like a grad school project gone rogue.</p><p>Young plays Vita, a young woman who wants to make a movie that is more or less about herself, even though in her voiceover she keeps foregrounding the differences between her real story and the fiction she is creating. “Real” Vita has two mothers, a couple who conceived Vita with the help of a gay male friend; also, as an adult, Vita has had two abortions.

It seemed an obvious, genius move to them: violently sandblasting a core of yearning sweetness.</p><p>The brothers formed a no-frills band, wearing drainpipe trousers and black leather, accessorised with stormcloud fringes and casual misanthropy with which they baited early audiences. Naturally, the Mary Chain would have a standing drummer (a position that rotated so much – including a stint by Bobby Gillespie – this joint memoir should come with an “other guys” spreadsheet).
