The easiest way to back up your photos is via cloud storage; you can then store them in Apple\u2019s iCloud, on Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or in the online storage of a third-party provider. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this is only a temporary solution, because after your vacation you should review the pictures on your home PC, sort out duplicates and unsuccessful ones, and edit the others if necessary. If you only have the limited data quota of free storage available, you will have to move files saved online to your PC from time to time anyway and archive them there.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2382252/google-drive-files-deleted-but-storage-sti", "id": 1073092, "language": null, "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2438528/making-the-most-of-storage-space-in-the-cloud-heres-how.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.pcworld.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 246, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Maximize your cloud storage with these 5 tools and tricks", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-03T10:30:00+00:00", "description": "\n<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<body><section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div id=\"review-body\" class=\"review\"><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\" style=\"--rating: 2.5;\" aria-label=\"Rating of this product is 2.5 out of 5.\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Thin and light for an 18-inch laptop</li><li>Vibrant 18-inch Mini-LED display</li><li>Excellent sound system</li><li>Wired connectivity includes Thunderbolt 4, 2.5Gbps Ethernet</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Design, fit-and-finish needs work</li><li>CPU, GPU performance doesn\u2019t match competitors</li><li>Battery life is short, though better than some alternatives</li><li>Low value f", "id": 1073091, "language": null, "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2438511/msi-stealth-18-ai-studio-review.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.pcworld.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 246, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "MSI Stealth 18 AI Studio review: A big laptop with a big price tag", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-03T08:00:00+00:00", "description": "\n<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<body><section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> For $89.97 through September 29, the Auto Wireless Car Adapter lets you <a href=\"https://shop.pcworld.com/sales/carplay-android-auto-wireless-adapter-with-streaming-app-support?utm_source=pcworld.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=carplay-android-auto-wireless-adapter-with-streaming-app-support&utm_term=scsf-603119&utm_content=a0xRn0000022q6DIAQ&scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stream movies and shows from your phone to your car\u2019s screen</a>, keeping passengers entertained on the go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a car monitor for navigation is pretty common on summer road trips, but what about keeping your passengers entertained along the way?
