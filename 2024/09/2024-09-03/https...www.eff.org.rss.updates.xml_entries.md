<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden"><div class="field__items"><div class="field__item even"><p><span>A misguided bill that would have required many people to show ID to get online has died without getting a floor vote in the California legislature, where key deadlines for bill passage passed this weekend. Thank you to our supporters for helping us to kill this wrongheaded bill, especially those of you who took the time to </span><a href="https://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/"><span>reach out to your legislators</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>EFF </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/06/california-lawmakers-should-reject-mandatory-internet-id-checks"><span>opposed this bill from the start</span></a><span>. Bills that allow politicians to define what is “sexually explicit” content and then enact punishments for those who engage with it are inherently censorship bills—and they never stop with minors. </span></p>

<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden"><div class="field__items"><div class="field__item even"><p>The Constitution prohibits dragnet device searches, especially when those searches are designed to uncover political speech, EFF explained in a <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/armendariz-v-city-colorado-springs">friend-of-the-court brief</a> filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</p>
<p>The case, <em>Armendariz v. City of Colorado Springs</em>, challenges device and data seizures and searches conducted by the Colorado Springs police after a 2021 housing rights march that the police deemed “illegal.” The plaintiffs in the case, Jacqueline Armendariz and a local organization called the Chinook Center, argue these searches violated their civil rights.</p>
<p>The case details repeated actions by the police to target and try to intimidate plaintiffs and other local civil rights activists solely for their political speech.
