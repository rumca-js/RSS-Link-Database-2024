 In a 23-page decision dated August 27, U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman&#8212;the same judge who, in March 2023, ordered several books banned by Llano County officials returned to library shelves&#8212;denied most of the Texas county's motion to dismiss librarian Suzette Baker's wrongful termination suit, trimming only a small part of the suit as duplicative. Despite claims from Llano County that Baker, the former head librarian at Llano County's Kingsland library, was dismissed for insubordination, Pitman found that Baker had plausibly asserted that she was fired for opposing orders to improperly pull books that overwhelmingly represented the LGBTQ and BIPOC communities.
