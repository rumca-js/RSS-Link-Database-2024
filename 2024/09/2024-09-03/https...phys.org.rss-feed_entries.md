NASA's newest climate mission has started collecting data on the amount of heat in the form of far-infrared radiation that the Arctic and Antarctic environments emit to space. These measurements by the Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-Infrared Experiment (PREFIRE) are key to better predicting how climate change will affect Earth's ice, seas, and weather—information that will help humanity better prepare for a changing world.

A research team led by Prof. Seo Byeong-Chang of the Department of Brain Sciences at DGIST has made the world's first discovery of how proton-activated chloride (PAC) channels—which play an important role in protecting cells in our bodies—work. PAC channels are important mediators of cell damage caused by tissue acidification, and by unraveling the mystery of how they are activated, the research team has opened up a new road for treating cancer and brain diseases.

Candle flames and airplane engines produce tiny soot particles from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as their precursors, both of which are harmful to humans and the environment. These carbon-based particles are also common in space, making up 10–12% of interstellar matter, and are becoming valuable for use in electronic devices and sustainable energy. However, the fingerprint signals of soot and PAHs have very short lifespans in flames—lasting only a few billionths to millionths of a second. This brief existence requires very fast cameras to capture their behavior in both space and time.

Ferruginous Hawks (Buteo regalis) that spend their winters in California seem to be going up in number, yet their preferred grassland habitat has been declining for over 20 years. Most other grassland bird species are, sadly, doing the expected: plummeting in tandem with the open areas that used to define much more of western North America.

What's the difference between an asteroid and a comet? A comet is basically a dirty iceball composed of rock and ice. The classic image is of a bright "star" in the night sky with a long curved tail extending into space. This is what happens when they approach the sun and start emitting gases and releasing dust. It normally continues until there's nothing left but rock or until they fragment into dust.
