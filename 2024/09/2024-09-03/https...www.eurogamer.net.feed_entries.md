Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 are both now set to launch for Xbox next year following "technical discussions" with Microsoft, after the platform was omitted from Capcom's original release announcements.
</p><p>
Word of an Xbox release was conspicuously absent when Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 were announced for PS4, Switch, and Steam back in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-nintendo-direct">June</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-in-todays-nintendo-direct-and-indie-world-showcases">August</a> respectively, frustrating fans on Microsoft's platform.

Now, however, with Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics' 12th September release looming, Capcom has <a href="http

## Intel's Lunar Lake laptop chips are faster, more efficient and even capable of genuine RT gaming

The new Core Ultra 200V chips look impressive, offering significantly better performance at lower power levels than last year's first-gen Core Ultra 'Meteor Lake', with graphics and AI performance being areas of particular improvement. In fact, the new top-level chips are even fast enough for RT gaming at decent frame-rates - something I definitely didn't expect to be a focus of Intel's presentation! </p><p>Let's rattle through some numbers quickly. Intel says that its fastest Core Ultra 200V chip has seen its single-core speeds improve by around 18 percent versus the last-gen, while the GPU has improved by 30 percent on average across a 45-game sample. Meanwhile, package power has dropped by 40 to 50 percent

Floundering 5v5 shooter Concord is set to go offline indefinitely this Friday - just two weeks after its PS5 and PC release - as Sony and Firewalk Studios admit "our initial launch didn't land".
</p><p>
Concord - one of several games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-as-it-continues-work-on-triple-a-multiplayer-exclusive">snapped up by Sony</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">live-service push</a> under former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-pvp-shooter-concord-is-firewalk-studios-first-game">initially announced last May</a>.

Indeed, it's a wonder that Phoenix Wright and the rest of the defence profession isn't surplus to requirements at this point, so watertight are Edgeworth's various case files here that any potential court trial would be over before it began.</p><p>Of course, one of the defining traits of the Investigations games is that there <em>aren't</em> any court trials, with the action instead shifting solely onto the pros

You might have spotted Eurogamer is 25 this week, and so alongside the first appearance of a few permanent micro-wrinkles and a sharp decline in people asking us for ID, we're marking the occasion with something special.</p><p>Actually, it's several things that are special, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-turns-25">as editor-in-chief Tom Phillips explained</a> at the start of the week, but this one warrants a bit of explanation. Today marks the launch of the Eurogamer 100, a list of the very best video games to play <em>right now</em>.</p><p>The emphasis, you might have spotted, is on that last bit. Somehow, in Eurogamer's 25 years of publication, we've never actually run a list of the best video games full stop.

It takes a lot for an online shooter to stand out these days. Just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spare-a-thought-for-poor-concord-a-kind-and-earnest-shooter-sent-out-to-die">ask Concord</a>. But FragPunk's Shard Card system looks to be the twist needed to ensure it stands out above the rest.

The game was revealed back at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024">Xbox Games Showcase in June</a>, but is set for release next year across Xbox Series X/S and PC.
