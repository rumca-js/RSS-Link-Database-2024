<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am very much a code noob but I am very tech savvy and 100% get the concept of coding and what it&#39;s trying to do, I just don&#39;t know how to speak it&#39;s language. I&#39;m trying to use ScraperAPI and I think I&#39;ve gotten everything setup, I&#39;m just not sure where to start scraping and don&#39;t know how to get the website to tell me the elements I need to put into the script so it can find it online when running and pull it. I feel like I&#39;m so close YET so far. I&#39;ve always wanted to dip my toes into coding and this project seems like the perfect starting point. I&#39;m using Python for the language and think I have a lot it in place, just need some confirmation and maybe direction on where to start scraping. Any and all help is so glady appreciated. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ITakeLargeDabs"> /u/ITakeLargeDabs </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I am by no means a professional web scraper, I have practiced a little on the older websites which are meant for scraping but now for my portfolio project I wanted to make a full stack web app, which essentially summarizes reviews a product from amazon using scraping, db, caching and ml pipeline, so far all of them are going great, until i got stuck on pagination, amazon has its own reviews webpage consisting of 10 reviews per page, i want a 100 for each time i run the code, so 10 pages, I have tried scrapy spider, it did not work, it would always load the first page but whenever i tried to move to the second page I get intercepted with a login page, now I have reverted back to using selenium and bs4 where in i navigate and extract page sources with selenium and parse them with bs4, but even here i am being throttled by getting redirected to the login page... all videos i have seen seem to be able to achieve this easily... I don&#39;t know what

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t consider myself a starter but I was wondering something might be a starter question because I never had to face a situation like this, if I make a .exe file out of a playwright (python) file will the person running that .exe file need to have installed a webdriver on his/her computer? I&#39;m talking about the one that gets installed with &gt;playwright install. What about Selenium or other scraping tools? Do they have such dependencies?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/balaszDenmark"> /u/balaszDenmark </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1f814nj/playwright_python_noob_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1f814nj/playwright_python_noob_question/">[comments]</a></span>
