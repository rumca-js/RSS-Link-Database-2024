<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for cool and interesting wood/bakelite games in the vein of Gigamic, Hive, Cathedral, etc. Something bulletproof that could be played with people of all ages and levels of sobriety, without too much intensity, on a porch with a beverage. No cards, cardboard, paper, pencils, etc. Should fit on a small end table. Rules should only take a minute or two to explain and be picked up fast. Bonus points for games that just look good and built with quality in mind.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/StovetopRitualist"> /u/StovetopRitualist </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1f8ay4d/simple_chunky_abstract_woodbakelite_games_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1f8ay4d/simple_chunky_abstract_woodbakelite_games_for/">[comments]</a></span>

This a version of the game made by Portal Games North America. There&#39;s a version of this game that I believe is made by a polish company, which is identical gameplay wise but the meeples and cards are not anywhere near as nice.

I’ve played a few games now, at least one with each faction, and I think I’m starting to “get it” as to why this is considered a beloved game now. I knew it was asymmetrical, but I hadn’t realized each faction was essentially playing its own mini version of a different type of game in order to score VP. After a little bit, I started thinking each faction in the Core box is its own type of game, and you could recommend a faction to a new player based on what types of games they like.</p> <p>Marquise de Cat - straightforward dudes on a map game, with some supply chain management.</p> <p>Eyries Dynasty - a puzzley tableau/engine builder game</p> <p>Woodland Alliance - a Euro worker placement game</p> <p>Vagabond - an adven

There hasn&#39;t been a standalone Simpsons game in 20 years, and the previous ones were generally takes on classic roll and moves, trivia or card games. </p> <p>Even Simpsons branded &quot;classics&quot; appear to be a thing of the past. The last one, Simpsons Codenames, was in 2019, and the last prior to that was 6 years earlier. Compare that to the 00s, when they couldn&#39;t find enough games to put the Simpsons branding upon.</p> <p>Who else would like to see a quality designed Simpsons board game? And what kind of game could it be?</p> <p>And out of interest, what other IPs that have been neglected by game publishers have a great narrative of location for a board game?</p> <p>For me another is Black Sails, which had the makings of a great 4x/political/combat game within it&#39;s narrative and chatacters.

I have not played with the expansion yet, so maybe this mitigates things.</p> <p>All 3 games start you off with a hand of cards. In Terraforming Mars, after that initial hand, you draft cards every round, giving you ample opportunity to find cards that have synergies with your strategy. There are also many cards that allow you to draw more.</p> <p>In Earth, you start off with a hand of cards and depending on the Island/climate/ecosystem combo you choose, you can steer yourself towards other cards that let you draw. It does feel more limiting than TM, though.</p> <p>In Ark Nova, you start off with a hand of cards, but the hand size limit is 3, and opportunities to draw new cards come fairly infrequently. There is a market, unlike in the other 2 games, but realistically you are limited to the cheapest card in th

I wiped these with Chlorox wipes and there seems to be a dark smears, but they won&#39;t come off. There is no residue on the wipe. When I press, it appears to be slimy, but as I said they don&#39;t wipe off. </p> <p>I&#39;m wondering if they somehow formed inside the plastic? Maybe there is a small breach in the plastic where moisture collected? Or maybe there are small holes where these marks are?</p> <p>Let me know if you have any tips, or if I should take any precautions before unboxing it. I&#39;ll see then if I can wipe them off and if they are on the box&#39;s surface. </p> <p>There are possible mold concerns with other items I ordered with this

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does or has anyone played the game Nightmare Productions? It’s a game where you bid on stuff and make some horror movies and stuff. If anyone has played it I’m just wondering if they encounter the same issues as me and my dad when we played. It was almost like there were two pages of the rule book missing! I kept on asking questions on how to play but we just kept rereading the instructions to no avail. And it wasn’t like we made up rules for the fun, we had too!! The rules didn’t explain it nearly enough and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth considering how expensive it was! I did like the games art design as I am a huge fan of horror movies but it was pretty hard to play this game. I’m wondering if anyone else encountered this problem playing, it’ll also be easier to explain if you played but yea. Still a fun game to check out just seems idk maybe rushed out or something, not playtested or looked at long enough </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;
