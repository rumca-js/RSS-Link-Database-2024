<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For a basic overview, I’ve got a very simple setup. I have an application that pushes some metrics to influxdb 2.0 every 15 minutes. Then I have a free grafana cloud dashboard on top of that displaying some information for me. </p> <p>My problem is that I don’t want to use this special query language for influx. I’ve been holding out for 3.0 to get SQL support but it’s been delayed too much and I want a solution now. does anyone have an alternative to influxdb that has a SQL like query language I can use with grafana? Bonus points if it has a simple python library for pushing metrics to it like influx does. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HarbaughHeros"> /u/HarbaughHeros </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1f7pveb/does_anyone_have_a_influxdb_alternative_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1f7pveb/does_anyone_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><ul> <li>I have a SLZB-06M coming in the mail that I plan to use as a controller for my new zigbee devices.</li> <li>I have a unifi cloud gateway max router with a unifi U6-LR access point for wifi.</li> </ul> <p>I see I have the option to select a channel on the wifi access point. I also remember watching a zigbee video where a guy recommended channel 30 or something like that for the zigbee controller.</p> <p>Can someone recommend which channel I should set my zigbee controller to and what channel for my unifi wifi access point please. Or point me in the right direction to determine it myself I&#39;m new to this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/murkr"> /u/murkr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1f7p2a9/what_channel_should_i_set_my_zigbee_controller/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1f7p2a9/what_channel_should_i
