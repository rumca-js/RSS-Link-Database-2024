Today on the Matt Walsh Show, racial pandering on the Left has somehow managed to reach new lows in the last week. We'll discuss. Also, the media continues to smear Donald Trump for honoring fallen service members while Biden sat on the beach and couldn't be bothered. Trump clarifies his stance on a pro-abortion measure in Florida. And The New York Times encourages you to ditch your air conditioning for the sake of the climate.
