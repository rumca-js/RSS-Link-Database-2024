	In previous posts, we&#39;ve explored relocation, trivial relocation, and their use in optimizing data structures like vector-like containers. We&#39;ve also examined how trivial relocation relates to move assignments, enabling further optimization of operations like swaps and algorithms such as <code>std::sort</code> and <code>std::rotate</code>.</p>

		<strong>Is trivial relocation allowed in Standard C++?</strong></p>
	<p>
		That&rsquo;s probably a question we should have asked as soon as we started this journey. Of course, the answer is&nbsp;no, it is not allowed!</p>
	<p>
		Remember how trivial relocation works: we use&nbsp;<tt>memcpy</tt>&nbsp;a source object(&lsquo;s representation) into some storage, and claim that operation realizes the equivalent of
