As a VPN Service Provider, I can tell you the truth about VPN's. They are not the end-all. They do not protect everything. And they can be vulnerable IF you don't understand the limitations. This is a particularly important discussion for people in Brazil who are now threatened with a $9000 daily fine for using a VPN. Can you get caught if you use it? What can the government see? What does it really protect? Are there substitutes like iCloud Private Relay or other alternatives?

VPN's are banned in other countries like China and Saudi Arabia. Can you use it anyway?
