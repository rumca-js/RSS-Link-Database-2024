Over the last few weeks, after a massive defeat at the UK general election, several senior staff in the Conservative Party have reportedly taken voluntary redundancy, with more staff cuts expected to follow. Perhaps not surprising, as morale is not likely to be high. But it raises an interesting and broader career development question: is it better to leave an organization in decline or which has suffered a major downturn? Or are there benefits to staying with it?

A team of computer scientists at Google Quantum AI has demonstrated a type of quantum memory for a quantum computer that produces far fewer errors than others. The group has published a paper on the arXiv preprint server describing their new memory system, how it works, and the degree to which it is capable of reducing error rates.
