<p>Need another USB flash drive? Of course you do! It’s impossible to have too many of them, especially when you’re always moving files from one machine to another.</p>



<p>And right now, you can grab <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-MUF-128AB-AM-Plus-128GB/dp/B07D7PDLXC/">this 128GB Samsung Fit Plus flash drive for just $15 on Amazon</a>, a huge discount off its normal price of $45. Yes, that’s right — it’s 67 percent off and not a typo.</p>



<p>The Samsung Fit Plus is a great flash drive for many reasons, but the one that immediately catches your eye is just how small it is. It’s so easy to carry around in your pocket, and it’s nearly invisible once plugged in. You can put it on a keychain because losing it is a real possibility.</p>



<p>And yet, despite how small it is physically, this flash drive has plenty of room for all your files and phot

<p>AMD is offering gamers an early version of what it calls AMD Fluid Motion Frames 2 (AFMF2), an AI-powered technology that creates additional frames per second for those gamers with laptops powered by AMD Ryzen AI 300 processors. The improvements appear significant: about 30 to 40 percent.</p>



<p>Specifically, AMD says that AFMF 2 will boost frame rates in <em>Cyberpunk: 2077</em> from 56 frames (1080p, Low settings, Balanced FSR) to about 100 FPS using the new technology, and other games will see a similar boost. For now, AMD is <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-AFMF2-TECH-Preview.html">offering AFMF 2 as a technical preview</a>, though the technology will be added to AMD’s Adrenalin Edition software at a later date. </p>

<p>I just found a fantastic deal on a superb Dell gaming laptop and I just have to share it with you. Right now, you can get <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-16-13th-generation-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i9-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-8gb-32gb-memory-1tb-ssd-metallic-nightshade/6579779.p?skuId=6579779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this Dell G16 laptop for just $1,250 at Best Buy</a>, which is a significant drop from its usual $1,600. That’s a nice discount for a powerful config.</p>



<p>For starters, the Dell G16 features a large 16-inch display with a high resolution of 2560×1600 for crisp images. With a max refresh rate of 240Hz, it’s fast enough for buttery smooth visuals in action-heavy games, offering the ultimate portable gaming experience.</p>

<p>The best investment you can make for an overseas trip? Not jamming a week’s worth of clothes in a carry-on. Not paying hundreds for more legroom on the plane. It’s buying a local SIM or eSIM, specifically one that offers unlimited 5G data so you’re never disconnected.</p>



<p>In the past year, I’ve traveled to cover both Computex (in Taiwan) and IFA (in Germany), and on both occasions I purchased local SIM access for relative peanuts — about $30 or so for 7 to 10 days’ worth of data. Each plan I bought offered unlimited data on networks that were as good or better than what’s offered here in the United States.</p>



<p>Consider this: you’re likely going to be out and about, visiting museums, eating out at restaurants, streaming Netflix by the pool… Yes, you can use your hotel’s Wi-Fi, but only within range of the hotel. And with all the concerns about <

<p>It isn’t every day that you’re able to snatch one of the best gaming monitors available at its best-ever price. But right now, you can get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-Adjustable-LS49CG954ENXZA/dp/B0CP6HW894/">this 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9 monitor for only $800 on Amazon</a>, a massive discount off its normal $1,300 MSRP.</p>



<p>For starters, you have to know that this is a super large monitor at 49 inches. That’s basically the size of a television, so expect it to take up a bit of space on your desk — but the size is worth it because it enables you to have an incredible, unparalleled experience.</p>



<p>With its ultrawide resolution of 3440×1440, you can pack so many apps side by side on screen <em>and</em> play your games as immersively as possible. Its fast 240Hz refresh rate ensures smooth visuals with minimal blur

<p>Dig into your Settings in Windows 11, and you’ll find a list of your PC’s installed apps—including a couple related to core Windows features like Cortana and Copilot. If you dislike anything, you can nuke the offending software with a click.</p>



<p>But despite a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2443906/microsoft-finally-allows-the-controversial-recall-feature-to-be-uninstalled-heres-how.html">brief moment of excitement on the internet</a>, the same isn’t true for Microsoft Recall, the upcoming AI-infused Windows feature that will capture screenshots of everything you do on your PC. And in all likelihood, uninstalling Recall won’t be a possibility for a while after its launch (if ever).</p>



<p>It should be, though, given Microsoft’s attempts to associate Windows 11 with security and privacy.</p>

<p>Protecting an account with just a username and password is not very smart. Both can be stolen, guessed, or cracked too easily. This is why two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended for all important access points. It has even been mandatory for online banking for years. </p>



<p>With 2FA, two factors are used to gain access to an account, a network or an application. One factor is a security feature that can come from three categories: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge </strong>(password, PIN)</li>



<li><strong>Possession </strong>(smartphone, Fido2 stick, etc.)</li>



<li><strong>Biometrics </strong>(fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.)</li>
</ul>



<p>For 2FA to provide good protection, the two factors used must come from two different categories. If more than two factors are used, this is referred to as multi-factor authentication. </p>
