Now i have 10 kilos of 2.85 abs that has been in storage for 5+ years. I however can also not use it as my ender 3 uses 1.75mm and also i don&#39;t have a enclosure for abs. Is it worth it building a filament resizer and dealing with possibly very wet filament ( the green one snaps in half very easily) or just to leave/sell it and buy normal filame

I think it&#39;s pretty good for a first try but looks like there&#39;s some glow in the dark stringing stuck in the tpu between the design. The whole thing is printed on a textured print bed giving it a glitter and glossy look, it&#39;s not slippery at all thought.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnowpigQc"> /u/SnowpigQc </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fdxopw">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span
