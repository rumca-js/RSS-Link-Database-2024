## Show HN: How much is 13B euros?

<p>Hi,<p>I made this page to contextualize 13 billion euros (or 14): an amount due to Ireland in an EU Apple tax case and all over the airwaves here this week. I use some pretty silly back-of-the-envelope type calculations (the same ones also repeated a lot in Ireland this week!).<p>These calculations aren't especially interesting, but at least they are present: you can see them, and you can change them. If you do - change the 13 billion to 14 billion for example, related numbers will flash with updates.<p>It's an example using calculang[1]: a language for calculations, and an example that focuses on a close connection between numbers that we read or share and formulas/workings behind those numbers.<p>I plan to do a separate Show HN about calculang perhaps when I have more docs and newer playground and gallery together, but Showing this page in case it's interesting, & happy if there is feedback!<p>Declan<p>[0] <a href="https://HowMuchIs13BillionEuros.com" rel="nofollow">https://HowM

## Show HN: Tune LLaMa3.1 on Google Cloud TPUs

<p>Hey HN, we wanted to share our repo where we fine-tuned Llama 3.1 on Google TPUs. We’re building AI infra to fine-tune and serve LLMs on non-NVIDIA GPUs (TPUs, Trainium, AMD GPUs).<p>The problem: Right now, 90% of LLM workloads run on NVIDIA GPUs, but there are equally powerful and more cost-effective alternatives out there. For example, training and serving Llama 3.1 on Google TPUs is about 30% cheaper than NVIDIA GPUs.<p>But developer tooling for non-NVIDIA chipsets is lacking. We felt this pain ourselves. We initially tried using PyTorch XLA to train Llama 3.1 on TPUs, but it was rough: xla integration with pytorch is clunky, missing libraries (bitsandbytes didn't work), and cryptic HuggingFace errors.<p>We then took a different route and translated Llama 3.1 from PyTorch to JAX. Now, it’s running smoothly on TPUs! We still have challenges ahead, there is no good LoRA library in JAX, but this feels like the right path forward.<p>Here's a demo (<a href="https://dub.sh/felafax-de

## Is 7 days a week the new norm (for YC)?

<p>I've worked for 2 major YC companies and done some one-off/contract work in recent years at a few others here in SF. Really like the startups coming out of YC.<p>I had to unfortunately voluntarily quit the last on-site contract due to it being 7 days a week (I tried to take off a Sunday, didn't work), on top of a requirement to be there until 8-9pm daily and occasionally pull all-nighters when there are sales demos (at the office until 7AM the next day - then stayed at work for the next day). I tried to stick it out, and even though I consider myself to have the best work ethic of anyone I know, being at an office nearly 24/7/365 to do basic React work with constantly changing directions/requirements felt pointless to say the least. It wasn't like we were building something with a clear goal in mind - and the founders did <i>nothing</i>. They would shoot hoops with the nerf basketball, leave for 2-3 hours at a time, come back with food, talk, etc.<p>Anyway, so I quit to find anoth

<p>I have been building the open source project <a href="https://github.com/claceio/clace">https://github.com/claceio/clace</a>. Clace is an application server that builds and deploys containers, allowing it to manage webapps in any language/framework.<p>Compared to application servers like Nginx Unit, Clace has the advantage of being able to work with any application, without requiring any dependency or packaging changes. Clace provides a blue-green staged deployment model for apps. Not just code changes, even configuration changes are staged and can be verified before being made live.<p>Clace is not a PaaS solution, it does not support deploying databases and other auxiliary services. It does share the fact that it manages containers with PaaS solutions. Clace is different in that it builds its own reverse proxy, instead of depending on Traefik/Nginx. This allows Clace to implement features like shutting down idle apps and adding app level OAuth authentication. Clace runs natively

## Ask HN: Why Is Pave Legal?

<p>If you haven't heard of it, Pave is a YC-backed startup that helps startups with compensation. I can't actually access the system so I'm speaking from hearsay and what's information on public parts of their website. The way I understand it works is that you connect Pave to your HR and Payroll systems, they take the data about who you employ and how much you pay them, combine it with all their other companies, and give companies a collective breakdown of compensation ranges.<p>My question is, isn't this specifically anti-competitive wage fixing? This seems exactly like RealPage but for employee compensation. As far as I know, colluding on wages like this is illegal. Is there something about the company that I'm missing?</p>
