It’s also the finest. And this time, it’s a family affair.</p><p>The film stars Washington’s oldest son, John David, and is directed by his youngest, Malcolm. His daughters, Katia and Olivia, are also involved, as producer and actor in a small role respectively. And as the credits roll, there’s a dedication to the children’s mother Pauletta. Call it projection, but it’s hard not to get sentimental about the kids getting together to grapple with this story.

How does he explain this? “I attribute it to fear,” he says. “But now we can change the course, without apology or fear.”</p><p>The choreographer helping change that course, as the ballet Oscar opens this month in Melbourne, is US-based Briton Christopher Wheeldon, one of the world’s leading dance-makers, whose ballets include adaptations of The Winter’s Tale and Like Water for Chocolate.

Leaving parliament to head home, he walked past a bus stop. “There were lords and ladies; there were MPs; there were the girls who used to serve us in the tea room, people who worked the doors, the cleaners,” he said. It wasn’t, he concluded, the sort of sight you’d see at a bus stop in Liverpool.</p><p>In London, if you missed one bus that night, another would quickly appear. In Liverpool you’d face a half-hour wait.

<p>From delighting in repetitive tasks to unselfconscious joy, there is much to be learned from a dog’s approach to life</p><p>What is important in life? What gives it purpose, and meaning? While philosophers ponder these questions, dogs just live them. In his new book, Mark Rowlands argues the case that a dog’s capacity for joy, for meaning, for wholesale commitment to being, far exceeds that of humans. A professor of philosophy and a serial dog owner, Rowlands has written a profound and funny examination of what it means to be fulfilled, both for canines and humans. By the end, you will envy your dog’s every waking moment.</p><p>It was Socrates who said – or probably said – that the unexamined life is not worth living. But the examined life is not all it’s cracked up to be. We humans are creatures of doubt, agonisers and&nbsp;second-guessers, ceaselessly interrogating ourselves, our actions and our motives. Dogs, not so much.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/20

<p>Society is controlled by constant surveillance with police and cameras enforcing strict rules through fear and punishment</p><p>Islamic fascism, a harsh form of tyranny, is marked by oppressive rule, intolerance and violence. Its most extreme form today is seen here in Afghanistan, where freedom is crushed under severe suppression. Fascism in Afghanistan is a particularly cruel and horrific form of oppression, severely interfering in every aspect of life, especially for women. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/26/taliban-bar-on-afghan-women-speaking-in-public-un-afghanistan">It controls everything from what we wear</a> and where we go and most importantly, what we are allowed to think.

<p>The Clerks director continues his nostalgic mood in endearing study of a geeky adolescent with high romantic ambitions</p><p>Following on from his likable threequel Clerks III, Kevin Smith remains in a nostalgic mood with yet another semi-autobiographical comedy whose main character is basically an avatar of Smith himself, just a little thinner. Protagonist Brian David (Austin Zajur, who had a much better character name in Clerks III, Blockchain Coltrane) is a junior in high school. This being 1986, there’s not much for a 16-year-old to do in suburban New Jersey but go to the local multiplex with his friends, geeky Belly (Reed Northrup) and cocky Burny (Nicholas Cirillo) – so that’s what the guys get up to, paying to see something PG and then sneaking into the R-rated film when the ushers aren’t looking.</p><p>However, on this particular day, Brian has mustered the courage to ask his crush, Melody (Siena Agudong), to go see a new release on a date with him at 4:30 that afternoon an

The director – someone she knew and had thought of as a friend – was standoffish, “playing the director power game”. She had to read the part several times, trying – and failing – to subvert it, the people in charge looking bored.

<p>Public-facing staff in shops and frontline services are donning cameras to help fight abuse and theft</p><p>When you work in security it can be a battle to stop people stealing.
