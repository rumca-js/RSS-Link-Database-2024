<p class="has-text-align-none">While <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/sea-of-thieves/38538">Sea of Thieves</a></em> is a goofy, lighthearted game on the surface, players have been reporting a recent surge in troubling incidents from the pirate sandbox. Some have been assailed with insults, threats, and harassment, while others have been kicked from the game with fraudulent temporary bans. On Wednesday, game developer Rare acknowledged the issue with a statement, stating that it’s identified and removed an exploit, and pledging to address the problems with upcoming moderation actions and tools.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The gimmick at the center of Megan Park’s dramedy <em>My Old Ass</em> is grabby: On the night of her 18th birthday, a teenager blows off her family birthday celebration to go do drugs in the woods. There, she encounters an adult version of herself, and promptly proceeds to rag on herself for being so old. (The other version of her is just 39.) Seeing a confident teenager and her older self playfully butt heads over future job prospects and appearances is already funny. But woven through the <em>Oh my God, is this what I’m going to
