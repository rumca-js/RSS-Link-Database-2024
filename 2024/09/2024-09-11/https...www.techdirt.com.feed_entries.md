Last month, we discussed the internet&#8217;s reaction to Donald Trump, well, Donald Trumping all over social media. He shared several images on social media, some of which were real, some of which were parody, and some of which were AI generated images, all of which appeared to suggest that Taylor Swift had endorsed him. In [&#8230;]

If you think qualified immunity is awarded far too frequently during far too many cases involving obvious rights violations, brace yourself for the harrowing insanity that is the wreckage that has been made of Supreme Court&#8217;s Bivens decision. That case involved rights violations by federal officers against Webster Bivens. The Supreme Court found in favor [&#8230;]

In the last month, I wrote about two of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s bullshit crazy lawsuits over him being very, very mad that social media companies keep moderating or limiting the spread of his dangerous bullshit anti-vax nonsense. In one, the Ninth Circuit had to explain (not for the first time) to RFK and his [&#8230;]

The Fraternal Order of Police isn&#8217;t here to protect cops from anything but accountability. It doesn&#8217;t actually care about the rank-and-file, not when it can leverage its power to secure even more power. It doesn&#8217;t care about law and order, despite being the definitive figurehead of that ideal. No, the FOP is &#8212; and has [&#8230;]

You probably already know the benefits of learning a language, so let&#8217;s focus on the app. Right off the bat, let&#8217;s be clear about one thing: When we say &#8220;app&#8221; we don&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re limited to using Babbel on your phone. You can use Babbel on desktop, too, and your progress is synchronized across [&#8230;]

Over the last few years, politicians in Utah have been itching to pass terrible internet legislation. Some of you may forget that in the earlier part of the century, Utah became somewhat famous for passing absolutely terrible internet laws that the courts then had to clean up. In the last few years, it’s felt like [&#8230;]

Over the next six months, states are poised to receive more than $42.5 billion in taxpayer subsidies to help fund broadband rollouts around the country. A lot of this money is getting dumped into the laps of big telecom monopolies with a lousy track record of follow through. But a lot of it is also [&#8230;]
