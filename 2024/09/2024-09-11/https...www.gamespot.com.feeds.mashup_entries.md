<p>If you don't have kids, it's quite possible you've never heard of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gorilla-tag/">Gorilla Tag</a>, and if you <em>do </em>have kids, there's a good chance Gorilla Tag is all you've been hearing about for a few years now. Originally developed by one person, Kerestell Smith--known to fans by his online handle Lemming--Gorilla Tag is <em>the </em>game of a generation. It hosts a million unique players daily, up to three million monthly active users, and has been played by over 12 million people since it released in 2021. While many older players have sometimes already written off VR, players of a particular age, approximately 7-14, have flocked to a game that is simple in its gameplay loop but sneakily complex in its design.</p><p dir="ltr">As both a writer in this space and the parent of a Gen Alpha kid who's been shimmying through his bedroom as a virtual great ape for a few years now, I was excited to meet Smith and hear the complete Gorilla Ta

Emily Watson has a leading role on the series as Valya Harkonnen, one of leaders of the sisterhood that will become the Bene Gesserit. And during a new interview, Watson took a shot at Star Wars while praising her show's moral complexity.</p><p>"It was very exciting, but also very great to go into that world with the security of knowing I've got the skill set to make everything feel real," Watson told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-shows/dune-prophecy-star-teases-her-character-and-rejects-comparisons-to-star-wars-its-not-childish-its-not-like-star-wars/">Total Film</a>.

Getting into the makeup and prosthetics was a taxing experience, he said. Farrell said Penguin series creator Lauren LeFranc asked him if he would be up for playing Penguin again, if she could find a way "that makes sense." Farrell replied by saying he would consider it--but it wouldn't be anytime soon.</p><p>"I said, 'Absolutely.' And maybe in a year I would.

The visibility of some attack effects have been improved, and some of the boss's damage, stamina damage, and attack range of a few non-weapon-based attacks have been decreased. While the final boss is still challenging, the changes should help more players to overcome it.</p><p>The patch also applied some balance adjustments to PvP. It decreased the damage of Backhand Blades, Spears' dual wield attacks, and the Pata weapon against other players.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-elden-rin

The other players sprint over, swooping in like hawks, but I manage to snag the two kills before they can, so they jump back onto rooftops and boulders to wait for the next batch of baddies and try again.

<p>Worms Armageddon wiggled onto the gaming scene in 1999, and to celebrate its 25th birthday and re-release on consoles and PC, the turn-based strategy game is getting a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG6LX2Y4?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">collector’s edition </a>packed with physical goodies. A digital version of the game was launched on PS5, Xbox, and Switch earlier this year, but if you’re looking to snag a bunch of collectible goodies, the collector's edition that arrives on <strong>December 3</strong> is worth a closer look.</p><h2>Worms Armageddon Anniversary Collector’s Edition</h2><h3>$50</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4364954-image%2815%29%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4364954" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4364954-image%2815%29%281%29.png"><img alt="The Worms Arma

<p>Following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/">the official reveal of the PlayStation 5 Pro</a> earlier this week, the majority of the conversations about it have centered on its $700 price rather than its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/">advanced PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution technology</a>. This is understandable, since $700 is a lot of money to put down on a new version of a console that's only been out for four years. But as noted by former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, there's at least one way to get that price down. Or as they say in the spam ads, "one weird trick."</p><p>Ybarra pointed out a tactic that many fans had already thought about--namely trading in their existing PS5 models and effectively cutting the cost of a new PS5 Pro in half.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1833527742534500820" data-has-ima

<p>The new Xbox Game Pass tier, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-games-tiers/1100-6524825/">Game Pass Standard</a>, is officially available now for everyone, following an initial debut in August only for testers. The Standard membership includes "hundreds" of games for $15/month with some key differences between Game Pass Core and Game Pass Ultimate, including how Microsoft's new releases won't come to Game Pass Standard for some time.</p><p>Game Pass Standard is Microsoft's attempt to "give players more choice" when it comes to a subscription offering, the company said. As announced previously, Standard comes with all the benefits of Game Pass Core, including online multiplayer and a selection of games. One of the big distinctions is the Game Pass Standard library is substantially larger than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-xbox-game-pass-core-games/2900-5716/">Game Pass Core, which has 40+ games.</a></p><p>Game Pass Standard has a library
