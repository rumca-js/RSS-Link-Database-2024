<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want a cheap way to get multiple USB buses out of my raspberry pi zero 2w and was looking into this <a href="https://robu.in/product/usb2-0-expansion-module-hub-1-drag-4-interface-adapter-development-board-free-drive/">https://robu.in/product/usb2-0-expansion-module-hub-1-drag-4-interface-adapter-development-board-free-drive/</a> . I had trouble in the past with generic no brand USB hubs. I ended up getting a &quot;branded&quot; usb 3 hub but that ended up costing like 60% of the cost of the board itself. The site doesn&#39;t say much about the chip or compatibility either. Will this work with my pi?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NotACenteredDiv"> /u/NotACenteredDiv </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fe7z8k/will_this_usb_hub_module_work_with_my_zero_2w/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fe7z8k/will_thi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello and thank you in advance for your help. </p> <p>I&#39;m a little new to the pies but what I&#39;m working with is a pi 4 4gb.</p> <p>I installed 64bit os using the raspberry pi program. I then used the command line to install retropie. These are the instructions I followed. <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Manual-Installation/#:%7E:text=The%20RetroPie%20SD%20image%20is,order%20to%20run%20emulationstation%20">https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Manual-Installation/#:~:text=The%20RetroPie%20SD%20image%20is,order%20to%20run%20emulationstation%20</a></p> <p>After the basic install and selecting reboot. Is pretty much where I&#39;m stuck. Each time I either type emulationstation in the command line or click the shortcut i created in the preferences, it opens the command line breify, closes and nothing happens. </p> <p>I also have an update at the top right of my screen, and everything I select install up date, it gets an error. I can take a picture or
