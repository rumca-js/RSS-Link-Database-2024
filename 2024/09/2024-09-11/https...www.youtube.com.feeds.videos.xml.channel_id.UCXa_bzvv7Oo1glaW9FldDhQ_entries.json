NBA 2K25 may very well be the modern era's best due to its diverse selection of content, excellent presentation, responsive gameplay, and new features.\n\nThe City feels more organic than before; the various Eras offer extensive customization and avenues to relive historical moments; and MyCareer feels engaging. Even the on-court action is solid, though the Shot Meter can take some getting used to (some extensive options to customize it do help).\n\nMyTeam isn't as appealing to me, though Breakout is occasionally fun, and some mechanics like blocking feel ineffective. The whole pay-to-win structure also doesn't sit well, which is a tale as old as time with the franchise. Nevertheless, as far as being the ideal basketball title, NBA 2K25 is worth checking out.", "id": 1127479, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWU-PTc1wvI", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/FWU-PTc1wvI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "NBA 2K25 Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-11T15:30:20+00:00", "description": "Acts of Blood is an indie beat \u2018em up game in development by Eksil Game Studio. The game follows Hendra, a law student whose life is struck by tragedy when his family is killed by his father\u2019s business rival. Hellbent on avenging his family, Hendra faces the criminal underworld of Bandung. \n\nAs an indie fighting game, Acts of Blood shares similar game mechanics with other successful titles in the genre, namely Sloclap\u2019s Sifu and United Front Games\u2019 Sleeping Dogs. \n\nFor instance, Acts of Blood\u2019s melee combat is focused on using the environment against enemies just like Sifu while it also provides the players with firearms and parkour mechanics akin to Sleeping Dogs. Analyzing these similarities as well as Eksil Game Studio\u2019s new takes on the genre is the aim of this video.", "id": 1126126, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siFJ8_iSdj8", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/siFJ8_iSdj8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "This Game's BRUTAL COMBAT Will Instantly Remind You of Sifu And Sleeping Dogs", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-11T06:30:10+00:00", "description": "Sony has official revealed the PS5 Pro and along with it, a host of other details that you may not be aware of.
