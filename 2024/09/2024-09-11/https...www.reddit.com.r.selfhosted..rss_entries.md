<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>edit: i put unloaded in the title but i mean unbound</p> <p>Hey,</p> <p>so i originally only wanted to setup a jellyfin that is accessible from anywhere, but i thought about just connecting to my home network and use the jellyfin already running there, it&#39;s also a good way of extra security layer. I have setup wireguard on my raspberry pi, where also jellyfin and pihole (+unbound ) are running. If i connect to it, i can access the pi hole interface from anywhere, so local network communication seems like it is working, but when i connect to the internet, this does not work, the wg0 adapter does not seem to send (or is unable to send) packets back, when from the internet.</p> <p>Does anyone know a fix for this? I can share further information about this if needed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Distinct_Shift1043"> /u/Distinct_Shift1043 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfho

It has the Radeon GPU passes through to it and it can run fine with low settings. I want solid h265 and av1 encoding support for both the arr suite and the virtualized gaming setup, so i want to add the intel arc a770</p> <p>My question is what is the best setup for this GPU? My original plan was to just use it for the encoding side for the virtualized gaming and tdarr, and then run the games through the Radeon GPU, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s optimal. Would it be better to get rid of the Radeon GPU and just run the arc for everything? I&#39;m not that concerned about pricing for selling a GPU or the potential conflicts in resources if I&#39;m gaming and encoding a show or movie at the same time. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not sure how many people this may help, but wanted to post about how i was able to get my Fortigate IPsec VPN to work even though my IPv4 address is now behind CGNAT.</p> <p>The reason I created this project is because I use a fortigate router&#39;s IPsec VPN to access my home network resources when outside of my house. My ISP has changed me from a public IPv4 address to a IPv4 address behind Carrier Grade NAT (CGNAT) that prevents me from accessing my IPv4 address publicly. Luckily for me though, my fortigate router does have a publicly assigned IPv6 address assigned to the WAN port. Thanks to the IPv6 port, I can technically still access my home network resources, however basically all hotels I have ever used only provide IPv4 addresses which means I would not be able to connect to my VPN at those hotels.</p> <p>I tried setting up a NGINX reverse proxy but could NOT get it to work with the ports 500 and 4500 used by IPsec. I was able to get the NGIN

I want to start to self-host some services and there are some things I do not understand.</p> <p>I understand that there are 2 main possible ways to start, pick some old laptop/Raspberry Pi or purchase some server online on Digital Ocean/Linode...</p> <p>In the case of starting with an old laptop/Raspberry Pi, how do you access those services if you are outside of your home network? For example, if I want to self-host Searxng (the private search engine), how can I access it if I am outside of my home network? </p> <p>Another question I have is, what do you think is better for starting self-hosting, using the old laptop, or purchasing some cheap machine online? I am currently thinking of only 3 services to self-host: Bitwarden, Searxng, and Actual, and I am thinking that using a whole laptop for that maybe will be using too much power consumption, and the cost per month would be b

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m am preparing to build my first own NAS-Server and would like it to have double redundancy, as in that two of the four Drives can fail before Data loss occurs. When reading up on ZFS, i learned that one drive can be considered a spare, which means that upon a drive failing, the spare will automatically replace it until you replaced the fail drive. So technically you can also survive 2 Drive fails just like with Raidz2. The capacity would be the same either way. Based on what i read i would say the advantages are as follows: Raidz1 + Spare: The spare would be inactive most of the time, leading to a longer life and consequently a lower likelihood of two drives failing at the same time. Raidz2: More speed. Is that about correct ? Or are there other advantages/disadvantages?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/shouldworknotbehere"> /u/shouldworknotbehere </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I am currently researching about port forwarding and how safe it is and I&#39;m finding some mixed answers. It interests me for two reasons, I am considering hosting a simple website on a raspberry pi that I would want to have available to the public, it has a backend too so I can&#39;t just host on Github pages or something similar. And second I want to do some peer to peer file sharing for which at least one of the peers needs an open port, so having that will enable me to engage with more people. </p> <p>As far as I understood the danger lies in someone using the applications that are listening to the ports to gain access to my raspberry pi. It seems to me like this danger is brought up more when it is concerning self hosted websites, but port forwarding for an application like BitTorrent or Minecraft is considered a regular thing to do from what I can tell. What makes one more secure than the other? If I don&#39;t plan on exposing an SS

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was looking at minio and then <a href="https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/">https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/</a> and it looks nice for replacing S3, but then I thought the main reason I use S3 is that it&#39;s really cheap (or that it can offload bandwidth). If I could use a filesystem for the same price of storage I probably would. </p> <p>So if I&#39;m going to selfhost and choose not to use my storage as a filesystem, what would be the benefit? The only thing I can think of right now is that anything written to use the S3 APIs would be easy to migrate, but that&#39;s it. Is there anything else? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/williambobbins"> /u/williambobbins </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdwypz/people_selfhosting_an_object_store_why_looking/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fdwypz/people_selfhosting_a
