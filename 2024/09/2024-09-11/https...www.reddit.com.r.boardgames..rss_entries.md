<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A pre-game or intermission meal during a play session makes for a good time, especially if you whip up some themed eats. But I was always iffy on the thought of eating <em>during</em> a session. But that&#39;s just me. So, do you eat or drink while playing board games? Maybe water only? Perhaps you forbid finger foods? Or are you more &quot;anything goes&quot;? Perhaps food isn&#39;t even allowed in the same room? Maybe it depends on the game? Please, do share - Do you eat or drink while playing?

Then, I found out that TI3 is incredibly cheap on the second hand market; likely due to people upgrading. I&#39;m talking 1/6<sup>th</sup> of the price of TI4. Like, small card game cheap. Would that be a good way of testing out the experience?
