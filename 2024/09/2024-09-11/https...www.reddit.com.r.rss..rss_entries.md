<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have sought in vain for an Android RSS reader that fits my use case. I may wind up self hosting at some point in the future, but am I missing an obvious choice?</p> <p>Here‚Äôs my use case: when I travel, I want to download my feeds in full text and read them without an internet connection on long flights.</p> <p>There is at least one option on iOS (Unread) that would allow for this. Is there such a thing on Android? I see plenty of RSS readers with various levels of UI polish, and some which will fetch full articles if connected at the time of reading. Are there any that will allow me to download articles in full text in advance (even better if it will grab images as well) and cache them for offline reading without an active internet connection? Free or paid, I don‚Äôt care. I remember Press would allow this way back in the day but sadly it is no more, and feeds seem to be truncated intentionally more often nowadays which I suppose presents a problem t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>Trying to figure out the best way to get multiple articles onto my Kindle, currently playing around with Calibre.</p> <p>Anyway, I&#39;m on a news site, and have the RSS feed showing on Feedly. That just gives me like 10 of the most recent articles.</p> <p>However, the site has seperate sections - &quot;News&quot;, &quot;Opinion&quot;, &quot;Essays&quot;, &quot;Analysis&quot;, etc. What I want is the &quot;Essays&quot; feed, so that I can send all the essays, going back over a couple of years, to my kindle, without having to send them individually.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a way to see specific sections like this with RSS, or if you just have to accept whatever shows up when you add &quot;/feed&quot; to the end of a site&#39;s address.</p> <p>Help appreciated!</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/salty-bois"> /u/salty-bois </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://ww

## Looking for a calm RSS reader

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few months ago I read a post somewhere on the internet about some person who felt like their RSS reader was bombarding them with new entries to read, not skimming every single entry was like missing out, it felt like a second inbox next to your email that you had to clear out rather than a place to relax and read interesting stuff. That post really resonated with me. To combat this, they started developing their own RSS reader meant to meet their own needs. And it sounds like their needs overlap with mine. Unfortunately I can&#39;t find that post anymore, does anybody know what I&#39;m talking about?</p> <p>If you don&#39;t know the post I&#39;m talking about, please share in the comments which RSS reader you&#39;re using and whether you experience the reading as &quot;calm&quot; (whatever that means to you). I know that some readers have the option to disable unread counts on the feeds, but that&#39;s just one piece of the puzzle imho. Does your re
