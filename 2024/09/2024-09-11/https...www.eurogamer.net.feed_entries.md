With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>'s October release looming ever closer, developer BioWare continues its slow and steady stream of blog-sized info-nuggets and teases - this time revealing a little about exploration, alongside news of a photo mode.

Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/11/new-xbox-friends-and-followers-experience/">announced</a> it's bringing friend requests back to Xbox after more than a decade, with its new "friends and followers experience" set to go live for Insiders this week.
</p><p>
Xbox hasn't had friend requests since 2013, when - as part of its transition from Xbox 360 to Xbox One - Microsoft introduced a social-media-style system making it possible to follow activity feeds without the need for explicit approval. If the other party reciprocates, a follower becomes a friend, so both can chat, message, and game.
</p><p>
Soon, though, Xbox will introduce a more traditional "two-way, invite-approved" friend request system that Microsoft says will give users "more control and flexibility". This'll sit alongside the existing "one-way" follower syst

The console is a more advanced version of the PlayStation 5 that boosts its graphics capabilities, and even improves backwards compatibility with some PS4 games.</p><p>Yet the biggest catch of all is its &pound;700 price tag. What's more, with this being a digital-only console, the &pound;100 disc drive add-on is required for physical games, not to mention the additional &pound;25 needed for the optional stand just to hold the console vertically. That's a total of &pound;825 - without games, as well as the fancy TV necessary to really show off those extra pixels.</p><p>The reaction so far has been overw

The answer was surprisingly straightforward: users love 60fps performance modes, so why not serve that up with enhanced quality comparable to today's 30fps fidelity modes? It's an elegant solution for presenting a higher-end piece of hardware without making the standard model look lacking.</p><p>Beyond that, the marketing became significantly less convincing, culminating in a price-point that's so high, few saw it coming. We have entered the age of the &pound;699/$699 console, rising to an astonishing &euro;800 for our friends in Europe. This price rises still further
