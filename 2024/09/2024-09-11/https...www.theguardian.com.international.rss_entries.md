Truly, handshakes are a minefield</p><p>Nearly 40 years ago I was introduced to a builder called Ambrose in a very dodgy pub in Birmingham. The moment has remained with me partly because Ambrose struck me as an unusual name for a builder, but mainly because his handshake was so fierce it felt as if there wasn’t an unbroken bone left in my hand. I didn’t yelp out loud – it wasn’t a place for yelping – but my eyes were definitely watering. I had to lift my pint to my lips left-handed.</p><p>How firm should your grip be? I’ve been grappling with this question ever since I started shaking hands with people. When was that, I wonder. At what age do you begin shaking hands? There must be a moment when someone decides the time has come. This could be a parent, perhaps, who might see it as a rite of passage akin to teaching you to tie your own shoelaces, or tie a tie, or ride a bike, or open a bank account,

<p>Evading detention and ‘the convenience question’, stowing away and sweet-talking soldiers, Miller and her cohort were able to deliver some of the most striking reporting of the second world war</p><p>In August 1944, the photographer and war journalist Lee Miller was sent to France to report on conditions in the newly liberated port city of Saint-Malo in Brittany.

Far from being liberated, much of Saint-Malo was still a violent war zone, with US soldiers under heavy fire as they battled to dislodge the occupying Germans.</p><p>At this point in the second world war, around 200 women had, like Miller, gained military accreditation with the allied forces. Yet as Miller well knew, none of them were meant to be reporting on scenes of actual fighting, since their brief was simply to write the “softer” stories of war, about hospitals, air raid wardens and civilian heroism.

<p>Yes, I’m late to the Slough House party. But now that I’ve caught up on all four seasons, I feel silly. I’ve been missing one of the most sensational shows on TV</p><p>Although peak TV has officially peaked, there is obviously still far too much television. My job involves watching as many TV shows as I possibly can, and yet sometimes it feels as though I can only consume the very tip of the iceberg. Just when I think I’ve got a good handle on things, someone will send me an email saying, “Lou Diamond Phillips gives the performance of a lifetime in Not Without My Carrots, exclusive to the new Google Maps streaming platform, starting at just £75 per month,” and I’ll be back to square one.</p><p>What I’m saying is that we’re all bound to miss stuff from time to time.

<p>Keir Starmer says cutting the universal winter fuel allowance for pensioners is a ‘tough decision’ Labour has to take. But many of his MPs were not happy, as Peter Walker reports</p><p>Keir Starmer has been talking a lot about “tough decisions” since he became prime minister this summer. For some of his MPs, tough decisions came almost immediately – with a vote on the two-child benefit cap. Seven Labour MPs who rebelled against the party line and voted to scrap the cap found they had the whip removed.</p><p>Then the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced another controversial “tough decision”: the winter fuel payment paid to all pensioners to help with their heating bills was to be axed. The Guardian’s senior political correspondent <strong>Peter Walker</strong> says when MPs returned to their constituency over the summer they were left in little doubt of how worried it had left pensioners who were struggling to make ends meet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024

<p>Maura Delpero’s beautifully-made drama explores the complex dynamics of a sprawling family near the wartime border with Germany</p><p>Maura Delpero’s new film was a richly deserving winner of the Grand Jury prize at the Venice film festival this year and will now be a jewel of the selection at Toronto and anywhere else on the festival circuit. It is a richly compassionate, emotional and detailed drama of family secrets in the wartime Italian countryside, in the manner of Ermanno Olmi or the Taviani brothers. It is wonderfully acted with unaffected naturalism by its cast of professionals and newcomers and plays an extravagant, almost shameless pizzicato on the audience’s heartstrings.</p><p>The setting is the remote Alpine village of Vermiglio in 1944. Cesare is the village schoolteacher whose wife Adele (Roberta Rovelli) is continually pregnant: he is a white-haired, bespectacled man of fierce standards who also runs an adult literacy class and whose prestige in the community equal
