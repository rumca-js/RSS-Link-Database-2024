<p>It seems that Qualcomm sees Intel’s struggling business as a potential opportunity. The San Diego-based chipmaker has reportedly expressed an interest in taking over Intel “in recent days,” according to a new <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/qualcomm-approached-intel-about-a-takeover-in-recent-days-fa114f9d" data-original-link="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/qualcomm-approached-intel-about-a-takeover-in-recent-days-fa114f9d"><ins>report</ins></a> in <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em></p>
<p>Though the report cautions that such a deal is “far from certain,” it would be a major upheaval in the US chip industry. It would also, as <em>The WSJ </em>notes, likely raise antitrust questions. But Qualcomm’s reported interest in a takeover underscores just how much Intel’s business has struggled over the last year.</p>

<p>Danny Boyle’s zombie sequel <em>28 Years Later</em> was shot using several iPhone 15 Pro Max smartphones, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.wired.com/story/28-years-later-danny-boyles-new-zombie-flick-was-shot-on-an-iphone-15/"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Wired</ins></em></a>. This makes it the biggest movie ever made using iPhones, as the budget was around $75 million.</p>
<p>There are some major caveats worth going over. First of all, the sourcing on the story is anonymous, as the film’s staff was required to sign an NDA. Also, the entire film wasn’t shot using last year’s high-end Apple smartphone. Engadget has confirmed that Boyle and his team used a bunch of different cameras, with the iPhone 15 Pro Max being just one tool.</p>

Whether you’re training for your first triathlon or you want to step up your game from beginner to intermediate runner, a dedicated GPS running watch can provide a lot of benefits over a standard smartwatch. Faster and more accurate GPS can be one of those things, in addition to more advanced health metrics, more trackable workout profiles and extra-long battery life. And those are on top of standard “smart” features like phone notification alerts, virtual assistant support, onboard music storage and more. I’ve been a regular runner for nearly five years and I tested out a bunch of the latest GPS running smartwatches to find the ones that are actually worth your money.</p>
