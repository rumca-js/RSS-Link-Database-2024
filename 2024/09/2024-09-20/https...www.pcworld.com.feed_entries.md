<p>After kind of giving up on integrating Windows Copilot, now Microsoft may be kind of giving up on the Windows Copilot key, too.</p>



<p>In the latest build (Build 22635.4225) to the Beta Channel of Microsoft’s Windows Insider program, there’s a new control that allows you to remap your laptop’s Copilot key. Instead of launching Copilot, you can program it to launch another app instead, via a new control insider the Windows <em>Settings menu > Personalization > Text Input</em> setting. </p>



<p>The “Customize Copilot key on keyboard” setting is significant in two ways: first, it’s being rolled out in the Beta Channel, a good sign that it will be pushed to the Release Channel and then to ordinary PCs before long. Also, you don’t have to configure Windows to ask for the latest changes as soon as possible. Both indicate that Microsoft has pretty much settl

<p>If you’re looking to get yourself a quality ultrawide monitor without breaking the bank, this deal is for you: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-ViewFinity-Ultrawide-Borderless-LS34C50DGANXZA/dp/B0C6LSD69F/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samsung ViewFinity S5 is on sale for $240 on Amazon</a>, down from its $350 MSRP.</p>



<p>This is a 34-inch display with a 1440p resolution and a 21:9 ultrawide aspect ratio (that’s 3440×1440), providing a wide viewing area that’s great for work productivity and gaming immersion.</p>



<p>Moreover, the ViewFinity S5 has a refresh rate of 100Hz, which falls just short of the more ideal 120Hz but is still pretty good for gamers. (Far better than 60Hz, that’s for sure.) And thanks to HDR10 technology, it can display about a billion colors for great contrast and vivid images.</p>

<p>Browser extensions are useful because they bring additional functionality to your web browser, allowing you to do things like track price histories for online products, change CSS styling on certain pages, and, of course, block ads and other scripts that get in the way.</p>



<p>Well, browser extensions aren’t always coded well. Depending on what they do, they might have to run various types of analyses and/or make changes to a page before it loads — and if an extension isn’t coded well, all of that processing can slow things to a crawl.</p>



<p>That’s why Microsoft is currently testing an upcoming feature in the Edge browser that detects when extensions are impacting performance and warns you when said extensions are causing slowdowns.</p>



<p>The so-called “extension performance detector” will pop up on screen with details about which installed exte

<p>I wasn’t impressed with Keychron’s earlier Mac-focused mechanical keyboards, but the company blew me away when <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823922/keychron-q5-mechanical-keyboard-review.html">I tried the Q Series a couple of years ago</a>. Since then, it’s been a frequent feature in our best keyboard roundups.</p>



<p>And today, Woot is selling many of the initial Keychron Q designs — which can retail for over $200 — <a href="https://computers.woot.com/plus/keychron-mechanical-keyboards-5">starting at just $69.99</a>.</p>



<p>So, what’s the catch? These are the first-gen Q keyboards, which means they lack the Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless connections of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2231174/keychron-q-max-review.html">the new standard Q Max designs</a>. These are really only deals if you’re okay with a high-end board that needs a

<p>These days, wireless charging is about as convenient as it gets, and that’s true whether you have an iPhone or some other smartphone. But it kind of sucks when your phone is sitting on a pad and you can’t use it…</p>



<p>Which is why you need this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/INIU-Wireless-Qi-Certified-Sleep-Friendly-Compatible/dp/B08LVSFN4X/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">INIU wireless charging stand that’s on sale for $11.69 on Amazon</a>, down from its normal $27. (Make sure you clip the on-page coupon to bring the deal price even lower!)</p>



<p>This wireless charger looks great and easily supports your phone at an angle while charging, allowing you to keep an eye on the screen for notifications or maybe even watch YouTube as it charges.</p>



<p>The device has a 15W charging throughput, making it suitable for all smartphone brands.

## All games with loot boxes will be rated M or higher in Australia

<p>Loot boxes in video games and mobile games have become less of a flashpoint for controversy, but a few years ago they were a major target of ire for both gamers and regulators.</p>



<p>The wheels of justice (or at least of legislation) turn slowly, but they do turn, and Australia is making a big move in this sector. Starting this Sunday, any game sold in Australia with loot boxes will be rated either M (Mature) or R 18+ (Restricted).</p>



<p>For the uninitiated, loot boxes are essentially digital blind boxes. Gamers buy a loot box (or several) in the hopes of finding rare items, weapons, or character outfits. But actually getting what you want is pure chance… and chance that’s artificially slimmed down to an incredible longshot for the most rare and desirable items.</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/google-password-manager-passkeys-update-september-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google announced</a> that we’re now one step closer to a future without passwords: you can now use Google Password Manager on both Android and desktop devices to save <strong>passkeys</strong>, not just passwords.</p>



<p>Up until the announcement, passkeys could only be saved to Google Password Manager on Android. Those passkeys could be <em>used</em> on other devices, but you’d have to scan a QR code with an Android device with the Android app to actually <em>save</em> them to your account.</p>

<p>Even if your network knowledge runs deep there’s a high chance you haven’t heard of Nagle’s Algorithm. Named after its creator, John Nagle, this algorithm plays a part in the efficient operation of your router’s TCP/IP traffic.</p>



<p>That being so, savvy gamers have added it to a list of things to disable to decrease their network latency. Admittedly, it’s so obscure that taking the time to disable this setting, which is quite involved, places you squarely in Saturday night Windows Club kind of territory (you’ve been warned!).</p>



<p>Then again, when microsecond reductions in latency could be the difference between winning or losing in your next game of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, who’s going to judge you?</p>
