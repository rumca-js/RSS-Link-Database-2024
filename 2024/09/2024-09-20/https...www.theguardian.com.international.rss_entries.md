It wouldn’t be me; but it could be Kamala. History beckoned. But a whole lot of bigotry, fear and disinformation, not to mention the electoral college, stood in the way. Could we do it? Could we finally shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling and prove that in America there is no limit to what is possible?</p><p>When Bill and I heard the news that Biden was withdrawing and endorsing Kamala, we drafted a joint statement saluting him and endorsing her.

In taking two years to follow it with his debut album, the 27-year-old singer has probably lost a little momentum, but <em>OFA (Oxlade from Africa)</em> is extremely likable, delicate pop. Stars such as Dave and Popcaan feature, but Oxlade’s imploring vocal, trilling softly in spacious settings, is the focus.</p><p>It’s interesting that he positions himself so clearly as “from Africa”.

We used this to revisit south-east Asia – not to relive past travelling glories of my 20s (where my destinations usually revolved around partying). Instead we floated around the more “cultured” parts that were not on my radar in days gone by – South Korea, Japan, Taiwan (a revelation) and more remote areas of the Philippines and Indonesia.

<p>Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, alongside established stars, have helped the league reach a new level of popularity as the playoffs approach</p><p>As the NFL’s Colts clashed with the Packers in Wisconsin last Sunday, downtown Indianapolis was alive – but not because of football. Half a mile up the road from the Colts’ empty stadium, Gainbridge Fieldhouse <a href="https://x.com/cbrennansports/status/1835396134476333072">was filled to near capacity</a> for the WNBA matinee between the Dallas Wings and Caitlin Clark’s Indiana Fever. The game did not disappoint.</p><p>Clark, this year’s No 1 draft pick, scored a career-high 35 points to set the single-season rookie scoring record, and her free throws down the stretch helped preserve a 110-109 victory that locked Indiana into the playoff’s sixth seed.
