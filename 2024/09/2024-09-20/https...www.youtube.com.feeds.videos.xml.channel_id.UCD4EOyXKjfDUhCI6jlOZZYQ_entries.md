OpenCV is a computer vision framework that you can easily use with Python. You can use it on live video, or on still images.

This class will explain how OpenCV works, how to install and run it on your computer and how to interact with it with Python.

You'll learn how to trigger events based on real time video input, and more.

You can train OpenCV to detect what you care about, and it runs locally so Big Tech doesn't spy on you. You can even run it on systems as small as Raspberry Pi's.

The class will go over:
- Install OpenCV
- Use Python to control OpenCV
- Process Still Images
- Process Live Video
- Use HTML and CSS to create Bounding Boxes
- and more...
