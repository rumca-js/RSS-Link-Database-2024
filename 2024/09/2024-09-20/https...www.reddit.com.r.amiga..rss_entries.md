<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First of all, thanks for your help :)</p> <p>As far as I can remember, it was an executable file. There was only one effect. Some kind of copper carpet that flies and waves. The viewer (you) could see top and bottom depending on movement (under was darker like half bright). There was also a white line that moved across the carpet and went very fast. I also remember that the music really matched the scene.</p> <p>Can someone help me to find it please ? I spent a week trying and I need some sleep :D</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pablouchka"> /u/Pablouchka </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fliq5o/demo_scene_experts_help_to_find_the_name_of_a_demo/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1fliq5o/demo_scene_experts_help_to_find_the_name_of_a_demo/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, when it comes to Amiga keyboards can someone please explain what is meant by &quot;long enter&quot; and &quot;short enter&quot;? Is this a reference to the return key or the numpad enter key, and is it a reference to the size, orientation or some other characteristic? It is not obvious to me at all. Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deanodley"> /u/deanodley </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1flfsm2/amiga_keyboards/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1flfsm2/amiga_keyboards/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, total Amiga newbie here. The A500+ machine I have just acquired had no software at all with it. It boots OK to the kickstart menu with the rainbow logo, which I believe is 2.04 for the A500+. My question now is which workbench should I get? From my research it looks like the A500+ with KS 2.04 will support WB 1.3 and 2.05 but anthing further requires newer KS and possibly more RAM/faster CPU. Am I on the right track? Any advice and pointers would be most appreciated. Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deanodley"> /u/deanodley </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1flfk46/new_user_workbench_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1flfk46/new_user_workbench_question/">[comments]</a></span>
