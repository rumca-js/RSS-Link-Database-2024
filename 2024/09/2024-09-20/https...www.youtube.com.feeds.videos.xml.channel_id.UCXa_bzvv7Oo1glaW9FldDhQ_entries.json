The cyborg is, however, set to take the stage once more with the upcoming Khaos Reigns expansion, though this time, Cyrax is going to be a woman. \n\nNot only that, she\u2019s not a cyborg, but rather a human warrior who is equipped with the cybernetic armour and equipment that the Lin Kuei clan is outfitted with in this universe, thanks to its Master Armourer Sektor. Cyrax serves directly under Sektor in this new universe, but from what we\u2019ve seen so far, she is still going to have that independent streak that she has been known for in past universes. \n\nHow that impacts her story remains to be seen, but we\u2019re certainly curious to find out. Thankfully, we don\u2019t have much longer to wait, with Khaos Reigns set to launch on September 24.", "id": 1183733, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI4fkW3rgSA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/QI4fkW3rgSA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Komplete Story of Cyrax - Before You Play Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns [4K]", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-20T16:00:27+00:00", "description": "New Zelda games are always going to sell well. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, due on the Nintendo Switch on September 26th will be no different, despite some wholesale changes to its Switch predecessors Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. \n\nMost headline-grabbing is titular princess Zelda is at the helm as player-character, and with it she wields a unique magic wand which grants her power to conjuring copies of creatures and objects she encounters in Hyrule\u2019s overworld. \n\nThere\u2019s substantial intrigue preceding Echoes of Wisdom too.
