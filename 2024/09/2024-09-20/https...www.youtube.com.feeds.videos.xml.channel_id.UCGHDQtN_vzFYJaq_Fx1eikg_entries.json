Well, it depends actually. Here's how you can get away with it.\n\n\n\"Human cannibalism is the act or practice of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of other human beings. A person who practices cannibalism is called a cannibal. The meaning of \"cannibalism\" has been extended into zoology to describe animals consuming parts of individuals of the same species as food.\nAnatomically modern humans, Neanderthals, and Homo antecessor are known to have practised cannibalism to some extent in the Pleistocene. Cannibalism was occasionally practised in Egypt during ancient and Roman times, as well as later during severe famines. The Island Caribs of the Lesser Antilles, whose name is the origin of the word cannibal, acquired a long-standing reputation as eaters of human flesh, reconfirmed when their legends were recorded in the 17th century. Some controversy exists over the accuracy of these legends and the prevalence of actual cannibalism in the culture.\nCa", "id": 1184427, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeSQRtaOtuw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 447, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/SeSQRtaOtuw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "How to Enjoy Cannibalism Legally | Tales From the Bottle", "vote": 0}]
