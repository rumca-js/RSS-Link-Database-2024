At 59 years old, Kamala has shifted from being more radical than Bernie Sanders to no longer supporting the government entering your home and inspecting firearms. </p><p>Although there is no evidence besides her lying words to support that, you better believe it and ‘vote blue no matter who’ this November. </p><p>Kamala told Oprah what she believes Americans want to hear, which is that if

Last night, Oprah hosted a town hall meeting with Kamala Harris supporters. This event was painstakingly crafted to make Kamala Harris look good. It would not even surprise me if Kamala's staff wrote the questions the "attendees" asked.</p><p>Instead, Kamala tossed the word salad like it was a sixty-year-old mayor.
