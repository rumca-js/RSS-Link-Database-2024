<p>The US Department of Justice (DoJ) is set to wrap its case in the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3511465/is-google-a-monopoly-us-doj-begins-second-antitrust-trial-this-time-targeting-ad-tech.html">Google antitrust trial</a>, after an eventful two weeks in the courtroom.</p>



<p>The tech giant is accused of engaging in monopolistic behavior by strategically acquiring certain companies and controlling the adtech industry’s most widely-used tools and exchanges. The lawsuit was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies">filed in 2023</a> by the DoJ and a coalition of eight states seeking to “restore competit

<p>At the beginning of the summer, I saw a reaction video on Tiktok where two people who worked as product owners in IT talked about their jobs and what they do during the day. It would have been completely undramatic if it hadn’t been for the fact they were both working in the bright sun, in swimwear, in a pool, with their laptops on the edge of the pool. </p>



<p>The person who reacted to the clip was insane. “It’s people like you who ruin it for the rest of us,” he growled. “It’s stuff like this that forces us back to the offices.”</p>



<p>Recently, the debate about remote work and office presence has gained new momentum. </p>

<p>The European Union risks becoming an artificial intelligence backwater thanks to a “fragmented and unpredictable” regulatory environment that is damaging the technology’s development.</p>



<p>That’s according to a blunt <a href="https://www.euneedsai.com/#signatories">open letter</a> and newspaper advertisement signed by 49 executives, researchers and industry organizations, notably including the CEOs of SAP, Spotify, and Ericsson.</p>



<p>But it is the appearance on the list of two other signatories — Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg and its chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun — that frame the whole communication, which appears to have been Meta’s idea.</p>

<p>Disney will reportedly end its use of Slack for internal employee communications and migrate to Microsoft Teams after a hacking group stole and leaked more than a terabyte of corporate data.  </p>



<p>Disney CFO Hugh Johnson announced plans to move away from Slack in a memo to staff earlier this week, according to a <a href="https://www.status.news/p/disney-slack-hack?_bhlid=2e08c17fcf0f354fe97aeead04b747bf1e3f692d&utm_campaign=disney-s-slack-hack-fallout&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=www.status.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report Wednesday by Oliver Darcy</a> in the “Status” newsletter.

<p>IBM has apparently begun layoffs of as many as 8,000 people — layoffs that were announced back in January. But those layoffs are avoiding the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1628180/older-it-pros-pushed-aside-by-younger-h-1b-workers.html">age-related criticisms of IBM’s past</a> and are also too early to reflect the IBM-promised generative artificial intelligence (genAI) layoffs, according to Jason Andersen, a former IBM manager who today serves as VP/principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.</p>



<p>Andersen said his overall take on the layoffs is that “it was a bit of a yawn,” given <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-24-IBM-RELEASES-FOURTH-QUARTER-RESULTS">IBM’s Ja
