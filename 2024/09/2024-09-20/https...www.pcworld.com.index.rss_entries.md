<p>Yesterday, Microsoft announced in a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/windows-app-now-available-on-all-major-platforms/ba-p/4246939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> that Windows App has finally been released to the general public and is available for Windows, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and web browsers.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, Windows App is a “unified experience” that lets you securely connect to a Windows device from any other supported device. It’s a simplified way to connect via Windows 365, Azure Virtual Desktop, Remote Desktop, Remote Desktop Services, or Microsoft Dev Box. That means on most platforms you’ll end up replacing whatever remote desktop app you’re using with Windows App.</p>



<p>But that’s not all it does. Windows App a few more tricks up its sleeve that makes it a nifty tool for both

<p>Console gamers have a leg up on PC gamers when it comes to ease of use. Turn it on and your settings are mostly chosen for you with little fuss. From game to game, the overall experience is standardized — no need to worry if your PlayStation 5 can handle the latest releases.</p>



<p>As PC gamers, we may have more options, but that comes at a cost. There’s a real learning curve when it comes to configuring hardware and software to run games optimally, and developers have to play it safer as they’re forced to support a much wider range of specs. A game might not run on a given CPU and GPU combo, or if it does, it may run poorly.</p>



<p>Enter the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/">Nvidia App</a>, the successor that combines both Nvidia Control Panel and Nvidia GeForce Experience into one cohesive tool that simplifies configuratio

<p>I’ve written a lot about ad blockers in the last few weeks, from Google’s Chrome updates <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2423294/google-is-killing-one-of-chromes-biggest-ad-blockers.html">making some popular options inoperable</a>, to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2429437/four-ad-blockers-that-still-work-with-chrome.html">alternatives that will work</a>, to my reason for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2419276/i-block-every-ad-on-youtube-and-im-not-ashamed.html">blocking every ad on YouTube</a>. So when I was contacted by representatives from <a href="https://www.ghostery.com">Ghostery</a>, a German company that operates an ad-blocker extension and other privacy products, I was eager to pick their brains. </p>

<p>Windows licenses cost a lot—almost to the point of pain. Paying $139 for Windows 11 Home or $200 for Windows 11 Pro feels exorbitant when Linux is free, especially when that much money is easily a third of a budget PC build. Yet with less developer support for Linux, Windows is an inescapable necessity for most of us. </p>



<p>What’s <em>not</em> a given is paying full retail. Yes, it’s possible to snag a discount on Windows 11. How much you’ll save depends on how much hassle you can tolerate—as well as your circumstances. If you’re lucky, you could technically get it for free. Legitimately for free, since installing Windows without ever activating it doesn’t count as a full, sanctioned copy of the software.</p>



<p>Here’s how, in several different ways. Better yet, these strategies often apply for Windows 10 licenses too, although that operating syste
