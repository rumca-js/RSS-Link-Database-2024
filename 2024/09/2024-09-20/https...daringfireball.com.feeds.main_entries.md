<p>Austin Mann:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the past week we’ve traveled over a thousand kilometers
across Kenya, capturing more than 10,000 photos and logging over
3TB of ProRes footage with the new iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro
Max cameras. Along the way, we’ve gained valuable insights into
these camera systems and their features. [...]</p>

<p>The moment I learned about it, I knew exactly how I wanted to test
it: a photo shoot with Craig.</p>

<p>A few months ago, my friend Bobby Neptune introduced me to Craig,
one of the last remaining super tusker elephants roaming the
earth. He is unique not only because of his enormous tusks, but
also because of his extremely gentle demeanor and his curious
habit of often approaching safari cruisers. I knew if we were
lucky enough to find him, it might be a great opportunity to put
the new Ultra Wide sensor to the test.</p>

<p>Bobby got on the phone with David, a local maasai who tracks Craig
daily, and we met up with him to see if we could

<p>Speaking of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7Iz4Zr-z4">Leon</a>” Musk, here’s Victor Tangermann, writing for The Byte:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In March, the US government <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2195">accused</a> the founder of
Moscow-based company Social Design Agency of orchestrating a
“persistent foreign malign influence campaign” on behalf of the
Kremlin. The propaganda operation, dubbed “Doppelganger,” involved
spreading memes, deepfaked videos, and falsified documents online
to alienate the West from Ukraine and its leadership following
Russia’s 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>The company is <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/russian-misinformation-social-design-agency-sergei-kiriyenko-20240904.html">overseen by a top aide</a> to Russian
president Vladimir Putin, and has attempted to discredit Ukraine’s
military and political leadership by flooding social media with
propaganda.</p>

<p>And as it turns out, <a href="https://

## Cards Against Humanity Sues Elon Musk (SpaceX) for $15 Million

<p>Cards Against Humanity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have terrible news. Seven years ago, 150,000 people paid us $15
to protect a pristine parcel of land on the US-Mexico border from
racist billionaire Donald Trump’s very stupid wall.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, an even richer, more racist billionaire — Elon
Musk — snuck up on us from behind and completely fucked that land
with gravel, tractors, and space garbage.</p>

<p>Just look at it! He fucked it.</p>

<p>How did this happen? Elon Musk’s SpaceX was building some space
thing nearby, and he figured he could just dump his shit all over
our gorgeous plot of land without asking. After we caught him,
SpaceX gave us a 12-hour ultimatum to accept a lowball offer for
less than half our land’s value. We said, “Go fuck yourself, Elon
Musk. We’ll see you in court.”</p>

<p>The European Commission yesterday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, the European Commission has started two specification
proceedings to assist Apple in complying with its interoperability
obligations under the Digital Markets Act (‘DMA’). [...] Pursuant
to Article 8(2) of the DMA, the Commission may, on its own
initiative, adopt a decision specifying the measures a gatekeeper
has to implement to ensure effective compliance with substantive
DMA obligations, such as the interoperability obligation of
Article 6(7) DMA.</p>

<p>The first proceeding focuses on several iOS connectivity features
and functionalities, predominantly used for and by connected
devices. [...] The Commission intends to specify how Apple will
provide effective interoperability with functionalities such as
notifications, device pairing and connectivity.</p>

<p>The second proceeding focuses on the process Apple has set up to
address interoperability requests submitted by developers and
third parties for iOS and IPa

## Shohei Ohtani’s Game for the Ages

<p>Los Angeles Dodgers DH Shohei Ohtani entered last night’s game in Miami with 49 stolen bases and 48 home runs for the season. Only five other players in MLB history have ever hit 40 home runs and stolen 40 bases in a season. No player had ever achieved a 50-50 season.</p>

<p>Ohtani went 6-for-6, hitting 3 homers, stealing 2 bases, and knocking in 10 RBIs — thus breaking 50 in both categories in the same game. Unreal. It’s the second-greatest single-game performance by a hitter in baseball history. (Everyone knows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDMYVtzHGuI">the greatest</a>, especially Dodgers fans.)</p>
