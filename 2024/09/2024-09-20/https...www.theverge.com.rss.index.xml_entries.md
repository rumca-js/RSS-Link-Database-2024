  <p id="5tWmda">A former OceanGate contractor, Antonella Wilby, testified before a U.S. Coast Guard panel on Friday that the company’s Titan submarine, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23770260/titanic-tour-titan-submersible-catastrophic-implosion-oceangate">imploded last year during a dive</a> to the Titanic’s wreckage, relied on an incredibly convoluted navigation system.</p>
<p id="Jnpjva">As Wilby described it during the US Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation hearing, the Titan’s GPS-like ultra-short baseline (USBL) acoustic positioning system generated data on a sub’s velocity, depth, and position using sound pings. </p>
