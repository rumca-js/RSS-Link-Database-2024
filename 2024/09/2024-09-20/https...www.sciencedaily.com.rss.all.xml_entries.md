The Colorado River is a vital source of water in the Western United States, providing drinking water for homes and irrigation for farms in seven states, but the basin is under increasing pressure from climate change and drought. A new computational tool may help the region adapt to a complex and uncertain future.

Lasso peptides are natural products made by bacteria. Their unusual lasso shape endows them with remarkable stability, protecting them from extreme conditions. In a new study, researchers have constructed and tested models for how these peptides are made and demonstrated how this information might be used to advance lasso peptide-based drugs into the clinic.

A research team has developed a computational workflow for analyzing large data sets in the field of metabolomics, the study of small molecules found within cells, biofluids, tissues, and entire ecosystems.

## Fever drives enhanced activity, mitochondrial damage in immune cells

Fever temperatures rev up immune cell metabolism, proliferation and activity, but they also -- in a particular subset of T cells -- cause mitochondrial stress, DNA damage and cell death, researchers have discovered. The findings offer a mechanistic understanding for how cells respond to heat and could explain how chronic inflammation contributes to the development of cancer.

## A two-dose schedule could make HIV vaccines more effective

Researchers have shown that they can generate a strong immune response against HIV with two doses of a vaccine given one week apart.

## BESSY II: Heterostructures for spintronics

Spintronic devices work with spin textures caused by quantum-physical interactions. Scientists have now studied graphene-cobalt-iridium heterostructures at BESSY II. The results show how two desired quantum-physical effects reinforce each other in these heterostructures. This could lead to new spintronic devices based on these materials.

## Unlocking the potential of patient-derived organoids for personalized sarcoma treatment

Investigators developed the largest collection of sarcoma patient-derived organoids to date that can help improve the understanding of the disease and better identify therapies that are most likely to work for each individual patient. By using 3D mini tumor models that closely resemble a patient's tumor, treatments could be tailored more effectively, paving the way for more personalized cancer treatments.

## Wastewater monitoring can detect foodborne illness

First used in the 1940s to monitor for polio, wastewater surveillance proved such a powerful disease monitoring tool that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established the National Wastewater Surveillance System to support SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in September of 2020. Now, a team of scientists have shown that domestic sewage monitoring is useful for a foodborne pathogen as well.

## Demand-side actions could help construction sector deliver on net-zero targets

Researchers used a detailed mathematical model to demonstrate that the construction sector in the UK and Europe could almost eliminate its carbon emissions by 2060. This could be achieved through using state-of-the-art energy efficiency technologies to renovate existing properties and construct new ones.

## What role does a tailwind play in cycling's 'Everesting'?

Within the cycling realm, 'to Everest' involves riding up and down the same mountain until your ascents total the elevation of Mt. Everest. A new record was set a few years ago, but a debate ensued about the strong tailwind the cyclist had on climbs. To what extent do the tailwind help a cyclist as they climb? Should limits be set on the allowed windspeed?

## Inflammatory cells in tumor microenvironment promote the transformation of prostate cancer cells into treatment-resistant cells

There is a challenge related to prostate and many other cancers that cancer cells form resistance to treatments as the disease progresses. However, these resistance mechanisms are not yet fully understood. A new study found that inflammation-promoting immune cells, M1 macrophages, can transform cancer cells into stem-like cells and thus immune to treatment.

## European Green Deal: A double-edged sword for global emissions
