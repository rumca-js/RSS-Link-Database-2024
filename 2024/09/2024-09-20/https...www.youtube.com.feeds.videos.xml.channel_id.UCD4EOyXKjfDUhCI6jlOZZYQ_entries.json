You can use it on live video, or on still images.\n\nThis class will explain how OpenCV works, how to install and run it on your computer and how to interact with it with Python.\n\nYou'll learn how to trigger events based on real time video input, and more.\n\nYou can train OpenCV to detect what you care about, and it runs locally so Big Tech doesn't spy on you. You can even run it on systems as small as Raspberry Pi's.\n\nThe class will go over:\n- Install OpenCV\n- Use Python to control OpenCV\n- Process Still Images\n- Process Live Video\n- Use HTML and CSS to create Bounding Boxes\n- and more...", "id": 1184748, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg_RZ5t2OqQ", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 102, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCD4EOyXKjfDUhCI6jlOZZYQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zg_RZ5t2OqQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Python - OpenCV for Computer Vision", "vote": 0}]
