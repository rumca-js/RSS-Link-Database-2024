<p>Spurs manager enjoyed a stirring start to reign last season but is now enduring difficult questions from grumbling fans</p><p>Ange Postecoglou agrees because he knew just as well as anyone how it would have been painted. “Firstly, you can say that if we lost the other night, we would have been in crisis,” the Tottenham manager says. He is discussing the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/18/coventry-tottenham-carabao-cup-third-round-match-report">Carabao Cup tie at Coventry</a> on Wednesday, which came three days after the home loss to Arsenal, a result that left Spurs with four points from the opening four Premier League games.</p><p>Postecoglou had fallen at the first hurdle in last season’s Carabao Cup, going out on penalties at Fulham, having made nine changes to his starting XI. He swapped eight players at Coventry and there is no doubt that relief was the most prominent emotion when the substitutes Djed Spence and Brennan Johnson scored late goals for a 2-

<p>Grated apple and fresh blackberries bubbling under a lid of peanut butter crumble </p><p>I’ve got a similar recipe to this tart in <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/ill-bring-dessert-9781837830398">my most recent cookbook</a>. That version includes a rich peanut frangipane and is studded with fresh blackberries for something that is decidedly nut-forward. This recipe, however, leans much more to the fruity side, with the peanut butter crumble playing second fiddle to the blackberry and apple filling.

The vines are about 150 years old, their trunks as thick and gnarled as the arms of the countless generations who tended and cultivated them, built the dry-stone walls of its terraces and made wine using techniques unchanged for centuries. But, as young people turn their back on this heritage and head to the cities, those ancient skills, as well as the vines themselves, are under threat. In Sicily, as in so many wine-producing regions

<p>The musician, who died in 2021, shaped much of the sound of modern pop, from Madonna to Charli xcx. As her posthumous second album is released, her family and collaborators share memories of a producer who saw the future</p><p>Next week sees the release of the self-titled final album by the British artist and producer Sophie, who died in 2021, aged 34, after an accidental fall. In the years prior to her death, Sophie had gone from underground darling to genuine alt-pop star, thanks to her ability to fuse, through generational talent and sheer will, the immediacy of pop with a futuristic vision of experimental music. When she died unexpectedly, slipping while trying to gain a better view of a full moon, tributes poured in across the musical spectrum, from Rihanna and Vince Staples to Arca and Flying Lotus – a breadth of adulation that could only have been earned by someone who had touched the mainstream and the underground.</p><p>Posthumous albums are a dime a dozen, and often cash-

<p>The Premiership’s longest-serving director of rugby brushes off retirement talk as he focuses on returning Exeter to the top</p><p>Occasionally it is worth reflecting on what success in sport really looks like. Is it measured by silverware alone or by a much wider set of parameters – the long-term flowering of a club, say, or the depth of regional pride? The biggest compliment you can pay Rob Baxter, the Premiership’s longest-serving one-club director of rugby, is that once-unfashionable Exeter is now the last place where opponents want to kick off a brand new season.</p><p>In a decade and a half under Baxter’s stewardship, among other things, the Chiefs have yet to lose a round one game at Sandy Park, magnifying the challenge facing Leicester in the opening game of the Michael Cheika era.

<p>The oddest restaurant I’ve eaten in all year</p><p><a href="https://restaurantkod.co.uk/kod-soho/">Köd</a> (pronounced “cud” in Danish), tucked down St Anne’s Court off Dean Street in Soho, is a dark, cavernous Danish steak restaurant with the odd flash of neon faux glamour. In fact, it reminds me of nothing so much as a Wednesday goth night at a club called Ritzy’s in 1987; it’s also the oddest place I’ve eaten in all year.</p><p>Köd arrived in London in 2023, <a href="https://restaurantkod.co.uk/kod-city/">over in Liverpool Street</a>, and marketed itself as serving the very best of Nordic meats and experimental Scandi cooking: lobster with crisp pasta and daikon, cod ceviche with passionfruit vinaigrette, that kind of thing.

<p><strong>(Songvest)</strong><br>Pierson’s mellifluous vocals radiate positivity in a dozen bouncy tracks that skip giddily between electro-pop, rock, dance and disco</p><p>For nearly 50 years, Kate Pierson has been best-known as the mellifluous voice, mega-bouffant and keyboard player of the B-52s, as well as popping up on REM’s Shiny Happy People and Ramones’ Chop Suey or singing with Iggy Pop on Candy. She’s always sounded as if she’s enjoyed every minute, and says this second solo album is so bouncily upbeat because she “wanted to put out something positive in these dark times”. At 76, Pierson’s voice is still recognisably that of Love Shack; these dozen tracks, recorded with some of David Bowie’s later-period musicians, giddily skip between electro pop, Bangles-y rock, dance and disco.

<p>The actor was told to act like smoke by Terrence Malick and saw Peter Bogdanovich soak his cravat in iced water before he wore it. She talks about shooting with Kristen Stewart, investigative acting, and filming The Teacher in Palestine</p><p>Imogen Poots has a confession. “I drew a man’s penis too big recently,” she says, her anime eyes widening. The 35-year-old London-born actor is sitting at home in New York in an olive baseball cap. Willygate occurred at a life-drawing class she attends in Brooklyn. “The art teacher said I needed to get my proportions right, so I erased what I’d done. But then the model, who looked like a young Sam Shepard, came over and saw where the original penis had been, and realised it had been downsized.” She is pondering whether to find another class. “There’s a bunch all over the city but I’m running out of options.”</p><p>She already had to flee one through no fault of her own. “There was a man there who glommed on to the fact that I’m an actress.

<p>Some people are unable to use vitamin C skincare comfortably but there are ways round the problem</p><p>I use a vitamin C serum almost every morning. It gives my skin a brightness and glow, some antioxidant protection, what I believe is a beneficial effect on pigmentation and texture, and it generally agrees with my skin. But frequently I meet women who <em>want</em> to use vitamin C skincare, but have found they can’t – at least not comfortably.</p><p>Vitamin C – especially in the form of L-ascorbic acid, the purest, most evidenced but also least stable form in skincare – can be too punchy on sensitive skin types. But there are ways to deploy it more gently. CeraVe’s recently launched <strong><a href="https://www.cerave.com/skincare/facial-serums/skin-renewing-vitamin-c-serum">Skin Renewing Vitamin C Serum</a></strong> (£29) uses L-ascorbic acid but in a manageable 10% concentration, and buffers it with the brand’s signature complex of ceramides to cushion and comfort the skin bar

<p>Frequently absurd and heavy on le fromage, this French soap set in rival fashion houses owes a lot to the Roys – and turns out to be very good mindless TV indeed</p><p>If the pitch that got La Maison made didn’t mention Succession and Emily in Paris then I’ll eat my couture fascinator. This rich, occasionally sickly French soap, about the trials and tribulations of a fashion house called Ledu, is over the top, melodramatic and frequently absurd. It is heavy on <em>le fromage</em> and light on subtlety. Yet, despite its daft plot twists and self-important mood, it turns out to be very good mindless TV, as elegantly trashy as it is irresistibly moreish.</p><p>Vincent Ledu (Lambert Wilson) is the artistic director of a legendary fashion house which grew from humble beginnings as a small family atelier to become an international powerhouse. It is part of the French establishment, and Vincent cannot move for the honours that are bestowed upon him. That is, until he does a <a href="https

<p>On Tuesday, dozens of people were killed when electronic pagers blew up. The next day walkie-talkies exploded. What was the goal of the attacks? William Christou reports</p><p>On Tuesday, <strong>William Christou</strong>, a journalist reporting from Beirut for the Guardian, began hearing about simultaneous explosions across the city. Then videos began to emerge of small blasts in shops, cars and people’s homes. The death toll began to rise. Then came the extraordinary reason: electronic pagers, used by members of Hezbollah to communicate, had blown up, wounding their owners and whoever was nearby.</p><p>Israel was blamed by its critics and supporters alike and questions multiplied: how could such an attack have been carried out, and why now? Israel and Hezbollah have been trading attacks over the Lebanese border since the beginning of the war on Gaza, but this operation took everyone by surprise. Then came more deadly explosions – this time walkie-talkies blew up.</p> <a href="htt

<p>Saturday’s election will be the first since a people’s movement toppled the president. But other problems have proved harder to shift</p><p>Just over two years ago, a mood of both crisis and optimism gripped Sri Lanka. Across the Indian Ocean island, the population of 23 million people was enduring hunger, medical shortages and unemployment as part of the worst economic disaster in its history.</p><p>Yet there was also a ripple of hope. A youth-led movement known as the <em>aragalaya</em> (struggle) had successfully toppled the authoritarian president Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his powerful family dynasty, who were accused of bankrupting the country through corrupt deals and policies. Protesters overran Rajapaksa’s presidential mansion, lying on his bed, swimming in his pool and working out in his gym.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/20/sri-lanka-election-vote-hopes-revolution">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anger and nervousness abound on the Lebanese-Israeli border as uncertainty surrounds Hezbollah’s next move</p><p>The funeral was over almost as soon as it began. Women did not linger in their lamentations but marched directly alongside the pallbearers to bury the body. An overzealous Hezbollah staff member did not wait for them to finish before pulling the picture of their fallen comrade off the martyr’s shrine, eager to pack up. Ten minutes later, the crowd dispersed, filtering out past the ad hoc army checkpoints set up for the occasion in the southern Beirut neighbourhood.</p><p>The funeral – a far cry from the usual 90-minute long ceremonies to honour the Shia militia’s deceased – was one of dozens held across Lebanon on Thursday. One after the other, Hezbollah had issued a steady stream of funerary announcements as the death toll mounted from the operation, probably Israeli in origin, that blew up pagers and walkie-talkies on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep
