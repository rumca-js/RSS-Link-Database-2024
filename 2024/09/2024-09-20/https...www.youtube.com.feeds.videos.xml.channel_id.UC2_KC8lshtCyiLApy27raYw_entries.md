Star Wars. Got the lightsabers, the space wizards, pretty cool stuff. Honestly, I think most people kinda “get” Star Wars. Except for the people that own Star Wars, they have no idea what they’re doing. Over the past decade this brand, that was at one point pretty much the biggest “thing” on the planet, has now become an embarrassing disaster.


It takes a special level of incompetence to achieve this, and while I’m not the first to tackle this topic (and certainly won’t be the last), I feel like 2024 has been a uniquely awful year for Star Wars.


A big budget show, the acolyte got canceled before a second season amongst awful user reviews and low ratings.

 Star Wars Outlaws was a flop, to a degree where it’s caused some investors to question whether the game’s publisher Ubisoft should even stay as a public company.

And I just kinda wanted to talk about all of this.
