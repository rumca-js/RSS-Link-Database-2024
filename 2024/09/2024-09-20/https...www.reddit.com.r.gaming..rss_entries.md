<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just had an idea for a video game, one which I&#39;ll likely never be able to make, but I&#39;d still love to share it. This is one of a few I&#39;ve had, but I think this one in particular has some merit. </p> <p>We&#39;ve all played, or at least heard of, games like Phasmophobia or Lethal Company, where players go solo/in teams to explore a dangerous environment. Additionally, we all know about extraction shooters like Hunt: Showdown or Escape from Tarkov, which operate on a semi-similar concept, except the map is much larger and they have both PvP and PvE elements. After finally seeing Twisters this past weekend, I had a thought: why not make a game that mixes some of these elements, where players take the role of storm chasers?</p> <p>In my head, this game would take place in an expansive, persistent open world, where storms can appear anywhere, anytime. Players can ride solo or in teams, with tasks of photographing tornadoes, collecting meteoro

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently got on a puzzle binge and have played through The Room 1-4, Machinika: Museum and Machinika: Atlas (Newly released but super buggy, I don&#39;t recommend it until bug fixes are done). Looking for similar games to scratch the itch.</p> <p>I do know about the house of da vinci series. Already have it on my wishlist. Just waiting for a sale.</p> <p>I tried the original Myst game but it wasn&#39;t really what I was looking for. It was more of an adventure type game: do this and do that across a huge map.</p> <p>Other posts I&#39;ve seen have recommended escape room style games like the cube escape series but it&#39;s not what I&#39;m really looking for either.</p> <p>I am looking for more of a tinkering/dabbling type game. Where you interact with the doohickey/thingamabob/doodad/gismo/rube-goldberg type contraption until you figure out how it works and you solve the puzzle. Something about seeing mechanical components in action is so satisfying.<
