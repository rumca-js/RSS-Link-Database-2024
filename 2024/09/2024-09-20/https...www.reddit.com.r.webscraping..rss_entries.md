Just admit defeat!</li> <li>Selenium is cool and talked about a lot, but Playwright/Puppeteer/hrequests are new and better.</li> <li>Don&#39;t feel like you have to go with Python. The Node.JS scraping community is huge! And more modern advice than Selenium.</li> <li>AI will likely teach you old tricks because it&#39;s trained on a lot of old data. Use Medium/google search with timeframe &lt; 1 year.</li> <li>Scraping is about new tricks, as Cloudflare, etc block a lot of scraping tactics.</li> <li>Playwright is super cool! A lot of MS coders brought on from Puppeteer, from what I heard.

Sharing in case it helps others! <a href="https://github.com/phileasme/ProxyFilter">-&gt; *Proxy Filtering Library* &lt;-</a></p> <p>Full story:</p> <ul> <li>On Monday my provider locked up my server&#39;s IP address and flagged the events as network abuse.</li> <li>The culprit? Making an overwhelmingly large number of calls to dead proxies (oops, my bad).</li> <li>I created a simple tool to prevent this from happening again. Check it out :) *it&#39;s free ðŸ’µ</li> </ul> <p>What it does:</p> <ul> <li>Checks if addresses are alive</li> <li>Marks them as unrouted, behind Cloudflare, or invalid (likely unstable)</li> <li>Keeps track of everything, number of calls, providers, etc..</li> </ul> <p>This might be useful if you&#39;re:</p> <ul> <li>Using rotating proxies</li> <li>Pulling from multiple sources (like proxy lists)</li> </ul> <p>It&#39;s nothing fancy, it&#3
