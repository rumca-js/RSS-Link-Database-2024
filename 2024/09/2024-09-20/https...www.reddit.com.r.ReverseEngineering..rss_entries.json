I have this bluetootb thermal printer I bought for dirt cheap, I bought it with the intention of figuring out how it works and why its so cheap. My two first thoughts were embedded malware and poor quality. As an aside Its where my whole journey started; and everything Ive done has been to develop skills towards this. </p> <p>Ive had a minor break thru recently where I desoldered some onboard flash memory and read it with an XGecu t48, and Ive tried to analyze what Im assuming is the firmware. After doing this I quickly became confused. I ran strings on it and got a load of garble, I used binwalk and got 2 lzma sections, both of which could not be decompressed by the lzma package. Im very confused and Im wondering if its maybe encrypted.</p> <p>I have images of what Im talking about. The strings pretty much all look like that Ive looked for anything coherent.
