This app will have a reporting feature that exports some standardized documents (as in, the contents will be more or less the same) which contains data fully processed within the app. The current problem is, each client have different layouts for those documents and one of the requirements is that the clients can set their own layouts by themselves.</p> <p>Previously I already did something similar for another app, although it&#39;s only used by one client. I used a rich text editor (TinyMCE) embedded in the app to let the user define the document layouts by typing and placing predefined tags.
