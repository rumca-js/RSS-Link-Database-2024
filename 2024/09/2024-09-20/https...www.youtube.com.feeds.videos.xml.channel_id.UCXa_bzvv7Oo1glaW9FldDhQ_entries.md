Cyrax did not show up in Mortal Kombat 1, which launched last year and once again rebooted the series with another, entirely new timeline. The cyborg is, however, set to take the stage once more with the upcoming Khaos Reigns expansion, though this time, Cyrax is going to be a woman. 

Not only that, she’s not a cyborg, but rather a human warrior who is equipped with the cybernetic armour and equipment that the Lin Kuei clan is outfitted with in this universe, thanks to its Master Armourer Sektor. Cyrax serves directly under Sektor in this new universe, but from what we’ve seen so far, she is still going to have that independent streak that she has been known for in past universes. 

How that impacts her story remains to be seen, but we’re certainly curious to find out. Thankfully, we don’t have much longer to wait, with Khaos Reigns set to launch on September 24.

New Zelda games are always going to sell well. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, due on the Nintendo Switch on September 26th will be no different, despite some wholesale changes to its Switch predecessors Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. 

Most headline-grabbing is titular princess Zelda is at the helm as player-character, and with it she wields a unique magic wand which grants her power to conjuring copies of creatures and objects she encounters in Hyrule’s overworld. 

There’s substantial intrigue preceding Echoes of Wisdom too. The glittering purple rifts appearing across Hyrule were top of the game’s mystery list, although some questions have been answered following Echoes of Wisdom’s most recent trailer. Where the game sits in Zelda’s chronology is another topic discussed in this feature.

The PlayStation 5 features a vast catalogue of action-adventure games; games which perfectly blend the unbridled exploration and immersive storytelling afforded by adventure games with skilful combat and environmental puzzling affording in action games. 

Games of this type are right at home on PlayStation, as they have been for nearly three decades, and whilst many on this rundown were originally on PS4 their inclusion here speaks to how immaculate they were on Sony’s prior-gen console, and how they’ve benefited from PS5’s increased technical prowess. Worth noting for this rundown is that this list is presented without order. Each of these games deserve your time; in fact, a list of 30 probably isn’t substantial enough.
