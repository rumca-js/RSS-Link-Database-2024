Some time ago, info leaked of a new Like a Dragon game, only this one would be pirate themed. People laughed and brushed it off, but now Sega has revealed the game to be real. Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a legit game and is coming out next year. In other news, PC players are once again mad at Sony for forcing PSN linking on their PC games. God of War: Ragnarok, the highly-praised action game that hit PS4 and PS5 two years ago is finally coming to Steam, but just like most first-party Sony games, it requires a PSN account. Many gamers, especially those not in the U.S., are expressing frustrating since signing up for a PSN account, although free, can be a huge pain in the butt (not to mention all those times Sony was hacked and PSN info leaked out onto the internet).

The highly anticipated anime Sakamoto Days is finally coming to Netflix, and they gifted us with this new trailer for the upcoming series. Fans have been begging for the popular Shonen Jump series to be made into an anime for several years, since it popped onto the scene back in 2020. For the uninitiated, the story centers on a retired hitman who settles into a peaceful lifestyle with his family. But it gets disrupted when some of his former colleagues start gunning for him, so he has to come out of retirement and give them the business. While the trailer is very short, it gives us a great idea of the action we’ll see play out in the anime, with the titular hero, Taro Sakamoto, in a frenzy of beatdowns. The anime comes to us courtesy of TMS Entertainment. Masaki Watanabe is at the helm as director, and Netflix is currently slated as the only place you can catch the highly anticipated anime series, which is expected to drop sometime in January of 2025. With titles like My Hero Academia
