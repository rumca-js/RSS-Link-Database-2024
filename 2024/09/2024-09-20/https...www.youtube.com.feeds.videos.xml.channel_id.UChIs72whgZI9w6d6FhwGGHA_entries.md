We're reviewing the Tryx LUCA L70 computer case, which is from a new company with some major backing behind it in the industry. Asetek has put major marketing effort behind the Tryx Panorama cooler, its staff include defectors from players like Cooler Master and ASUS, and it just put its first case out. The LUCA L70, unfortunately, proves to be a catastrophic failure of both build quality and case design. Several oversights include thumbscrews in locations that cause threading into the wrong panels on removal, captive screws in areas that don't make sense, panels that aren't secure, loose grommets, drive cable management that points the cables the wrong direction, and incompatibilities that make it seem like no one ever tested all of the claimed configurations.
