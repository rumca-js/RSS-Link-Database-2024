<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! üëã</p> <p>Today I want to introduce Lazywarden, a tool I&#39;ve been some weeks developing to make your life easier if you use Bitwarden or Vaultwarden. If you&#39;ve ever wondered how to make your Backups and Imports of passwords automatic, secure and with as little effort as possible, including your attachments, this project is for you! <a href="https://github.com/querylab/lazywarden">https://github.com/querylab/lazywarden</a></p> <p>Why Lazywarden?</p> <p>We know Bitwarden is great for managing passwords, but sometimes it can be complicated to automate certain processes such as cloud backups, integration with other services, or just making sure your data is always safe on a local computer. Lazywarden comes to simplify all of this with one script that does the heavy lifting for you. üòé</p> <p>I&#39;m open to any kind of feedback, suggestions, or improvement ideas: feel free to share your thoughts or contribute to the project! ü§ù</p> <p>

I would like to use one for my own dynamic QR code links, but I have no idea what I am trying to do. When I search for info I don&#39;t know what I am looking for so I get too much garbage to sift through. I just need to host my own links that I can redirect to dropbox folders, (I want control just in case dropbox does something to a link). Most of my searches take me to &quot;free&quot; website builders, but I don&#39;t even know what terminology I should be using. In my head I would have a list of links that would have some sort of redirect that I can easily update if needed. Then I would keep a spreadsheet that has the QR code info and the dropbox link/file name. Does any of this make sense, if not, where should I ask this, and what should I ask?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about disaster recovery and how to handle it. By &quot;disaster&quot;, I mean something like the following. Middle of the night an electrical fire in your home starts, fire alarms blare, you wake up, grab your dog, and run butt naked out of the house, barely escaping with your life. All electronic devices - phone, tablet, laptops, servers, external drives, etc. are destroyed.</p> <p>A decent backup solution means you should have copies of your data stored externally, maybe at a friend or family member&#39;s house or in the cloud. But if you&#39;re security-conscious, access to those backups will be locked behind passwords and encryption keys. Those passwords and keys are likely stored in a password manager. If your password manager is self-hosted it&#39;s gone and all of your devices which have offline copies cached are also gone. If your password manager is hosted in the cloud it&#39;s still there, but you should have 2FA enabl

Goggle Picasso used to identify faces and tag images accordingly but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s around anymore. Is there any tool that even uses AI to know where pics were taken, etc. So I can search by name and location? Or even query, show pics taken at x restaurant or of grilled food, etc? Web based would be awesome so I can view my content anywhere, on anything. That would give much greater access to content since right now it&#39;s more snap a pic and forget about it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I currently have emby running under docker/unRAID on a Dell r530/630 can&#39;t remember I believe I have the 2697v4 it&#39;s the most performance based v4 CPU if I recall correctly. I have a second unRAID box that has a ryzen 5600g that is on the same network with a 10g link, my emby instance on the big server is running on nvme storage, would emby feel any faster if I move it to be running on the ryzen box and just hit the file share over the network to pull all the actual &quot;Linux isos&quot; or am I unlikely to see any performance boost. I am thinking emby only feels slow due to my Linux isos being on slow mechanical drives but I don&#39;t know how to tell if my host is actually holding it back. Thanks for any feedback on this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Squanchy2112"> /u/Squanchy2112 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fkz82z/container_host_question/"
