And if they are not women, why do we need the term “Cis-Female”? That is something the left cannot comprehend, which is why the woke City of Toronto intends to remove “male” and “female” from forms and replace it with “cis-male” and “cis-female”. </p><p>Adding the term “cis” in front of words is a way for the gender-bender bandwagon to justify their terms as if they are the normal ones. However, the fact that they demand the masses “affirm” their delusion at the expense of sanity proves otherwise. </p><p><br/></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The city of Toronto is planning to remove “Male” and “Female” from all forms and change it to “Cis-Male” and “Cis-Female” <br/><br/>“These changes need to be made in an emergency basis.” <a href="https

So think about what you want with that observation. </p><p>Comparatively, Melania is one of the most beautiful first ladies America

The border crisis, grocery and gas prices, cost-of-living increases, inflation, etc. It's been such a disaster that Joe Biden dropped out of the race because he wa
