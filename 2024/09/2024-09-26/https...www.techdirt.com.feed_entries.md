But things really came to a head last year when legal investigator extraordinaire, Kathryn Tewson, started digging in and [&#8230;]

One of the most horrific acts of police brutality has now resulted in two DOJ investigations. The first concerned the torture of Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker by six white deputies who referred to themselves as the &#8220;Goon Squad&#8221; for their willingness to break rules and violate rights. The first investigation involved the incident itself [&#8230;]

Among the key reasons Elon Musk insisted he had to buy Twitter were (1) that it was too political in how it was managed and how content moderation was done, (2) the company was not as transparent as it should be, and (3) it was too quick to censor. Since taking over, Elon has been [&#8230;]

We&#8217;ve talked a great deal about the trademark adventurism of famed burger chain In-N-Out.
