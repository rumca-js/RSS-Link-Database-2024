The latest entry in The Legend of Zelda series has you play as Princess Zelda in her very own adventure. The people of Hyrule are being stolen away by strange rifts that have appeared, with a certain swordsman among the missing. Team up with the mysterious fairy, Tri, and use the power of the Tri Rod to create echoes – imitations of things found in the environment. Then recreate those echoes whenever you like to solve puzzles and defeat enemies.

Here is the first 31 minutes of gameplay.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been delayed from November of this year to Feb. 14th 2025. In a statement posted to Twitter, the team cited the need to further polish and refine the experience, and to push some of its key features even further. Preorders for the game are being refunded, along with Ubisoft doing away with its traditional season pass model, allowing all future preorders to be given the first expansion for free. Remarking on this delay in a financial call, Ubisoft mentioned the learnings garnered from Star Wars Outlaws release, which led them to think about delaying Shadows to further tinker away at Shadows to make sure it is well polished and meets expectations.
