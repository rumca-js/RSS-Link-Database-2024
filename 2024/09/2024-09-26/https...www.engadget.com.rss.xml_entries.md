<p>Several news outlets that received the vetting dossier of the Republican vice presidential candidate leaked by hackers chose not to publish the sensitive document since it contained personal information.

The “fall <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Prime Day</a>” of sorts has served as the online retailer’s unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season for the past few years.</p>
<p>We expect most of the deals to be Prime exclusives, meaning you must be an active Prime subscriber to get the discounts. There are always a couple of deals available for everyone, though, so it’s worth perusing Amazon’s site even if you don’t pay for Prime. It’s also worth doing so now because we’ve found a number of solid early Prime Day deals already available. These are the best of the bunch; we’ll be updating this post regularly in the lead-up to October Prime Day, so check back for the latest deals.</p>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially issued its full recommended fine against political consultant Steve Kramer for a series of illegal robocalls using deepfake AI technology and caller ID spoofing during the New Hampshire primaries.

<p>Researchers have spotted an apparent downside of smarter chatbots. Although AI models predictably become more accurate as they advance, they’re also more likely to (wrongly) answer questions beyond their capabilities rather than saying, “I don’t know.” And the humans prompting them are more likely to take their confident hallucinations at face value, creating a trickle-down effect of confident misinformation.</p>
<p>“They are answering almost everything these days,” José Hernández-Orallo, professor at the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Spain, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03137-3" data-original-link="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03137-3">told</a> <em>Nature</em>. “And that means more correct, but also more incorrect.” Hernández-Orallo, the project lead, worked on the study with his colleagues at the Valencian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligenc

<p>LG has started showing screensaver ads on all its smart TVs, even expensive OLED models, according to an LG <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://lgads.tv/press_release/idle-time-is-not-wasted-time/">press release</a> and a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1727255253"><em>FlatpanelsHD</em></a> report. The placements appear before the regular screensaver activates.</p>
<p>On top of an ad for LG's own streaming channel, one <em>FlatpanelsHD</em> reviewer spotted third-party ads. The screensaver ads will appear "across the home screen, LG Channels and Content Store on LG smart TVs," according to LG. These are now turned on by default but can be disabled in the settings.&nbsp;</p>

However, I also get suspicious when the reviews are too good — there&#39;s no pleasing me, apparently — so I&#39;m relieved to hear that Google is making it easier to spot <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-competition-regulator-amazon-google-fake-reviews-095052267.html">fake ones</a>.
