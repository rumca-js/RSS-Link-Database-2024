<p>Sandro Tonali is ready for a start, Ipswich will be hopeful for visit of Villa and should Fulham be aiming for Europe?</p><p>Despite positive results, Newcastle’s performances have disappointed, so Saturday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/21/fulham-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">3-1 reverse at Fulham</a> was not a significant shock. Eddie Howe did not disagree with recent suggestions that his team had been deliberately “undercooked” in pre-season training to help reduce the injuries that dogged them in the spring. The only problem is that they currently seem unable to implement the high, hard press that has brought them considerable success under the former Bournemouth manager.</p><p><em>Newcastle v Manchester City, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)</em></p><p><em>Chelsea v Brighton, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>Brentford v West Ham, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>Everton v Crystal Palace, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>Arsenal v Leicester, Saturday 3pm</em

<p></p><p>Ange Postecoglou had talked about how keenly Tottenham felt their absence from European competition last season – a “real gap in our calendar,” as the manager put it. And so what was a further 35-minute wait?</p><p>It was a night of transport chaos around the stadium, overland trains suspended, roads blocked and kick-off delayed. It set the tone for a wild tie against Qarabag, Tottenham’s Europa League curtain-raiser featuring a red card for their centre-back Radu Dragusin inside seven minutes and countless close shaves in front of their goal. How did they manage a clean sheet? Guglielmo Vicario was a big part of the reason.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/26/tottenham-qarabag-europa-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This visceral film about the massacre at the Israeli Nova music festival is a nightmarish look at what the victims went through.

But once they got in their cars, traffic was at a standstill – Hamas militants had blocked the road out of the site. Increasingly frightened, some began to document their journeys on their phones.</p><p>This film, from the Israeli director Yariv Moser, uses those videos – in combination with Hamas body camera footage – to recount the su

<p>Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Shailene Woodley star in a very boring murder mystery streaming on Amazon</p><p>What might seem like a relatively easy ask on paper – the director of a buzzy festival hit adapting a Jo Nesbø short story with three likable and attractive actors set on the camera-ready island of Crete – has become a bizarrely effortful slog in the misshape of Killer Heat, a dull and predictable sunshine noir that wastes the time of those involved as well as ours.</p><p>Originally known as the far more appealing The Jealousy Man in print, the anonymously retitled mystery plays less like a real movie and more like a case-of-the-week episode of an ITV crime drama (without credits it’s not even 90 minutes long). Joseph Gordon-Levitt, revisiting similar yet considerably lesser territory to his role in Rian Johnson’s stylish 2005 thriller Brick, plays a run-of-the-mill private detective named Nick who is called to investigate a seemingly cut-and-dried death on a Greek island.

<p>Nonsensical article lacks Sewell’s authentic voice and is hateful way for paper to remember one of its best writers</p><p>Who knew the late art critic Brian Sewell was such a tediously cliched writer? Especially since some of the dead verbiage in the London Standard’s AI version of Sewell reviewing Van Gogh at the National Gallery has become common currency only since his death at 84 in 2015.</p><p>Give him credit, he had a voice. And it was a posh voice. Evidently the chatbot used by the Standard needs to be fed a lot more novels by Evelyn Waugh and Anthony Powell, some Latin perhaps, and a mouthful of plums before it can begin to resemble the public school-educated, Courtauld-trained Sewell, who started his career as the protege of the upper-class art historian and Soviet spy Anthony Blunt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/sep/26/london-standards-ai-imitation-of-brian-sewell-proves-art-critics-cannot-be-easily-replaced">Continue reading...</a>

This would pull the UK out of bottom place in the G7 league table for public investment, and would promote confidence in private investors that having skin in the game would mean the government would provide supportive policies to ensure healthy long-term

But at City Hall on Friday the battle over plans to build 39 new courts at Wimbledon will reach a potentially decisive point.</p><p>On one side of the net stands the AELTC, which will say that the expansion is needed to ensure Wimbledon remains the world’s pre-eminent tournament. However, that is disputed by local residents’ groups and MPs, who question why Wimbledon needs to almost triple in size from 41 to 115 acres and the legality of building on metropolitan open land.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/26/wimbledon-expansion-plans-decision-day-all-england-club-tennis">Continue reading...</a>

One in particular caught my eye in this attempt to set these two Iberian artists side by side. It’s Love and Death, from Goya’s series <em>Los Caprichos</em><em>.</em> A woman who is wild and haggard with grief cradles the corpse of the man she loved: in doing so, she holds him up, willing him to stand like a living body. It reminds me of Rego’s disturbing masterpiece The Family, in which a woman holds up the doll-like form of her paralysed husband, her face ambiguous and musing.</p><p>The Goya print she owned is surely a source for this painting that autobiographically dissects Rego’s marriage to artist Victor Willing, who had MS.

<p>This tasteless, grisly, state-of-the-nation tale is certainly bold. Who knows what it’ll be like when Travis Kelce makes his long-awaited acting debut later in the series?</p><p>It might seem odd to suggest that Grotesquerie, the latest show from the ubiquitous, never knowingly understated Ryan Murphy (who co-creates and co-writes here), is more downbeat than his usual horror fodder. There are four highly theatrical massacres in the first two episodes alone, and a body count so vast that the number of corpses might outweigh the members of the living, breathing cast. Yet it is different to many of his other projects, which tend to err on the side of spectacle for spectacle’s sake. This is clearly grappling for a grander narrative in the gothic horrors on display.</p><p>Those horrors are plentiful. Niecy Nash is Lois Tryon, a no-nonsense, hard-drinking detective with a complicated family life, all of which are the basic entry requirements for a female TV cop. You can practically see

<p><strong>Theatre Royal Bath<br></strong>Allen gives a capable performance in an arresting production that gives a chilling sense of state control – but the central romance fails to fizz</p><p>Seventy-five years after George Orwell wrote his dystopian masterpiece about a world in which a totalitarian state has criminalised freedom of thought, its questions about resistance and humanity seem no less powerful and pertinent. But there is high risk in adapting a story whose imagery and ideas have become so much a part of the cultural lexicon – from Room 101 to Big Brother’s all-surveilling eye.</p><p>This economically delivered production by Lindsay Posner keeps you gripped, although Ryan Craig’s adaptation flattens the book’s depth and speaks rather too prosaically, even daring to change the plot to circumvent some of the complexities of its staging.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/sep/26/1984-review-keith-allen-theatre-royal-bath">Continue reading...</a>

But mystifyingly, dismayingly, My Old Ass morphs into a gloopy, droopy, soupy young adult fantasy romance which finally fails to deliver its own ending, and we are denied the actual big finish, without which the entire story has been a pointless waste of time. (I suspect an earlier script-draft had that ending but Park had second thoughts.)</p><p>Park imagines a teen called Elliott (Maisy Stella), whose parents run a cranberry farm; it’s the end of the summer and she is about to begin university at Toronto, but is enjoying a glorious romance with a girl who works at a coffee shop.

<p>The Magnum photographer spent 20 years visiting his home city of Buffalo, capturing its harshness and hidden beauty – as well as a celebrity deer </p><p>Look at Magnum photographer Gregory Halpern’s images of Buffalo, New York and you’ll see stark contrasts and contradictions. It is a place full of obstacles and hardship: relentless snowfall that lasts for months on end; a decline of industry and population in the city’s postwar era; a lack of both infrastructure and opportunity.</p><p>In one image, vibrant wildflowers grow in thick, yellow-tipped swathes across the foreground of weathered industrial structures. A windswept wooden house leans sleepily, its vacant innards exposed to a flurry of snowfall. A single white deer gazes ahead, ears poised, focused as if bracing for danger.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/sep/26/photographer-gregory-halpern-home-hardship-us-rust-belt-buffalo-new-york">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Only Way Is Essex brought her fame – followed by vicious bullying and ridicule. Then she had to cope with a stillbirth. She discusses the difficulties of life in the tabloid glare</p><p>I walk past Lauren Goodger’s house twice trying to get my bearings before I spot it: a gleaming Range Rover, with a personalised licence plate. It’s the only trace of reality TV stardom on the Romford cul-de-sac where Goodger, 37, lives with her three-year-old daughter, Larose.</p><p>When the door swings open to reveal a woman in tiny black shorts and a matching tank top I ask, reflexively: “Are you Lauren?” and instantly feel foolish. It’s a ridiculous question. Goodger is one of the most-photographed celebrities in the UK today, a staple of tabloid newspapers and gossip magazines since The Only Way Is Essex (Towie)<em> </em>first appeared on our screens in 2010, and in so doing, created the enormously influential genre of structured reality TV.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-r

<p>During the first world war, Americans across society were expected to contribute. And that included baseball’s biggest stars</p><p>Great Bambino … Sultan of Swat … steelworker?</p><p>Yes, Babe Ruth, the man who would hit 714 home runs in Major League Baseball had a stint as a steelworker early in his career. Why the move to working for Bethlehem Steel in Lebanon, Pennsylvania? The career change was a result of a US government directive during the first world war called the Work-or-Fight Order: Eligible men had to either register for the draft or find essential work – such as at a steel mill. But there was a loophole for Major Leaguers like Ruth. Bethlehem Steel had its own baseball league and was all too happy to hire professional athletes, ostensibly for war-related jobs but actually to enhance its league’s competitiveness. This story rises from obscurity in a book published earlier this year – <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Work-Fight-Play-Ball-Bethlehem/dp/1439925178">Work, Fig

<p>A new book offers the first independent, comprehensive history of the cable channel that dominated the 2000s, from Lizzie McGuire to Miley to High School Musical</p><p>In late 2005, executives at the Disney Channel were caught off-guard. The cable channel had high hopes for High School Musical, one of its Disney Channel Original Movies (DCOMs), among the target demographic of so-called “tween” viewers, kids between ages nine and 12. The film, directed by Kenny Ortega, had slick choreography, original pop music, a diverse cast and palpable romantic chemistry between stars Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens. But no one, according to a new book on the millennial-beloved cable channel, expected it to transcend kids programming, long considered a cultural backwater both within and beyond Disney. “Despite what some executives later tried to say, that they saw it coming, they did not,” said Ashley Spencer, author of Disney High: The Untold Story of the Rise and Fall of Disney Channel’s Tween E

<p>A forensic accounting of the former president’s business empire reveals a reputation built on myth</p><p>Donald Trump started his career at the end of the 1970s, financed by his father Fred Trump. Over the years this transfer of wealth added up to around $500m in today’s money in gifts. My rough calculations say that, had he simply taken the money, leveraged it not imprudently, and passively invested it in Manhattan real estate – gone to parties, womanised, played golf, collected his rent cheques and reinvested them – his fortune could have amounted to more than $80bn by the time he ascended to the presidency in 2017.</p><p>And yet Trump was not worth $80bn in 2017. Instead, Forbes pegged him at $2.5bn – which, given the difficulties of valuing and accounting for real estate, is really anything between $5bn (£4bn) and zero (or less). It is in this sense that Pulitzer prize-winning New York Times reporters Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig call Trump a “loser”. He&nbsp;is indeed one o

Through the smog emerged a great modernist</p><p></p><p></p><p>‘Only an eye – but my God, what an eye!” said Cézanne of Monet. But no artist is only an eye. Posing as an innocent, unquestioning painter of the light that came to him gave Monet a helpful privacy, a professional facade, behind which he could explore wild poetic thoughts. His early masterpiece Impression, Sunrise presents itself as a simple view of dawn in the Le Havre docks, but it’s a Romantic meditation, as tentative and emotionally growing as a Wagner prelude. Shown at the first impressionist exhibition in 1874 it became an icon of this movement’s passion for painting reality, fast. It was only when Monet visited the Savoy Hotel in London three decades later, as the Courtauld shows in 21 paintings in two very intense rooms, that he rediscovered other,

It helped usher into the pop charts a new wave of black British club culture – think Soul II Soul and Massive Attack. But it was made by a mixed-race woman, one born in Sweden, one who had the nerve – and verve – to perform it on Top of the Pops while eight months pregnant.</p><p>After the worldwide success of her first LP, Raw Like Sushi, Cherry’s recording career has been a stop-start affair, long silences punctuated by eye-catching collaborations with the likes of the Avalanc

<p>Unfolding in what looks like a single take, Thomas Sieben sends his protagonist into a house that’s haunted by historical trauma</p><p>When Maria (Nilam Farooq) shows up 37 weeks pregnant at the attractive but remote country home of her husband Viktor (David Kross), you sense immediately that no good can come of this. If a character is pregnant in a film, it’s about even odds that said pregnancy will function as a way to increase their vulnerability – though not all films take this as far as this nifty little low-budget horror movie from talented German director Thomas Sieben, which combines the haunted house subgenre with pregnant-woman-in-peril to nicely nerve-jangling effect.</p><p>Occult horror always needs a starting point, a first evil from which the later ghosties and bumps in the night derive. Some films take as their inciting incident a broader historical crime or atrocity and it’s into this category Home Sweet Home falls. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herero_
