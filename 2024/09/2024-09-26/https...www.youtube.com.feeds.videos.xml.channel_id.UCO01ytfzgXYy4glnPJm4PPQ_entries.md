The cast of Hamilton came together to make a get-out-to-vote song, which they are billing as a nonpartisan get-out-to-vote song. But it's quite obvious that it's very partisan indeed. Also, in terms of the artistic quality, it is a travesty and a human rights violation, that I'm now going to inflict on all of you.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left is in mourning after a convicted murderer, guilty of brutally stabbing a woman to death, was executed. They have spun up a bunch of false narratives alleging that the man was innocent. But why are they coming to his defense? And why do they care so much about some criminals on death row, but not others? We'll discuss. Also, Kamala Harris sits down for her first solo interview since she stole the nomination. And she embarrasses herself, as expected. Plus, a couple of pastors and the guy who created Veggie Tales are the latest "Christians" to come out against my new movie.
