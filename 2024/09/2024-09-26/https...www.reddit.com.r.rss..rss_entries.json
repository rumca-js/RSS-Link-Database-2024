Not just mundane stuff like scrolling &lt;divs/&gt; either. For example, you can:</p> <ul> <li>Add/delete RSS feeds</li> <li>Create/rename folders</li> <li>Sort/filter feeds</li> <li>Navigate to a RSS feed</li> <li>Read its articles</li> <li>Extract all of the images from the article, and view them in a fullscreen gallery</li> <li>Toggle between dark-light modes</li> <li>Etcetera.</li> </ul> <p>We&#39;re a totally bootstrapped company with no investors (on a shoestring budget) so it&#39;s behind an email waitlist. This allows us to gauge how much our server costs increase as new users get onboarded to CoreText. That being said... I&#39;m hoping to onboard users as quickly as possible!
