## LG Smart TVs, Including OLEDs, Now Show Screensaver Ads

<p>Rasmus Larsen, writing for FlatpanelsHD:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While reviewing LG’s latest high-end G4 OLED TV (review here),
FlatpanelsHD discovered that it now shows full-screen screensaver
ads. The ad appeared before the conventional screensaver kicks in,
as shown below, and was localized to the region the TV was set to.</p>

<p>We saw an ad for LG Channels — the company’s free, ad-supported
streaming service — but there can also be full-screen ads from
external partners, as shown in the company’s own example below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Death comes for us all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon, Google, and Roku have long built their respective TV
monetization strategies around ads, and with LG and Samsung
turning webOS and Tizen into digital billboards, the only refuge
appears to be Apple TV 4K, which can be connected to any TV. You
can now disconnect your TV from the internet.</p>

<p>Gerald Lynch, editor-in-chief:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dig out your old iPod and fire up your ‘Songs to cry to’ playlist,
I come bearing sad news. After more than 15 years covering
everything Apple, it’s with a heavy heart I announce that we will
no longer be publishing new content on iMore.</p>

<p>I want to kick off by thanking you all for your support over the
many years and incarnations of the site. Whether you were a
day-one early adopter in the ‘PhoneDifferent’ days, came on board
with ‘The iPhone Blog,’ or recently started reading to find out
what the hell Apple Vision Pro is, it’s been a privilege to serve
you a daily slice of Apple pie.</p>

## ★ A Few Brief Thoughts on Meta Connect 2024

<p>I’ll link first to The Verge’s “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24250234/meta-connect-rayban-glasses-orion-ai-llama">Everything Announced at Meta Connect 2024</a>” roundup because Meta still hasn’t posted today’s keynote address on YouTube; best I’ve found is this recording of the livestream, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ezXhxAkhJfk?t=2598">starting around the 43m:20s mark</a>. I watched the most of the keynote live and found it engaging. Just 45 minutes long — partly because it was information dense, and partly because Mark Zuckerberg hosted the entire thing himself. He seems very comfortable, confident, and natural lately. Nothing slows an on-stage keynote down more than a parade of VPs. There was clearly no political infighting at Meta for stage time in this keynote. The keynote was Zuck’s, and because of that, it was punchy and brisk.</p>

<p>In terms of actual products that will actually ship, Meta announced <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s/">
