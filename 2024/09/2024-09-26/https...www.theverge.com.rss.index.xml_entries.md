  <p id="fAYnBI">California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law (<a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426">AB 2426</a>) to combat “disappearing” purchases of digital games, movies, music, and ebooks. The legislation will force digital storefronts to tell customers they’re just getting a license to use the digital media, rather than suggesting they actually own it.</p>
<p id="FWkQPr">When the law comes into effect next year, it will ban digital storefronts from using terms like “buy” or “purchase,” unless they inform customers that they’re not getting unrestricted acces

  <p id="v6Q71c">Google took a page out of a familiar playbook in court this week, defending itself from claims of anticompetitive conduct by raising security concerns. While the government argues it locked up the ad tech market to make more money, Google’s witnesses say that a more closed ecosystem is often safer for users — echoing a defense both it and Apple have made of their mobile app stores.</p>
<p id="mthekO">Google’s attorneys have spent the last few days mounting its defense against the Department of Justice. The company argues that conduct <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253293/google-ad-tech

Google will now <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/14114287">impose restrictions against business profiles</a> that violate the search giant’s Fake Engagement policy, such as temporarily removing reviews, blocking new reviews or ratings, and displaying a warning message on profiles that have had fake reviews deleted.</p>
