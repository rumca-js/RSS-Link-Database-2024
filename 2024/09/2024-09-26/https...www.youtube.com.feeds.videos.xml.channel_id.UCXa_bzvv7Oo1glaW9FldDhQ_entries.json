After feeling disappointed by The Awakened King and The Forgotten Kingdom, The Dark Horizon fares slightly better. \n\nThis new sector offers several vast canyons which require a glider to traverse. There are tough but fair new foes to tackle and challenging yet enjoyable enemies to beat. Of course, new rings, amulets, and weapons also await.\n\nIt still has shortcomings, such as the odd narrative, sometimes tedious exploration, lack of unique enemies, and one of the worst dungeon events ever. Nevertheless, it ends the DLC trilogy on a decent note while offering plenty to keep players grinding for a long while.", "id": 1219060, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6JDMzKKcG4", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 129, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/c6JDMzKKcG4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Remnant 2: The Dark Horizon Review - The Final Verdict", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-26T17:30:04+00:00", "description": "Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns features a decent but one of the weakest campaigns in the entire franchise.
