A 2020 microlensing event was caused by a planetary system with an Earth-like planet and brown dwarf. The star type was uncertain. The team has determined that the star is a white dwarf, a system resembling what our sun-Earth system will look like in 8 billion years. The good news: the planet survived its star's red giant phase, so maybe Earth will too. The bad news: it's still uninhabitable.

## Programming cells to target brain tumors

Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor, with an average survival after diagnosis of less than two years, and against which current treatments remain ineffective. In recent years, immunotherapies have given patients renewed hope, albeit with relatively modest success. A team has succeeded in identifying a specific marker on the surface of tumour cells, and in generating immune cells carrying an antibody to destroy them. Furthermore, these cells, called CAR-T cells, appear to be capable of targeting diseased cells in the tumor that do not carry this antigen, while sparing healthy cells.

## Unexpected immune response may hold key to long-term cancer remission

Results from a preclinical study in mice and a collaborative clinical study in patients show that the type 2 immune response -- associated with parasitic infection and thought to play a negative role in cancer immunity -- is positively correlated with long-term cancer remission.

## ESO telescope captures the most detailed infrared map ever of our Milky Way

Astronomers have published a gigantic infrared map of the Milky Way containing more than 1.5 billion objects -- the most detailed one ever made. Using the European Southern Observatory's VISTA telescope, the team monitored the central regions of our Galaxy over more than 13 years. At 500 terabytes of data, this is the largest observational project ever carried out with an ESO telescope.

## Light at the end of the tunnel for night shift workers

The use of circadian-informed lighting, where artificial lighting is synchronised to the natural biological rhythms or a person's 'body-clock', significantly improves quality of sleep and work performance for night shift workers, a major new trial has found. The trial is amongst the first tightly controlled in-laboratory studies to have simultaneously evaluated circadian-lighting effects on markers of body-clock timing, work-shift cognitive performance, and sleep following an abrupt transition to night shift work.
