The keynote was Zuck\u2019s, and because of that, it was punchy and brisk.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of actual products that will actually ship, Meta announced <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s/\">", "id": 1214260, "language": null, "link": "https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/a_few_brief_thoughts_on_meta_connect_2024", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 489, "source_url": "https://daringfireball.com/feeds/main", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "\u2605 A Few Brief Thoughts on Meta Connect 2024", "vote": 0}]
