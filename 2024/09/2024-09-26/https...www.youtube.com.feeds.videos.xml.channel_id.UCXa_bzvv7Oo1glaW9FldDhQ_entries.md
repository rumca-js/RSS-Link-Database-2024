Remnant 2's third post-launch DLC, The Dark Horizon, is available now, and while not the end of the shooter's support, it is the final paid content drop. After feeling disappointed by The Awakened King and The Forgotten Kingdom, The Dark Horizon fares slightly better. 

This new sector offers several vast canyons which require a glider to traverse. There are tough but fair new foes to tackle and challenging yet enjoyable enemies to beat. Of course, new rings, amulets, and weapons also await.

It still has shortcomings, such as the odd narrative, sometimes tedious exploration, lack of unique enemies, and one of the worst dungeon events ever. Nevertheless, it ends the DLC trilogy on a decent note while offering plenty to keep players grinding for a long while.

Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns features a decent but one of the weakest campaigns in the entire franchise. Featuring rich visuals and solid performances, Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns' campaign struggles with weird plot choices and pacing issues.

Along with Khaos Reigns, we also get access to six playable characters out of which only three are playable at launch. Sektor and Cyrax are great additions but the real star of the show is Noob Saibot.

Besides the story expansion and characters, animalities are also back after almost three decades and they are every bit awesome as you remember them.

Khaos Reigns in Mortal Kombat 1's new expansion, though "chaos is present" would perhaps be more apropos. Taking place after the base game, it sees Havik attacking the current timeline and causing havoc for Liu Kang and his warriors. But that's not all.

Bi Han has gone to the dark side as Noob Saibot; Sektor will follow her Grandmaster down whatever path; and Cyrax is conflicted about her involvement with the Lin Kuei. The multiverse shenanigans seen in the base game aren't as overt here, though players will encounter other variants that may need assistance.

But enough about the set-up - how does it all end? How does Liu Kang thwart the latest threat to Earthrealm? What does Havik even want? Do the Kamidogu, which haven't been seen since Mortal Kombat X, play a significant role in the current timeline? Find out all of this and more here.
