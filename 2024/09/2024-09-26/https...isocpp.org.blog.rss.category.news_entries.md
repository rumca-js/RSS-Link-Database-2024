		We often discuss mutexes as the basic building blocks of concurrency. However, there are more fundamental concepts upon which concurrent programs and synchronization primitives are constructed. The C++ language defines a memory model, which describes how programs behave when multiple threads are involved. Additionally, C++ introduces atomic operations that serve as foundation for working with data across threads, ensuring both safety and performance. The goal of C++ atomics is to closely
