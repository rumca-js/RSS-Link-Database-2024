I started played a lot of Yahtzee and Farkle with my gf and my family, and I also learnt how to play Mahjong, so I came up with a few ideas. Bear with me. 1. Tunnel dice Beer face can be used as a wild in tunnel sequences, but it can never be used as a 1 (one peep side) nor more than one beer can be used for the same tunnel, you can use multiple beers for multiple tunnels though. 2. When using magic dice you can spend all the magic symbols in it on just one die. But if you choose to do so, then you must only reroll that one die, even if the magic die has more than one magic symbol on it. You may stop when you reach your desired die face or when the magic symbols (rerolls) run out. 3. Tunnel dice have farkle rules now (a few). - When scoring at the end of a round, if you have 3 dice showing the same amou

It had two scenarios that I know of that each had their own deck of cards, one scenario was set on a cod fishing ship which I believe was called the Abigail or the Annabelle or something like that. There was a map of the ship included so you could tell where everyone was and you would take turns drawing cards until you changed into a new section of the story with each section having it&#39;s own deck of cards. I also remember the games way of saying put this card in the graveyard deck being &#39;send them to the deep&#39; when a character died.

I thought maybe the publisher knew about this and put fewer 1&#39;s on the dog cards, but taking a quick look, it seems like 1&#39;s appear just as frequently with no bias to account for the dice odds.

I was thinking about getting Horrified but it seems similar to Eldritch Horror in a lot of ways and I don&#39;t know if my group will like it or if it&#39;ll seem redundant and with little new to offer.</p> <p>For those of you who have played both, what do you think? Is Horrified worth it? What about the challenge? Can it be as difficult and replayable as Eldritch Horror?</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zakro"> /u/Zakro </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fplr1c/is_horrified_worth_it_if_i_already_played/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fplr1c/is_horrified_worth_it_if_i_already_played/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts and reasoning! </p> <p>For me, I&#39;d start with <strong>Harvest</strong> (the japanese title) because it has hit 100% of the time. Easy to get, immediate interaction and laughs</p> <p>Next, I&#39;d probably want to go with something cooperative, and nothing grabs attention of my casual friends than <strong>Horrified</strong> </p> <p>I&#39;d likely go with <strong>Can&#39;t Stop</strong> next if I know they energy for 4 games. Easy to understand and is just gambling and pushing your luck that always amuses.</p> <p>Finally I&#39;d definitely choose <strong>Coffee Rush</strong> as it is so easy to understand. the falling order queue gets people stressed to just run and collect ingredients and it&#39;s maybe my favorite entry level game because people unfamiliar with the hobby don&#39;t know games can be this exciting.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/StuTeacher82">
