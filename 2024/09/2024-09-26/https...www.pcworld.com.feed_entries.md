<p>If you’re a Gen Xer or Millenial who used to listen to music on your Windows XP computer back in the 2000s, you probably have fond memories of the llama-whipping Winamp.</p>



<p>Though it was <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/448729/the-end-of-an-era-winamps-shutting-down.html">discontinued back in 2013</a>, it was <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/826186/winamp-gets-first-release-decade.html">picked up by new owners a few years ago</a> and re-released for a comeback that never quite crystallized. And then earlier this year, those new developers <a href="https://about.winamp.com/press/article/winamp-open-source-code">announced that Winamp would be going open source</a>.</p>



<p>Well, that day has finally come. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/winamp-releases-source-code-asks-for-help-modernizing-the-player/" target=

<p>Maybe your gaming laptop doesn’t have enough storage. Or you simply want an easy way to make your game library portable. An external SSD can fix both of these issues (and more) by providing an easy way to expand storage that you can take on the go.</p>



<p>But choosing an external SSD means sorting through a dizzying array of options, and making a poor choice can leave you feeling hard done by. Lucky for you, we’ve done the testing and can offer some sure-fire recommendations that are guaranteed to help, and not hinder, your gaming setup.</p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust us:</strong> We are PCWorld. Our reviewers have been putting computer hardware through its paces for decades. Our external drive evaluations are thorough and rigorous, testing the limits of every product — from performance benchmarks to the practicalities of regular use. As consume

## This Dell deal marks the cheapest Copilot+ laptop we’ve seen yet

<p>When Chris Hoffman <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2415368/dell-inspiron-14-plus-7441-review-another-copilot-pc.html">reviewed the Dell Inspiron 14 Plus</a> earlier this year, he liked the Snapdragon-based laptop a lot… but he also thought it was too pricey at $1,100. “Wait for a sale on this one,” he wrote.</p>



<p>Well, that sale is now here: <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-inspiron-14-plus-copilot-pc-14-qhd-touch-laptop-snapdragon-x-plus-16gb-512gb-ssd-ice/6584131.p?skuId=6584131">Best Buy is selling the Inspiron 14 Plus with Copilot+ capabilities for just $750</a>.</p>



<p>That’s already a pretty good deal for a laptop with 16GB of RAM and a 1440p screen, but it’s notable because this is the best price we’ve seen for a laptop that qualifies for fancy Windows 11 Copilot+ features.</p>

<p>You don’t need a massive desktop PC for a powerful gaming or home office setup these days. Mini PCs have come a long way — and if you don’t need the portability of a laptop, a mini PC can provide much better performance at a given price.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ACEMAGIC-AD08-i7-11700B-1165G7%E3%80%91-Computers/dp/B0CY296GG6/">this Acemagic AD08 mini PC that’s on sale for $303 on Amazon</a> is astonishingly good for the price, especially now that it’s knocked down from its $449 MSRP.</p>



<p>There’s nothing miniature about this mini PC’s performance. Under the hood, it sports an Intel Core i7-11700B processor, a solid 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 512GB SSD. All of that amounts to a fast machine with ample storage for all your games, movies, and photos.</p>



<p>What’s really great about this Acemagic mini PC is that if you want

## Meta’s new Quest 3S is the VR headset I wanted last year

<p>The Meta Quest 2 remains the most popular VR headset in the world, at least if we assume that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Steam’s hardware survey</a> is an accurate indicator of the VR headset market.</p>



<p>And it isn’t even close: With 38 percent of the userbase, it has more than double the market share of Valve’s own PC-focused Index HMD. So, why is Meta’s newer and far-more-advanced Quest 3 headset so far behind its predecessor at just 17 percent in the same survey?</p>



<p>The answer is obviously its price.</p>



<p>The Quest 2 is still the cheapest standalone VR headset you can find at most retailers, including crucial brick-and-mortar stores where VR headset demos are at least possible, if not commonplace. And it can be connected to a gaming PC with Steam, giving it more fun

<p>Do you want a huge amount of usable display space, but without the hassle of a double-monitor setup? An ultrawide monitor is the ticket. Ultrawide monitors have a wider display panel that provides an immersive experience and far more screen real-estate than your average widescreen. </p>



<p>I’ve tested a bunch of ultrawide monitors in order to name the best picks in various categories ranging from those optimized for gaming to those suited for professional use. Below you’ll find a curated list of my favorites in each category. I describe my evaluation process for monitors at the bottom of this article, or for even more details, see the article on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2285790/how-we-test-monitors-at-pcworld.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2285790/how-we-test-monitors-at-pcworld.html">how we test monitors

<p>Intel has been struggling with a major issue in its 13th- and 14th-generation Core CPUs for most of this year. Due to a production error, high voltages and temperatures led to crashes for users and permanent damage in the processors, affecting overall service life.</p>

<p>The technology industry over the last few years has felt a lot like an episode of the original <em>Power Rangers</em>: It’s <a href="https://youtu.be/-0OAPheMuJs?t=17">AI, AI, AI</a>. Artificial intelligence already had a nebulous and inconsistent definition here in the real world (almost everything we’re calling “AI” now is machine learning, not AI in the science fiction sense), <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2341361/ai-is-now-a-meaningless-term-thanks-cooler-master-thermal-paste.html">but it’s getting truly ridiculous</a>.</p>



<p>The latest perpetrator of questionable AI branding? HP. The company is introducing “Print AI,” what it calls the “industry’s first intelligent print experience for home, office, and large format printing.”</p>



<p>What does that mean? It’s essentially a new beta software driver package for some HP printers. <a hre

<p>It’s one thing to have a power bank that can charge your phone while on the go. It’s another to have one that can charge both your phone and your laptop. But it’s next level for a power bank to be able to fast-charge multiple laptops and phones at the same time.</p>

<p>This is a seriously impressive power bank that features 250W of charging output across three ports: two USB-C ports (with max 140W output) and one USB-A port (with max 65W output). The charging rates go down slightly when multiple ports are in use at once.</p>

<p>News that <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/">GOG.com</a> has delisted 29 games this month is a sobering reminder that at any moment the games you own could vanish from your PC game libraries at any time and there’s not much you can do about it.</p>



<p>Admittedly, GOG’s games include titles that many gamers may not have heard about. But history has shown that this happens to well-known titles too and on platforms with millions of users like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-app">Origin</a>.</p>



<p>So how is it that something you’ve legitimately bought can be whipped away in a heartbeat? Don’t we have consumer protection laws against that?</p>

<p>Take it from me—I’ve been tracking SSD and storage deals for well over a decade, and have been covering them for PCWorld since 2016. The list you’ll see below considers not just capacity and speed, but also online reviews from tech sites like ours (when available), user feedback, and price history.
