They have spun up a bunch of false narratives alleging that the man was innocent. But why are they coming to his defense? And why do they care so much about some criminals on death row, but not others? We'll discuss. Also, Kamala Harris sits down for her first solo interview since she stole the nomination. And she embarrasses herself, as expected. Plus, a couple of pastors and the guy who created Veggie Tales are the latest \"Christians\" to come out against my new movie.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n00:00 - 00:33 Opening \n02:34 - 24:03 This Man Confessed to His Brutal Crimes\u2026 And They Still Call Him 'Innocent'\n24:50 - 30:30 Kamala Had Her First Solo Interview\n30:31 - 35:12 NYC Mayor Eric Adams Indicted In Federal Corruption Case\n35:13 - 43:14 Hamilton Cast Sings Cringey \"Go Vote\" Song\n45:24 - 1:01:02 These \"Christian\" Podcasters Are Canceled\n\nEp.1451\n\n- - - \n\nBe", "id": 1219357, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BarxSL2e5U", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 212, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCO01ytfzgXYy4glnPJm4PPQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/8BarxSL2e5U/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Ep. 1451 - This Man Confessed to His Brutal Crimes\u2026 And They Still Call Him 'Innocent'", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-26T17:00:24+00:00", "description": null, "id": 1219358, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js9iQmpba5A", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 26, "page_rating_contents": 82, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 212, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCO01ytfzgXYy4glnPJm4PPQ", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Js9iQmpba5A/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "It's not that complicated to listen to the cops", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-26T00:00:08+00:00", "description": "An MSNBC reporter is shocked and appalled to discover that normal voters don't care at all about January 6th.\n\nBecome a DailyWire+ member and watch the full show: https://bit.ly/4bEQDy6\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos every day. https://www.youtube.com/c/MattWalsh?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch the full episode here: https://youtu.be/nGCLINgqIws\n\nStop giving your money to woke corporations that hate you.
