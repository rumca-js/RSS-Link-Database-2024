<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys, my Pi 4 (Raspbian) HDMI 1 port doesn&#39;t output anything. HDMI 0 works fine, but it has that ugly problem with terribly slowing down Wi-Fi speeds (even on 5Ghz), so I wanted to try with HDMI 1, but as I said I get no output. How do I solve?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ihadtosubscribe"> /u/Ihadtosubscribe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fq15jb/raspberry_pi_4b_hdmi_1_not_working/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fq15jb/raspberry_pi_4b_hdmi_1_not_working/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have ordered 3 identical micro SD cards from Aliexpress. Formated all on my PC and put my baremetel OS image on all 3 cards. PC reads all cards without any problems, but only one of them works in my Pi Zero. What can be the cause that between 3 identical cards only one works on Pi Zero ? One that works boots like it should, green LED blinks and everything else works like it&#39;s intended, with other two LED is off all the time. Tried with more than one Pi Zero, result is allways the same.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bedroom-Organic"> /u/Bedroom-Organic </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fpqc9m/problem_with_micro_sd_cards/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1fpqc9m/problem_with_micro_sd_cards/">[comments]</a></span>
