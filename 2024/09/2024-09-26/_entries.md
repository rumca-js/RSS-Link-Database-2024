## Dark matter could have slight interaction with regular matter, study suggests

The reason we call dark matter dark isn't that it's some shadowy material. It's because dark matter doesn't interact with light. The difference is subtle, but important. Regular matter can be dark because it absorbs light. It's why, for example, we can see the shadow of molecular clouds against the scattered stars of the Milky Way. This is possible because light and matter have a way to connect.

Rabies is a deadly disease. Without vaccination, a rabies infection is nearly 100% fatal once someone develops symptoms. Texas has experienced two rabies epidemics in animals since 1988: one involving coyotes and dogs in south Texas, and the other involving gray foxes in west central Texas. Affecting 74 counties, these outbreaks led to thousands of people who could have been exposed, two human deaths and countless animal lives lost.

The impending expiry of a U.S. licence permitting transactions involving the pillars of Russia's financial infrastructure could make it harder and costlier for Russian businesses to deal in Chinese yuan, sources engaged in imports and payments told Reuters.  The yuan, which hit a near-one-year high against the rouble on Wednesday, has become the most traded foreign currency in Moscow since Russia's decision to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022 sparked sweeping Western sanctions and a ramping-up of Russia's de-dollarisation policy.  With Chinese banks wary of the secondary sanctions risks of dealing with Russian entities blacklisted by Washington, and the Bank of Russia reluctant to continue pumping in yuan liquidity through FX swaps, some importers fear that payment issues between Russia and China could worsen.

Russia, the world's leading wheat exporter, is expanding its Baltic Sea ports as it aims to boost agricultural exports by 50% by 2030 while reducing dependence on traditional Black Sea routes, officials and executives said.  The country, which exported at least 72 million metric tons of grain in the 2023/24 season, is looking at new markets in Latin America and Africa to diversify from its traditional grain markets in North Africa and the Middle East.  It has relied on its Black Sea ports to handle booming agricultural exports for the past decades but the conflict with Ukraine has made the area risky for shipping with both sides regularly striking each other’s facilities and infrastructure.
