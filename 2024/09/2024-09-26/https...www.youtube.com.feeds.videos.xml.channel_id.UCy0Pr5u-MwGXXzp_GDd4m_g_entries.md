Did I hear you asked for another rejected SNL audition? You got it! ...Why do I continue auditioning for a show that clearly doesn't want me you may be wondering? Guess I'm a glutton for punishment... also now you all get to enjoy my failed attempt at impressing Lorne.

Criteria for an SNL audition tape:
Has to be under 5 minutes
Has to show off your writing ability
Has to show original characters
Has to show as many impressions as possible
