<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this month, fans of the wild cult fantasy movie <em>The Fall </em>got <a href="https://www.polygon.com/trailer/448140/the-fall-movie-4k-streaming-mubi">what seemed like the best news imaginable</a> — Tarsem Singh’s 2006 magnum opus has been restored in 4K and will begin streaming on MUBI on Sept. 27. That release marks the end of a long period of unavailability for the film, which was both out of print in physical copies and was not streaming or available digitally. But MUBI announced on Thursday that <em>The Fall</em> is also coming to American theaters, with nationwide event screenings starting Tuesday, Oct. 15.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One issue with handing out annual awards for games, and naming a game of the year, is that some of the most played games on the planet don’t slot neatly into an annual schedule at all. Many are enjoyed well past their year of release; in fact, many don’t reach their peak of quality or audience size until years later. These include games designed and engineered to be a perpetual “live service,” like <em>Fortnite</em>, but aren’t limited to that category. In the age of the patch, almost any video game can be a living, evolving thing, and newness isn’t the sole preserve of new releases. What if the best game you played all year actually came out years ago?</p>

It isn’t how you’d expect to be introduced to Goro Majima, perhaps one of the most popular characters in the <em>Like a Dragon</em> series, but it sets the tone. Polygon was invited to a recent hands-on preview to get a taste of what <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza</em> in Hawaii would have in store — and it’s a story of Majima on the down and out, on a path to become the greatest pirate the world has ever seen.
