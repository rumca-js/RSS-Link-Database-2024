When I initially switched the computer portion of my </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/news/jammer">rhythm stage setup</a> over to a Raspberry PI I
went with a 32GB SD card because 

<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html">that's
recommended</a>.  But I don't need very much space for what I'm doing
and a bigger SD card makes copies slow: the cheap cards I've been
using take me 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/duplicating-rasberry-pi-images">over an
hour</a> to write with my Mac's card reader.

I recently made some changes to my setup, <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/keyboard-gremlins">removing support</a>
for bass whistle on the PI (now that I have an <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/embedded-whistle-synth">arduino-based version</a>) and adding
support for <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/simultaneous-footbass-and-footdrums-ii">more
foot-bass options</a>. This normally means round of re-imaging all of
my SD car
