When Marvels Wandavision first kicked off on Disney+ fans across the MCU were enthralled in the world Scarlett Witch had created for herself.  It seemed the MCU was expanding and fans everywhere had theories about where Marvel was headed after Wandavision.  The biggest push was the appearance of Evan Peters as a cliff hanger late in the season. Fans of Marvel immediately saw this as a potential X-Men crossover event that would bring the Merry Mutants to the MCU.  But what Wandavision gave us might have been the biggest slap in the face from any Marvel movie up to that point.
