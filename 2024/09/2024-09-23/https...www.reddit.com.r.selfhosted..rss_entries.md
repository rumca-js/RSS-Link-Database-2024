<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys,</p> <p>I have a few older scanners that support Scan to Email functionality but don&#39;t support newer TLS/SSL for this. Furthermore, the email provider I use doesn&#39;t support older TLS, but supports SMTP through port 25. It works, but I don&#39;t really like the idea of my scans going out of my network without the best security they can. Is there any selfhosted service that would accept scans from local devices and forward them/resend them to the SSL provider? Meaning that service would connect to the SSL provider, not the local devices.

The container is behind NGINX proxy manager, which, of course, uses ports 443 and 80.</p> <p>If this is simply resolved by stricter firewall rules, what more can I do without making the software unusable?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My buddy and I both self host services out of our homes with our public IPs, and I was considering having him roll up a VM for me to setup uptime Kuma and monitor my instance from his end, especially since we have different internet providers! When I started thinking about it I realized I wasn&#39;t sure how I would accomplish it the way i originally considered, because I had just planned on running SWAG and uptime Kuma in docker and routing it through my cloudflared domain. But he uses 80/443 for his domain, is there a way to change what port cloudflare points back at and be able to have both our reverse proxies running? Or is there a better way that still allows us to have our separate domains? Ideally we would probably do this reversed on my end for him as well in the end.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LegendofDad-ALynk404"> /u/LegendofDad-ALynk404 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Has anyone successfully set up Authentik with Caddy using Docker? I&#39;m having some trouble, and since I&#39;m fairly new to this, I&#39;m struggling a bit. I&#39;m encountering the blank page issue with Caddy.</p> <p>I can access Authentik directly via IP and port, and all the Authentik-related containers are running without problems. However, I&#39;m unsure what&#39;s going wrong with the proxy configuration in Caddy.</p> <p>The Authentik containers are on the same network as Caddy, as expected. I also have other applications running fine with Caddy, so I’m not sure what the issue is. Could I be missing something in my Caddyfile?
