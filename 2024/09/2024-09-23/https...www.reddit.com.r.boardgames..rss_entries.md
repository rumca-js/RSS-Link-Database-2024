<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I am looking for recommendations for a solution to store sleeved cards that no longer fit in the inserts that come with the game. I have done plastic bags on some games, but some games such as ISS vanguard, Oathsworn, Etherfields, etc have sorted trays with divider cards that tell you what that section is. Trying to find some kind of product that would fit this use case for various games. The card size is pretty standard, maybe ever so slightly smaller than a regular card.</p> <p>I looked on amazon for 3x5 index card holders but they waste quite a bit of room and the tabs have to lay down sideways or they&#39;ll get crushed when closing any lid. There is also a lot of wasted space, but not enough to get a divider and create a second row. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/iYTMkxz">https://imgur.com/a/iYTMkxz</a></p> <p>Not really looking for a specific insert for each game, but more of a solution that could work for games that have si

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Tom, Mike and Zee from Dice Tower all have it in their latest top 100 (Zee even at #1), the crowdfunding campaigns get millions of dollars, and many people seem to own a copy. Is this a case where the IP is largely the reason why a product is so successful or is the game truly excellent? What explains the craze? I don&#39;t know whom to trust. Some say it&#39;s so easy and boring, others say you can make it as hard as you want, thus, it&#39;s also enjoyable for more experienced players.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking at their latest campaign, DC Heroes, and the highest package already has <strong>hundreds</strong> of cards and figurines. That&#39;s insane to me for a new game. Is it really such a rich and replayable system? How does it compare to other superhero games like Marvel Champions and Sentinels of the Multiverse?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We were going through some old board games at my parents place and came across a version of a game called Wheeler Dealer. Apparently there&#39;s four levels of the game that you can work up to. We only played level one. It was similar to Monopoly, but with some slightly different mechanics and honestly I think more fun. </p> <p>It seems like the company that made this was selling customizable versions for fundraising purposes sometime in the &#39;80s. Basically a town could get businesses to buy spots on the board as advertising space and then sell the game for fundraising. </p> <p>It was a fun nostalgic trip since about half of the business don&#39;t exist in my hometown anymore. Just curious if anyone else has come across a version of this and what the other levels of the game entail?

Out of those 6 only 1 ended with a human victory and it was a 4 player game (larger human to hybrid ratio than a 3 or 5 player game) and the 3 humans had played the game before while the hybrid was playing for the first time. Even still it was a pretty close match.</p> <p>I realize 6 games is not enough to determine with any certainty if the game is balanced or not, but some things we think are true: </p> <ul> <li>the hybrid becomes so powerful once they reveal themselves that there is no reason not to do so.</li> <li>sometimes it feels like the humans are perfectly capable of losing the game by themselves without the hybrid having to do much because the game is so punishing by itself</li> <li>4 and 6 player games would

Like which one has the Wingspan card, which one has the Can&#39;t Stop card, etc.? </p> <p>Basically, is there a list somewhere that lists which cards are in which version?</p> <p>And if anyone has played both, which one do you recommend?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Games from the Cellar</strong> covers <strong>Camel Up</strong> this episode, and it is much crazier than normal on the microphones. Perhaps a bit too much chocolate before recording.</p> <p>We get a little more philosophic in this one, about what a game could be, what it should be, and what makes some games great and other games bad, even when they&#39;re essentially the same game. Winner&#39;s Circle enters the room and opinions become a bit more animated. Chris almost earns a one-game misconduct via our &quot;<strong>no trite cliches, ever</strong>&quot; rule, and Ed, again, likens the discussion to Soviet era politics. Definitely covered some ground in this one in spite of it being so short.</p> <p>This may be our best episode to date, one that was almost lost, rediscovered on a sim drive that was about to be deleted. Give a listen if you like, <strong>in your podcast app</strong> or via the handy-dandy link below.</p> <p><a href="https://

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not an exhaustive review but I had sent my friend a Slate interview about this game, and she instantly bought. We’ve played twice now and really enjoy it. It is pretty balanced, fairly quick, and fun. First game we were sort of confused how to use “candy”, the game’s euphemism for drugs, but durning the second game, we were popping candy often. Pay attention to your manager power, don’t forget it. However, this might be an area where it seems unbalanced; some managers seem better than others, but maybe our players just used them more effectively, or perhaps some other combination of job, rocker, and other circumstances just made them golden at that time.</p> <p>Deep strategies? No, just straightforward play and good times. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wynlyndd"> /u/wynlyndd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fnkg6i/rock_hard_1977_a_darn_fun_game/">[link]</a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am not the most confident in my board playing skills. So, I tend to second guess a lot and sometimes I take up a few seconds more to finally make a move and continue thinking of what steps I can take later in the game so I can win. I even do this when I am about to win and my opponent has almost no way of suddenly beating me. The reason I do this is because I always think my opponent has a chance of beating me somehow even if it seems impossible. </p> <p>I am not doing this to drag out the win. I just think my opponent has chance of suddenly getting me and I lose. I don’t care about losing either. It is more like I want to win a game like everyone else so I am trying my best but of course if I lose, then I lose and I don’t make a big deal about it. </p> <p>Anyway, does anyone have advice on how to be aware of when you are taking time to make a decision even when you are about to win? It has led to frustrating situations so I want to make sure I stop

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I&#39;m thinking of hosting a birthday party (adults ages ~28-40) with approximately 8-12 people. I would love to do something like a murder mystery, but I have no idea which companies are good to order materials from. I would also be open to any other game that might provide a similar experience - something interactive that a decently large group of people could enjoy. </p> <p>I&#39;ve also thought about using something like Love Letter or Werewolf and leaning into the different roles (e.g. picking a theme I want and having people loosely dress up). </p> <p>Any thoughts or ideas would be super helpful.
