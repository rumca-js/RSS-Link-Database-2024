## Show HN: Who Should Be the President?

<p>Hi HN!<p>I made a live presidential polling website with real-time electoral results. Votes can be changed at any time until the poll closes. Only visitors from the USA can participate. Congressional district is detected automatically.<p>The idea is to enable a coordinated voting process, where selections are non-binding and negotiable rather than blindly cast once. Kind of like a presidential caucus, but national and over the Internet.<p>The infra is Fastly & DigitalOcean. Backend is a Django service running on DO App Platform with Postgres. Fastly is used for edge logic, captcha, geo location, and pushing updates to the page (Fanout). In theory it should be able to handle millions of participants.<p>Note: since my previous post, I've added a way to close the poll after a time period. I realized that without some kind of time boxing it was unclear what the point is or how long to participate.</p>

## We fine-tuned Llama 405B on AMD GPUs

<p>Hey HN, we recently fine-tuned the llama3.1 405B model on 8xAMD MI300x GPUs using JAX instead of PyTorch. JAX's advanced sharding APIs allowed us to achieve great performance. Check out our blog post to learn about the cool sharding tricks we used. We've also open-sourced the code: <a href="https://github.com/felafax/felafax">https://github.com/felafax/felafax</a><p>We're a small startup building AI infra for fine-tuning and serving LLMs on non-NVIDIA hardware (TPUs, AMD, Trainium).<p>Problem: Many companies are trying to get PyTorch working on AMD GPUs, but we believe this is a treacherous path. PyTorch is deeply intertwined with the NVIDIA ecosystem in a lot of ways (e.g., `torch.cuda` or scaled_dot_product_attention is an NVIDIA CUDA kernel exposed as a PyTorch function). So, to get PyTorch code running on non-NVIDIA hardware, there's a lot of "de-NVIDIAfying" that needs to be done.<p>Solution: We believe JAX is a better fit for non-NVIDIA hardware. In JAX, ML model code compil

<p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming-in-java" rel="nofollow">https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming-in-j...</a><p>This book is a distillation of everything I’ve learned about what effective development looks like in Java (so far!). It's about how to organize programs around data "as plain data" and the surprisingly benefits that emerge when we do. Programs that are built around the data they manage tend to be simpler, smaller, and significantly easier understand.<p>Java has changed radically over the last several years. It has picked up all kinds of new language features which support data oriented programming (records, pattern matching, `with` expressions, sum and product types). However, this is not a book about tools. No amount of studying a screw-driver will teach you how to build a house. This book focuses on house building. We'll pick out a plot of land, lay a foundation, and build upon it house that can weather any storm.<p>DoP i

## Show HN: Interactive map of the convenience store "turf war" in Japan

<p>Technologies used: Leaflet (frontend) Turf (Geojson generation and Voronoi generation)<p>I noticed that my neighborhood is all Lawsons, so I got the location of all Conbinis and ran some basic analysis to see if these pockets of brand territory are common.<p>I haven't worked much with web frontends before, so feedback is welcomed. I also have some ideas to maybe expand upon, like making the territory calculations based on streets and other geographical features rather than just beeline distance.<p>The site isn't tested too much on mobile yet, but should be ok.<p>Currently the frontend code and geojson files can be found at the public repo: <a href="https://github.com/kikkia/ConbiniWars">https://github.com/kikkia/ConbiniWars</a>. I will upload the backend code soon as I am cleaning it up and reorganizing it.</p>

<p>Hey Hacker News,<p>I’m excited to share a tiny service that’s very close to my heart - Today Has Been.<p>Here’s how it works: We have a phone number that has WhatsApp Business API enabled. Your messages sent to this number (after you activate your free trial) are added to your journal. It’s a super light weight journaling service - no app download or registration is required.<p>We also send you a daily nudge asking “How did your day go?” and after you have a few posts we send you a random blast from the past.<p>Why I built it: I was an active user and fan of Ohlife - only journalling app that could make me write 100s of entries. So, when it shut down it left a hole in my life too (just like it did for Paul G - <a href="https://x.com/paulg/status/1216714155731890176" rel="nofollow">https://x.com/paulg/status/1216714155731890176</a>). :)<p>“Today Has Been” is Ohlife on WhatsApp.<p>I’d love to hear your feedback and ideas.

<p>Hi, I want to create an app that runs on a batch job. Say at 4am every morning, this app should start. It should take a snippet from a database/data store and email it to a set of people in a list/DB.<p>I am a technical non-programming PM. So I understand technology but its been many years since I actually coded something.<p>I dont want to integrate with Twilio or something for an enterprise grade feature. This is just to create a quick POC to evaluate product/market fit.<p>Like I said above, its been a while, and I would like to do this myself. Any guidance on where I could start? Is the O-1 model good enough now where it can create this entire app for me, and deploy it? :)<p>Looking for tips that are not, simply said, too hard.</p>

<p>I built a tool to roast landing pages with AI agents. I was gathering feedback from watching landing page roast videos, and figured out I could prompt LLMs to analyse a screenshot and roast based on the same criteria. It's not 100% accurate yet, but it has been really insightful when I've tested it on my own websites. Let me know what you think!</p>
