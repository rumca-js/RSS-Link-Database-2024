<p>We continue to see a significant increase in API development year after year. <a href="https://nonamesecurity.com/resources/api-security-trends-report/">A 2022 report</a> conducted by 451 Research found that the average organization has 15,564 <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3269878/what-is-an-api-application-programming-interfaces-explained.html">APIs</a> in use, with a growth rate of 201% over a single year. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/landscape-of-api-traffic">Cloudflare has reported</a> that more than 50% of the traffic it processes is API-based. A variety of trends are driving explosive growth in the number of APIs enterprises use, yet these integration points are often

<p>One sign that we’re still very early in the evolution of AI is how much heavy lifting is still left to the user to figure out. As Community Leadership Core founder <a href="https://x.com/jonobacon/status/1837069258871689560">Jono Bacon laments</a>, even the very act of “need[ing] to choose between [large language] models” to run a query is “complex and confusing for most people.” Once you’ve chosen the “right” model (whatever that means), you still need to do <a href="https://x.com/simonw/status/1832944559162269990">all sorts of work</a> to get the model to return relevant results (and forget about getting consistent results—that’s not really a feature of current LLMs).</p>

<p>“You can use whatever AI tool you want to experiment in any way you want, using whatever data you want,” said no company executive ever. Executive leaders are focused on ensuring AI efforts target business opportunities while avoiding risks. Even the most cautious leaders are reluctant to ban AI outright, however, because failing to deliver <a href="https://blogs.starcio.com/2024/07/win-genai-digital-transformation.html" rel="nofollow">AI-driven transformational outcomes</a> risks business disruption.</p>



<p> In between these two hypothetical scenarios are the principles, practices, regulations, tools, and responsibilities defining how organizations seek to leverage AI capabilities, stay comp

<p>A <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3703211/10-ways-generative-ai-upends-the-traditional-database.html">vector database</a> is just like any other database in that it stores data. From there, the similarity mostly ends — especially when it comes to artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>Most traditional databases are built for transactional workloads, where structured queries and relational data dominate. Vector databases, meanwhile, are all about unstructured data, built to support modern workloads like <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a>, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3214424/wha
