One way to understand the potential for life on far-off planets—those in other solar systems that orbit different stars—is to study a planet's atmosphere. Telescopic images often capture traces of gases that may indicate life and habitable planets. But findings from a new study led by researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder challenge this idea: Scientists have created one type of gas often seen as an indicator of life in a chemistry lab with no organisms present.

An atlas doesn't seem to be an essential item in cars these days, but think about them and most people will think about distances. An atlas of the stars not only covers distances but must also take into account time too. The Andromeda galaxy, for example, is so far away that its light takes 2.5 million years to reach us.

A Doppler shift is defined as a change of frequency of light or sound when an object is moving toward or away from an observer. Edwin Hubble observed in 1929 that galaxies appear on average to be moving away from us (see figure above), which could indicate that the universe is expanding, an effect that became known as the Hubble Law.

The team from China has studied how female zebrafish responded after being exposed to artificial light at night, which is considered to be the main source of the world's light pollution.

Criminal suspects, defendants and offenders face many choices that affect their liberty, in situations ranging from searches of their property or data to interrogations and plea deals. Judicial doctrine considers these choices to be valid when they are made "voluntarily"– i.e., when the individual consents or agrees to a pat down, interview, plea, or surrender of information.

Researchers working in Finland propose that the unique light environment of the Earth's polar regions creates conditions that result in circumpolar hybrid zones around the North and the South Poles. These extreme conditions increase the synchrony of reproductive phenology among species, i.e., force all species into a smaller window for reproduction. This will sustain biodiversity in the long term.
