 More than 10,000 books were banned in US public schools from 2023 to 2024, according to a report, marking a stark increase over the year before as Republican-led states pass new censorship laws.

The survey from PEN America suggested that bans of books nearly tripled nationwide, from 3,362 the previous year.
