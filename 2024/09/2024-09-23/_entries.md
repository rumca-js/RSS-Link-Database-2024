Falling rates are expected to rejuvenate industrial spending, making it easier for companies to borrow money at lower costs and for consumers to buy tech products, all of which might benefit the stock prices of these companies.  Hedge funds placed almost three times as many long positions on the bet that information technology stocks would rise, compared to those with bets against them, said the prime brokerage note.
