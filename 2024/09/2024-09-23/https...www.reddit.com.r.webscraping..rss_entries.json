So I\u2019m currently learning web scraping and I\u2019m using the site pictured, nba.com/players . There\u2019s a giant list of nba players spread into 100 pages. I\u2019ve learned how to web scrape when the url changes with the page but not for something like this. The URL stays the exact same but upon scraping it only gets the 50 on the first page. Wondering if there\u2019s something I need to learn here. I\u2019ve attached an image of the website with the HTML. Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd", "id": 1198910, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1fnxr5d/python_web_scraping_multiple_pages_where_the_url", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source__id": 467, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/.rss", "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://preview.redd.it/65cgdkhi1nqd1.jpeg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d82e23e084669a265d058bd83f634887c57897c6", "title": "Python Web Scraping multiple pages where the URL stays the same?", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-23T15:00:57+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Welcome to the weekly discussion thread!
