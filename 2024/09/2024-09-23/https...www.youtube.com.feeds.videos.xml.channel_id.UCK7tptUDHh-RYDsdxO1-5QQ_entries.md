China’s fleet of warships is eclipsing the U.S as it is now the top global shipmaker by a wide margin. As tensions grow with Beijing, the U.S. looks to South Korea, one of its biggest allies in Asia, to help increase its battleship supply. Hyundai Heavy Industries is a leader in shipbuilding in South Korea and will soon start training engineers in the U.S. in hopes of building ships cheaper and more efficiently.
