<p>Every year, there are a few sale events that we simply cannot wait for—namely, Amazon’s Prime Day and Black Friday. Well, with October Prime Day on the horizon (Amazon calls it “Prime Big Deal Days”), we’re already looking for the best thumb drive discounts we can find.</p>



<p>It’s always good to have a good flash drive on hand to move files easily from one device to another, and Prime Big Deal Days is the best time to finally get one for a better price. We’ve curated our list of great drive deals by capacity levels, so you don’t have to peruse a ton of links to find what you need.</p>



<p>I’ve been a journalist for 18 years, with the last 12 of them focused on consumer tech. The past couple of years have been spent, in part, looking for the best deals available, including amazing discounts for flash drives. To create the deal lists below, I’ve taken 

## Qualcomm buying Intel makes no sense because of AMD’s ace in the hole

<p>The hits just keep on coming for Intel. AMD’s Epyc chips are gobbling up market share in data centers while <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2415697/intels-crashing-13th-14th-gen-cpu-nightmare-explained.html">Intel’s desktop chips are frying themselves</a> after years of being stuck on a stalled architecture. The company is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2416100/intel-will-lay-off-thousands-as-its-rethinks-its-strategy.html">laying off 15,000 people</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246599/intel-foundry-independent-spinoff">spinning off its foundry business</a>.

<p>If you’re going to upgrade to an OLED monitor for your gaming PC, you might as well go all-in. Today, Samsung’s Odyssey Neo G9 — tied for the biggest and widest OLED monitor on the market — is getting a serious discount at Amazon’s closeout site Woot: <a href="https://www.woot.com/offers/new-samsung-odyssey-49-oled-neo-g9-curved-gaming-monitor">it’s $999.99 for a new model</a>, which is an amazing $800 off its retail price.</p>



<p>A thousand bucks isn’t exactly cheap for a monitor, but that’s only a little more than you’d pay for some 27-inch OLED monitors, so I’m calling it a deal in terms of pure scale. The 5120×1440 resolution is basically two 1440p screens smooshed side-by-side into one panel, and it’s speedy with its 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time. Even the most powerful desktop PCs will have a difficult time maxing out this screen’s c

<p>It’s been exactly four days since the bombastic PS5 system-seller <em>God of War Ragnarök </em>landed on PC… and modders are already hard at work on it. One of their first priorities? Stripping the game of its Sony software hooks, as there’s already a mod that removes the requirement for a PlayStation Network login.</p>



<p>A PSN login probably shouldn’t be surprising for a Sony-published game, but it’s become a contentious flashpoint since it was <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2324284/sony-surrenders-helldivers-2-wont-require-playstation-login-on-pc.html">added as a required element to the PC version of <em>Helldivers 2</em> post-release</a>. It was eventually removed from that game, but Sony has been baking in PSN logins to every PC game released since — and gamers aren’t happy about it.</p>

<p>I prefer a PC case that looks like a tiny refrigerator — leave off the RGB, please. But even if there’s no accounting for taste, I have to admit that the massive builds that beg you to look at all the expensive parts within have a voyeuristic appeal. Several companies have been making this bigger and bigger lately, and the latest one is Asus.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-announces-tuf-gaming-gt-502-horizon-mid-tower-pc-case">Asus TUF Gaming GT502 Horizon</a> follows the pattern: a dual-chamber design with all the fun stuff on the right side and exposed to your peepers via tempered glass, with the power supply and the vast majority of cable routing on the back.</p>



<p>All of that makes this case shorter and wider than a typical ATX PC case, and it gives Asus room for that TUF branding right on the metal of the ex

<p>Our household only recently discovered the glorious, hands-free reality of a AI-enabled, self-emptying robot vacuum, one that scooted expertly around our apartment, busting dust for weeks on end with little input from us. But even with our trusty Roomba busting dust left and right, we knew something was missing: The bot was only <em>sweeping</em>, not mopping. </p>



<p>We’d long dismissed the idea of a robot mop—after all, the earliest ones did little more than drag a damp cloth across the floor. </p>

<p>Here’s a unicorn of a sale if you need a large-capacity portable SSD: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-Professionals-MU-PG4T0B-AM/dp/B0CHFSZX9W/">Samsung T9 (4TB model) is a whopping 45% off at Amazon</a>. This tiny-but-mighty storage drive is only $300 right now, which is basically as good as the best price we’ve seen for it all year.</p>



<p>With 4TB of storage space, you’ll never worry again about having enough room on your laptop, PC, or gaming console for your photos, videos, and documents. And since the Samsung T9 comes with super-fast read and write speeds of up to 2,000MB/s, it’s perfectly suitable for gamers who need quick loading times in their games.</p>



<p>Of course, this isn’t necessarily a product designed for gamers — these impressive speeds come in handy for loads of people. Even if the only thing you do with this d

<p>I’ll be the first one to admit to not practicing the best battery habits, especially where my laptop is concerned. Most days I leave my laptop plugged in for far too long, which can deteriorate the battery over time, especially if it’s fully charged. I’ll find myself cranking up the brightness as well, even when I’m just browsing social media and doing day-to-day tasks. That’s because I’m a mutant. Don’t be a mutant. </p>



<p>That said, I’m willing to turn over a new leaf and start practicing better battery life habits — and if you’re anything like me, it’s not too late to change your ways either. Here are a few simple tweaks you can make to extend the life of your laptop.  </p>

<p>For anyone trying to keep their personal information secure, recent headlines have been a grim kick in the pants. The harshest came last month when the National Public Data breach was disclosed—the source of a purported 2.9 billion records spilling onto the dark web. But it wasn’t the only prominent data leak. In early September, Medicare contacted almost one million beneficiaries about a loss of personal identifiable information related to a vulnerability in third-party software.</p>



<p>In other words, your social security number—central to filing taxes, applying and maintaining credit, and receiving certain US government benefits—is very likely available to hackers and would-be criminals for exploit. And if it isn’t yet, the unfortunate reality is that another data breach will inevitably change that.</p>
