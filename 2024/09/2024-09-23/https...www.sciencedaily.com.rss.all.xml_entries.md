The protein 'MIPS' changes its internal structure when it becomes active. Its disordered active centre becomes a defined structure with special functions. The protein plays a key role in the production of inositol, which is also known as vitamin B8, and fulfills important tasks in the body. Researchers have succeeded for the first time in observing the protein as it re-structures.

## Extreme polar light environment of the North and South Poles sustains biodiversity

Researchers working in Finland propose that the unique light environment of the Earth's Polar regions creates conditions that result in circumpolar hybrid zones around the North and the South Poles. These extreme conditions increase the synchrony of reproductive phenology among species, i.e., force all species into a smaller window for reproduction. This will sustain biodiversity in the long term.

## How the brain integrates pain prediction and stimuli

Using blushing coral star and genomic DNA analyses, researchers have uncovered vital links between coral populations at varying depths. They identified four distinct genetic lineages, finding strong connectivity between shallow and mesophotic populations. Shallow-specific lineages showed reduced genetic diversity and higher inbreeding compared to depth-generalist lineages. Importantly, mesophotic reefs emerged as crucial reproductive sources, particularly in the Lower and Upper Keys. Corals from these deeper zones hold significant potential to replenish and restore the declining shallow reefs in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
