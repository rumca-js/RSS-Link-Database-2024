<p>Comic book movies are still all the rage and it takes something special to stand out. Releasing a dark villain-driven movie based on a character who has already had many appearances in film (and the range in quality from the brilliant Oscar-winning Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight to Jared Leto’s mess in The Suicide Squad) is a bit of a risk but Todd Phillips certainly wasn’t going to play it safe with Joker. Casting Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role, Phillips double down on the risk by creating a movie that dared to ask how low does the support in a society have to go to create a villain as despicable as Joker? And to do it with barely a nod to Batman, that’s a director with guts and the bold move certainly pays off. Joker is its own film its own world. There are no links to other characters and movies and its refreshing to see a comic book movie without a hundred links to others. Whilst it is its own film, many in the audience will be aware of the character due to his popularity
