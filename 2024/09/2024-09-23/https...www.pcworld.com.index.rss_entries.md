<p>The Steam Deck might be <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2438718/linux-os-market-share-climbs-towards-5-thanks-steam-deck.html">the most popular Linux PC ever</a>, though you’d be forgiven if you haven’t realized that its SteamOS software is technically Linux. The Proton compatibility layer is the Steam Deck’s special sauce, allowing games made for Windows to run on Linux without a massive headache.

<p>GaN chargers are the future, so now’s as good a time as any to get ahead of the curve and start benefiting from them sooner than later.</p>



<p>Right now, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65/">this Anker Nano USB-C GaN charger is on sale for $15 at Amazon</a>, which is a nice 35 percent off its normal price.</p>
