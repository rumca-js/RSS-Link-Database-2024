<p>The new head of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty on Cop29 and why activism is not winning enough</p><p>Top climate scientists have long warned that swiftly curbing fossil fuel production will be necessary to avert climate catastrophe. Yet international climate treaties have failed to include such commitments. Despite pressure from vulnerable nations and activists, in the agreement signed at international climate talks last year, world leaders failed to commit to a fossil fuel “phase-out”, instead calling for a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/13/cop28-landmark-deal-agreed-to-transition-away-from-fossil-fuels">transition away</a>” from coal, oil and gas. Its a longstanding problem: the 2015 Paris agreement does not even mention that fossil fuels are responsible for global heating.</p><p>That paradox led climate-vulnerable nations and civil society groups to launch the<strong> </strong>Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative.

In the streaming era, these stories – long stripped of their quickie currency – are often re-evaluated and expanded into deep-dive miniseries, going for some level of prestige rather than a cheaply attained ratings share. No one has become more prolific at this form of cultural retooling than the producer Ryan Murphy, to the point where it can be difficult to keep all of his anthology series straight.

<p>She’s worked with most of the great names of European cinema, from Godard to Haneke, and on one of Hollywood’s greatest disasters. Now she’s ready for your closeup quizzing</p><p>France has quite a few <em>grandes dames</em> of cinema, with Catherine Deneuve, Juliette Binoche and Isabelle Adjani all very much in the game. But none can hold much of a candle to Isabelle Huppert, who is firing on all cylinders as she enters her 70s, in her sixth decade of headline acting performances. Tightly wound and fiery, while simultaneously self-contained and tough as nails, Huppert’s acting persona has been instrumental to a string of masterpieces – and even if the film around her isn’t that great, she’s always magnificent to watch.</p><p>With so many amazing credits, stretching back to the 1970s, it’s hard to pick out a few, but we’ll have a go: early attention-grabbers like The Lacemaker and The Judge and the Assassin that graduated to fully-fledged lead performances in Loulou and Claude Chab

<p>Former Spurs midfielder struggled abroad but Franck Haise’s climate of trust at <em>Le Gym</em> has allowed him to thrive</p><p><strong>By <a href="https://x.com/LukeEntwistle">Luke Entwistle</a> for <a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/">Get French Football News</a></strong></p><p>“Before – not after – every player, there is a person,” philosophises Franck Haise. The new Nice manager became renowned for getting the best out of players during his time at Lens, from reviving careers such as that of Wesley Saïd, to making them, as he did with Jonathan Gradit and Florian Sotoca, both rose from the depths of amateur football to experience Champions League football in their twilight years.</p><p>“There isn’t anything magic,” says Haise. “I don’t have a wand. It’s just about creating a relationship.” There are plenty of hypotheses as to why Tanguy Ndombele did not work at Tottenham, but perhaps his previous managers’ inability to build that relationship was one.</p> <a href="htt

<p>Low-budget limitations work in this French thriller’s favour, in which Earth is turned upside down </p><p>At one point in this smart, low-budget French disaster movie/post-apocalyptic thriller, teenager Ben (Lucas Ebel) pees into an unplumbed toilet dumped in the wasteland. It’s a moment emblematic of Frédéric Jardin’s film; it makes little practical sense, but is packed with arresting images and proceeds with something close to the dream logic of Luc Besson’s debut The Last Battle, and the great comic-book artist Moebius.</p><p>Ben is on a Caribbean family cruise with his revoltingly-in-love parents, Julia (Émilie Dequenne) and Tom (Andreas Pietschmann), and his just-plain-revolting older sister, Cassie (Lisa Delamar). After nervy whales graze their yacht, satellites fall burning through the atmosphere and a cataclysm begins, they awake to find their boat stranded on top of a promontory in an infinite desert.

<p>The former New York Jets first-round pick is enjoying a career-best run of form in Minnesota. And he may offer a lesson for quarterback-needy teams elsewhere</p><p>Not long ago, it looked like Sam Darnold’s days in the NFL were numbered. The No 3 overall pick in 2018 by the New York Jets had bounced around teams over the past few years and was set to be a backup this fall to the Minnesota Vikings’ first-round draft pick, JJ McCarthy. A preseason knee injury for McCarthy pressed Darnold into action, though, and the veteran has made the most of the chance. In <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671646">a 34-7 romp</a> over the Houston Texans on Sunday, Darnold completed 17 of his 28 passes, only getting 181 yards through the air but avoiding interceptions and firing four touchdowns to four different receivers. Darnold has been one of the league’s most efficient quarterbacks in all three weeks this season, and the Vikings are 3-0.</p><p>Darnold was a college star at

<p>Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest deployed super subs, while Manchester City and Arsenal served up a doozy</p><p>The Etihad showed off the best and worst of English football. Arsenal almost rolled back the years when their back five frustrated all-comers. Riccardo Calafiori’s cracking goal reminded of Ronaldinho at his improvisational best. Manchester City’s opener through Erling Haaland was a beauty, too. As for the bad – a referee taking centre stage and often losing control. Michael Oliver should not be headline-maker after this meeting of the Premier League’s best teams, but is likely to be. Sending off Leandro Trossard was correct, the Belgian foolish, but his red card generated the usual conspiracies that now swamp elite football. Arsenal then cranked up the gamesmanship as both sidelines behaved like spoiled children. That City, until John Stones’ goal, were poor – Rúben Dias is no attacking force – will concern Pep Guardiola. So will Rodri’s injury. Without him, City are a

But before we can make any headway, she’s leading me from painting to painting, around Frith Street Gallery in London. There’s one of a rock that looks like a face. Other faces, stoic in grief and resilience, stare back. Elsewhere, there’s a looming timeless head called Nemesis that looks like it is out to get me. Figures and faces emerge from pours of paint that have provoked them into life. Some appear the work of an instant, others have been reworked. There are uneasy figures in rooms, awkward confrontations, paintings called War and Ceasefire. Some paintings allude obliquely to c
