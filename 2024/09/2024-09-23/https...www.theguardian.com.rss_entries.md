<p><strong>British Museum, London</strong><br>Following China’s epic ancient trade routes through fabulous oases, desert palaces and burial mounds will radically change the way you feel about borders</p><p>Not many exhibitions turn the history of the world upside down. The British Museum’s mesmerising Silk Roads does, by showing how Asia, Europe and north Africa shared their cultures more than a millennium ago. Far from developing in isolation, let alone in a “clash of civilisations”, east and west were once mutually connected by epic trade routes known as the Silk Roads that carried China’s precious discovery, silk, across the then-known world. If that sounds dry, the British Museum turns it into a fairytale of magic and beauty, as you follow the merchants’ routes to fabulous oases, desert palaces, synagogues, mosques and burial mounds.</p><p>You reach the first oasis by clay camel, to be precise a two-humped Bactrian camel of painted ceramic, nearly a metre tall, rearing its head in

The German far right continues to strengthen</p><p>The name of Germany’s beleaguered chancellor, Olaf Scholz, was not on the ballot on Sunday, as his home state of Brandenburg went to the polls. But it might as well have been. Approval ratings for the coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and liberals that he leads have plunged to record lows.

<p>The band’s Martyn Ware has hit out at the fee offered for Temptation in the Grand Theft Auto franchise. But as music becomes ever more central to gaming, the sums get complicated</p><p>The 1983 song Temptation by Heaven 17 is an undisputed classic of the synth pop era, a glacial paean to sexual tension denied the number No 1 spot only by the sheer might of True by Spandau Ballet. So how much should it be worth to a video game publisher in 2024? That’s the question many asked when Heaven 17’s Martyn Ware recently <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832360363179868488">tweeted</a> about a licensing offer from Rockstar to use the track in Grand Theft Auto VI. “IT WAS $7500 [£5,600] – for a buyout of any future royalties from the game – forever,” he typed. “To put this in context, Grand Theft Auto 6 [sic] grossed, wait for it… $8.6 BILLION. Ah, but think of the exposure… Go fuck yourself.”</p><p>The thread went viral and Ware was inundated with reactions, ranging from support to

<p>With its gang of cartoon villains and wardrobe of bikinis, this low-budget thriller is reminiscent of old-style video nasties</p><p>For all its effective use of modern drone cinematography, this survival horror is very much a throwback to the video nasties of the 1980s. The villains are essentially cartoons: a heavily accented human trafficker (Sean Cronin) who comes complete with facial scar, cigar and goons. These are a big lad with stringy hair and an eye patch (Glenn Salvage), an even bigger lad with some painful-looking skin problems (Jon-Paul Gates), a dude who looks like he’s auditioning to play bass for Metallica (Mark Haldor), and a “pretty boy”, Jude (Louis James). Jude, a reasonably normal-looking guy, acts as a front for their outfit, a gang whose objective is to obtain 10 thin, blond women to be packed into a storage container and shipped to a wealthy client who remains faceless – we know him only from his voice and cufflinks.</p><p>The heroines are the kidnapped women

<p>To celebrate 30 years of Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe and Joey, we asked Guardian readers to share their best scenes from Friends. Prepare to cry laughing …</p><p>My favourite moment is some classic David Schwimmer physical comedy. It’s in the episode when Ross and Elizabeth go for a weekend to Elizabeth’s Dad’s country house, but Elizabeth’s Dad also happens to have gone for a weekend away with Rachel. Cue a fabulous farce, whereby Ross attempts to hide. At one point, Ross is standing behind the door in the bedroom when Elizabeth’s Dad enters – and Ross practically melts to the floor and slides under the bed. I don’t think any other actor could have captured the move so perfectly. <strong>Sarah Birkett, 48, Leeds </strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/23/ross-bagpipes-monica-proposal-favourite-friends-moments">Continue reading...</a>

When my university held a talent show and needed someone to host it, I volunteered and booked myself into an open mic night called Comedy Virgins to get some practice, but bombed.

I got so fascinated about why it hadn’t gone well that I spent a week with a pen and paper, watching standup specials and dissecting what the comedians were doing, line by line. Then I went back to the open mic night and won a little plastic trophy.</p><p><strong>Who did you admire when you were starting out?<br></strong>I was super into Alan Carr when I was a teenager.

And who knew that spaghetti ‘carbonara’ probably didn’t exist before 1950?</p><p>Preziosa (Precious) was the title Ada Boni gave to the home economics magazine she established in 1915. Six years later, the accumulation of slender monthly magazines formed the basis of her cooking manual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_talismano_della_felicit%C3%A0">Il Talismano della Felicità</a> (The Talisman of Happiness), which is still in print today. Boni would continue directing Preziosa until 1959, allowing for a lively symbiotic relationship, with the popular magazine nourishing the constantly updated editions of Il Talismano, making a dynamic reflection of evolving cooking and recipes over the decades.</p><p>I have a 1949 fabric-covered 18th edition of Il Talismano.

<p>Beyond being in or out of control, there is an alternative – and it’s one of the building blocks to living well</p><p>My family was recently taken down by a brutal stomach bug. It took us out one by one, and although nothing could be more predictable in a household with a child who has recently started nursery, the biblical brutality of the symptoms took me by surprise. I think I had better leave it at that.</p><p>While I have recovered physically, I am still reeling from the psychological vulnerability of feeling so helpless, of having no control over my own body. So I have been thinking about control, how frightening it is to feel out of it, how we kid ourselves that we are in it. People often speak of feeling out of control – of their thoughts, their emotions, their relationships – and it’s something that comes up a lot in therapy, whether I am the patient or the therapist. The assumption seems to be that to build a better life, you have to be in control of it; the truth is, thi

So do kids without them feel deprived – or more alive?</p><p>Nothing has been able to stop smartphones taking over our lives and those of our children. But the inevitable backlash is in full flow.

<p>The woman who hoped to become America’s first female president seems unable to accept her 2016 defeat, coming across in this memoir as uptight and grandiose</p><p>What Hillary Clinton lost was her chance to be the first female US president; what she has gained in the eight years since that wrenching disappointment is less clear. “My life is richer and my spirit is stronger,” she insists, but her new book, <em>Something Lost, Something Gained: Reflections on Life, Love and Liberty</em>, reveals her to be also the victim of lingering PTSD. Brooding about her defeat, she muddles the five-step grieving process and alternates between denial and anger, bargaining and depression. As yet, despite walks in the woods and romps with her grandchildren, she seems not to have arrived at acceptance. Just as Donald Trump continues to grouse about the supposedly stolen election of 2020, so Clinton shadow-boxes her way through endless reruns of her wonky, uncharismatic 2016 campaign.</p><p>An FBI of

He thought staging it there, in the style of grand opera, would ruin it. He didn’t want the big sets, or the famous singers who sang too loudly and acted badly. So he insisted the premiere take place at the Moscow Conservatory, with a smaller budget, less prestige and students playing the leads. He even refused to call it an opera. Instead, he titled it<em> “</em>lyrical<em> </em>scenes”. Yet the work has become Tchaikovsky’s most celebrated musical drama – and a standard of the operatic repertory.</p><p>Eugene Onegin, based on Alexander Pushkin’s novel in verse, is a story about unrequited love.

He’s cosying up with Giorgia Meloni for an entirely different reason</p><p>One cold, late evening in the winter of 1999, I was waiting for a train at Termini station in Rome when I noticed an old lady struggling with her suitcases and offered to help. “Signorina,” her voice trembled ever so slightly. “Fortunately there are still youngsters like you. I was very worried. This station is full of Albanian muggers. It’s an invasion.”</p><p>Back then I had no courage to tell her I was Albanian. One of the lucky ones – a student on a scholarship, unlike my fellow citizens who worked as cleaners, builders, carers and sex workers. We made headlines in Italy in those days. Sometimes as a nation of smugglers, pimps and burglars; sometimes as failed individuals, socialised under a different system, who struggled to integrate; and sometimes as corrupt, lazy people unable to implement in their own country the formula for success they had see

The Yale history professor effectively took a sabbatical from his day job in 2017 to write <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/20/on-tyranny-twenty-lessons-from-twentieth-century-timothy-snyder-review">On Tyranny</a></em>, a series of 20 lessons derived from his close study of totalitarian regimes in Europe in the last century and how they might apply to the US in this one.</p><p>He followed that book, in 2018, with <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/15/the-road-to-unfreedom-russia-europe-america-timothy-snyder-review-tim-adams">The Road to Unfreedom</a>,</em> an illuminating and disturbing account of the ways in which Vladimir Putin’s war

<p>Bruno Jorge’s quietly observed film has an added poignance as the leader of the expedition to immunise one of Brazil’s isolated tribes is murdered activist Bruno Pereira</p><p>‘It doesn’t hurt to get your image,” says one man to another, nodding towards the camera. Both men are Korubo, an Indigenous tribe that lives deep in the Amazon rainforest. The man hesitant about being filmed has never seen a camera before. He belongs to an “uncontacted” group, who have lived completely isolated from the outside world – until now. This first contact is documented by film-maker Bruno Jorge in his fascinating, occasionally frustrating film – two-and-a-half hours of observation with no added frills. No interviews, no context, no explainers.</p><p>Jorge follows <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/05/brazil-high-risk-expedition-indigenous-tribe-success">a 2019 expedition</a> organised by Funai, Brazil’s agency for Indigenous people, which as a rule has a no-contact policy with isol

<p>I killed a great white when I was 18 to feed my family in Madagascar. But now I’m documenting the threat to these beautiful creatures from overfishing</p><p>The first time I came face to face with a great white shark, it was dead. I had caught it in my net. And I was so happy. I thought: I can bring a fortune back to my village. I can feed my family. I’m Malagasy – I come from Andavadoaka, a small fishing village on the south-west coast of Madagascar. It is a very dry place where no crops can grow. The name of my tribe, Vezo, means people who live off the ocean, but also people who survive it. Because we rely on it.</p><p>I became a shark fisher when I was 16 years old. I dropped out of school because my parents couldn’t afford to support me any more, and followed my uncle into fishing so I could bring some money back to my family. I didn’t see a shark as a magnificent creature. My mindset was: make money, kill, make money, kill. Support my family.</p> <a href="https://www.theguard
