<p>Tripp Mickle, writing for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Ive and Mr. Altman met for dinner several more times before
agreeing to build a product, with LoveFrom leading the design.
They have raised money privately, with Mr. Ive and Emerson
Collective, Ms. Powell Jobsâ€™s company, contributing, and could
raise up to $1 billion in start-up funding by the end of the year
from tech investors.</p>

<p>In February, Mr. Ive found office space for the company. They
spent $60 million on a 32,000-square-foot building called the
Little Fox Theater that backs up to the LoveFrom courtyard. He has
hired about 10 employees, including Tang Tan, who oversaw iPhone
product development, and Evans Hankey, who succeeded Mr. Ive in
leading design at Apple.</p>

<p>On a Friday morning in late June, Mr. Tan and Ms. Hankey could be
seen wheeling chairs between the Little Fox Theater and the nearby
LoveFrom studio. The chairs were topped by papers and cardboard
boxes with the earliest ideas fo

## iOS 18 Messages Bug, Triggered When Sharing an Apple Watch Face, Causes Crash and Data Loss

<p>Zac Hall, with a public service message at 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For now, the bug is triggered when someone replies to a shared
watch face in a thread on Messages in iOS 18. The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/104974">threaded
responses feature</a> allows you to have an inline
conversation about a specific message that may have been sent
earlier in the chat.</p>

<p>If this happens, Messages will repeatedly crash if the user tries
to open the conversation in the app. Sending or responding to
conversations from other chats directly in Messages is also not
easily possible as the app may repeatedly crash.</p>

<p>Once triggered, the bug affects both users. It appears to require
responding to the shared watch face from iOS 18. Replying from iOS
18.1 will not trigger the bug.</p>

<p>However, if the user responds in a thread to the shared watch
face, Messages will crash on iOS 18.1 beta, iPadOS 18.1 beta, and
macOS 15.1 beta as well.</p>
