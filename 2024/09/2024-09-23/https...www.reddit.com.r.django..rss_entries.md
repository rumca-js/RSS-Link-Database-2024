<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello fellows,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about how to handle the following situation in my Django project. I have two separate apps, each with its own models and views. For example, one app is designed to capture data from a specific type of device (such as batteries), while the other app captures data from a different type of device (such as suspension). So far, each app works well independently with its own views and functionality. </p> <p>However, the challenge arises when I need to create templates or views that need to import data into the tables from both apps simultaneously. I&#39;m unsure which approach would avoid potential issues in the future. I anticipate more cases like this, where there will be a &quot;composite&quot; nature of data handling across apps, alongside their isolated functionality.</p> <p>Any suggestion or material to read about would be of help.</p> <p>This is a work-tree that i am reasoning about.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Howdy everyone ðŸ‘‹, Tristan here. Over the past three years, I&#39;ve been working on various Django projects and noticed a patternâ€”no matter how experienced you are, code reviews tend to surface the same types of issues. You know the drill: variables with unclear names, unhandled exceptions, potential security flaws, and of course, views that get way too large and hard to maintain.</p> <p>After going through countless reviews filled with nitpicks (and delivering my fair share), I started thinking, <em>What if we could catch these problems in real-time, as we code?</em> Instead of waiting for a PR to reveal these issues, wouldnâ€™t it be great if there was a tool that enforced best practices and conventions, saving time and keeping code quality high from the start?</p> <p>That&#39;s why I built <em>Djangoly</em>, a VS Code extension designed to help Django developers catch and resolve annoying issues in real time, before code even gets to the review stage

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We&#39;re a group of 4 people learning django. When talking about the differences between put and patch the question of how we would validate the json fields in the put/patch request body. In SpringBoot and aspnet you&#39;d just use models like this:</p> <p>``` @RestController @RequestMapping(&quot;/api/users&quot;) public class UserController {</p> <pre><code>@Autowired private UserService userService; @PostMapping public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; createUser(@RequestBody User user) { String response = userService.createUser(user); return ResponseEntity.ok(response); } </code></pre> <p>} ```</p> <p>So the framework would automatically parse the json into a User object. If some fields are missing the framework raises an error and that&#39;s it.</p> <p>But since python determines variable types at runtime you can&#39;t really do that. Until now we always accessed the response data like this:</p> <p>``` def login(self): return self.client.post(&#39;/a
