<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!</p> <p>I (27M) have recently found myself with a lot of free time I haven&#39;t had before and want to get back into gaming. The problem is I scroll and scroll the store and have no idea what is good / worth the money. I try to read reviews but it seems like every game has people who say its the best and worst game they&#39;ve ever played.</p> <p>Im looking for a single player, open world game, but something that is good at keeping you engaged, I tend to get bored quickly. </p> <p>Some of my past favorite games are -Skyrim (most played) -Fallout -borderlands -far cry -assassins creed -hitman -red dead redemption </p> <p>I was considering the Witcher 3, or Far Cry Primal, but not sure if there are any others that may be better to get back into it.</p> <p>Oh I have Xbox series X, no PC unfortunately :(</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tight_b-hole69"> /u/Tight_b-hole6

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the PS5 Pro announcement, it is mentioned that 3/4 players would choose performance mode over quality mode. I am wondering if it would make sense that, in the future, the game file you need to download (or store on the disk) can be graphics mode dependent? For example, if you prefer performance mode for the gameplay, then the consoles or gaming platforms allow the removal of high quality 4k assets to save disk space. This practice seems doable as some games on PS allows you to start playing early even before the downloading finishes. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dzdhr"> /u/dzdhr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fignhh/will_future_game_file_size_be_graphics_mode/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fignhh/will_future_game_file_size_be_graphics_mode/">[comments]</a></span>
