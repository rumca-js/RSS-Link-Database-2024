<p>Two years ago, a catastrophic fall changed Kureishi’s life in an instant. But it’s clear from this film that it hasn’t changed his wild, hilarious, trailblazing spirit</p><p>‘I was drinking a beer, smoking a joint, watching the football,” recalls <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hanif-kureishi">Hanif Kureishi</a> in the powerful opening frames of In My Own Words. “Everything went fuzzy and I landed on my head.” These are the last moments the writer recalls from Boxing Day 2022 in Rome, before the fall that crushed his spinal cord, leaving him paralysed. Unable to move his arms or legs, he required constant care but was determined, nonetheless, to write. As those who have followed Kureishi’s extraordinary posts, dictated to his son since the accident, will know, he is not one to shy away from the truth of an experience, however devastating. “I was done for,” he says, his eyes a little glossy, his hangdog expression entirely serious. “My life was ruined.”</p><p>This is an

As house prices and interest rates remain high, buyers are taking out longer loans to keep their monthly repayments affordable, but experts say they risk paying thousands more over the length of the mortgage.</p><p>A report from UK Finance, the lenders’ trade body, says that even though households are under less pressure than at the peak of the cost of living crisis, the number of people taking out lengthy loans is “far higher than seen in the past”. In June, 22% of loans taken out by first-time buyers were for 35 to 40 years. Just five years ago, this stood at 6%. More lenders now offer terms of up to 40 years – even 45 in one case.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/16/the-40-year-mortgage-solution-to-rising-property-values-or-too-hig

<p>Men’s golf is still divided despite last year’s framework agreement and Luke Donald’s 2025 team could be weakened</p><p>Jon Rahm has made his second decision. Only time will tell if this proves more successful than his first. If not, Europe’s Ryder Cup scene is about to get messier than anybody could have expected.</p><p>By his own admission, Rahm anticipated the pace of play towards collaboration in elite men’s golf to be considerably sharper than has proven the case. He probably even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/08/jon-rahm-confirms-switch-to-liv-golf-masters-pga-tour">expected his switch to LIV last December</a> to accelerate talks between Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and traditional tours. Instead, the sport remains in a state of flux. Each entity ploughs its own furrow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/16/rahm-case-casts-shadow-over-ryder-cup-as-pga-tour-liv-rupture-still-runs-deep">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Gabriel the derby hero, Nketiah embraces new surroundings and Sancho introduces himself to Chelsea</p><p>A lot of the focus was on how Nottingham Forest clogged the midfield to frustrate Liverpool before bringing on two wingers to change the game for their first victory at Anfield in 55 years. What might have gone unnoticed were the performances of their full-backs Ola Aina and Àlex Moreno. Neither are household names, the former a free transfer from Torino and the latter on loan after underwhelming at Aston Villa. They were both excellent at Anfield against some of the Premier League’s finest wide players; Aina kept Luis Díaz quiet on the left and Cody Gakpo had no impact after replacing the Colombian, while Mohamed Salah up against Moreno put in one of his most underwhelming performances in a Liverpool shirt. The Forest duo showed the club might be finally losing their reputation for being chaotic when it comes to doing transfer business. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p><p><em>Mat

<p>Despite his record running London 2012 and World Athletics, the Olympian cannot count on winning the popularity contest</p><p>While most Britons were demolishing the last of the Christmas turkey in 1979, Sebastian Coe ran a punishing 14.4 miles up the Derwent Valley, defying everything that nature and the elements dared to throw at him. “It was a hard effort, a 5:30 pace in wet tracksuits and slickers,” wrote the Olympic marathoner Kenny Moore, who tried to keep up. “The wind and rain howled out of the Pennines, stopping the men cold in places, blowing white water back up from the spillways into the lakes.”</p><p>Eventually Moore had enough and went to sit with Coe’s father, Peter, who was driving behind them, listening to Schubert in the car. But Coe ploughed on. “I’m harder this year than last,” he told his father afterwards. “Clear to see,” came the response. A few months later the world realised it, too, as Coe won a brilliantly defiant Olympic 1500m gold in Moscow.</p> <a href

But he has now taken on a very different challenge: a barn in Cumbria. More specifically, he wants to recreate and preserve the legacy of Kurt Schwitters, the great German dada artist, nonsense poet and experimenter in sound, who died in exile in the Lake District in 1948.</p><p>Lowe, through his non-profit <a href="https://factumfoundation.org/">Factum Foundation</a>, has taken over the Cylinders Estate in luscious Elterwater, where Schwitters created his final unfinished masterpiece: the Merz Barn.

These are reasonable assumptions. But I would wager that your mental catalogue does not include the figure of a smiling<strong> </strong>brown woman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/13/pro-palestine-protester-cleared-racial-offence-coconut-placard-sunak-braverman">holding up a placard</a> depicting a coconut tree, with pictures of Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman pasted on it.</p><p>That woman is Marieha Hussain.

They’d met through working at Greenpeace and become friends, and were having a drink in a north London pub at the end of 2018. For two years, Brexit had dominated every news cycle. “We were just completely flummoxed by the chaos the country had been pitched into,” Ben remembers, talking from the Donkeys HQ in Hackney.</p><p>The four were laughing at David Cameron’s 2015 election tweet: “Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice – stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband”. It would be a shame if he deleted it, they agreed. “We said, ‘Let’s put it up on a billboard,’” Stewart continues. “We just found somebody to print it, did it with wallpaper paste – David C
