<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry if I&#39;m late but I just learned about Ethos-U55 from a crowdfund that&#39;s been nagging me and I finally looked at to see if it will leave me alone now that I looked at it. I still need to read up on it but I noticed that it was in the ARM ecosystem and I hadn&#39;t known ARM had specific IP designed into such chips.</p> <p>Anything ARM can do, I feel like RISCV should also enable; they&#39;re things people want to do and they&#39;re doing them.</p> <p>What, if anything, is in the RISCV ecosystem that provides AI enablement like the ARM IP? </p> <p>I am experienced in embedded engineering but not as deep on RSICV arch as I&#39;d like to be, so I&#39;ll understand what you&#39;re saying even if it seems I ask basic questions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/russellmzauner"> /u/russellmzauner </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1fhy09u/ai_chip_with_arm_cortexm
