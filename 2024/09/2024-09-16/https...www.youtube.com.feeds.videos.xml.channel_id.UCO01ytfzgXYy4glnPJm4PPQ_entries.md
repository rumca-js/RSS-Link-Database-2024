Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the unhinged rhetoric about Donald Trump has now apparently led to a second assassination attempt. Will this cause the media to back off and stop fear-mongering about Trump? Of course not. Also, my new film, “Am I Racist?,” debuted in theaters and managed to crack the top five in the national box office. This is a huge achievement, and we'll talk about it today. Plus, the Navy brags about their latest innovation: a gender-neutral submarine.
