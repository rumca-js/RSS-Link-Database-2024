This move comes with a notable shift: CEO Sam Altman is no longer part of the safety committee, marking a departure from the previous structure.</p>
<p>The newly formed Safety and Security Committee (SSC) will be chaired by Zico Kolter, Director of the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. Other key members include Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, retired US Army General Paul Nakasone, and Nicole Seligman, former EVP and General Counsel of Sony Corporation.&nbsp;</p>

An iPad can be useful for note taking and writing papers (especially with a keyboard attachment), carrying out research and definitely not streaming a new TV obsession during class.</p> 
<p>So if you’ve been lagging on a back-to-school gift or even just want to treat yourself to one of Apple’s iPads, you may be pleased to learn that the iPad Air is currently on sale.

<p>While it&#39;s unclear if mainstream PC users are actually using Microsoft&#39;s Copilot AI, the company claims that businesses using MS 365 Copilot are seeing plenty of benefits. According to a Microsoft survey, Copilot users at Honeywell save up to 92 minutes per week, while customer service agents at Teladoc are saving up to five hours a week by using the AI tool to draft responses to questions. Now that we&#39;re a year beyond the MS 365 Copilot launch (at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-will-charge-businesses-30-per-user-for-its-365-ai-copilot-153042654.html">a costly $30 per seat</a>), Microsoft is eager to throw more AI features at corporate drones.</p>
<p>Most intriguingly, Microsoft is upgrading its Business Chat app, which so far has been a way to interact with Copilot&#39;s across your emails, calendar entries and other data, alongside data from your organization. Now it&#39;s getting better collaboration with the addition of Copilot

It also won for outstanding drama series, directing and period costumes, among other accolades.

And, after testing a number of affordable fitness trackers, I can say with confidence that you might be surprised by how much a $100 (or less) wearable can do — a welcomed treat for those who don’t want to spend a ton of cash on an Apple Watch. Many of these gadgets go well beyond being glorified pedometers, providing in-depth reports on how you're sleeping at night or giving you a breakdown of your heart rate variability during a workout.
