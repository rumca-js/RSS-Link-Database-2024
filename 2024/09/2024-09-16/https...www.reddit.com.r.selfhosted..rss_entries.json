Still very new to all this so don&#39;t really know what my options are. I currently have an &quot;old&quot; gaming pc running unraid with 16tb of random size hard drives, no redundancy. But I keep running out of space and I don&#39;t know how to swap out a drive for a larger capacity one since I don&#39;t have any more ports to plug into/ no more room in the case lmao. I built it on a whim just to see if I could do it and now I&#39;m ready to &quot;upgrade&quot; for something better for long term.<br/> What&#39;re my options? My wishlist would be maybe rack mounted style pc but on the quieter side hopefully? I&#39;d also like to be able to have 4 concurrent 4k transcodes. Unraid is my OS of choice. I&#39;d also like to do more with it in the future such as mess with my own ai model and host immich and game server. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ju", "id": 1151485, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fhuxnf/looking_for_reccomendations", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Looking for reccomendations", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-16T01:53:16+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h2>TLDR;</h2> <p>Built a home server with old gaming PC parts, questions at the end of post. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/PlqtZbz\">Dashboard</a></p> <h2>Main goals:</h2> <ul> <li>media server for watching legally acquired digital dvds from my local store</li> <li>host game servers for friends</li> <li>host small side code projects/APIs</li> <li>adguard DNS </li> </ul> <h2>Leftover PC parts:</h2> <ul> <li>i7 7700k+old MSI mobo</li> <li>24 GB RAM</li> <li>980TI</li> <li>550w PSU</li> <li>3 TB of SSD (bought a new 2TB one)</li> <li>old case with duck tape lol </li> </ul> <h2>Setup:</h2> <ul> <li>Ubuntu server </li> <li>reserved server IP on my router</li> <li>SSH - changed default port + disabled root login + set up key + disabled password login</li> <li>configured UFW</li> <li>mounted the drives into one large drive using merger.fs and fstab </li> </ul> <h2>Software:</h2> <ul> <li>I used YAMS (basically a very large docker compose file of arr apps) with t", "id": 1151156, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1fhtaef/first_ever_home_server_noob_questions_after", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "First ever home server - noob questions after completion", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-16T01:30:04+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Im looking for a self-hosted email generator that can generate non-expired email and can filter it so that my customers can see specific email only.
