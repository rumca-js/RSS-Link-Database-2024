A flamboyant robber, a loyal friend, an icon of freedom, Bruno Sulak left his mark on the history of crime with his non-violent heists on multiple jewelry stores. Despite being actively pursued by George Moréas, an unconventional, astute and tough police commissioner, Sulak managed to escape from prison several times in order to reunite with Thalie, his lover and accomplice, thus becoming the public enemy number one of the 80s.

It's the powerless against the super powerful as The Boys embark on a heroic quest to expose the truth about “The Seven,” and their formidable Vought backing.
