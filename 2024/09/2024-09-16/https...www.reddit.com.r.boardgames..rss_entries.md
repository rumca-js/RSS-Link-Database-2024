For context, the only experience most of these guys have with modern board games is the time we got a little drunk and played TTR. They loved it, but I want to push us into something more strategic, competitive, and engaging. </p> <p>The truth of it is that most of these guys played some RISK when they were kids and loved it—but we all know that RISK has too many flaws. What I am looking for is a game that accommodates up to 5 players and captures some of the strengths of RISK—map control, direct conflict, alliances, etc. </p> <p>Problem is, that this group lacks all understandings of modern board games but I’m a teacher by trade, so I am hoping I can help the players get up to speed pretty fast. I am looking to find the ONE game that we’ll use to battle all winter long. I was thinking SCYTHE might work. What else might you suggest?

I don’t see this specified anywhere in the rule book.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/djkidkaz"> /u/djkidkaz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fi5d0f/harvest_gameplay_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fi5d0f/harvest_gameplay_question/">[commen

## 51st state Ultimate vs Res Arcana

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This question has probably been asked already, but I’ve chanced upon a deal for the 51st State ultimate (with the game found stuff), and while I’m tempted, I’m holding back because after looking at the rules I’ve noticed some core similarities between how the game plays out (race to points, turn/round based actions, mostly resource converting). Are the two able to coexist on my shelf if there are major differences between the two, or should I just pass since I already have Res Arcana?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/firewind555"> /u/firewind555 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fhwkp3/51st_state_ultimate_vs_res_arcana/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1fhwkp3/51st_state_ultimate_vs_res_arcana/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just curious, my collection of board games is growing. Space is becoming a thing lol. Im just curious how everyone stores their games. Ive only removed guts of the box for 1 series of games, Imperial Assault, only bc it really came zero inserts and etc. Everything was in baggies to start with. However, the plenty other miniature heavy board games ive gotten came with inserts and Ive kept them all and keep the painted minis in those inserts and practically kept the boxes as is (minus the punchouts lol). And i also keep all the board games horizontal. </p> <p>Now im curious what does everyone do? I&#39;ve seen people ditch all inserts and literally put everything in multiple baggies, even the painted minis and then stand all their games vertical. That... scares me, especially with painted minis. Just seems like it would damage and scar a lot. But i also see the perk of having less boxes by keeping some games with expansions all in one box by rem

## Help identifying a hidden object board game from my childhood

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I’m trying to remember the name of a hidden object board game I played as a kid and could really use some help! Here’s what I recall:</p> <pre><code>• The game came in a greenish box, and I think there might have been a mascot on it, possibly with a spacecraft or something futuristic. • It had multiple themed boards, including a futuristic board and an Egyptian-like board, but there were more boards than just these two. • The gameplay involved drawing cards that had objects you needed to find on the board, but the challenging part was that some objects on the board looked really similar to the one on the card, designed to trick you into thinking they were the correct ones. • The artwork was cartoonish, hand-drawn, and not too childish. It wasn’t overly simple or kiddie. • It was a regular board game size, with no electronics or timers—just cards and the board. • The title of the game might have included words like “search,” “hunt,” or “t
