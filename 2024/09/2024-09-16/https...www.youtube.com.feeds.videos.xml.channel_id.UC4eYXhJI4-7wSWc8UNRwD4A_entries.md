This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.

Felix Contreras | September 16, 2024
From the moment Colombian superstar Juanes started singing “Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor,” we know we were in for something special.

He usually performs in arenas and stadiums all over the Spanish speaking world, but he brought his intensely personal songs to the Tiny Desk — and none of them lost their power of speaking directly to the heart.

A highpoint for me was when he converted his popular song “La Luz” into a Dominican merengue, complete with crowd singalong. But what brought the house down was his surprise encore of “A Dios Le Pido,” proving this performance celebrates the power of his artistry and the familiarity of his music in our lives.
