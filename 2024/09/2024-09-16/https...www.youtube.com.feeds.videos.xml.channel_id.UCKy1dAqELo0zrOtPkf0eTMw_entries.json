The company has reportedly found a supplier for their as-yet-unannounced PlayStation 6. According to the report, Intel has lost out on the contract to chipmaker AMD, who also supplied the custom chip for the PlayStation 5. This previous arrangement was apparently important in the negotiations, as Sony wants the PS6 to be backwards compatible with the PS5, and using a different chip from a different manufacturer could complicate that. In other news, Warhammer fans on PlayStation have news to celebrate. Hot on the heels of the successful Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 launch on PS5 and PC, the formerly Xbox console exclusive Warhammer 40K: Darktide is coming to PS5. And finally, watch out, Zelda fans, as leaks and spoilers of the new Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom have appeared online after a ROM made its way online.", "id": 1157346, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbNMUSXOqo", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ZAbNMUSXOqo/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Sony Reportedly Finds Chip Manufacturer for PlayStation 6 - IGN Daily Fix", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-16T22:55:13+00:00", "description": "DAN DA DAN is coming to Crunchyroll October 3rd Pacific Time!\n\nDandadan is a story about Momo, a high school girl who comes from a family of spirit mediums, and her classmate Okarun, an occult fanatic.
