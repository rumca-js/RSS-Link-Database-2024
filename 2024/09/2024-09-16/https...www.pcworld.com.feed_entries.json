Now, streaming services and smart TVs have all of the content you could ever want at your fingertips at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the era of on-demand content comes with a few drawbacks. Streaming services put region locks on certain content, third parties track and sell data about your viewing habits, and internet service providers (ISPs) have the ability to throttle your internet speeds. Thankfully, using a VPN on your smart TV can help overcome these issues with the added benefit of more privacy and security. In this article I\u2019ll discuss why you should be using a VPN with your smart TV and how to set one up properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re on the hunt for a great VPN for your smart TV, look no ", "id": 1153341, "language": null, "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2453859/heres-why-you-should-be-using-a-vpn-with-your-smart-tv.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.pcworld.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 246, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Here\u2019s why you should be using a VPN with your smart TV", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-16T10:30:00+00:00", "description": "\n<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<body><section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s nothing more heart-stopping than frantically searching for the nearest outlet while your laptop verges on dying.
