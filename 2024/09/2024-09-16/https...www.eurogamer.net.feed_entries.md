If (like me) you found developer Ironwood Studios' wonderfully weird four-wheeled survival game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> just a bit too exhausting when it launched earlier this year, now might be the time to go back: its new Drive Your Way update introduces a whole bunch of custom difficulty settings and presets to make things easier - or masochistically more difficult, if you prefer.
</p><p>
With Pacific Drive's new update installed, players can immediately <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1458140/view/7176011919745442295">choose from seven presets</a> enabling them to tweak the difficulty of their adventures across the Olympic Exclusion Zone. These range from the standard Pacific Drive experience to Joyride - which retains the same fundamental core but red

EA has shared early first details for the next instalment in its Battlefield series, confirming the multiplayer shooter will be returning to the modern era for its next outing, and that the unpopular Specialists system has been jettisoned for good in favour of more traditional classes.
</p><p>
That's according to Respawn head and Battlefield boss Vince Zampella who, in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">conversation with IGN</a>, teased a back-to-basics approach for the series' next outing following 2021's poorly received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>.

With the first anniversary of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> 2's disastrous launch approaching, publisher Paradox Interactive has announced further delays to the game's DLC as developer Colossal Order focuses its efforts on completing the "crucial" assets editor.

nDreams, the VR-focused developer behind the likes of Far Cry VR and Synapse, has confirmed restructuring and redundancies that could affect up to 17.5 percent of its workforce.
</p><p>
The UK studio, which was founded in 2006, currently consists of four teams - nDreams Studio, Orbital, Near Light, and Elevation -  employing around 250 people between them. That means upward of 40 staff could lose their jobs as nDreams' redundancy process proceeds.
</p><p>
In a statement <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/uk-studio-ndreams-confirms-layoffs-could-impact-17-5-percent-of-workforce">provided to Game Developer</a>, nDreams CEO Patrick O'Luanaigh blamed the cuts on a "challenging VR games market" requiring a "renewed strategic focus". O'Luanaigh added that jobs may be cut at all levels, "including senior leadership".

It's a chance to reassess the introduction of the new hardware by being able to actually see the difference, with the blurry haze of YouTube compression artefacts removed from the presentation. In the process, we've learned more about the games shown and have some initial opinions about PSSR - PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution - the new AI upscaling technology used by PS5 Pro. Think of it as Sony's take on Nvidia's game-changing DLSS.</p><p>Of course, we've made a YouTube video about it embedded on this page and by extension, the audience might be wondering how we can show you the games running well on th

It felt like the only question.</p><p>UFO 50 is a collection of 50 new games that look like very old games - games that have come to us, by the armful, straight from the 8-bit generation. An opening graphic shows a storage locker roller door being flung back, and someone gasping in wonder at what's inside. 50 new games, arriving all at once. Not mini-games. Not micro-games. These are full games - games about driving and drifting and blowing planes out of the sky, games about betting on alien sporting events, and games about exploring the deepest oceans.
