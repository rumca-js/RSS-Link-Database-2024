The difference between &#8216;buy now&#8217; and &#8216;bye now&#8217; is very thin. Sometimes, when we push very hard for a commitment, we break the trust we&#8217;ve earned. For a while, you might not notice the broken trust, because we&#8217;re encouraged to keep pushing, treating every individual as a walking ATM, not a relationship to be nurtured [&#8230;]
