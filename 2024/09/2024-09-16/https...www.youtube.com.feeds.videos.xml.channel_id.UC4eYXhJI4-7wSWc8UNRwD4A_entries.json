But what brought the house down was his surprise encore of \u201cA Dios Le Pido,\u201d proving this performance celebrates the power of his artistry and the familiarity of his music in our lives.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cNada Valgo Sin Tu Amor\u201d\n\u201cCecilia\u201d\n\u201cMala Gente\u201d\n\u201cLa Luz\n\u201cA Dios Le Pido\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nJuanes: lead vocals, guitar\nFelipe Navia: bass\nJuan Pablo Daza: guitar\nRichard Bravo: percussion\nMarcel", "id": 1152652, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pt-nLSMONI", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "source_obj__id": 225, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/1Pt-nLSMONI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Juanes: Tiny Desk Concert", "vote": 0}]
