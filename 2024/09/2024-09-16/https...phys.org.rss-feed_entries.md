Accurately predicting how rapidly tropical cyclones (TCs) will intensify is a significant challenge due to the complex processes involved. Limited observations show that smaller TCs tend to intensify faster, suggesting a simple linear relationship between a cyclone's inner-core size and its intensification rate.

Perpetual American strangle options (PASOs) offer investors a method for minimizing risk during highly volatile market scenarios by allowing them to buy or sell options at any date without an expiration date. In a new study, researchers investigated the pricing of PASOs under a stochastic volatility model with fast mean reversion which better captures real markets compared to traditional models.

Many histories of Nazi Germany are accompanied by a photograph of two scientists measuring a man's facial features with a caliper. The picture is often contextualized, in these books, museums, and image archives as an illustration of the National Socialist obsession with quantifiable racial purity, particularly as it was applied to Jews.

Like many natural phenomena, precipitation can be both a blessing and a scourge to human life. On the one hand, it supplies our rivers and fields with water; on the other hand, it can cause floods, landslides, and other natural disasters. Either way, understanding and predicting the different types of precipitation is essential.

The Southern Annular Mode (SAM), with an iconic dipolar zonal wind pattern centered around the axis of the storm track, is the most dominant mode of variability orchestrating the weather and wind from the subtropics to the poles. Its origin, maintenance and feedback have been one of the central themes of atmospheric dynamics. But what role the clouds play in the life cycle of the annular mode remains largely unknown until now, while the wind pattern associated with SAM has long been observed to organize the distribution of cloud in the storm track.

Egyptian temples were not only colorful, but also gleamed in glistening gold. Columns, gates and obelisks have been covered in gold since the beginning of the Pharaonic Period. Researchers also know from textual sources that some of the buildings were gilded. In most cases, these were overlays of thicker metal foils made of gilded copper. Their traces can only be seen today as holes in the walls.

Around 252 million years ago, the world suddenly heated up. Over a geologically brief period of tens of thousands of years, 90% of species were wiped out. Even insects, which are rarely touched by such events, suffered catastrophic losses. The Permian-Triassic mass extinction, as it's known, was the greatest of the "big five" mass extinctions in Earth's history.

Front-line communities, those in regions most severely and immediately affected by increasing weather hazards and climate extremes, can benefit from partnerships between local organizations and academic researchers. However, such coproduction efforts—or collaboration between multiple entities to create solutions-focused knowledge and services—are not always equitable.

As urban areas continue to expand, they often experience the urban heat island effect, where cities become significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Urban trees have long been proposed as a solution to mitigate this effect, thanks to their ability to provide shade and cool the air through evaporation. However, the effectiveness of these cooling mechanisms, particularly under rising temperatures, has remained uncertain—until now.

The 15-minute city, a concept where essential services are accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride, has become increasingly popular in urban planning in recent years. This is because it offers solutions to several pressing challenges in urban areas, such as traffic, pollution, social isolation, and quality of life. With more than half of the world's population now living in cities—and this figure steadily increasing—these issues are becoming ever more critical.

The core-mantle boundary (CMB) is a crucial interface within the Earth, marking the boundary between the outer core and the lower mantle. For the past two decades, seismological studies have identified anomalous low-velocity zones above the CMB, such as the large low-shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs) beneath Africa and the Pacific. Smaller ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs) have been detected in these regions, characterized by significantly lower seismic wave speeds and higher densities compared to the surrounding mantle.
