<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m having an issue setting up the dual can hat on my Raspberry Pi 3 A+. This issue hasn&#39;t occured before but now it seems when adding this command into terminal &quot;<code>sudo</code> <code>/sbin/ip</code> <code>link set</code> <code>can0 up type</code> <code>can bitrate 500000</code>&quot; it completely freezes the RPi. Even opening another terminal won&#39;t let me enter any command, therefor a hard reboot happens and I start again. I have tried on 3 Raspberry Pi&#39;s all with the same Can hat and I get the same results.</p> <p>This is very weird considering I setup multiple RPi&#39;s a few weeks ago with the exact same steps and didn&#39;t get any issues.</p> <p>Has anyone had this issue before and if so what was the fix?</p> <p>MCP2515, both can0 and can1 are succesffuly initialized when entering &quot;dmesg | grep can0&quot;</p> <p>The steps I follow can be found here: <a href="https://copperhilltech.com/blog/pican2-pican3-and-picanm-d
