<p>A good gaming monitor is the next step to take if you want to make the most of your high-end laptop or desktop. But after dropping all that dough on a top-notch machine, spending even more on a display can feel like a real burden. That’s why this deal is such a treat.</p>



<p>Right now, <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1784672-REG/acer_um_hxxaa_302_27_wqqhd144hz_va_monitor.html">B&H Photo is selling a 27-inch Acer Nitro gaming monitor</a> with 1440p resolution for just $190. That’s half off its retail price! </p>



<p>The Acer Nitro XV275U hits all the important specs for a budget gaming monitor. Its 27-inch screen and 2560×1440 resolution comprise the “sweet spot” for showing off graphics while still hitting high frame rates. And with its 170Hz refresh rate and compatibility with AMD FreeSync, you can absolutely hit those high frame rate

<p>If there’s one thing you can always bet on, it’s that you’re going to need a charger — and when you <em>do</em> get to charging, you don’t want to wait around for hours while that battery percentage creeps up.</p>



<p>That’s why you should replace your old and outdated wall chargers with a proper one, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-Foldable-MacBook/dp/B09C5RG6KV/">this Anker USB-C wall charger that’s now down to $30 on Amazon</a> (that’s 46 percent off its normal $56 price).</p>



<p>What makes this a “proper” wall charger? Well, there are three big reasons why we love it.</p>



<p>For starters, it’s powered by second-generation GaN technology, meaning it’s more powerful than older non-GaN chargers. The USB-C output port can deliver up to 65W of fast charging throughput while the USB-A output port can go up to 22.5W. It supp

<p>A gaming laptop that doesn’t cost a small fortune is always a good find, but spotting one with great specs is like spotting a unicorn. Well, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-g15-15-6-fhd-120hz-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-1tb-ssd-dark-shadow-gray-w-black-thermal-shelf/6576920.p?skuId=6576920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this Dell G15 is on sale for $900 at Best Buy</a>, down from its usual $1,150.</p>



<p>If you want a solid gaming laptop with good bang for your buck, this might be the one for you. The Dell G15 starts off strong with an Intel Core i7-13650HX processor and 16GB of RAM, which gives the laptop enough power to run resource-intensive apps and multitask.</p>



<p>But on top of that it has an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card. It may not be the latest model, but it’s still great an

<p>There’s no such thing as storage that’s too fast — but there <em>is</em> storage that’s so fast you can’t even utilize it to its maximum hardware potential. Such is the case for Lexar’s newest SD card.</p>



<p>Lexar’s Professional Gold Pro SDXC Express Card uses the new Secure Digital 8.0 standard and sports a maximum write speed of 1GB/s and a maximum read speed of 1.7GB/s. But good luck actually getting those speeds because no current devices actually go that fast.</p>



<p>To be clear, you can still buy and use the Lexar Adjective Adjective Adjective Acronym Adjective Card in anything with a standard SD card slot. (That’s the one that’s about the size of a US postage stamp, popular in high-end cameras.) But there are no cameras, computers, or even external card readers that can match its maximum speed, despite the standard being finalized back in May

<p>How far can your home Wi-Fi network reach? Out in the boonies I can get a signal for perhaps 30 feet outside my small house. But in packed urban apartments I’ve seen it drop off completely just a couple of rooms away, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407165/mesh-network-explained.html">hence the demand for mesh networks</a>.

<p>Microsoft recently unveiled plans to clean up the increasingly labyrinthine Settings page in its Edge browser.</p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2024/09/15/microsoft-edge-update-could-redesign-settings-to-rival-google-chrome/">Windows Latest</a>, you can see these plans for yourself if you head over to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=416093&filters=In%20development&searchterms=416093">official Microsoft 365 roadmap page</a> and expand the description for the item labeled “Microsoft Edge: Elevating top settings and improving settings page navigability.”</p>

<p>Today, Microsoft is announcing “Wave 2” of its Microsoft 365 Copilot AI innovation, which is geared towards users who are paying for a Microsoft 365 Copilot Pro subscription. But one feature, known as <strong>Pages</strong>, may be available to business customers who use Copilot without a subscription.</p>



<p>The subtext of Pages — and the overall theme of the new Copilot wave in general — is that Copilot’s AI contributions matter.</p>



<p>Normally, any advice provided by Copilot remains within Copilot and only for a short time. Microsoft characterizes Copilot’s output as “ephemeral,” signifying something that eventually passes over.</p>



<p>But the new Pages feature treats Copilot’s insights as equal to something that you or your coworkers themselves might have authored, saving Copilot’s output on a “page” to be worked on with your colleagues.</p>

<p>Long ago, it used to be possible to share your grouped tabs from Android’s Chrome app with others. That feature, which was removed for whatever reasons, is now making a comeback in improved form.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-update-september-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google announced</a> that its Chrome browser would be getting some new features, and one of them is the ability to share your grouped tabs between your various devices.</p>



<p>For example, you could create a tab group on your phone while commuting home, then open that same tab group on your desktop PC once you’ve settled down at home. Conversely, you can have a tab group on your laptop that’s also accessible on your phone while on the go.</p>

<p>The notifications at the bottom right of the Windows desktop screen can be practical.<strong> </strong>If you’re waiting for an important e-mail, for example, you don’t need to keep opening the mail program to look for it–instead you’ll be informed via a notification. That said, constant notifications can be really annoying. This applies, for example, to routine tasks like when the printer is printing a document. For such cases, Windows offers the option of deactivating the notifications for each application on an individual basis. </p>



<p>In Windows 10, click on <strong>System – Notifications & actions</strong> in the Settings app. </p>



<p>At the top, you can switch off all notifications. Below this is the list of individual apps, starting by default with the apps that last drew attention to themselves with notifications. Use the sliders to switch o

<p>Most recently, we saw <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2456238/this-windows-programme-secretly-eats-up-resources-how-to-switch-it-off.html">the Photos app causing performance issues</a> after it was switched over from UWP to Windows App SDK.

<p>If you’re one of the many people out there who uses a third-party email app to access Microsoft’s Outlook email service, you may need to start looking for an alternative email program soon.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-sends-final-notice-before-you-lose-outlook-access-on-third-party-apps-today/">Neowin reports</a>, Microsoft has started sending out a “final notice” that some third-party email apps will soon lose access to Outlook emails. The reason? The affected third-party email apps aren’t secure enough.</p>



<p>Microsoft wants users to switch from “Basic Authentication” (which only uses a username and password for logging in) to “Modern Authentication” (which uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for a much safer login process that keeps accounts secure).</p>



<p>In other words, third-party email apps that don’t support OAuth 2.

<p>Gone are the days of circling through the same old cable TV channels or blocking out your schedule on weeknights just so you can catch your favorite show. Now, streaming services and smart TVs have all of the content you could ever want at your fingertips at all times.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the era of on-demand content comes with a few drawbacks. Streaming services put region locks on certain content, third parties track and sell data about your viewing habits, and internet service providers (ISPs) have the ability to throttle your internet speeds. Thankfully, using a VPN on your smart TV can help overcome these issues with the added benefit of more privacy and security. In this article I’ll discuss why you should be using a VPN with your smart TV and how to set one up properly.</p>
