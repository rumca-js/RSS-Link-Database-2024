In China, marriage is hard for men. They need a house, a car, and age is also a big issue.

In this video, we explore the growing challenges facing young people in China when it comes to marriage. From the skyrocketing costs of buying a home, bride price demands, and wedding expenses to the imbalance in the male-to-female ratio, the pressures on young men and women are immense. We also discuss how societal changes, economic downturns, and high unemployment rates are driving many to delay or abandon marriage altogether. Watch to understand the complex factors shaping Chinaâ€™s marriage landscape in 2024.
