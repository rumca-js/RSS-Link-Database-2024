It juggles multiple thoughts, which can lead to information slipping away. Recreating the context where you had the thought may help in retrieving it. Neuroscientists like Earl K. Miller suggest avoiding multitasking to reduce these memory lapses

New research into Earth’s inner core suggests that supercooling, a process where a liquid cools below its freezing point without solidifying, may reveal that the core is much younger than previously thought. Composed of iron and nickel, the core plays a critical role in maintaining Earth’s magnetic field, which protects the planet from harmful solar radiation. Studies indicate that supercooling could have impacted the core’s formation, potentially reducing its estimated age to between 500 and 1,000 million years, a discovery that could reshape our understanding of Earth’s magnetic and geological history.
