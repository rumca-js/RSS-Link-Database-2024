In today's Daily Fix:
Sony has finally revealed the PS5 Pro, but that doesn't mean they're resting on their laurels. The company has reportedly found a supplier for their as-yet-unannounced PlayStation 6. According to the report, Intel has lost out on the contract to chipmaker AMD, who also supplied the custom chip for the PlayStation 5. This previous arrangement was apparently important in the negotiations, as Sony wants the PS6 to be backwards compatible with the PS5, and using a different chip from a different manufacturer could complicate that. In other news, Warhammer fans on PlayStation have news to celebrate. Hot on the heels of the successful Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 launch on PS5 and PC, the formerly Xbox console exclusive Warhammer 40K: Darktide is coming to PS5. And finally, watch out, Zelda fans, as leaks and spoilers of the new Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom have appeared online after a ROM made its way online.

To prove to each other what they believe in is real, Momo goes to an abandoned hospital where a UFO has been spotted and Okarun goes to a tunnel rumored to be haunted. To their surprise, they each encounter overwhelming paranormal activities that transcend comprehension. Amid these predicaments, Momo awakens her hidden power and Okarun gains the power of a curse to overcome these new dangers! Their fateful love begins as well!?

## Funko Fusion Review

Funko Fusion reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PlayStation 5. Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

"Funko Fusion has no shortage of oversized heads, but between them all it still manages to contain precious little in the way of interesting new ideas. Its simplistic shooting is dull, its many bugs and backtracking requirements are exhausting, and its peculiar marriage of child-pleasing character styles and LEGO-like level design with a number of film and television licenses that are distinctly adult just seems ill-advised from the jump. Although it definitely nails the signature look of the pint-sized collectibles, it’s really not much fun to play which means that just like your Funko Pop collection it’s probably best left on the shelf."
