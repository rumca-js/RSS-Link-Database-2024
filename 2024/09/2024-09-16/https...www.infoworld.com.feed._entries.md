<p>In the beginning, there was no need to build anything. We manipulated the toggle switches on the front panel of a mainframe, and the code either ran or it didn’t. Creating software was very straightforward. Maybe not easy, but certainly uncomplicated.</p>



<p>Today, every line of code could pass through a dozen or more steps. A software developer’s—or should we say “CPU instruction artist’s”?— magical keystrokes are transformed to create machine executables. This process, often called the <em>build</em>, is so elaborate that even medium-sized teams may dedicate one or more full-time engineers to managing the complicated dance.</p>



<p>How did we get here? Well, over the years, software devel

<p>This past week I spent time with some IT executives at a Fortune 500 company. Despite years of big spending on AWS, the company made a commitment years ago to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2262556/why-microsoft-azure-wins-with-enterprise-customers.html">switch to Microsoft Azure</a>. Today they’re still on AWS… and Azure… and private data centers. Our conversation was yet another reminder of the messy reality of enterprise IT spending. However much we may want to pretend there are absolutes about enterprise IT (“everyone is moving to the cloud”), the foundational principle of enterprise IT strategy always comes down to two words:</p>



<p>It depends.</p>

<p>Scared of flying but don’t think twice about a lengthy road trip? Consider this: <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/planecrash/risky.html">NOVA reports</a>  that your odds of a fatal car crash are 1 in 5000, but the chance of perishing in a plane is just 1 in 11 million. Despite air travel being 2,200 times safer than a car<strong>,</strong> many people fear flying more than driving. Feeling anxious is understandable if you’ve ever white-knuckled your way through a turbulent flight, but the numbers tell a different story. </p>



<p>There’s a similar misconception about biometric authentication and passwords. While biometrics aren’t immune to compromise (just as air travel isn’t completely r

<p>Amazon Web Services is transferring its <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2338432/somehow-opensearch-has-succeeded.html">OpenSearch</a> open-source project to the Linux Foundation, which has launched the OpenSearch Software Foundation to support the project and its search and analytics software.</p>



<p>The announcement was made September 16. An open-source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana, OpenSearch now becomes part of the Linux Foundation family of open source projects. OpenSearch is used by developers around the world to build search, analytics, observability, and vector database applications, to the tune of more than 700 million downloads, the Linux Foundation said.
