Jonah Hill's Seth, Michael Cera's Evan were perfect as the stand ins for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, and Christopher Mintz-Plase's McLovin proved to be the perfect comedic sidekick.  Comedy sidekick's like Superbad's McLovin aren't anything new.  In fact theres a long line of comedic sidekicks that made their movies instant classics.  Without McLovin, who knows if Superbad would have landed as well with audiences.\n\n#superbad #mclovin #sethrogen #nerdstalgic \n\nhttps://variety.com/2022/film/news/jonah-hill-hated-christopher-mintz-plasse-superbad-audition-1235343770/\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12301079/Jay-Baruchel-reveals-onscreen-dislike-Jonah-Hill-End-based-reality.html", "id": 1155694, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxCmjJEzHSs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXjmz8dFzRJZrZY8eFiXNUQ", "source_obj__id": 236, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/WxCmjJEzHSs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why McLovin Is The Perfect Comedy Sidekick", "vote": 0}]
