Today they\u2019re still on AWS\u2026 and Azure\u2026 and private data centers. Our conversation was yet another reminder of the messy reality of enterprise IT spending. However much we may want to pretend there are absolutes about enterprise IT (\u201ceveryone is moving to the cloud\u201d), the foundational principle of enterprise IT strategy always comes down to two words:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It depends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of \u201cit\u201d depends ", "id": 1152202, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3522124/when-your-cloud-strategy-is-it-depends.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.infoworld.com/feed/", "source_obj__id": 468, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "When your cloud strategy is \u2018it depends\u2019", "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-16T08:30:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"remove_no_follow\">\n\t\t<div class=\"grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"article-column__content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Scared of flying but don\u2019t think twice about a lengthy road trip?
