<p>Jason Snell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ten years sure seems like a long time.</p>

<p>Ten years ago the iPhone got physically big for the first time.
(In the ensuing decade, iPhone revenue has doubled.) Ten years ago
Apple announced the Apple Watch.</p>

<p>Ten years ago I found myself without a job for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I ran into Snell before (and again after) Apple’s event last week, and he mentioned that it marked Six Colors’s 10th anniversary. My reaction: I somehow simultaneously think of Six Colors as still kinda new <em>and</em> a bedrock of the Apple media firmament.</p>

<p>On days like today, it’s the first site I visit, because of pieces like these:</p>

<p>Joe Rossignol, reporting for MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple released watchOS 11 today following months of beta testing.
A key new health-related feature included in the software update
is sleep apnea detection, which is available starting today on the
Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch Series 9, and Apple Watch Ultra
2 in more than 150 countries and regions, according to Apple.</p>

<p>The list of countries includes the U.S., U.K., France, Germany,
Italy, Spain, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and many others, with
a <a href="https://www.apple.com/watchos/feature-availability/#health-sleep-apnea-notifications">full list available on Apple’s website</a>. A few
English-speaking countries where the feature is not yet available
are Australia and Canada, as Apple is still seeking regulatory
clearance for the feature in some regions.</p>

<p>17 years later, I’ve consolidated. 2007 was so long ago that <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a> hadn’t yet been created; my back-pocket notebooks are much slimmer now than that hardcover Moleskine.<sup id="fnr1-2024-09-16"><a href="#fn1-2024-09-16">

<p>Thierry Breton, in a letter to Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On 24 July, you wrote to Member States asking them to nominate
candidates for the 2024-2029 College of Commissioner, specifying
that Member States that intend to suggest the incumbent Member of
the Commission were not required to suggest two candidates. On 25
July, President Emmanuel Macron designated me as France’s official
candidate for a second mandate in the College of Commissioners — as he had already publicly announced on the margins of the
European Council on 28 June. A few days ago, in the very final
stretch of negotiations on the composition of the future College,
you asked France to withdraw my name — for personal reasons that
in no instance you have discussed directly with me — and offered,
as a political trade-off, an allegedly more influential portfolio
