They need a house, a car, and age is also a big issue.\n\nIn this video, we explore the growing challenges facing young people in China when it comes to marriage. From the skyrocketing costs of buying a home, bride price demands, and wedding expenses to the imbalance in the male-to-female ratio, the pressures on young men and women are immense.

Watch to understand the complex factors shaping China\u2019s marriage landscape in 2024.\n\nHave questions? Do you have something to share with us about China?
