<p>Dillon plays a man with more red flags than a golf course and Aida Folch does her best stay above water in Fernando Trueba’s noir-adjacent film</p><p>Neither pulpy enough for the midnight movie crowd, nor classy enough for the arthouse, this alleged thriller about a young woman called Alex (Aida Folch), who travels to an idyllic Greek island where she meets mysterious restaurant owner Max (Matt Dillon), who is obviously repressing some sort of dark past, feels like a missed opportunity. Spanish director Fernando Trueba (Belle Époque, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235830/">Chico &amp; Rita</a>), working from an iffy script he co-wrote with Rylend Grant, gets most of the ingredients right – exotic location, good-looking leads, a few different narrative reveals up its sleeve – but flubs the execution, leaving his cast floundering (in one case literally, in a fake drowning scene).</p><p>You can see why the actors signed on, though.

## Last Straw review – waitress holes up in diner in twisty low-budget siege horror

<p>This debut feature from Alan Scott Neal shows plenty of promise, with its classic  setup and innovative midpoint switcharound</p><p>The first half of this 80-minute roadside diner siege horror plays out almost like a section of an anthology film, calling to mind the nasty little slasher The Gas Station in John Carpenter and Tobe Hooper’s Body Bags project. The opening 40 minutes or so mostly sticks with the same location, and the focus is initially on one character: newly pregnant waitress Nancy (Jessica Belkin), whose dad (Jeremy Sisto) owns a modest diner in the middle of nowhere, and who has put her in charge of that evening’s imminent night shift. It’s not exactly the world’s most enviable nepo baby gig, even if you’re not attempting to suppress mounting waves of nausea, and so Nancy is cranky and in no mood to take any flak from either a gang of punks on dirt bikes or the surly “legacy hire” chef Jake (Taylor Kowalski), whom she summarily fires after he mouths off.</p><p>This

<p>The TV chef’s go-to recipe for dining under the duvet is pasta in a bright red sauce. Picturing the consequences chills me to the bone</p><p>Possibly the least surprising revelation from the Times’s recent Nigella Lawson interview: she loves eating in bed.

I was in a dark place, but we filled a hole in each other’s hearts.  </p><p>Floof burst into my life on a gloomy autumn night in 2015. I was new to London, walking home from my bar job in the teeming rain, when a pair of green eyes on a porch roof stopped me in my tracks. Closer inspection revealed a small fluffy cat – black as the night, totally drenched and yelling right at me. I helped her down, and in response she shadowed me for 25 minutes down the busy main road, screeching outside my front door with a determination that woke my flatmate. We let her in – “just for tonight”. But as she bedded down on my pillow, I knew she had no plans to leave.</p><p>It shouldn’t have worked.

<p>A celebrated travel writer is drawn into a labyrinth of secrets and betrayals by MI6, while battling his childhood trauma, in a masterly tale set in the early 60s</p><p>You don’t necessarily think of <a href="https://williamboyd.co.uk/">William Boyd</a> as an author of spy novels – not in the way you would think of John le Carré or <a href="https://charlescumming.co.uk/">Charles Cumming</a> – but he returns again and again to the secret world in his writing. In 2013, he wrote a Bond novel, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/07/solo-william-boyd-james-bond">Solo</a></em>, which saw the spy travel to Nigeria, where the author grew up. Writing a character who embraces espionage so wholeheartedly seemed to highlight the way in which the agents in the rest of the Boyd oeuvre tend to be pulled into the secret service reluctantly, their subterfuge speaking of deeper personal struggles.</p><p>Gabriel Dax lives in the shadow of an early tragedy.

<p>The eventful love life – and intelligence-gathering skills – of one of the most talked-about women of her age makes the first half of this sympathetic study more compelling than the postwar ‘gold-digging’ years</p><p>As a youth she wasn’t popular among her peers. “Fat and freckly with red hair and mad about horses,” remembers Clarissa Churchill. “We used to bully her.” Nancy Mitford was no kinder: “She was a red-headed bouncing little thing, regarded as a joke.” Among the debutantes of 1938 she did not shine, being neither rich nor beautiful. And yet despite this unpropitious beginning, Pamela Digby (later Churchill Harriman) would become one of the most influential, moneyed and talked-about women in postwar Anglo-American high society. <a href="https://www.soniapurnell.com/about">Sonia Purnell</a> explains how she did it in this sympathetic, well-researched, busily peopled but faintly exhausting biography, which will test even the keenest appetite for stories of ambition and the w

<p>As rich westerners fuel demand for the ancient fragrance, a lucrative race for the resin is killing the trees but leaving little of the trade’s profit for those gathering it</p><p>In a corner of Covent Garden, well-heeled Londoners and tourists browse the range of frankincense products sold by a leading cosmetics brand while they drink a complimentary rose and berry tea. Amid the aromatic resin sheathed under glass, shoppers can buy “age-defying” serums, creams and essences, and tablets to strengthen brittle nails and hair.</p><p>At one counter, a sales assistant is advising customers on how much of the essential oil to add to their nebuliser to make guests feel relaxed “without overwhelming them”. Another explains frankincense’s “hydrating and rejuvenating” properties, including its alleged ability to smooth out fine lines caused by smiling and squinting. In terms of popularity, she says, it now far outstrips lavender, tea tree and other botanicals.</p> <a href="https://www.thegua

It is now a deserted wasteland; only two residents remain, their daily routine revolving around cleaning up mountains of black slag or sorting through rusty machine parts left behind in abandoned factories. Hypnotic in its eerie solemnity, Jessica Johnson and Ryan Ermacora’s documentary connects these images of present-day ruins with Anyox’s sordid past, in which labour exploitation was inflicted in the name of commerce.</p><p>Digging through official reports, personal diaries and newspaper articles, the film conjures the psychological impact as well as the physical toil endured by the miners, half of whom were immigrants from eastern Europe.
