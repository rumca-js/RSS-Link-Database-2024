Superbad is without a doubt one of the seminal high school comedies of our generation.  Jonah Hill's Seth, Michael Cera's Evan were perfect as the stand ins for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, and Christopher Mintz-Plase's McLovin proved to be the perfect comedic sidekick.  Comedy sidekick's like Superbad's McLovin aren't anything new.  In fact theres a long line of comedic sidekicks that made their movies instant classics.  Without McLovin, who knows if Superbad would have landed as well with audiences.
