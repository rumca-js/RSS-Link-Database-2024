Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time I wanted to look at the rise of "AI Video Game Engines", Google and some of the biggest companies in the world have created a neural game engine that seems to do nothing but regurgitate video game footage (very expensively too) instead of actually creating something new to play or make the job easier for developers to create the games we love to play. Thanks for watching!
