<p>According to credible rumors, Snap and Meta will soon unveil their next-generation AI glasses.</p>



<p>Snap might introduce its fifth-generation Spectacles at the Snap Partner Summit on Sept. 17. Features like a wider field of view and improved battery life could grace a production run of fewer than 10,000 units for developers. (The current 4th-generation Spectacles are also for developers only; Snap never sold them to the public.)</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Meta could well unveil its “Orion” project at its <a href="https://www.meta.com/connect/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.meta.com/connect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Connect conference</a>, scheduled for Sept. 25-26. Accor
