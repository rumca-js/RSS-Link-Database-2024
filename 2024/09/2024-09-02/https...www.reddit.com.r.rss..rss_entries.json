CaRP is no longer being updated by its author, <a href=\"http://carp.docs.geckotribe.com/\">Gecko Tribe LLC</a>, so it is only compatible/working with up to PHP version 7.4</p> <p>With version 8.4 coming out in November and 7.4 eventually being obsolete. , I have started looking for a replacement script package I can use/host.</p> <p>Does anyone who is familiar with a product like CaRP have any suggestion(s)?
