## America’s New Female Right review – this lazy BBC documentary fails to tackle dangerously extreme views

<p>This shoddy programme neglects to properly challenge the hard-right views of the women interviewed. It’s a wasted opportunity</p><p>I am going to go out on a limb and say that most Guardian readers who watch a BBC documentary called America’s New Female Right are unlikely to be in accord with the views espoused therein. We are not going to empathise with statements such as: “Women getting the right to vote has led to every form of degeneracy,” “Feminism was absolutely created to destabilise the family [and] western civilisation,” and: “Feminism is a thousand times more toxic than the ‘toxic masculinity’ we hear so much about.” We are unlikely to agree that “Satan’s agenda” is to destroy the nuclear family structure in order to control society.</p><p>All these statements are uttered – with certainty and apparent sincerity – by women championing rightwing causes, often in a way that seems to run counter to what we would consider their best interests.</p> <a href="https://www.theguard

The film’s very fragility is what makes it so gorgeous.</p><p>Tilda Swinton plays Martha, a driven former war correspondent now dying of cervical cancer and keen to reconnect with an old friend, Ingrid (Julianne Moore), who has latterly become a writer of acclaimed autofiction. Martha and Ingrid were once colleagues on a hip New York magazine and briefly shared a Philip Rothian lover, Damian (John Turturro), but they haven’t seen each other in years; their lives have spun them down different paths

<p>Just the right balance of fragrant herbs and sour tamarind, with a tickle of spice: a lovely light lunch or dinner</p><p>I could drink tamarind broth in lieu of tea or coffee. The heat in this dish comes from the judicious use of black peppercorns that are coarsely ground in a mortar, but please do this mindfully. I have been known to grind the pepper overzealously into a dust, which is a mistake, because the resulting broth will take your head off. Add rice noodles, pak choi and prawns, and you’ve got a warming yet fresh and light dinner in 30 minutes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/sep/02/quick-easy-hot-sour-noodle-soup-prawns-recipe-rukmini-iyer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How much will it cost you to get tickets for your favourite band, or to marry your favourite person? Well, how much can you conceivably afford?</p><p>Because I am a good friend and a solid person, I sometimes put together a quiz for my associates. Because I am a slapdash friend and a flake, the answers are often contestable – you could even say wrong – and I choose to see this as part of the unforgettable fun. Anyway, on Saturday, in the round called The Wonderful World of the Young, I asked the price of a ticket to Reading festival and, in The Wonderful World of the Old, the price of an Oasis ticket. These questions turned out to be so profoundly unanswerable that the whole thing disintegrated in rancour.</p><p>Even after you had added every caveat – early bird or regular, sitting or standing, official site or online tout – there was no true price. There were people round the table who had paid £291 for Reading tickets, yet the lowest price you could find on the whole of the inter

<p>Writer-director Molly McGlynn’s own experience adds a new dimension to the usual tropes of virginity loss, relationships and high school politics</p><p>Older viewers may feel, well, erm, old, to see that this film comes prefaced with a wise statement – handed down as if ’twere written on tablets of stone – from the 2009 film Jennifer’s Body. (Wasn’t 2009 about four years ago?) Portentously proclaiming “Hell is a teenage girl”, it’s an apt little quote to kick off this neatly done teen movie, which unusually throws a rare biological condition into the typical mix of virginity loss, relationship drama and high school politics. Our lead Lindy (Maddie Ziegler) discovers, after a routine medical appointment, that she does not have a uterus or vaginal canal deeper than “a vaginal dimple”, making the prospect of first-time sex with her dreamy boyfriend Adam (D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai) more than usually anxiety-making.</p><p>For the majority of its runtime, Fitting In takes a commendably charac

These forgotten treasures carry the traces of Burlaka’s life, and the remains of a bygone film-making era.</p><p>Many of these black-and-white photos are discoloured and damaged, leaving behind evocative swirls and patterns; in closeup, these imperfections conjure a form of visual map that bears the mark of time.

<p>The new government must use its landslide majority to mend the damage to jobs and fish populations caused by neglect</p><p>It is a lonely and unglamorous job, being His Majesty’s official opposition, as Labour knows only too well. There were moments when, out of the spotlight, the party’s spokespeople in parliament heroically defended the public interest on some of the most important issues of the day. One example was during the post-Brexit Fisheries Act, where Labour made a formidable case that history has proved right. The question now is whether Labour will use its landslide majority to fix the extraordinary neglect of our marine environment that it previously lacked the votes for.</p><p>Back in 2020, when the fisheries bill was making its way through parliament, Labour’s fisheries spokesperson, Luke Pollard, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/13/supertrawlers-ramp-up-activity-uk-protected-waters-during-lockdown">made the case</a> that the prime objective

<p>This elegiac Irish film documents the relationship between street artist Asbestos and his mother, and the public art project he makes to help process his grief</p><p>A strange but reassuring ouroboros effect is in place in Ross Killeen’s documentary about dementia. One of the things that ailing Helena is able to recall is her son’s insistence as a child on embracing creative thinking. Now a grown man and operating as a street artist under the moniker Asbestos, art is the means by which he seeks to grasp her identity and come to terms with her disintegration. It is a labour that encircles her, spills out on to the streets of Dublin and colours the fabric of this crisp, sensitive film.</p><p>Helena no longer remembers what day of the week it is, or the month. Her husband tries to reignite her synapses by consulting her on crosswords.
