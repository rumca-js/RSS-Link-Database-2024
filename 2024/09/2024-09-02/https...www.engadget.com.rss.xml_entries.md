<p>A federal judge has ruled that social media companies can’t be required to block certain types of content from teens. The ruling will prevent some aspects of a controversial social media law in Texas from going into effect.</p>
<p>The ruling came as the result of tech industry groups’ challenge to the Securing Children Online Through Parental Empowerment (SCOPE) Act, a Texas law that imposes age verification requirements and other policies for how social media companies treat teenage users. But, as <em>The Verge</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/2/24232366/texas-scope-act-hb18-blocked-kids-online-safety" data-original-link="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/2/24232366/texas-scope-act-hb18-blocked-kids-online-safety"><ins>points out</ins></a>, the measure also requires companies to “prevent the known minor’s exposure to harmful material,” including content that “glorifies” self-harm and

<p><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em> is here; a gravy-flavored palate cleanser from all the action-adventures, Souls-likes and Metroidvanias I’ve played the last few months.</p>
<p>Published by Panic Inc., the same company that unleashed <em>Untitled Goose Game</em> into the world, there’s a certain throughline, even if the aesthetic and tone is very different. Presented in cartoon style somewhere between Cartoon Network and educational ‘toons for preschoolers, it’s an aggressively English, charmingly northern “slap-former”, where you play as an unnamed tiny man, who’s come for a job interview at town hall. After being fobbed off by the receptionist, he has to kill time in the fictional northern-England town called Barnsworth, which is definitely 80 percent Barnsley, 20 percent plausible deniability.</p>

## The Morning After: A Tamagotchi made with real egg

<p>It’s Labor Day, so tech news typically slows down. We’ve still got some intriguing headlines to share, though, like, er, a new Tamagotchi. Bandai’s newest digital pet is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/general/the-latest-tamagotchi-is-made-with-real-eggs-120051417.html">made with recycled eggshells</a>. The Original Tamagotchi Celebration digital pet is even colored like a tan/brown egg, with green and white designs with pink accents and buttons.</p>
<p>In ways, it’s a bit of a throwback compared to the recently released Tamagotchis. In May, the company re-released Tamagotchi Connection, the model with a faux antenna, to celebrate its 20th anniversary. Last year’s Tamagotchi Uni had WiFi connectivity and gave users access to the Tamaverse.</p>
<p>This one is a little more basic, and it’s available at Amazon, currently on pre-order for $30.</p>
