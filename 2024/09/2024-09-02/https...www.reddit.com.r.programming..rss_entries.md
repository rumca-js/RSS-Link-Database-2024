<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys! I’m a 20F student from Germany, and I’ve been working on a project that requires some programming skills. I tried using ChatGPT for help, but I wasn’t really successful, lol. I learned a bit of C# out of boredom during the lockdown for about two weeks, but other than that, I don’t have much programming experience.</p> <p>I thought maybe someone else might be stuck on their goals too, and if they’re related to biochemistry/biology or German, maybe we could help each other out. Feel free to DM me!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwordfishDue2391"> /u/SwordfishDue2391 </a> <br/> <span><a href="http://ebay.de">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1f6x2cz/offering_help_with_learning_german_or/">[comments]</a></span>
