<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I am working on an exercise that asks for converting assembly instructions to machine code and I am kinda confused when it comes to the immediate value in B format instructions, so if my offset is -8 in decimal, converting it to binary using 2s complement on 12 bits gives 1111 1111 1000 so here do i need to shift this immediate value left by 1 (so that it becomes 1111 1111 1000 0 on 13-bit) or do i just ignore the first zero and sign extend by 1 ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fit-Extension-4752"> /u/Fit-Extension-4752 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1f78yyk/left_shift_in_b_format_instructions_riscv/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1f78yyk/left_shift_in_b_format_instructions_riscv/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I apologize if my question is dumb, but I don&#39;t understand CPUs as well as I&#39;d like.</p> <p>Years ago, I was talking to a friend about CPU instruction sets, and he said the instruction set itself wasn&#39;t the thing that determined how good a modern CPU was. I&#39;m not sure I remember his argument accuratetly, but I think he said that it had more to do with how the chip was designed, how the ISA was implemented, and how good the chip was at things like instruction pipelining. My friend said that the ISA was implemented on top of something lower level in the chip, (the microarchitecture?), and that the differences that determine which CPU is best often exist at a level below the ISA. </p> <p>My question is whether the big CPU companies have special expertise in design and manufacturing that don&#39;t have anything to do with the ISA, and that will make it hard for RISC-V to compete on the high performance end, or if those techniques are well
