While looking for a shady place to capture this Field Recording, we trekked down a steep rocky trail, all the way to the edge of the nearby Roaring Fork River, only to find it too tight for our crew and musical guest. And because the river was indeed roaring, we headed back to the top of the hill to record this intimate set.\n\nSon Little had never performed a concert in a field before, but he was completely at ease on the hot hill, waiting patiently while we set up the cameras and microphones. He played a lovely four-song set that radiates vulnerability and affection, starting with \u201cbend yr ear\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s good\u201d (both from his latest album, Like Neptune), and finished the set with two of his bigger hits, \u201cmad about you\u201d and \u201cneve give up.\u201d\n\nSET LIST \n\u201cbend yr ear\u201d\n\u201cwhat\u2019s good\u201d\n\u201cmad about you\u201d\n\u201cneve give up\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS \nSon Littl", "id": 1067463, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_XdKr7q0r8", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "source_obj__id": 225, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/0_XdKr7q0r8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Son Little: Field Recordings x Aspen Ideas Festival", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
