## For anyone who followed the journey since the first 3D printed version, now the exoskeleton is more than half in metal (CNC machined Alu). Some components will still be 3D printed (I'm using ABS-GF now). Still work in progress but it was long I didn't post any update so here it is.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a printer and I&#39;ve been studying about types of 3d printers, types of filaments and resins, configurations on slicers and many other stuff.</p> <p>What I came to conclusion is that I want and will eventually buy a colored FDM printer. The goal is to print some useful items for my house, some trinkets/cool stuff, organizers and maybe in the future build models (drones? cars? other? dunno now).</p> <p>A1 Combo seems to be a good choice, but I end up with FOMO about the types of filament that it doesn&#39;t support (or &quot;kinda&quot; support like ABS) and I keep leaning towards a P1S or a X1 Carbon. The thing is... Prusa XL seems to be AWESOME (almost no waste on colored printing), but way, way off my budget (X1 would be expansive to me, but doable).</p> <p>For people that are years into 3d printing, would you say that this Prusa XL &quot;model&quot; with multiple print heads will be a thing in cheaper printers in upcoming years?
