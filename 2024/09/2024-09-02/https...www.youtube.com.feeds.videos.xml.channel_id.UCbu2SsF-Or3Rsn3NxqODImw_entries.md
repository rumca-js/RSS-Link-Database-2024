It's been over a decade!

A lot can change in a decade and if you played 2011’s Warhammer 40K: Space Marine at launch, it has been OVER a decade since you first experienced the game’s narrative… unless you’ve replayed it recently of course. 

However, if you clicked this video, that’s probably not you. So whether you’ve forgotten or never played it at all, you’re in the right place. We’re going over all the major events of the original game just in time for the much anticipated sequel.
