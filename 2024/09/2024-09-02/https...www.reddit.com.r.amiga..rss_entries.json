When I first got my Amiga 500, very late 80s (i think), the thirst thing that I run was some kind of demo/intro/cracktro/music disk. All I remember was that it featured a single image (or at least it was the first image that appeared when it started). The image was of a safety edge razor blade, diagonal on the screen, with blood dripping along the top edge (or was it bottom edge?). I know that it is not a lot information, and I&#39;ve been googling for it for quite some time... Does it ring a bell for anyone?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ftmk\"> /u/ftmk </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1f7ez64/searching_for_this_one_introdemomusic/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1f7ez64/searching_for_this_one_introdemomusic/", "id": 1070496, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1f7ez64/searching_for_this_one_introdemomusic", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/.rss", "source_obj__id": 458, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Searching for this one intro/demo/music disk/something else that I once had", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-02T18:35:48+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1f7e8vx/my_icons_are_corrupted/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/w83txht2xfmd1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25204cb40a692486f2e8ad1dbd79c1b740726e49\" alt=\"My icons are corrupted\" title=\"My icons are corrupted\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello all,</p> <p>In my Amiga setup (I use the same setup both on real A1200 and WinUAE, the icons are somehow corrupted.
