<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Since the early 2000s I have volunteered hosting a news and info portal site for my local Council on Aging center. (<a href="https://SalisburyMass.com/forums">Salisbury COA</a>) The page displays RSS new feeds via the CaRP Evolution RSS parser script package uploaded to my commercially hosted domain. CaRP is no longer being updated by its author, <a href="http://carp.docs.geckotribe.com/">Gecko Tribe LLC</a>, so it is only compatible/working with up to PHP version 7.4</p> <p>With version 8.4 coming out in November and 7.4 eventually being obsolete. , I have started looking for a replacement script package I can use/host.</p> <p>Does anyone who is familiar with a product like CaRP have any suggestion(s)? This is NOT a wordpress site, BTW.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ddawall"> /u/ddawall </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1f7fv3t/looking_for_replacement_for_carp_evol
