Tomato breeding has historically depended on a narrow genetic pool, leading to decreased diversity and loss of valuable traits. Traditional methods and biparental populations fall short in harnessing the full potential of wild relatives, posing challenges in improving traits like fruit size, disease resistance, and adaptability. Addressing these challenges, comprehensive genetic resources that integrate diverse alleles from wild and weedy tomatoes are essential for discovering novel genes and boosting breeding efficiency.
