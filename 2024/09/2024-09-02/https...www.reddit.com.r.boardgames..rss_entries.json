I&#39;m used to seeing dozens, if not hundreds, of comments a day from backers, talking with each other, asking questions, etc. On Backerkit, I barely see this at all. What got me wondering this is the One Deck Dungeon campaign that&#39;s up right now. I admittedly don&#39;t know Backerkit that well, and have only backed one thing there and then ignored it, but is this normal? Do people really just not talk much during Backerkit campaigns? I find the format of it a little clunky, so again, not sure if I&#39;m just not understanding how people talking on Backerkit works. Any insight is appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GriffinFur\"> /u/GriffinFur </a> <br/> <span", "id": 1065483, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1f6tdh1/am_i_missing_something_on_backerkit_or_do_few", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/.rss", "source_obj__id": 473, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Am I missing something on Backerkit or do few people talk there?", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
