I don&#39;t mind hosting it myself on my computer, just portforwarded or something.

I don&#39;t really like having the DNS pointing to my public IP without being behind a Cloudflare proxy as I have new people join sometimes. </p> <p>I am running the Minecraft servers on an application running on another VM on Proxmox called AMP (Application Management Program). I have done some digging and have found out about the Streams feature. From my understanding, since Cloudflare&#39;s proxy feature only allows port 80 &amp; 443, I could use this to direct traffic from these ports to ports that Minecraft uses (22565, 25566, and so on for separate servers).</p> <p>I find this to be a safer option then exposing my public DNS. I am not entirely sure how to set this up and was wondering if any of you have any insights or experience in this.</p> <p>Any advice would be appreciated!</p> </div><!-- S

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, as part of a research project I&#39;m doing for my Masters, I&#39;m carrying out a survey to collect some data on the potential use of AI within the workplace. My thoughts here are that there are potentially a large number of organisations, big and small that only know about the usual suspects such CoPilot, ChatGPT etc. and not local options such as Ollama and RAG.</p> <p>I&#39;m interested in understanding how companies gather and process their data, especially those that handle sensitive and confidential data and I figured here, along with other subreddits such as <a href="/r/ollama">r/ollama</a> are a good place to start. Likewise, I&#39;m interested in determining whether or not it may be viable to operate local LLMs in cases such as this.</p> <p>It shouldn&#39;t take more than a few minutes to complete and any feedback is welcome, survey link here. <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/NAh19AF6tu">https://forms.office.com/e/NAh19AF6tu</a></p> <

On the other hand, it sucks to have to reboot for simple updates and writing over configs is something I end up doing constantly. I started with Mint simply bc it was on the machine I bought, and I hate having some packages from snap, some from synaptic, etc, much rather have everything from apt, I can&#39;t imagine the VanillaOS idea of running other repos/systems in containers simplifies that in a meaningful way.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AlexHurts"> /u/AlexHurts </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/

We have a bunch of computers – N&lt;100 – in the basement, all equipped with gaming GPUs. Depending on our projects, we get assigned a few of these PCs to run our experiments remotely, which means we have to transfer our data to each one for training AI models.</p> <p>The issue is, there’s often a lot of downtime on these PCs, but when deadlines loom, it’s all hands on deck, and some of us scramble to run multiple experiments at once, but others are not utilizing their assigned PCs at all. Because of this, the overall GPU utilization tends to be quite low. I had a thought: what if we set up a small slurm cluster? This way, we wouldn’t need to go through the hassle of manual assignments, and those of us with larger workloads could tap into more of the idle machines.</p> <p>However, there’s a bit of a challenge with handling the datasets, especially since some ar
