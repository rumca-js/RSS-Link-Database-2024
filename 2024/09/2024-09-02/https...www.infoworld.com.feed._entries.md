<p>The big news in the open source world last week was Elastic’s return to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3429076/what-is-open-source-software-open-source-and-foss-explained.html">open source</a>. As the Elastic founder and CTO Shay Banon <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-is-open-source-again">announced</a>, “We never stopped believing in open source at Elastic” and so Elastic “will be adding AGPL [GNU Affero General Public License] as another license option next to ELv2 [Elastic License 2.0] and SSPL [Server Side Public License] in the coming weeks.” I talked with Banon about it, and he was giddy with happiness over the license change/addition.</p>

<p>The world is a messy place. Buildings rise. Buildings fall. Roads wash out. Homeowners add cottages to properties. One location becomes home to two businesses. Roadside business stands spring up in the morning and disappear at night, but still need deliveries and maybe even electricity.</p>



<p>How to track it all? To date, the best mapping services do a passable job. In developed countries, addresses identify locations and allow us to route to them. But what happens inside each location is often lost as situations change. In less developed, rural, and remote areas, good luck knowing exactly what exists in any one place.</p>
