The COVID-19 pandemic not only gave us a global health crisis but also an infodemic, a term coined by the World Health Organization (WHO) to describe the overwhelming flood of information—both accurate and misleading—that inundated media channels. This information complicated the public understanding and response to the pandemic as people struggled to separate fact from fiction.

Particles in wildfire smoke can lower air quality and harm human health. Smoke aerosols can also influence weather and climate by modifying cloud formation and changing how much of the sun's energy is reflected or absorbed by the atmosphere. Compared to larger particles directly emitted from fires, the formation and presence of ultrafine particles (UFPs) have previously been overlooked, as it was thought that they were quickly "scavenged" by the larger particles.

In their study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the group analyzed rocks from the Ordovician period.

Nowadays, there's lots of buzz about spectacular new medical treatments, such as personalized cancer therapy with modified immune cells or antibodies. Such treatments, however, are very complex and expensive and so find only limited application. Most medical therapies are still based on small chemical compounds that can be produced in large quantities and thus at low cost.

Eukaryotic cells—that is, cells with a nucleus—possess an astounding ability to radically change their shape and their cytoskeleton, allowing them to migrate through tiny pores and constrictions even smaller than their nuclear diameter. Yet how exactly the cell nucleus changes shape as a response to the surrounding structures, and what physical mechanisms are behind this deformation, have remained unclear.

Securing the world's water supply is one of the greatest challenges of our time. Research at Stockholm University is now presenting an alternative method for quantifying the global risk of water scarcity. Results indicate higher risks to water supply than previously expected if accounting for the environmental conditions and governability where rain is produced.

Our sun drives a constant outward flow of plasma, or ionized gas, called the solar wind, which envelops our solar system. Outside of Earth's protective magnetosphere, the fastest solar wind rushes by at speeds of over 310 miles (500 kilometers) per second. But researchers haven't been able to figure out how the wind gets enough energy to achieve that speed—until now.

Even a single person in the snow can exert enough pressure on it to cause a buried weak layer of snow to collapse and the snow cover to slide away. In this case, experts speak of anticracks. The fundamental fracture properties that can lead to powerful slab avalanches are still largely unknown, but crucial in order to accurately predict when avalanches will occur.

## Origins of variability in X-ray photons from a symbiotic binary star as revealed by dimensionality reduction

Symbiotic binary stars are a type of binary star system that consists of a compact star (such as a white dwarf) and a red giant star. In these systems, a compact star accretes materials from a red giant star and produces soft X-ray photons. However, some of them—known as hard X-ray-emitting symbiotic stars—also produce powerful X-ray photons, which may be due to the presence of massive white dwarfs.

## Cells use alternative splicing to regulate gene expression, research suggests

 - date published: 2024-09-02T05:00:01+00:00

Alternative splicing is a genetic process where different segments of genes are removed, and the remaining pieces are joined together during transcription to messenger RNA (mRNA). This mechanism increases the diversity of proteins that can be generated from genes, by assembling sections of genetic code into different combinations. This is believed to enhance biological complexity by allowing genes to produce different versions of proteins, or protein isoforms, for many different uses.

The study found that Global South cities have just 70% of the "cooling capacity" provided by urban greenery in the Global North. The paper, published in the journal Nature Communications, is titled "Green infrastructure provides substantial but unequal urban cooling globally."
