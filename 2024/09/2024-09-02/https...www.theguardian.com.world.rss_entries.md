<p>Single-word Ofsted judgments for state schools scrapped and replaced by report cards aimed at improving standards</p><p>Good morning. The summer recess is over, parliament is back, the newish Labour government is still in its hyperactive ‘early days’ stage (although no one is using the word honeymoon any more) and Keir Starmer is celebrating his 62nd birthday by making a visit to publicise the government’s announcement about the abolition of single-word Ofsted verdicts for schools in England.</p><p>This is a policy proposed in Labour’s manifesto, and it has been warmly welcomed by teaching unions who have long complained that single-word judgments were too crude. Pressure for their removal intensified after Ruth Perry, a primary school head, killed herself after learning that her school was going to be downgraded from outstanding (the best of four grades) to inadequate (the worst), even though Ofsted said it was giving pupils a good education, because of safeguarding errors.</p><p>
