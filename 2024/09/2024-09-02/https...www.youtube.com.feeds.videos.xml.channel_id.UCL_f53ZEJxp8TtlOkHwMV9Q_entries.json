Peterson sits down with the leader of the Conservative party of British Columbia, John Rustad. They discuss the natural resources of the province, the necessity of cheap energy to ensure prosperity, the biggest threats facing both Canada and the U.S. at large, and what it takes to be a politician who inspires confidence and earns trust.\n\nJohn Rustad is the Conservative MLA for Nechako Lakes - a riding he has held since 2005. John was born and raised in Prince George, married Kim in 1995, and has spent his entire life living in northern British Columbia. In the early 2000s, John was faced with a difficult task. Frustrated with the direction the province was headed, John had to decide between leaving for greener pastures or sticking around. Thankfully, he decided to stick around and, in so doing, decided to fight for BC. For more than 20 years, John has fought for the people of British Columbia.
