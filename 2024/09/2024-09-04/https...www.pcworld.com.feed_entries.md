<p>Discord started off as just a chatroom with voice chat features, but it has since grown into the de facto communication and community building tool for gamers, games, and organizations. The company has made plenty of missteps since Discord first debuted almost a decade ago, with some more egregious than others.</p>



<p>Here’s one recent change that some gamers may find unpleasant: your list of Discord contacts will no longer just show what games your friends are playing but also how long they’ve been playing each game and how often they’ve played in the last 30 days.</p>

<p>As laptops get more compact, some sacrifices have to be made — like the loss of precious USB ports along the sides. But that’s okay if you have something like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Splitter-Laptop-Extender-Windows/dp/B0CN3F9Y1Z/">this Acer USB hub that’s on sale for just $10 on Amazon</a>. At 60% off its usual $25 price tag, it’s a no-brainer purchase.</p>



<p>Whether you need extra USB ports for your home office workstation or you just want to make sure you’re covered while on the go, this USB hub fits anywhere and is easy to carry with its slim build.</p>



<p>This accessory features four USB-A 3.0 ports, allowing you to plug in various peripherals like mice, keyboards, flash drives, etc. When you have a device plugged in that requires power, you’ll want to plug the hub into a wall charger using the USB-C power port. (Not for data t

<p>Today at IFA in Berlin, Asus showed off the most recent iterations of their Vivobook and Zenbook line of laptops, now powered by the latest Lunar Lake architecture CPUs. These new CPUs supposedly deliver up to 47 NPU TOPS (tera operations per second), which help boost the speed of AI-based features. Asus’ new Zenbook also has a Ceraluminum lid, a fusion of aluminum and ceramic. Not only is this material gorgeous looking but in terms of durability, it’s a step up from the usual plastic or metal fare. While the redesigns are certainly attractive, the real star of the show is Intel’s Lunar Lake CPU. Let’s get into it.</p>

<p>A lot of time is spent looking at the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3219792/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">best paid antivirus suites</a>, but free antivirus solutions are worth discussion, too. After all, free versions are based on their paid counterparts.</p>



<p>Good news is, when you see a free alternative to a paid version you like, you can safely assume the antivirus protection level is similar—save for any specific malware types the free version doesn’t cover.</p>



<p>To create this list of the top free antivirus programs, we looked at the top mainstream antivirus suites for Windows and selected the ones that offer a free version, as not all of them do. Then we looked at how well these suites performed in third-party detection tests. We also made sure they weren’t resource hogs, because software that slows down your PC is a pain

<p>If you’ve been waiting for the best possible deal on an ultrawide OLED gaming monitor, you’ve found it. Woot has <a href="https://computers.woot.com/offers/msi-mag-341cqp-qd-oled-monitor">a 34-inch MSI ultrawide OLED monitor on sale for just $500</a> for the next three days (or until stock runs out, and trust me, it’s going to run out).</p>



<p>The only downside to this incredible sale is that this is a “factory reconditioned” (read: refurbished) monitor, so it only comes with a 180-day warranty instead of the usual year-long one.</p>



<p>The MSI MAG 341CQP sports a semi-standard 3440×1440 resolution, which is basically the same as a 27-inch 1440p panel except widened out to a 21:9 ratio. (All the better to spot campers in your peripheral vision.) And with its gentle 1800R curve, impressive 175Hz refresh rate, and lightning-fast 0.03ms response time, i

<p>Gaming laptops used to be a bit of a punchline, but we’re long past the point where desktop elites can scoff at them. So, why not go all-in and make one that has a full controller built right into the body?</p>



<p>That seems to be the thinking behind Acer’s Project DualPlay design. As PCWorld’s Mark Hachman said on the IFA 2024 show floor, it’s giving off <em>Transformers’</em> Soundwave vibes.</p>



<p>The Acer DualPlay is a chunky gaming laptop when closed and keeps that look when opened, plus it has a huge amount of RGB bling. You can play it in its normal configuration just like any gaming laptop (or, I dunno, just edit some spreadsheets like some kind of crazy person).</p>



<p>But when you’re ready to get your <em>Elden Ring</em> on, you can simply press the release button to pop the touchpad out, which then becomes a full-powered (if somewhat s

<p>What does seven grand get you in a novelty pre-built desktop? Less than you might think. <a href="https://www.coolermaster.com/en-us/products/shark-x/">According to the promotional page</a>, the single configuration includes an Intel Core i7-14700F processor, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti graphics card, 64GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 2TB Gen4 SSD. Those are great specs for a gaming PC, but nothing you couldn’t knock together yourself on a $1,500 budget or so.</p>

You no longer have to laboriously print out documents, sign them by hand, and scan them again for forwarding. Everything is done with just a few clicks or swipe gestures. </p>



<p>But some third-party programs will charge you extra to digitally sign documents, which is super annoying. We’ll show you how to sign digital documents on your PC or smartphone free of charge.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/XenoPanther/status/1829591003608891626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A user on X/Twitter</a> discovered evidence of a feature called “Intelligent Media Search” in Windows 11 Canary Build 27695 that scans all media files on the system (including text, image, audio, and video) and retrieves them on request.</p>



<p>It isn’t yet clear whether this is an independent feature or an extension of Recall itself, but the Windows community is unlikely to approve either way. Even if the feature is supposed to make everyday life and work easier, there are valid concerns about security, privacy, and performance.</p>

<p>At IFA in Germany, every laptop maker is strutting their stuff on the conference floor. It’s hard for any one of them to stand out, since most are just refreshed designs with a few internal upgrades.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="asus-proart-pz13">Asus ProArt PZ13 </h2>



<p>The ProArt PZ13 looks like Asus trying on the Microsoft Surface form factor — the tablet version, not the various other models.</p>



<p>But this one is marrying some of the best traits of mobile and laptop hardware together. For example, though it’s running on a Snapdragon X Plus processor, it sports a 13.3-inch OLED display with 2880×1800 resolution, something you’d expect to see on a premium laptop.</p>
