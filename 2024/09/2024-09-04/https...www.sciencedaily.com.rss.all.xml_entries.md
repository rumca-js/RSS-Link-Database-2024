In creating a pair of new robots, researchers cultivated an unlikely component, one found on the forest floor: fungal mycelia. By harnessing mycelia's innate electrical signals, the researchers discovered a new way of controlling 'biohybrid' robots that can potentially react to their environment better than their purely synthetic counterparts.

It's 7 billion years ago, and the universe's heyday of star formation is beginning to slow. What might our Milky Way galaxy have looked like at that time? Astronomers have found clues in the form of a cosmic question mark, the result of a rare alignment across light-years of space.

## Agriculture accelerated human genome evolution to capture energy from starchy foods

Scientists have suspected that modern humans have more genes to digest starch than our hunter-gatherer ancestors, but the amylase locus of the genome is hard to study. Researchers have now developed new methods to isolate the multiple amylase genes and compare the locus to ancient genomes. They found that amylase gene number has increased from an average of eight to more than 11 over the past 12,000 years.

## Researchers identify mechanism underlying allergic itching, and show it can be blocked

Researchers identified a mechanism for why some people will itch from an allergen or mosquito bite exposure, while others will not in a new study, and showed this pathway can be targeted to prevent allergic responses in preclinical models.

## At-risk butterflies more likely to survive with human help

Some of the butterflies most in danger of fluttering out of existence fare better when their habitats are actively managed by humans, a recent study found. Scientists have long warned that insect populations worldwide are falling rapidly due to the combined effects of climate change, habitat loss and pesticides. The study analyzed data on 114 populations of 31 butterfly species in 10 U.S. states. Overall, the research team found that these at-risk butterflies are particularly vulnerable, with populations declining at an estimated rate of 8% a year, which translates to about a 50% drop over a decade. However, the study findings offer hope that habitat management can slow or even potentially reverse those sharp declines.

## Prescribing nature can improve happiness and reduce anxiety

Green Social Prescribing is the practice of supporting people with mental health needs to engage in nature-based activities. Referrals will typically come from GPs, community mental health teams, or social workers, but people can also self-refer. Social Prescribing Link Workers, and other trusted professionals, then connect people to community groups and agencies for practical and emotional support. There are many different types of nature-based activities and therapies, including conservation, horticulture and gardening, care farming, exercise and sports, or talking therapies in the outdoors.

## 'Forever chemicals' influence the development and function of the brain

Some per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are poorly degradable and are also known as 'forever chemicals'. They adversely affect health and can lead to liver damage, obesity, hormonal disorders, and cancer. A research team has investigated the effects of PFAS on the brain. Using a combination of modern molecular biology methods and the zebrafish model, the researchers revealed the mechanism of action and identified the genes involved.

## Epigenetic changes reprogram astrocytes into brain stem cells

Resting brain stem cells hardly differ from normal astrocytes, which support the nerve cells in the brain. How can almost identical cells perform such different functions? The key lies in the methylation of their genetic material, which endowes these special astrocytes with stem cell properties. In mice, the researchers showed that experimentally induced lack of blood supply in the brain epigenetically reprograms astrocytes into brain stem cells, which in turn can give rise to nerve progenitor cells. This discovery shows that astrocytes could potentially be used in regenerative medicine to replace damaged nerve cells.
