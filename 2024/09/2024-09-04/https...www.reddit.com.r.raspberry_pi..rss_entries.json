Although I felt like character from the 1995 hit movie Hackers I was self aware enough to realise that all I had done was successfully followed a recipe and had no idea what I had actually done.</p> <p>Well it broke this week.</p> <p>After several restarts I figured &quot;just set it all up again&quot; but as I had no idea what I had done the first time I went searching for instructions.</p> <p>I ended up on Github and found out that this is a recent problem affecting everyone that uses it. It seams to have something to do with librespot, or spotify changing something that has caused librespot to stop working and other apps/software/services/protocols (im really not sure of the word) that rely on it or them. Some people suggest a fix and then say it&#39;s not working and then that it isn&#39;t for raspotify at all but one of these other... apps?", "id": 1084232, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1f94wlo/raspotify_broke_can_someone_explain_the_fix_or", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "source_obj__id": 470, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Raspotify broke, can someone explain the fix or even the problem like I'm 10 years old and is there an alternative?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-04T18:35:07+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The goal I have for the PI is to have Samba installed to where anyone at home can scan from the scanner to the shared folder and then pull it up on the computers at home.

Currently I cannot get Kodi to start as windowed mode on my raspi 5, it forces itself to desktop when i change the guisettings.xml . So I cant even manage the window with something like wmctrl, the kodi window doesnt appear with `wmctrl -l`</p> <p>I plan to use my raspi as a flexi-media player, I need to resize, reposition the video player along with a background image. I have to use Kodi since it&#39;s the media player that performs the best. VLC can&#39;t seem to play 4k60fps above 30fps even with HW decode while Kodi does it with no problem.</p> <p>Would appreciate any input or help</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/krespek\"> /u/krespek </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/commen", "id": 1080607, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1f8p82f/manipulating_kodi_window_on_raspi_5", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/.rss", "source_obj__id": 470, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Manipulating Kodi window on raspi 5", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-04T08:20:06+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys, iam programming an RC car from scratch rn. i know that it would be possible without any chips but i wanna code it. I bought a Radiomaster ER4, thats an ELRS receiver (radio controll protocol) with 4 PWM outputs. I wanna push that outputs into my raspi and work with this input in python. But i read thats not possible to read PWM input, so my Idea was to buy an PWM-analog converter to but an analog input into the raspi. Which converter can i buy and how should the analog input into raspi looks like?
