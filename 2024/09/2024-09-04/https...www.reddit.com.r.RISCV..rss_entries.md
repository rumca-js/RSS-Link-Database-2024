<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://github.com/dsheffie/rv64core">https://github.com/dsheffie/rv64core</a></p> <p>The directions are sparse right now. I will provide more details of how to get Linux built, etc on the github page at a later date. I also have an embarrassingly bad AXI wrapper for the design to work on an Ultra96v2 (100 mhz, uses basically all the resources). </p> <p>I&#39;ve worked in computer architecture (architecture - e.g. isa, simulators, compilers and workloads) and realized I&#39;d never built an functional OOO machine that can boot Linux on my own. </p> <p>No RVC support - I was paid by Intel for years to work on x86 and never want to touch anything variable length again (I have braincells dedicated to ModR/M and SIB). </p> <p>FPU isn&#39;t particularly interesting to me either. I&#39;m unlikely to build the whole thing myself and I don&#39;t see the point of just integrating soft-float (what would I learn?).</p> <p>I had fun putting this thing to

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>New RISC-V board on the way: <a href="https://milkv.io/megrez">https://milkv.io/megrez</a></p> <p>The real question is will it be availabe to buy before the <a href="https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-premier-p550">SiFive HiFive Premier P550</a> (SoC Eswin EIC7700) ?</p> <p><a href="https://www.eswincomputing.com/en/products/index/36.html">EIC7700</a> : 4-Core SiFive P550(RISC-V RV64GC)@1.4GHz 13.3 Tops</p> <p>EIC7700X: 4-Core SiFive P550(RISC-V RV64GC)@1.6GHz 19.95 Tops</p> <p>And then second question, that comes to mind, would be can either or both boards (before or after purchase) have their SoC upgraded to an EIC7702 or a EIC7702X which have 8 cores. To me it looks like the module can be upgraded on both boards, but theses days I never take anything for granted.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/m_z_s"> /u/m_z_s </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1f92rv8/milkv_me

## Hi everyone, I'm running my assembly language on spike simulator for the Isa rv64i . But it got stuck here. Any reason behind that?
