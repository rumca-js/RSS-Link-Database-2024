Mostly they are games that have a specific timer of a certain number of rounds before the game ends. A couple examples are Septima, Arnak, and River of Gold. These are 3 of our favorites, but Septima lasts the 4 seasons and each season has 5 rounds that seem to just go by too quickly. Arnak also has specific rounds, though it is nice that we can take as many turns as we can each round. River of Gold ends when the building stack empties.</p> <p>We&#39;ve debated ways to increase the length of the game. So far with River of Gold we ignore the rule that you remove a building tile when you pass the end of the river. We&#39;ve debated moving the staff back again for Arnak, literally doubling the number of rounds, likewise for Septima we&#39;ve debated playing for the equivalent of 4 seasons, again doubling the number of rounds.</p> <p>Are there any games you

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I rarely pre-order games, but I&#39;m excited about <em>Beyond the Horizon</em> due to the strength of <em>Beyond the Sun</em> and the designers, especially Fabio Lopiano, plus the free promo pack. My concerns are that the soldier/settler tokens seem small and fiddly, and the game is a table hog with similar-looking icons that will be hard for me to read. The theme also feels somewhat weak—there’s no artwork for techs, and the map tiles all have the same artwork (e.g., &quot;museum&quot; and &quot;skyscraper&quot; have identical art). Additionally, the historical characters and techs offer only offer minor variations on the same few actions, which feels oddly abstract for a civ game, which usually leverages the theme through &quot;Einstein gives you science&quot; type stuff. Despite these nitpicks, the tweaks to the gameplay and Klemenz Franz’s cosy art look promising.</p> <p>Has anyone else pre-ordered? Thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I typically think of party games as upbeat while many s.d. games can be tense.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A little while ago I remember playing this game with a friend from France. It was like a road trip planning game (similar to ticket to ride) where you tried to chart the best route across a map of France while hitting all the required countries (which were on cards that you drew at the beginning) I think it was likely a France exclusive or something and all the cards were in French. I believe it was called something along the lines of &quot;Tour of France&quot; It might have been a vintage. Searches have produced no matches, so I am turning here for hopes of finding it. I don&#39;t necessarily need to buy it, but it would be nice to at least satisfy my curiosity. If more details are needed I have a pretty good memory of it and am happy to provide. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IceCuber5000"> /u/IceCuber5000 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1f8f9bm/fr
