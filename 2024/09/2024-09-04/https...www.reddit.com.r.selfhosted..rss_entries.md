<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been recently interested in Self Hosting. I’m relatively familiar with docker, basic commands and such.</p> <p>My intention is to host Adguard + Wireguard and then get started with a Media Server.</p> <p>Upon a lot of research, although it would be ideal to have a Raspberry Pi or a mini PC. I wanna get started a cheap VPS (vultr? buyVM? Linode? OCI?) and then eventually get a home server per se if I like what I’m doing in a few months.</p> <p>Is this a good/ workable plan? Would there be any latency issues with updating my router DNS server this the Adguard’s on the VPS? Or any other security considerations ?</p> <p>Also, in terms of the steps/plans, does this sound good ?</p> <p>I get a cheap VPS Install/setups proxmox/other Linux distro Install these apps using the guide for proxmox or using docker? Access with the IP address?</p> <p>Would really appreciate any inputs . Would be great if there’s any wiki starter guide for this on this sub.. </p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I finally got a chance to try out Coolify last week and from my initial impressions -- it&#39;s pretty great! Very impressive!</p> <p>After my initial experimentation I decided to get it set up through NPM and start putting it through its paces with some more small apps. Problem is (was) the dashboard, once I got it set up via NPM, the websocket support that&#39;s usually a toggled switch away did nothing. So down the rabbit hole I went.</p> <p>After some digging, and surfacing <a href="https://docs.soketi.app/getting-started/backend-configuration/nginx-configuration">this documentation</a> on the soketi website (which is what Coolify uses for websockets, I guess?), I managed to get things to work with a &quot;Custom Location&quot; in NPM.</p> <p>Step 1:</p> <p>Turn off &quot;Websockets support&quot; in &quot;Details&quot; screen</p> <p>Step 2:</p> <p>Under &quot;Custom locations&quot;:</p> <pre><code>Define Location: /app Scheme: http Forward Hostnam

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This post is more of a rant but I cant help but feel frustrated over the existing state of the email industry.<br/> Is anyone else frustrated with the fact that it&#39;s considered laughable when someone wants to self host their own ESP / smtp server? I believe anyone should be able to do this. I understand the importance of preventing spam but it&#39;s unreal how difficult it is to find hosting providers that even allow port 25 to be open. Let alone the fact that most email providers act as if they are part of some email mafia along with the spam list companies who try to extort users for paying to remove their name from blacklists etc.. </p> <p>We&#39;re basically forced to pay a reputable ESP/SMTP service indefinitely, who all have increasing email costs just because they have strong IP reputation. The alternative is to attempt to create a self hosted smpt service, while being mocked/told repeatedly that we should not create our own (even within th
