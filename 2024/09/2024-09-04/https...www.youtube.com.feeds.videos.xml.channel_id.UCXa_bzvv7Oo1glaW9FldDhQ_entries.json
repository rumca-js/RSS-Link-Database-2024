Even as someone who never played the original Space Marine, my personal excitement levels for its sequel were high, given how promising it looked with each showing, as well how strongly it was taking cues from Gears of War, a series I cannot get enough of. \n\nAnd happily enough, Space Marine 2 is good enough to not only match those expectations, but easily surpass them. It is, in fact, legitimately one of the best action games to have come out in recent memory. \n\nWith adrenaline-fueled combat, breathtaking scale, unforgettable encounters again hordes of massive sizes, and impressive technical achievements, Space Marine 2 is easily one of 2024\u2019s standout games.", "id": 1081692, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kgw9rDt2SU", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/3Kgw9rDt2SU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Review - ONE OF THE BEST ACTION GAMES IN RECENT YEARS", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-04T15:00:12+00:00", "description": "In the state that it exists right now, however,\u00a0Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown\u00a0is still a good game, if not necessarily a great game.

While many assumed that Firewalk Studios would carry out its planned roadmap, it's been announced that the competitive shooter will go offline from September 6th.\n\nNot only will it be pulled from sale, but PS5 and PC players will receive refunds. The fact that this decision occurred roughly two weeks after its launch is unprecedented, especially for a live-service title from a major publisher like Sony.\n\nWhile there's a possibility that it returns, as Firewalk explores further options, this may also be the last we see of the shooter for a long time.
