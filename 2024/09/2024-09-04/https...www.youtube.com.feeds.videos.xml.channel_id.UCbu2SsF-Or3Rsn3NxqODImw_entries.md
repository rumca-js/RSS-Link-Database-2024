In this gameplay, Princess Zelda escapes from a dungeon and uses her Tri Rod to make Echoes and battle everything from Moblins and Strandtula's to a Talus and Dark Link. Echoes of Wisdom involves a lot of puzzle-solving by copying both monsters and everyday objects and then using them creatively in a physics-based environment.

Princess Zelda takes a starring role for the first time in the franchise that bears her name, with a suite of ingenious and creative powers to play with.
