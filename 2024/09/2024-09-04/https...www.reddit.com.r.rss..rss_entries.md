<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m looking to possibly pay for rss.app... the instagram to rss and linkedin to rss functionality sounds great. However, after doing a search of this subreddit, it seems that any kind of support from the service is non existent. Is that true? How reliable are the IG feeds also? It seems like IG is constantly trying to prevent against RSS feeds so it&#39;s probably a cumbersome task to try to stay ahead of them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chilloutfam"> /u/chilloutfam </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1f8yzv1/is_rssapp_reliable/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1f8yzv1/is_rssapp_reliable/">[comments]</a></span>
