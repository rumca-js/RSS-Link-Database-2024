<p>Angular 19, a planned update to the popular TypeScript-based web framework, is set to make <code>standalone: true</code> the default for components, directives, and pipes. This change, announced in an <a href="https://blog.angular.dev/the-future-is-standalone-475d7edbc706">Angular blog post on September 3</a>, eclipses the use of NgModules. With the new default, developers no longer need to type the <code>standalone: true</code> flag.</p>



<p>The announcement notes that a developer preview of the standalone feature was introduced with <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335637/angular-14-arrives-with-typed-forms-standalone-components.html">Angular 14</a> in June 2022. This made it poss

<p>InfluxData is releasing an updated version of the databases it markets under the name InfluxDB 3.0, it said Wednesday.</p>



<p>The updates to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2338315/how-influxdb-revved-up-for-real-time-analytics.html">InfluxDB</a> 3.0 are aimed at easing development of applications based on time-series data, and include improved Ingest performance, real-time querying, and superior data compression through native object storage to power high-cardinality.</p>



<p>The new features are now generally available, and will support <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2262688/observability-what-it-should-know-as-the-technology-heats-up.html">observability</a>, <a hre

<p>For years now, PostgreSQL has been one of the best-kept secrets of enterprise software and open source alike—a powerful, robust, expertly maintained relational database. MySQL may be better known, but PostgreSQL offers many features MySQL has only started to provide.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll walk through the steps to set up and get running a basic PostgreSQL installation. Most of this discussion is aimed at folks who are starting from scratch, but I’ll also discuss how to migrate data from a previous PostgreSQL installation or another database solution. This article focuses on the PostgreSQL 16 family of releases, the most recent and current revision of PostgreSQL as of this writing.</p>

<p>Qt Group is moving forward with Qt/.NET, a proposed toolkit for interoperability between <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335793/the-state-of-the-c-plus-plus-developer-ecosystem.html">C++</a> and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3488746/microsoft-net-9-previews-c-runtime-sdk-improvements.html">Microsoft’s .NET software development platform</a>.</p>



<p>The toolkit includes a Qt-based <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/netcore-hosting">custom native host</a> for managing assemblies, along with a native-to-managed adapter module providing interoperability services such as instance method invocation, event notification, and object-lifecycle manag

<p>It’s no surprise that evolving the vast protocol infrastructure that underlies the internet is an epic proposition. The next major version of HTTP is built on the QUIC protocol and promises better performance and more security. Here’s what web application developers need to know.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-promise-and-perils-of-http-3">The promise and perils of HTTP/3</h2>



<p>HTTP/3 aspires to make the internet safer, faster, and simpler for everyone. If these goals sound familiar, it’s because they’re the same ones that HTTP/2 started with. That’s an interesting tale, but the bottom line is that HTTP/3 takes another pass at addressing long-standing shortcomings in both TCP a

<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy not so far away, a deceptively simple idea started to take hold within the development community: Software, given its immense potential as an engine of change, should be made free and open to everyone. Unsurprisingly, this idea—most commonly associated today with the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3429076/what-is-open-source-software-open-source-and-foss-explained.html">open source software</a> movement—was initially met with fierce resistance from the business community. </p>



<p>However, over the past 40-odd years, the open source software movement has come quite a long way. What was once famously referred to as “a cancer” by then-Microsoft CEO Steve
