Developer Saber have pulled on all the right in-universe levers to provide Warhammer 40k fans with a highly addictive game with a really solid story at its heart for those wanting more than just raw violence in power armour. In Space Marine 2 Titus must rejoin his Ultramarine brothers after a century in the Deathwatch to support the Cadians in defence of Kadaku from the Tyranid hive fleet invasion. His black shield status is hidden. He no longer trusts his brothers. He&#8217;s been demoted in rank. And he&#8217;s taking over another sergeant\u2019s squad.

As people&#8217;s lives fall apart, a new terrible foe appears from beyond the Fire Isles, sweeping in and slaughtering villages while taking a few valuable people and leaving red and burned ruin in their wake. As the kingdom scrambles amongst internal fighting and uncertainty to front a defence to the onslaught, a group of misfits attempt to solve the mysteries of the past to empower the Sister Queens&#8217; future. Ruhlin is a boy watching his village be slain by marauders. Confronted by death, something changes in him, making him a fearsome killer \u2026 and then immediately a slave. Thera is a Vellihir, a justice who travels the realm to do everything from settle feuds to nominate people to inherit titles.
