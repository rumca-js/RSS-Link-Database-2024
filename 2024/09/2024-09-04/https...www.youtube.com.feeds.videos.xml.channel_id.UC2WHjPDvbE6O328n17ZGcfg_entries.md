Let's talk about how to avoid destroying developer productivity. So programmers, send this video to your manager or boss that keeps interrupting you while coding. I'm not responsible for any retaliation put upon you by whomever you send this to... may luck be on your side. And if you have control over your own time, take these tips and pointers and apply them to your coding workflow, see what works and what doesn't, and adjust accordingly to how you work. Hope it helps!
