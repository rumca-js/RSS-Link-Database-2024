Next time you pick up a package of coffee or a pack of toilet paper, take a closer look. You might notice the package looks familiar, but what is inside has subtly diminished. This is "shrinkflation" in action, a pricing strategy used by manufacturers worldwide. By reducing product size instead of increasing final prices, companies take advantage of the psychology of shoppers who are more likely to notice a price hike than a slight reduction in size.

LHC Run 3 began in 2022, with the recommissioning of the LHC at 6.8 TeV, resulting in the delivery of 39.7 fb⁻¹ of integrated luminosity, surpassing initial expectations. Luminosity is an important indicator of the performance of a collider: it is proportional to the number of collisions that occur in a given amount of time. The higher the luminosity, the more data the experiments can gather to allow them to observe rare processes.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often described as forever chemicals, can tag along into groundwater that's later removed for drinking. Researchers analyzed water from over 100 wells in Denmark for one particularly persistent PFAS: trifluoroacetate.

Chromatin is a structure in the cell nucleus that helps pack DNA tightly by wrapping it around proteins called histones. These DNA-protein units, called nucleosomes, control how genes are turned on or off by allowing or blocking DNA access to factors that regulate gene activity. Large protein complexes called chromatin remodelers help move nucleosomes to make DNA accessible to these factors.
