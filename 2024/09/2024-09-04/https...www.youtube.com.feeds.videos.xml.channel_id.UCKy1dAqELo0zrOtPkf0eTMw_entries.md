Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 reviewed by Chris Reed on Xbox Series X, also available on PlayStation 5 and PC.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a terrific third-person shooter with a compelling story, loads of weapons that are a blast to use, and a healthy variety of enemies to use them on. It once again borrows many of its ideas from the Gears of War series, but they’re good ideas, and Space Marine 2 does a fine job of making them its own. And while the Operations PvE mode that accompanies it doesn’t currently offer enough to keep me coming back, the deep customization options for your Space Marine do look promising if it’s supported in post-launch updates as planned. Besides, when you’re eviscerating aliens on planets as pretty as these, it’s hard not to leave satisfied.

The Casting of Frank Stone reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.

"The Casting of Frank Stone’s repetitive, time-hopping horror tale is packed with dozens of character choices to consider, but really the most important decision that Dead by Daylight fans need to make is whether or not a sub-standard, six-hour story is worth sitting through purely to spot the odd recognisable weapon or slight reference to the source material’s lore. I would argue it’s not, since no single stretch of this sluggish and forgettable horror show ever comes close to matching the frantic amounts of fun to be had in a single, 15-minute Dead by Daylight trial. Unable to match the intensity of its murderous multiplayer inspiration and lagging well behind Until Dawn and The Quarry as a standalone story, The Casting of Frank Stone is a second-rate interactive slasher that just can’t hack it."
