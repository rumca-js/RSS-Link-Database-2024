For more than a decade, University of Kansas researchers have shown that giving students, especially those with disabilities, ownership of their education improves their outcomes. The Kansas University Center on Developmental Disabilities' team recently concluded a project to implement the Self Determined Learning Model of Instruction (SDLMI) in 15 schools in Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania. They have published multiple studies, including an overall analysis that suggested when the SDLMI program is installed with robust teacher supports, it not only helps the educators but has better outcomes for all students.

Imagine how a phone call works: Your voice is converted into electronic signals, shifted up to higher frequencies, transmitted over long distances, and then shifted back down so it can be heard clearly on the other end. The process enabling this shifting of signal frequencies is called frequency mixing, and it is essential for communication technologies like radio and Wi-Fi. Frequency mixers are vital components in many electronic devices and typically operate using frequencies that oscillate billions (GHz, gigahertz) to trillions (THz, terahertz) of times per second.

Once it has a strong enough gravitational pull, other material collapses around it to form the atmosphere.
