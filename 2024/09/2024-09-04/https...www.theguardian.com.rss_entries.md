And yet someone already had, which is part of what makes the story so astonishing.

In 2019, Zelenskiy began serving as president in real life; barely three years after that, he found himself president in a time of war, when Vladimir Putin did what he had long wanted to do and invaded the country.</p><p>The Zelensky Story, directed by Michael Waldman, is told in three hour-long parts filmed over several trips to Ukraine. It comprises interviews with Zelenskiy, his wife, Olena, and friends and colleagues, mi

<p>Netflix’s archival documentary relives the near-fatal explosion of 1970 with remarkable and urgent footage</p><p>On paper, the survival of three astronauts aboard Apollo 13, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa">Nasa</a> spacecraft bound for the moon and imperiled by a near-fatal explosion in April 1970, is nothing short of astounding. The explosion, over two days and 210,000 miles into the mission, nearly drained the three-part spacecraft of oxygen and electrical power. The three astronauts – Fred Haise, Jack Swigert and mission commander Jim Lovell – were forced to spend four harrowing, near-suffocating days in a lunar module meant for just two people and 45 hours, with just a few light bulbs’ worth of power. The unprecedented and untested maneuvers to get them home – transferring flight data by hand to the “life boat” module, catapulting off the moon’s orbit, manually aiming an unpredictable rocket blast at the earth – were each dicey and high-risk, requiring exac

How often have we heard that from a politician in parliament? I’ve almost lost count. In the recent past, we’ve had Hillsborough, Post Office Horizon and the Infected Blood Scandal.

You’ve got to hope. Hope that maybe this time something will change. That the fine words will be backed up by finer deeds.

The brothers, Zdravko and Slaven Marić, told me about a sports tournament they organised for kids from countries that were once part of Yugoslavia. What, really? Kids from Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, all coming together in Split to play and compete together? Apparently so. And Norton came into it because in Croatia he’s a big star. Everyone loves his show, subtitles and all. So they wanted him to come to Split to be a guest of honour at their Youth Sports Games.</p><p>At short notice I was unable to make their wish come true, but the

It is a romance in a New Wave style, with the British-French film-maker Jethro Massey making his feature debut as writer-director in the Venice critics’ week section. The Paul and Paulette of the title hang out in Paris, have sex and conversations in a way that perhaps conjures sense-memories of Jacques Rivette. Paul, played by Jérémie Galiana, is a young American in Paris, yearning to be a photographer, but forced to take a dull job in a real estate office; here he finds himself having an affair with his demanding female boss, nicknamed “Goebbels”, one of the film’s many baffling and tonally calamitous Nazi gags.</p><p>In the Place de la Concorde, formerly the Place de la Révolution,

## Physicist MV Ramana on why nuclear power is not the solution to world’s energy needs

<p>In his new book, the professor says nuclear is costly, risky and takes too long to scale up. Can he win over converts?</p><p>You’d be forgiven for thinking that the debate on nuclear power is pretty much settled. Sure, there are still some naysayers, but most reasonable people have come to realise that in an age of climate crisis, we need low-carbon nuclear energy – alongside wind and solar power – to help us transition away from fossil fuels. In 2016, <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-the-worlds-nuclear-power-plants/">400 reactors</a> were operating across 31 countries, with one estimate suggesting roughly the same number in operation in mid-2023, accounting for <a href="https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/IMG/pdf/wnisr2023-v5.pdf">9.2% of global commercial gross electricity generation</a>. But what if this optimism were in fact wrong, and nuclear power can never live up to its promise? That is the argument MV Ramana, a physicist, makes in his new book. He says nuclear is

<p>The Venice premiere of Almodóvar’s The Room Next Door received 17 minutes of applause – has touting the length of clapping has become just another PR tool?</p><p>For any film lovers who aren’t currently at the Venice film festival and want to play along at home, here’s something to try. Pop in a DVD of your favourite Pedro Almodóvar film – or your least favourite, or one you think is merely OK, since it makes little difference for this exercise. Watch the film through and, as the closing credits begin to roll, set the stopwatch on your phone, rise to your feet and start clapping. Keep clapping until your hands are sore, your feet are sore, or you simply get bored – whichever comes first. Pause the stopwatch and see how long you made it. A minute? Two if you were really stretching yourself?</p><p>If so, I’m afraid to say you’re not quite festival-ready.

<p>The faultlessly directed spy thriller is back with an even more stellar cast – and its lead actor’s role evolving into something that is occasionally quietly beautiful</p><p>Slough House, the building the ragtag spies in Slow Horses work out of, is not a peaceful place.

Discerning viewers, pleased by their own superb taste, revel in a series that is led by the sheer quality of Gary Oldman and Kristin Scott Thomas, and which evokes classic spy thrillers – intelligence work is a grand battle of wits, played by capable oddballs who are more concerned with winning the game than they are with real-world consequences – while updating the spies’ badinage so they s
