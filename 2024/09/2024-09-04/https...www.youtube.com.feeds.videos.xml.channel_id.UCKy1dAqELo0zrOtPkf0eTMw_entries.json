Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.\n\n\"The Casting of Frank Stone\u2019s repetitive, time-hopping horror tale is packed with dozens of character choices to consider, but really the most important decision that Dead by Daylight fans need to make is whether or not a sub-standard, six-hour story is worth sitting through purely to spot the odd recognisable weapon or slight reference to the source material\u2019s lore. I would argue it\u2019s not, since no single stretch of this sluggish and forgettable horror show ever comes close to matching the frantic amounts of fun to be had in a single, 15-minute Dead by Daylight trial. Unable to match the intensity of its murderous multiplayer inspiration and lagging well behind Until Dawn and The Quarry as a standalone story, The Casting of Frank Stone is a second-rate interactive slasher that just can\u2019t hack it.\"", "id": 1077904, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw7pqWG0pNk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Zw7pqWG0pNk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Casting of Frank Stone Video Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-04T01:43:53+00:00", "description": null, "id": 1077905, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYu4ALYyX1g", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 26, "page_rating_contents": 82, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ZYu4ALYyX1g/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Wake up samurai, we have a board game to play. #cyberpunk #boardgame #cyberpunk2077 #boardgames", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-04T01:09:31+00:00", "description": null, "id": 1077906, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnNUy4lplwY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 26, "page_rating_contents": 82, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/EnNUy4lplwY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dragon Age: The Veilguard is giving us a strong God of War meets Mass Effect vibe! #dragonage #ign", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-09-04T01:00:26+00:00", "description": "After you get through the tutorial missions of Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, the game dumps you into a full match against many of the Wizarding World's most famous faces.
