  <p id="yvduIG">X has won an appeal to block parts of California’s content moderation law, which requires social platforms to publicly post policies against hate speech and misinformation, as well as submit semiannual reports on their enforcement efforts.

  <p id="GU7NnP">Zillow is upgrading its AI search feature with the ability to find homes or rentals based on how far away they are from your office, school, or other points of interest. Instead of narrowing your search by selecting specific locations or filters, you can now simply enter, “Homes 30 min drive from Millennium Park.”</p>
<p id="arlfEZ">This will be very handy for people like me. I’m always searching for dream homes in spots that I’m not familiar with. Now, I’ll be able to search for “homes near Disney World” rather than casting a huge net over the entirety of Orlando.</p>

  <p id="uvaXTC">Snapchat will soon start “experimenting” with placing sponsored messages next to chat threads from friends, according to CEO Evan Spiegel.</p>
<p id="mJ2wF9">These “Sponsored Snaps” from brands will appear as unread messages in Snapchat’s main Chat tab, implying that they’ll sit above messages from a person’s contacts until they’re acted on. This is the first time Snap will show ads in the most used part of its app.</p>
