								<p>By the grace of the Emperor, after 13 years of faithful waiting, <strong>Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2</strong> is finally here - and I can kick off our Space Marine 2 review by reassuring you on at least one point: it <em>feels</em> fantastic. From the first bolt pistol shot and chainsword downswing, to the last wrenching-off of a Tyranid’s chitinous head, this long awaited sequel gets full marks for its most crucial assignment: making you feel like an eight-foot-tall power-armored death machine.</p>

								<p>Bewilderingly, sushi and tacos have become the focus of a heated <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong> discussion online, as art from the new D&amp;D Player’s Handbook happens to feature both of these foods. After a fan Tweet from September 1 decried this artistic choice as “nonsense”, several members of the D&amp;D community rushed to defend sushi and tacos’ status as fantasy game food.</p>

								<p>Wizards of the Coast revealed Meathook Massacre II, a sequel to another infamous<strong> Magic: The Gathering</strong> card, on September 3. And, like almost every sequel to an iconic horror movie, this new MTG card is a worse, more expensive imitation of its predecessor. Wizards is <em>nailing</em> the schlock-y horror vibes of Duskmourn, it seems.</p>

								<p>Upcoming <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> set Duskmourn is full of nods to the horror genre, and we’re a real big fan of this latest one.
