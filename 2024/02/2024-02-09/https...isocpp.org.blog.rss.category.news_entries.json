They use a simple analogy involving a robot with an abacus and pigeonholes to explain fundamental computer operations and how programs are executed. Matt then demonstrates how machine code, the computer's language, can be represented as a sequence of numbers and stored in memory to instruct the computer in performing tasks, illustrating the basic concept of programming.</p>\n</blockquote>", "artist": null, "album": "", "bookmarked": false, "thumbnail": null, "language": "en", "age": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-09T00:35:22+00:00", "tags": [], "link": "https://isocpp.org//blog/2024/02/machine-code-explained-matt-godbolt", "source": "https://isocpp.org/blog/rss/category/news", "permanent": false}]
