A coating that can hide objects in plain sight, or an implant that behaves exactly like bone tissue: These extraordinary objects are already made from 'metamaterials'. Researchers have now developed an AI tool that not only can discover such extraordinary materials but also makes them fabrication-ready and durable. This makes it possible to create devices with unprecedented functionalities.

A team of scientists has devised means for classical computing to mimic a quantum computing with far fewer resources than previously thought. The scientists' results show that classical computing can be reconfigured to perform faster and more accurate calculations than state-of-the-art quantum computers.

## Alien invasion: Non-native earthworms threaten ecosystems
