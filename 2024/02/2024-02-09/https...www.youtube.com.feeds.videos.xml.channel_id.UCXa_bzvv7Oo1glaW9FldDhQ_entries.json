As the end of the Erebonia saga, with dozens of playable characters and heroes from Trails in the Sky and Zero/Azure, it's an epic finale in many ways.\n\nWhile it doesn't always hit the mark in that regard - especially in terms of pacing with the second Act - Cold Steel 4 still offers an extensive world to explore, endearing characters to connect with, lots of content to complete and fun combat to engage with.\n\nThe PS5 version doesn't provide much outside of an improved frame rate and resolution, which makes the visual style look antiquated. Nevertheless, The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 4 is worth experiencing, even if the real send-off awaits in Trails into Reverie.", "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "", "bookmarked": false, "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zrNu4GoWZGM/hqdefault.jpg", "language": null, "age": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-09T20:30:06+00:00", "tags": [], "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrNu4GoWZGM", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "permanent": false}, {"vote": 0, "source_obj__id": 208, "title": "The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 3 PS5 Review - The Final Verdict", "page_rating_votes": 0, "comments": [], "dead": false, "user": null, "page_rating": 0, "description": "The Legend of Heroes: Trails series has been around for a while, and the setting has come a long way. However, even as fans prepare for Trails through Daybreak this Summer, they can revisit Trails of Cold Steel 3 and 4 on February 16th for PS5.\n\nThough you shouldn't expect much visual improvements - aside from a higher resolution/frame rate and faster loading times - The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 3 is still a standout title in the Erebonian saga. It offers strong characters, a compelling plot, slick combat and exceptional world-building, even if it can get overwhelming.\n\nWhile its visuals won't win too many players, the music and voice acting are top-notch.
