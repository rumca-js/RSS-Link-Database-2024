<p>If you use Windows for work and an iPhone for everything else, you should know that Apple has changed iCloud for Windows and no longer offers iTunes for the platform —  though none of your media purchases have disappeared.</p><h2><strong>How has Apple improved iCloud for Windows?</strong></h2>
<p>Apple has redesigned the iCloud for Windows application, giving it a more modern look that’s easier to navigate with Photos, iCloud Drive, Passwords, Bookmarks and Calendars/Contacts all easy to access in a click. It’s also easy to check how much storage you have in use.</p><p>Beyond the facelift, the software is now a little easier to set up and install and provides better insights into how files and other data are syncing.

<p>Apple Vision Pro just shipped. Reviewers say the technology inside is magnificent and unprecedented, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY4x85zqoJM" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">experience of using it still flawed</a>.</p><p>But by the end of the year, some 400,000 units could well be operating in the wild.</p><p>Apple’s new headset this year will be dismissed by many as too expensive, hot, heavy and not particularly useful. Still, I expect Apple to do what Apple does, which is to mainstream a new platform and dominate it with super high quality over time.</p><p>Like the Apple Watch, which started out “meh!” and ended up unbeatable in the market, Apple Vision Pro will turn out over the years to be the unbeatable spatial computing platform.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712820/meetings-are-about-to-get-weird.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Has there ever been a feature as packed with potential and simultaneously easy to forget as Android's screen-splitting system?</p><p>On the surface, splitting your screen to see two apps together at the same time <em>seems</em> like a stunningly splendid feat. Two apps at once? Easy drag and drop between 'em? No awkward flipping back and forth to reference info while you're writing something or access your calendar whilst chatting? That's desktop-style multitasking, baby!</p><p>And yet, best I can tell — anecdotally speaking — hardly anyone actually seems to use screen-splitting on Android on a regular basis in the real world. (When's the last time <em>you</em> did?!)</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712841/android-multitasking-shortcut.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
