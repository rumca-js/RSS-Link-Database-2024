<p><strong>Southwark Playhouse, London<br /></strong>This two-hander has a high concept and appealing performances but the script and songs lack emotional pull</p><p>‘Life’s not one of your paintings,” Ami rages at her artist boyfriend, Ben. “You can’t just rip it up and start again.” But what if Ben was in an accident, had amnesia and happened to meet Ami afresh, not remembering their faltering relationship at all? That might provide a new start for both – even if Ami is racked with guilt over not revealing their shared past.</p><p>Timothy Knapman and Stuart Matthew Price’s two-hander has a Hollywood-style high concept but their musical romcom is strangely reluctant to run with the premise and quickly becomes overly earnest. Knapman’s book has a good sense of the everyday ebb and flow of relationships yet could use sharper repartee. The occasional goofy humour is seldom matched by his and Price’s lyrics, which drift too often towards the commonplace. Price’s score – well pla

<p>San Francisco’s unlikely starting quarterback has grown from an unknown quantity to the verge of history with hard work, consistency and risk taking</p><p>When teams selected the NFL stars of the future in the 2022 draft, no one wanted to go anywhere near Brock Purdy – and it was hard to blame them. He had a good college career at Iowa State but the scouting reports hardly screamed The Next Tom Brady: “throwing is more of a chore than a talent”, “lacks quickness”, “a scrappy runner but not dynamic”, “shies away from tight throws”. At least Purdy was consistent: by the sport’s exacting standards, he appeared to be bad at everything.</p><p>But the San Francisco 49ers’ Kyle Shanahan, known as one of the finest offensive-minded head coaches in the NFL, had been impressed by Purdy’s tape from college and selected him with the 262nd – and final – pick of the draft, a position that each year earns one player the nickname “Mr Irrelevant” and plenty of derision on social media.</p>

<p>Abandoning its £28bn green plan betrays a lack of self-belief that has long bedevilled the party – a flaw it must address</p><p>In our punitive politics, the Labour party is almost always on probation. You can see it in Keir Starmer’s sometimes jumpy public manner, in the party’s dumping or scaling down of policies as a general election nears, and in its often cautious approach in power, even when it has a commanding majority.</p><p>Labour’s lingering insecurity and its related lack of credibility as a governing party in the eyes of others are clearest in how it handles, or is believed to handle, the public finances. State spending, investment, borrowing and deficits can seem dry topics. But they are also treacherous ones for the party which, since its founding, has been torn between seeking financial respectability – the terms of which are usually defined by establishment interests and Labour’s political enemies – and using government to create a more equal society.</p> <

<p><strong>Theatre Royal Bath<br /></strong>This eccentric retelling of the bloody story flamboyantly combines songs and pop culture gags but still shocks</p><p>Emma Rice’s retelling of this bloody folktale could be described as Blue Beard: The Cabaret. It is a characteristically eccentric affair, with song, movement and oodles of theatrical pizzazz. The ancient story of a man who murders his wives and keeps them in a locked chamber is flamboyantly, cheekily updated with pop culture references (from Lady Gaga to Jamie Oliver). Rice’s writing feels unruly but who cares when it is so charming? Magnificently mischievous, the show is staged as a musical (composed by Stu Barker), morphing into a full-on gig before reshaping itself to a more spine-chilling form.</p><p>Serial husband Blue Beard (Tristan Sturrock) is a svelte, sinister magician in a burgundy suit, wooing his bride, Lucky (Robyn Sinclair), by sawing her in half before his rapt audience.

It may seem a subtle change but for Lemina it was a significant one after the passing of his father, Mario, before the new year. “I feel like my dad is with me more than ever before,” he says. “I need to carry his name until I cannot walk any more. It is special and important for me and my family to always see his name on my back when I am on the pitch. We have the feeling he is always with us.”</p><p>Wolves required the Premier League to approve the name change on his shirt and the arrival of Lemina’s youngest brother, Noha, on loan from Paris Saint-Germain last month smoothed the process.

<p>Third-tier Nottingham Forest enjoying impressive season with Louanne Worsey hoping to dazzle WSL stalwarts</p><p>Nottingham Forest go into their FA Cup fifth-round tie against Everton on Sunday as one of two third-tier teams left in the competition. Charged with helping lead the line for them against the Women’s Super League side is the 18-year-old forward Louanne Worsey, the Cup’s joint top scorer with six goals.</p><p>Worsey has thrived on loan from Birmingham, playing with a freedom that has her relishing the pressure of taking on a team who have won only three WSL games this season. “I thrive off pressure, pressure makes diamonds so I’m going to go there with an open mind and hopefully get even more goals and prove even bigger a point,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/09/i-thrive-off-pressure-louanne-worsey-fired-up-for-everton-fa-cup-tie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Italian researchers say that joining the mafia is like entering a cult in which members must leave behind their own identity</p><p>Leonardo Vitale made his way into the Sicilian mafia at age 19 by killing a boss from a rival clan. He continued his violent career as a mafioso for the next 12 years until his arrest in 1972 and transfer to a maximum-security prison when, after a week of isolation, he began to self-harm and show signs of depression.</p><p>Overwhelmed by remorse for the criminal acts he had committed, Vitale<strong> </strong>suffered a nervous breakdown. The former boss felt “guilty” and “impure” to the point that, upon his release from prison a year later, he voluntarily went to the police station in Palermo to confess to two murders. He also provided the names of dozens of other bosses involved in criminal activities. Diagnosed with diminished capacity and schizophrenia by doctors, he was placed in a psychiatric hospital. When he was released, the mafia had a

They have not lost in 21 Championship matches and boast higher average possession than any club in Europe’s big five leagues, where Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona lead the way.</p><p>Southampton, who have won 10 home games on the bounce, conceding only three goals, are marching under Martin.

<p>The beloved Python narrates his touching tribute to a long-lost relative who was killed at the Somme</p><p>Michael Palin, the Python turned TV documentarian, has long delighted in sharing tales of his family, whether through his diaries – he has published three volumes so far – or through his film American Friends, a fictionalised account of the courtship of his great-grandfather, an Oxford don, and his American wife. In Great-Uncle Harry, he turns his attention to Henry William Bourne Palin – known as Harry – who died in the Battle of the Somme in 1916 at 32. Palin was alerted to his great-uncle’s existence by a cousin who gave him a “stash of Palinilia, among which were some photographs. One of these caught my eye. It was of a young man in a military uniform wearing a wide-brimmed hat and throwing a guarded glance at the camera.” Years later, while working on a documentary about the last day of the first world war, Palin saw Harry’s name on a war memorial in a Somme batt

The advance warning was to give everyone time to prepare. On the dot of six came the news that the king had cancer. It had been detected during his prostate treatment but was unrelated to it. The king was in good spirits and would start treatment very shortly. In the meantime he would cancel his public appearances but would attend to matters of state. That, you would have thought, just about covered it. Everything that needed to be said had been said. We could give the king some space to recover at home with his family.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/09/digested-week-media-frenzy-over-kings-cancer-does-no-one-any-favours">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Spring is the ideal season to plant most seeds, but the luscious eggplant is a notable exception</p><p>I have a pet peeve that I share with a lot of gardener friends: the social media-driven push to start sowing seeds now, even though it’s simply too early for most of us. Buoyed by the memory of generously warm springs – like that of 2020 – we could be forgiven for being optimistic and sow seeds in the hope that this coming spring will be just as ideal for our early crops. But British weather is unpredictable, so why plant&nbsp;seeds now when those sown later will probably fare better? This is&nbsp;true for the vast number of crops that I’ll be sowing when the daffodils are in full bloom.</p><p>But there are notable exceptions – and one is the aubergine. This vegetable was at the heart of the Mauritian cooking I grew up on, and&nbsp;so&nbsp;came to associate it with warmer climates, but it’s very possible&nbsp;– and very satisfying! – to&nbsp;grow aubergines in&nbsp;the UK

Now, he is rekindling his love affair with acting – and stepping into the wrestling ring</p><p>Bruce Jones has been a lot of things in life. A Ken Loach protege, Coronation Street’s Les Battersby, a dejected wannabe stripper in The Full Monty, a tabloid regular – and now, aged 71, a professional wrestler.</p><p>So why is he stepping into the ring for Sovereign Pro Wrestling this month? “It’s a good question,” he laughs as we sit in a Premier Inn at Melton Mowbray, where he is performing in Christmas panto. Jones’s role in the wrestling was originally a cameo – being billed as Les Battersby to promote another match – “but it got out of hand”, he says, referring to the attention his announcement got. “So, they were like: ‘You don’t mind getting knocked about in the ring a bit, do you?’”</p> <a href="https://www.thegua
