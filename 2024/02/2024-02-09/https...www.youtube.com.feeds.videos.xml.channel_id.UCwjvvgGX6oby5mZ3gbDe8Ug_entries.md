Following a few days of heavy snowfall, one will likely encounter unforeseen hardships and disasters in China. Whether one travels by high-tech or traditional means, survival can be a problem. 
This occurred on the night of February 3rd into the morning of February 4th. Affected by the snow, thousands of vehicles were trapped on the highway from Wuhan to Jingzhou for tens of hours. People used crowbars and hammers to smash the ice for self-help. They even burned tree branches to keep themselves warm.
