		A day’s not complete in the digital ID world until someone (and usually it’s many people) shakes a stick accusingly at health care (and usually it’s in the United States).

Here are three announcements addressing the need for broadly deployed, secure and efficient systems.

The first one is expected to address industry accreditations.

<a href="https://www.inteleos.org/">Inteleos</a>, a nonprofit health care certification organization, says it’s going to collaborate with identity verification exchange <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/credivera">Credivera</a> to create digital identities and verifiable credentials. The goal is to address fraud but also to make credential verification more efficient with a digital wallet.

		African countries participating in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) are preparing to adopt the Digital Trade Protocol in early 2024, set to define the continent’s digital infrastructure. As a key component of the planned African digital single market, the trade agreement will regulate digital trade, eliminating barriers and establishing rules, standards and interoperability frameworks.

The European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM) policy experts Chloe Teevan and Melody Musoni argue in a brief that the European Union (EU) should cooperate with the African Union (AU) to boost interoperability.

“To advance the African [Digital Trade Protocol], the EU and AU should collaborate on developing interoperable digital se

		The packed election year of 2024 is ramping up and so are political attacks using deepfakes. U.S. President Joe Biden has already been faked in robocalls related to primary elections in New Hampshire. Now deepfakes have surfaced in more local races, with victimized politicians comparing the potential impact of deepfake technology on democracy to weapons of mass destruction.

		The UK is planning to introduce mandatory photo identification for voters during national elections for the first time this year. But the country’s electoral watchdog is warning that the tight ID rules risk disenfranchising certain groups while the new rules could be seen as benefitting the Tory Party.

“The photo ID requirement is clearly proving more of a barrier to some people than others,” says John Pullinger, chair of the UK Electoral Commission.

The introduction of photo IDs for voting has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/06/tories-election-rigging-photo-id-gerrymandering-voting">fueling accusations</a> that the Tory government is trying to gerrymander the elections by excluding voters who are likely to vote against the

		Scientists have developed <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01838.pdf">EdgeFace</a>, a novel face recognition model optimized for use on devices with limited processing power and storage. This lightweight face recognition network is inspired by the hybrid architecture of EdgeNeXt, which combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers to perform accurate face recognition while conserving computational resources.

Typical <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/facial-recognition">facial recognition</a> systems rely on deep neural networks that, despite their accuracy, demand extensive memory and processing capabilities, rendering them impractical for use on edge devices. In response to these challenges, there has b

		Biometric sensor maker <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/fingerprint-cards-ab">Fingerprint Cards</a> released fiscal 2023 and fourth quarter financial reports that show a trudge toward black ink. Some key statistics are still moving the wrong way, however.

On the plus side, executives have some positive product news from this month to talk about.

Bright spots for the year ended December 31 included an operating loss that was almost halved. And a negative cash flow of SEK 334.1 million (US$31.9 million) that was cut to SEK 88.3 million ($8.4 million).

The fourth quarter’s gross margin rose from 8.8 percent for the same period a year ago to 9.5 percent, but the year’s margin sank to 12.7 percent from 19.3 percent a year ago.

		Belize is moving towards building its national identification system and formulating a strategy for biometric data with future plans for digitizing public services.

The Central American country is currently working on a draft of the National Biometric Strategy and Action Plan, targeting to reach an agreement among stakeholders by March 2024. Upon agreement, the final report will be submitted and an action plan will be formulated, according to Chief Executive Officer in the Ministry of E-Governance Jose Urbina.

		The National Identity Management Commission of Nigeria (NIMC) says it has boosted the digital ID enrollment capacity of all states in the country with the distribution of biometric devices.

In a recent media release signed by the NIMC’s Head of Corporate Communications, Kayode Adegoke, the agency said approval for the distribution of the devices was recently given by the ID authority’s Director General, Abisoye Coker-Odusote.

The devices have already been received and deployed by the states, the release mentions. Nigeria has 36 states.

“The provision of additional enrollment devices underscores the commitment of the DG/CEO to streamline operations and enhance overall effectiveness. The systems have since been installed and in use across all the states and hav
