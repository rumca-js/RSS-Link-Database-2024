A gathering Thursday night proved how valuable those pursuits can be among people with shared experiences and challenges. The ongoing series &#8220;Black Tech Night&#8221; marked one year since its launch with an event at Vera Project at Seattle Center, where roughly 200 people turned out to mingle and take in a panel discussion titled &#8220;Multigenerational Black Experiences in Tech.&#8221; &#8216;I remember how important it was for us to support each other. And I hope [this] generation sees how important it&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/black-tech-night-in-seattle-stresses-importance-of-strong-community-to-help-grow-represen

Gupta will transition to a new role as &#8220;chairman emeritus Apptio&#8221; and will be a strategic advisor to IBM, which acquired Apptio last year in a $4.6 billion deal. &#8220;We created a culture that was based on integrity, transparency, results driven, fast failures and most importantly creating wildly successful customers,&#8221; Gupta wrote on LinkedIn. &#8220;We built so many incredible memories and relationships with our customers, employees, and investors — these relationships will stay with me forever.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/apptio-ceo-sunny-gupta-stepping-down-17-years-after-founding-ent

As the law went into effect last month, companies such as Uber, DoorDash, and Instacart responded by adding new fees for customers in Seattle and adjusting tip mechanisms.
