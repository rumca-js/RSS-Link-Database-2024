A gathering Thursday night proved how valuable those pursuits can be among people with shared experiences and challenges. The ongoing series &#8220;Black Tech Night&#8221; marked one year since its launch with an event at Vera Project at Seattle Center, where roughly 200 people turned out to mingle and take in a panel discussion titled &#8220;Multigenerational Black Experiences in Tech.&#8221; &#8216;I remember how important it was for us to support each other.
