<p>Last week, The Browser Company, a startup that makes the Arc web browser, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arc-browser-comes-to-the-iphone-as-a-stripped-down-ai-powered-search-tool-150227704.html">released</a> a slick new iPhone app called Arc Search. Instead of displaying links, its brand new ‚ÄúBrowse for Me‚Äù feature reads the first handful of pages and summarizes them into a single, custom-built, Arc-formatted web page using large language models from OpenAI and others. If a user does click through to any of  the actual pages, Arc Search blocks ads, cookies and trackers by default. Arc‚Äôs efforts to reimagine web browsing have received <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23462235/arc-web-browser-review">near-universal acclaim</a>. But over the last few days, ‚ÄúBrowse for Me‚Äù earned The Browser Company its first online backlash.</p>

Keeping track of all those credentials manually would be an onerous task, which is why everyone could benefit from having a password manager.

<p>We‚Äôve spent the last week with the Apple Vision Pro and we have thoughts! This week, Senior Writer Sam Rutherford and Podcast Producer Ben Ellman join Devindra to chat about his Vision Pro review, as well as their first impressions of the headset. It‚Äôs far from a slam dunk, but it‚Äôs also one of the most fascinating devices we‚Äôve ever seen. We dive into Apple‚Äôs impressive 3D Immersive Videos, the elegant simplicity of the Vision Pro‚Äôs eye tracking and hand gestures, and the trouble with wearing such a heavy headset.</p>

<p>Apple took its time to get into mixed reality/spatial computing/putting screens on your face. But finally, the Vision Pro is here. Do you need one? Probably not. Will it change the world in a year? Probably not. Is it meant for developers, wealthy Apple devotees and influencers, hoping it‚Äôll pay dividends in content? Yeah.</p>

<p>Dyson's signature Supersonic hair dryer hasn't changed much since its launch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-14-dyson-hq-tour.html">back in 2016</a>, so the brand caught us by surprise when it unveiled a brand new model with a completely different look at New York Fashion Week earlier today. The "Supersonic r" is a tube-shaped hair dryer that dwarfs its predecessor, and it's lighter as well, weighing just 325g (around 11.5 ounces) ‚Äî almost half that of the original Supersonic, which my hairstylist friend said was too heavy for all-day use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This impressive weight and size reduction is largely thanks to some re-engineered heating elements, which allowed the team to replace the old design's large head with just a bend at the end of the shaft ‚Äî like a lower case "r," hence the name. (Remember the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-24-htc-re-camera-review.html">HTC RE</a> camera?) Miniaturized heating grills consisting of 99.9% copper microfins

<p>With the rise of AI tools that can quickly create modified images and videos, making fake images to spread political misinformation leading to the upcoming US presidential election has become easier than ever.
