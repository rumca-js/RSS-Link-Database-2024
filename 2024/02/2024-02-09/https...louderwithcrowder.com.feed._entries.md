But in Canada, that‚Äôs not how things work. They don‚Äôt really see Canadian citizens as people. They are more like cattle in so many ways because little things like ‚Äúparental rights‚Äù don‚Äôt exist there. </p><p>There's a new bill in Canada that would ban gender reassignment surgery for minors. That‚Äôs a good thing. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
