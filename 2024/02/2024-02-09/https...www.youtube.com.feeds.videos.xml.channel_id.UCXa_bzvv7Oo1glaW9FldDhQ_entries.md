The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 4 first launched in 2018 for PS4 and is finally coming to PS5 on February 16th. As the end of the Erebonia saga, with dozens of playable characters and heroes from Trails in the Sky and Zero/Azure, it's an epic finale in many ways.

While it doesn't always hit the mark in that regard - especially in terms of pacing with the second Act - Cold Steel 4 still offers an extensive world to explore, endearing characters to connect with, lots of content to complete and fun combat to engage with.

The PS5 version doesn't provide much outside of an improved frame rate and resolution, which makes the visual style look antiquated. Nevertheless, The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 4 is worth experiencing, even if the real send-off awaits in Trails into Reverie.

The Legend of Heroes: Trails series has been around for a while, and the setting has come a long way. However, even as fans prepare for Trails through Daybreak this Summer, they can revisit Trails of Cold Steel 3 and 4 on February 16th for PS5.

Though you shouldn't expect much visual improvements - aside from a higher resolution/frame rate and faster loading times - The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 3 is still a standout title in the Erebonian saga. It offers strong characters, a compelling plot, slick combat and exceptional world-building, even if it can get overwhelming.

While its visuals won't win too many players, the music and voice acting are top-notch. Whether new to the series or raring for another playthrough, it's well worth your time.

Here's what you should know about Skull and Bones before its (current) worldwide release, from its differing price on consoles vs. PC to the post-launch plans.

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been on the receiving end of plenty of criticism ever since its launch, and a lot of it is, sadly, well deserved. 

But while there’s been plenty of conversation about the game’s own inherent flaws (of which it has plenty), the conversation that’s been the loudest of them all has been how a studio as talented and beloved as Rocksteady has ended up being wasted on yet another live service looter shooter that is, above all else, aspiring to be a source of constant revenue for its publisher, rather than an actual good game that its audience will enjoy. 

Rocksteady is not the first single player studio that has fallen victim to that mindset, but will it be the last? Here, we attempt to answer that question.
