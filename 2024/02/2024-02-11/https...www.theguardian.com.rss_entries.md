## Haller the hero as Ivory Coast seal improbable Afcon win against Nigeria

<p>It turns out the zombie team really couldn’t be killed after all. The dead kid doesn’t fear the knife. Ghosts don’t feel pain. There was no way to prevent Ivory Coast from winning the Africa Cup of Nations for the third time. League formats excepted, no side had ever won a major tournament after losing twice, but it was more than those defeats by Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea in the group phase. Three times in the knockouts they were behind and each time Emerse Faé’s side came back to prevail. Nobody could pretend that this Ivory Coast team is one of the great sides, but this was one of the great tournament wins.</p><p>No one would set out to win a tournament this way, qualifying from the group as the fourth of four best third-placed sides, sacking the coach, doing – at least if almost every player interview since is to be believed – a lot of looking in the mirror. But maybe this is the most fun way to win, amid chaos and disbelieving laughter and an inextinguishable will.

Sometimes it’s impossible to describe why a dancer is so good, what it is that elevates them above others, except that you watch them with wonder and everything seems so … right, somehow. Rosa especially, with her close-cropped hair and pliable strength, is in control of her instrument in a way that seemingly transcends the sweat and guts it takes to get this good. There’s no projected showmanship or ardent love story between the pair, but something natural and inevitable, like the forces of nature at work on their bodies: folding, stretching, torquing, through and around each other.</p><p>It takes something special to stand

If so, such a calculation was more than naive”. Despite the best efforts of the Greenham women to prevent it, deployment of cruise missiles went ahead as planned, paving the way for the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which eliminated both cruise and the SS-20s. This multilateral deal could never have happened if their campaign for unilateral UK nuclear disarmament had succeeded.</p><p>Rebecca Johnson (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/30/the-warnings-from-greenham-common-women-are-as-perti

<p>A biracial family in rural Somerset struggle with relationships and identity in a debut novel of subtle originality </p><p>At one point in Fiona Williams’s accomplished debut novel, an elderly lady tells 10-year-old Max Hembry that the broken bricks employed to build his family’s cottage were also used as ballast at sea, “to weigh down them clipper ships sent to collect sugar from the Caribbean … yes, where your nana and grandad came from”. The symbolism could not be more explicit: that which appears damaged can, from a different perspective, offer stability.</p><p><em>The House of Broken Bricks</em> follows the Hembry family through a calendar year during which the fractures in their domestic life seem beyond repair. Tessa, London-born daughter of Jamaican parents, feels ground down by the often unwitting microaggressions she experiences as the only person of colour in their small Somerset village. Her husband, Richard, hides in his shed, secretly drinking as his business

<p>Diagnosed as a teenager with rheumatoid arthritis, the musician hid her condition from her bandmates and friends. But as the pain subsided after the menopause, acceptance of her body grew</p><p>Ten years ago, Candida Doyle spoke publicly for the first time about having lived with arthritis since she was a teenager. In a 2014 film about her band, Pulp, Doyle talked about being in denial. It was acceptable for pop stars to have a drug addiction, but not to be ill. Doyle, who plays keyboard for the band, had kept it so well hidden that when a bandmate watched the documentary, her arthritis was news to him.</p><p>The condition came on when Doyle was 16, a month after her periods started (there is thought to be a connection between hormones and arthritis, though it isn’t very well understood). “It was suddenly such an extreme difference,” she says, when we meet at her home in north London. “I was just aching all over, I lost my appetite.

In a rare, probably unrepeatable period of change – the last months of Mikhail Gorbachev’s rule and of his short-lived policy of glasnost (openness) – Lewis was allowed to visit the Gulag regions of north-eastern Siberia. It was 1991. The archaeology of the gulags was still lying in the snow: the wreckage of huts and fences, wooden stakes and rusted barbed wire, an old boot stiff in the permafrost. Starting in the port of Magadan, he travelled north along the “Road of Bones”, the 2,000km

<p>The author’s warm and shrewd account of her incident-packed existence is a hymn to her survival skills</p><p>With notable, largely historical exceptions, literary lives can be disappointingly dull to read about. Not so Lisa St Aubin de Terán’s. <em>Better Broken Than New</em> is the novelist and memoirist’s first book since 2007 and its vivid, sometimes chaotic narrative details – adventures and misadventures enough for multiple lifetimes – leave the reader wondering not from where she derives her creative material but how she’s lived to tell the tale.</p><p>Cheating death thanks to a premonition, cooking for a cannibal and surviving the apparently murderous ministrations of a racist maternity nurse: along with infidelities and estrangements, these startling occurrences become almost incidental in a volume whose defining dramas run to kidnapping her own five-year-old daughter and then living under police protection, and fighting off a homicidal gang of home invaders with a

<p>The child of Algerian parents who grew up in France and found artistic freedom in London on family, ideas of belonging and how she and close friend Sonia Boyce came to be the toast of 2022’s Venice Biennale</p><p>In the late 1960s, in a poor suburb north of Paris, Abdelrahman Sedira was in the habit of taking his little girl Zineb to the local cinema on his day off. Abdul Sedira worked as a cleaner in a factory. He was illiterate in both French and his native Arabic having hardly been to school, but he and Zineb shared a love of film. The cinema was the place where Abdelrahman met other working men, some like him from Algeria, some also with their children in tow. Father and daughter’s favourite films were spaghetti westerns, or schlocky Egyptian epics about Cleopatra. In place of subtitles an Arab speaker might stand at the front and shout out ad hoc translations. Those afternoon adventures stayed with Zineb Sedira, opened up worlds for her.</p><p>Fast forward to 2022, an

<p>A cosy winter dinner is best finished with a refreshing mint ice</p><p>The weather has been bitterly cold all week and the heating in this house is, to say the least, unpredictable. On the coldest day, with the wind howling down the chimneys, I made an old-fashioned chicken casserole, the mushroom-laden sauce deepened with sherry and pancetta. To swirl into the dark and aromatic juices on our plates, I made a purée of parsnips, the smooth and buttery kind rather than my usual rough mash. We thawed out a little more with each forkful.</p><p>I will purée any of the roots to go with a rich gravy: artichokes, swede, carrot or sweet potato, though not beetroot, which I find too thin and watery for the task. I threw everything at the chicken: whole, fat cloves of garlic, the aforementioned pancetta – a smoked version – as well as thyme, dried mushrooms and oloroso sherry. We ended up with a dark and bosky gravy and chicken that fell sweetly from its heavy bones. There was a good

<p>The change in the way we do our jobs since the pandemic accounts for half of the 30% drop in break-ins since 2019</p><p>Almost none of the long-term changes people said the pandemic would bring have turned out to be true. The gratitude and respect for carers and lower earners didn’t last long once we were allowed to do something more exciting than clapping on our doorsteps. Even online shopping has fallen back to roughly where the pre-pandemic rise would have put it.</p><p>But one change has stuck: working from home (with the important caveat that it’s rocketed among the top half of earners in particular; those working in a shop or restaurant, not so much). What affect will this have? It clearly boosts wellbeing, and is helping more mothers work full time. The research on its productivity impact is far more mixed, and I’d say comes down to a score draw. The big clear win is less time spent commuting, the benefits of which are shared between employees and employers. The los

Nevertheless, this is what psychologists tell us. We can suffer, apparently, from “compassion fatigue” – present in burnt-out care workers, but also at scale (Ukraine frets that, two years into a war with Russia, supporters in the west will reach compassion fatigue). We also suffer from “compassion fade”: as the number in need increases, tragedies dissolve into statistics.</p><p>Both biases have an element of paradox – we are withdrawing sympathy as the need for it increases. But I wonder if there is also a third sort of paradoxical bias lurking within our good intentions; call it “compassion status-bias”.

He’s fielding a coy question from flirtatious fan (and girlfriend in waiting) Pam (Lily James), and he fervently believes what he’s saying. She, reasonably, asks him how anyone can call themselves a “world champion” wrestler when so much of what plays out in the ring is “pre-arranged”. Kevin argues that the performance is the point; that the difference between a Speedo-clad lunk sweating it out on the provincial circuit and a bona fide champion boils down to self-belief and the quality of the show that they put on for the audience.</p><p>And this is a central idea in writer-director Sean Durkin’s powerful third film, a factually based account of the larger-than-real-life Vo

One owner, it reports, gave up after being quoted £14,000 to insure his £100,000 Range Rover Sport, and instead “bought himself a new Mercedes GLE”. Insurers, who say the vehicles are too likely to be stolen, seem to be deaf to the suffering of owners whose only fault was to buy an obese status symbol coveted by many hard-working criminals, as well

<p>The story of Jewish suffering means there is a moral necessity to fight oppression everywhere</p><p>William Zuckerman was born in 1885 in the Pale of Settlement, that part of the Russian empire to which Jews were largely confined, a place of poverty and pogroms. His family managed to escape, emigrating to America in&nbsp;1900.</p><p>During the First World War, Zuckerman returned to Europe to work with a charity aiding American Jewish soldiers. Later, he settled in London, establishing the European bureau of <em>Der Morgen </em><em>zshurnal</em>, an influential American Yiddish newspaper. In 1948, having returned to America, he founded the <em>Jewish Newsletter,</em> just as the new state of Israel was born.

But now the knee is causing problems again. As a self-employed chartered engineer, he needs to be able to get up and down tower blocks.

<p>The Picture Post photographer’s unpublished image, included in a new retrospective of his work, captures an equal pay protest that led to deportations</p><p>In 1942, <em>Picture Post</em> commissioned Bert Hardy to photograph the lives of Chinese sailors in Liverpool. About 10,000 seamen, some of whom had been settled in Liverpool’s Chinatown for decades, worked on the Blue Funnel Line or in the kitchens and laundries of Royal Navy ships during the war. The men were paid less than half the wage of their British-born crewmates.</p><p>From February to April that year, the workers made headlines when they went on strike for equal pay. Hardy’s pictures, which were never published in the magazine, illustrated those months of protest, when the sailors – branded as troublemakers – gathered in Chinatown’s hostels and boarding houses to discuss their action. Several of those images, including this photo, are included in a retrospective of Hardy’s work at the <a href="https://thepho

<p>Studies of two 19th-century champions of women’s rights, Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon and Annie Besant, shine a light on the bohemian and ‘badass’ pioneers, even if the tone sometimes grates</p><p>While her name is an awful mouthful, Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon remains something of a Zelig figure. Pick up almost any book about Victorian literary circles and she’ll be in it somewhere. You see her here, you see her there, this much-admired artist and co-founder of Girton College, Cambridge, this cousin of Florence Nightingale and friend of George Eliot. In as much as she sticks in the mind when your attention is really supposed to be elsewhere, she is a pleasing, bustling kind of figure: independent, cheery, rather bohemian for her time – and sharp, too. “Today came a letter from Barbara full of joy in my success, in the certainty that <em>Adam Bede</em> was mine, though she had not read more than extracts in Reviews,” wrote Eliot in her diary on 6 May 1859.

It’s a beautiful reimagining of a Florentine trattoria, even if the name translates literally as “ugly”. We were served ice-cold negronis, which even I drank, and tumblers of something white, sparkling and primitive. The lamps were turned off, so that the only illumination came courtesy of the guttering candlelight. Then the eight-minute version of Prince’s Purple Rain, full of screaming guitars and broken edges, was played out at top volume across the room. We stood in our own shadowed pools of silence, lost in thought, thinking about Russell Norman: the man who created this and so many other restaurants, and who died far too young last November. As it was explained to us by Monique Sierra, Brutto’s general manager, the playing of Purple Rain cranked up loud, to a crammed late-night Brutto dinin

Thompson would have been 100 on 3 February.
