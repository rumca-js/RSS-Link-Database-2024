<p>A landowner in Tierra del Fuego sets three men to clear a ‘safe route’ through native lands in this menacing shakedown of colonialism and its revisionists</p><p>From its thunderous score, which sounds at times like someone dismantling an orchestra with a mallet, to the huge, intimidating, blood-red lettering of the intertitles, to the gut punch of an opening scene: violence, or the threat of it, lurks in every frame of Felipe Gálvez Haberle’s assured debut.</p><p>Opening in 1901 in the sprawling wilderness of Tierra del Fuego, Chile, this Spanish- and English-language film is partly based on true events – including multiple massacres of the indigenous Selk’nam people by white settlers – and explores a grim period in Chile’s colonial past that has subsequently been all but written out of the country’s history books.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/11/the-settlers-felipe-galvez-haberle-mark-stanley-review-leone-inspired-western-packs-a-venomous-bite">C

## You don’t have to follow a particular God to say a prayer. The words are all that matters | Jackie Bailey

<p>I no longer belong to the Christian religion but I can pray to mother wolf or the divine mystery and feel better</p><p>When we were little, my sister and I said our prayers every night before bedtime. By my teenage years, I had started falling asleep before we had finished. I am pretty sure the failure of peace talks between the US and Russia in the 1980s was my fault.</p><p>I never had the transportive sense that, as reported by the Christian female mystic Julian of Norwich, “all shall be well, and all manner of things will be well”. I only ever felt the deep certainty that I would never get it right.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/12/you-dont-have-to-follow-a-particular-god-to-say-a-prayer-the-words-are-all-that-matters">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Adrift after leaving university, Satya Doyle Byock turned to psychology to bridge the journey to adulthood</p><p>When Satya Doyle Byock finished her studies after nearly 20 years, she felt like she was stepping off a cliff. Adulthood seemed perilously unclear. “I was in my 20s and in crisis, looking around myself at friends in crisis,” says Byock, now 40. Only a few of her fellow graduates seemed clear-eyed about the future, with jobs or further study lined up. The rest had “absolutely no idea”.</p><p>After graduating, Byock volunteered abroad, at a prison in Colombia, in tsunami relief in Sri Lanka, before landing a job as a project manager at a software startup in Portland. It was a “good job”, in a buzzy sector, with a decent salary. But Byock’s disorientation persisted. In her journals she wondered if she was on the right path and why she didn’t feel satisfied.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/11/i-felt-lost-in-early-adulthood-so-coined-th

<p>First Japanese conductor to gain recognition in the west who achieved superstar status</p><p>Seiji Ozawa, who has died aged 88, was one of the leading conductors of his generation. Though his place in the pantheon of truly great conductors was questionable, Ozawa was for several decades a major player on the international scene and a figure of some historical significance on several counts.</p><p>He was, to begin with, the first conductor from Japan to achieve recognition in the west, the only one to date to attain superstar status, the longest serving music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1973-2002) and one of the longest serving of any American orchestra. He had a prodigious memory and habitually conducted with the score unopened in front of him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/feb/11/seiji-ozawa-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This follow-up to the 2017 French children’s film is notable only for the self-defeating mission of its baddie – and some age inappropriate subplots</p><p>A peppy but inconsequential globe-trotting sequel to forgettable 2017 French animation <em>The Jungle Bunch</em>, this instalment pits the plucky defenders of the forest against a new foe. Stepping into the bad-guy shoes of Igor the evil koala is a deranged beaver, complete with an army of brainwashed hench-beavers. His aim, which seems ill thought-through given the beavers’ natural affinity for trees, is the complete deforestation of the jungle.</p><p>It’s basic stuff, stronger on action set pieces than it is on humour, which veers towards the toilet-based. Given that the film is aimed towards the youngest audiences, the inclusion of sappy interspecies relationship subplots seems a decidedly odd decision.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/11/the-jungle-bunch-world-tour-review-a-deranged-beaver-wreak
