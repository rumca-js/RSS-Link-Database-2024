If you've been paying attention and can do math, then you'll probably know that Games Workshop will probably be making a new edition of Kill Team this summer, as the last edition came out in 2021. So what do we think it'll be like? I've got some ideas and I'll be glad to share them with you, and of course answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!
