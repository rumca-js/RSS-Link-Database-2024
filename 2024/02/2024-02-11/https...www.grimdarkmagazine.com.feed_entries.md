<p>The Briar Book of the Dead is the latest novel from World Fantasy Award-winning author A.G. Slatter. Set in the same world as her earlier novels All the Murmuring Bones and The Path of Thorns, The Briar Book of the Dead is a standalone fantasy novel that can be enjoyed independently. Although it is a safe bet that if you like those novels from Slatter, you will enjoy this one, too. I went into The Briar Book of the Dead without prior experience of Slatter&#8217;s work and enjoyed reading this gothic tale, with all its thorny twists and turns. Slatter is an author whose work I look forward to exploring her ‘Sourdough’ universe further after this first taste. In The Briar Book of the Dead, we meet the witches of the Briar family. Custodians of a small town called Silverton, the Briars protect the inhabitants with their magic – escaping the usual punishment of burning for their craft. The novel&#8217;s protagonist is Ellie Briar, the first non-witch born to the family in cent
