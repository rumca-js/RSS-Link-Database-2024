<p>Way back when the world was new, and &ldquo;ray tracing&rdquo; was something that only happened in oceanographic illustrations, you needed a wired keyboard to play PC games. Otherwise the old-fashioned wireless connections could lag or skip out, possibly costing you that crucial shot or goal. But that&rsquo;s no longer the case. Modern wireless keyboards are generally fast enough, and wireless <em>gaming </em>keyboards are faster than any human&rsquo;s reaction time and rock-solid stable to boot. </p>



<p>You can use any old keyboard to play PC games, but there&rsquo;s an additional element to consider when you&rsquo;re looking for the best wireless gaming keyboard: latency. The Bluetooth connection on a keyboard like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502685/keychron-q1-pro-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">oth

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">Graphics cards</a> are too expensive. I don&rsquo;t think anyone would seriously disagree with me there &mdash; to get the same level of performance relative to where the industry was ten years ago, you&rsquo;re looking at $100-300 more for a GPU. Options are particularly anemic under the $200 level, with Intel and AMD fighting for a market that Nvidia has basically abandoned. Until now. A new, lower-spec variant of the GeForce RTX 3050 is coming to market with a refreshingly approachable price tag. </p>



<p>The new 6GB version of the GeForce RTX 3050 was announced today, and there are two things about it that might just turn some heads. One, unlike <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/608294/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" tar

<p>LastPass. 1Password.&nbsp;You can hear it in their names: Password managers like to sell the idea you&rsquo;ll only ever need to remember their login. All of your other credentials can live within your vault.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given many people&rsquo;s lax online security, this attitude makes sense&mdash;better to have a single strong password that unlocks access to complex and unique login info, so that more people use random passwords for every site, service, and app. Yes, password managers could fail to uphold their promises to protect your data. LastPass&rsquo;s data breaches painfully proved that in 2022. (Seeing that unfold was the worst timeline.)

<p>The more we live our lives digitally, the more important it is to keep our computers and other devices safe from data loss, fraud, and spying. </p>



<p>Although most people today use phones more than computers, it is computers that need the most attention. Both Windows and Mac OS are more capable operating systems than Android and iOS, but because more can be done on a computer, the potential for problems is also greater.</p>



<p>Computer security is about protecting a computer from unauthorized use, malware, and espionage. For most people data security is at least as important, i.e. not losing irreplaceable files such as private photos and videos. Data security depends on computer security, but not vice versa. Even if you don&rsquo;t have a single irreplaceable file on your computer but use a web browser to check your emails or log in to your bank,
