SPOILER WARNING!

Tekken 8 has a really cool story mode called The Dark Awakens that follows Jin in the battle against his father, Kazuya, and we really enjoyed the ending. But we also noticed that in the Gallery after we finished The Dark Awakens, there were two videos missing that claimed “specific conditions” needed to be met to unlock more story. We’re here to show you how to do that, and unlock the trophy called "Despair" in the meantime.

## Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Review

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League reviewed by Simon Cardy on PlayStation 5, also available on Xbox Series X/S and PC.

"Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a thoroughly frustrating game to play. There are things to enjoy here, with combat that’s snappy enough to carry it through a genuinely good DC comics story artfully dressed in high production values. But everything else just falls down around it. Engaging mission design is nearly non-existent, the looter-shooter mechanics are tired and dull, and the grotesquely-repetitive postgame leaves little-to-nothing to do of interest. The result is a bit of a mess that doesn't ever impress with any of its numerous ill-conceived ideas."

The highly anticipated RPG, Avowed, won't be featuring a particular trope of the genre, and the game's director explains why. In other news, Resident Evil 4 is getting another release (no, it's not a remaster of the remake, relax) which will certainly add to its already impressive sales numbers.
