The renaissance of Silent Hill is still underway, and while some of the heavy hitters, like Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 and NeoBards' Silent Hill f, are yet to come, Konami has surprised players with Silent Hill: The Short Message.

Available now as a free-to-play title on PS5, it tells a relatively short story about Anita, a teenager who arrives at a rundown apartment complex at the behest of her classmate Maya.
