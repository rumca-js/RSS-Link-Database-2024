<p>Guitarist helped to give Detroit band their powerful, politically charged sound and continued their legacy into the 21st century</p><p>Wayne Kramer, the guitarist who co-created MC5 – one of the rawest, most influential and politically engaged bands in US history – has died aged 75. His Instagram page announced the news: “Wayne S Kramer. Peace be with you. April 30 1948 – February 2 2024.”</p><p>Born and raised in Detroit, Kramer teamed with teenage friend and fellow guitarist Fred “Sonic” Smith, each of them influenced as much by free jazz as they were by R&amp;B and rock’n’roll. Along with the frontman Rob Tyner, they made MC5 into an incendiary force in their city’s music scene, alongside peers such as the Stooges.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/feb/02/wayne-kramer-co-founder-of-rock-band-mc5-dies-aged-75">Continue reading...</a>

It was no more than Leeds deserved for a hugely impressive display in a largely one-sided contest, with their hosts out of sorts and only able to create a few openings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/02/wilfried-gnonto-sees-off-bristol-city-to-power-dominant-leeds-up-to-second">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manager is determined to retain team’s style but would happily accept an ‘ugly’ winner in title showdown with Liverpool</p><p>Well, that was unexpected. As Mikel Arteta looked forward to Sunday’s showdown against Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium, a game with massive implications for the Premier League title race, he was taken back to Tuesday night’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/30/nottingham-forest-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">2-1 win at Nottingham Forest</a>. And specifically to the on-pitch row between Oleksandr Zinchenko and Ben White after the full-time whistle, when passions boiled over.</p><p>The defensive teammates were furious about how Arsenal had conceded. It is probably fair to say, too, that things would have got a lot more heated if they had done so again in stoppage time, as they nearly did after a half-cleared corner; David Raya had to save from the Forest striker Taiwo Awoniyi. So, were Zinchenko and White friends again?</

<p>Manager knows his side will have little margin for error in the next 16 games as the race to become champions heats up</p><p>Some unscrupulous chancers are hitting the jackpot thanks to Jürgen Klopp’s leaving of Liverpool. Lower main stand tickets for his final game at Anfield are priced at £12,000 on one resale site (well, they are right behind the dugout) and a seat on the Kop is going for £4,250. They will get it too, and possibly more nearer the time, should the price of a ticket for Wolves on 19 May include the presentation of the Premier League trophy to a departing idol.</p><p>Klopp was asked on Friday whether he had contemplated the perfect Premier League send-off. “I am not a dreamer,” he replied. Having lost out by a single point in two other title races with Manchester City, and with 16 matches to go, it pays not to be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/02/jurgen-klopp-says-liverpool-must-buckle-up-for-high-stakes-battle">Continue readin

Given the way Ireland went about their work in this 38-17 victory in Marseille, you guess they’re going to take an awful lot of stopping again this year, more of it, perhaps, than any of the other four teams in the championship can offer.</p><p>Three months on from the World Cup, the game was pitched as a little glimpse of the final that might have been. In fact, only the Irish were in anything like the same sort of form they had been in that tournament. Really, the game was a first look at these two teams’ answers to the question they’ve both had hanging over them ever since those last moments of the knock-out rounds – what now? France clearly have not come up with an answer, yet, they were all over the place, and their performance was strewn with handling errors and missed tackles.</p> <

<p>The greatest shock of all, perhaps, is when there is no shock. In a Cup of Nations in which reputation and pre-tournament billing has meant nothing, there was at last a game that went the way that might have been expected, as Ademola Lookman’s first-half goal and a fourth clean sheet in a row carried Nigeria to the last four of the Cup of Nations for the 16th time.<br /><br />It’s a familiar position for them to be in, and it was a familiar way in which they achieved it. Although Zini hit the post when the score was 1-0, this was another very controlled performance from José Peseiro’s side, the only real concern their failure to add a second and make the game safe.<br /><br />Nigeria are exceptionally good at quarter-finals. This was the 11th they have played in at the Cup of Nations since the expansion of the tournament in 1990; they had only lost one, in 2008 to a Ghana inspired by Junior Agogo. And this Angola, respectfully, are not a Ghana inspired by Junior Agogo.</p>

<p><strong>Gagosian Grosvenor Hill, London</strong><br />Four decades of video work ranging from Dr Jekyll to a red light odyssey showcase the Turner-winning artist’s obsession with good and evil</p><p>Ethical beliefs drive plenty of 21st-century artists but Douglas Gordon is a different sort of moralist. The problems that haunt him are biblical. He is obsessed with the nature of good and evil, seeming to believe in sin and the existence of the human soul.</p><p>Confessions of a Justified Sinner, the video work that won him the Turner prize back in 1996, distils his metaphysical concerns perfectly. It’s one of the oldies but goodies, playing on a colossal mound of TV monitors at the Gagosian, part of a portable anthology entitled Pretty Much Every Film and Video Work from About 1992 Until Now, updated since it was shown at the Hayward two decades ago.

<p>A refreshing, alcohol-free livener with a seasonal rhubarb infusion – just add soda or tonic</p><p>Shrubs are a bit like cordials or syrups, and are usually made with fruit (commonly berries) and vinegar, which is then diluted to make a delicious drink – they’re great with still or sparkling water, tonic or soda water, or as a base for champagne or sparkling wine cocktails. They’re also ideal for anyone intending to carry dry January over into February and beyond. The start of the year always feels like a bit of gap in the fruit calendar, but it does herald the start of the Yorkshire forced rhubarb season, which is beautifully pale pink and makes for an extremely pretty drink (you can also make the shrub with regular rhubarb, though it won’t be quite as pretty). The vinegar you use makes all the difference here, so it’s worth spending a bit more. I use organic coconut vinegar, but moscatel or other quality white-wine vinegar would be just as nice; steer clear of apple cide

For the first time, it is believed, US troops were killed from the air by an enemy drone: three US army reservists died and more than 80 were wounded in last weekend’s attack on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/29/jordan-drone-strike-who-are-islamic-resistance-in-iraq-and-what-is-tower-22">Tower 22, a little-known logistics base near Jordan’s border with Syria</a>.</p><p>The attack, the Pentagon said, had “the footprints of Kataib Hezbollah”, an Iran-aligned militia in Iraq. Joe Biden, the US president, added that he held Tehran responsible “in the sense that they’re supplying the weapons” – the fast proliferating, relatively cheap drones that are changing the nature of warfare.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com

<p>By continuing to focus the conversation around our appearance, all the body positivity movement does is reinforce that how we look is the most important thing about us</p><p>There was a time when a woman reaching the age of 28 may have been considered to be approaching her middle years. That time was probably in the early 1900s, when the average life expectancy for women (in England) was around 50.</p><p>Surely in 2024 though, a 28-year-old is still considered young, right? Wrong! According to a recent social media trend and the feral comments it has produced, the only thing more depressing than being almost 30 is looking like you’re almost 30.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/03/young-women-are-turning-their-backs-on-body-positivity-its-time-we-all-stopped-obsessing-about-how-we-look">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If you’re keen to learn about wine, where do you start? You could simply trust flavours you already like, and experiment from there</p><p>I was hosting an online wine chat the other day when one of the participants volunteered that he knew next to nothing about wine. Loads of people say that, but in this case it turned out that he really didn’t. Did he know which grape varieties he liked, I asked. Sauvignon blanc? Malbec? It was clear from his nonplussed response that he wasn’t familiar with either.</p><p>And there’s nothing wrong with that.

The demonstration was peaceful, passed off without incident and earned a brief mention on the evening news. But suppose for a moment that it had gone the other way.

<p>Warren Gatland’s bold choice can take inspiration from Gareth Edwards and Sam Warburton, other young captains who went on to thrive in a Wales shirt</p><p>There was a buzz in the Cardiff air on Saturday 3 February 1968. Elsewhere in Britain the slump in the polls of Harold Wilson’s Labour party after a disastrous devaluation of the pound occupied minds. But in the pubs and rugby club bars from Aberavon to Ynysybwl the fevered talk was all about a certain young Welshman: Gareth Edwards, elevated to national captain at the age of 20. Scotland, the visitors to the Welsh capital that day, had better brace themselves for the coming storm.</p><p>Fast forward 56 years and the echoes of that giddy moment are as plain as the red dragon emblazoned on a bottle of Brains beer.

<p>Nicola Coughlan brings new life and nuance to Austen’s story of poverty-stricken sisters</p><p>The world isn’t short of audio versions of Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen’s first published novel, which follows the fortunes of sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood and their pursuit of love. Rosamund Pike recorded one in 2018 while Kate Winslet, who appeared in Ang Lee’s screen adaptation, did one in 2007. Juliet Stevenson recorded her version in 2004, though not before Prunella Scales and Glenda Jackson got theirs in.</p><p>Now we have another, courtesy of Derry Girls actor Nicola Coughlan, which does seem superfluous to requirements. But Coughlan’s smart and nuanced narration, in which she gives voice to&nbsp;the Dashwood family and their acquaintances, makes it a decent addition to a crowded market.

That might seem an odd concern to have in 2024, when white people are well represented at every major awards ceremony and <em>the</em> cultural event of the last 12 months was Barbenheimer, a set-to between the greatest of the Great White Man biopics and a jubilant celebration of the archetypal blonde. Or it might just seem a misdirection of energies when, at long last, we also now have some serious east Asian, Black and Indigenous-centring contenders to cheer on, in the form of Past Lives, American Fiction, The Color Purple and Killers of the Flower Moon. Yet even in our racially diverse times, whiteness on screen is everywhere – and nowhere.</p><p>White people still make

Instead of showing off her virtuosity as a viola player or her skills at writing four-part harmony, Sonne manipulates stray elements of 20th-century modernism and beyond to illuminate her curious, elliptical songs.</p><p>Her previous LPs have comprised wordless, drumless instrumentals: painterly constructions which invoked choral samples and minimalist synth pulses, with Sonne occasionally playing drones and flourishes on her viola.

<p>Schools closed and bus thrown off road in most powerful storm for decades, while snow ends dry spell in Himalayas</p><p>This week brought the strongest storm so far of the 2023-24 European season, as Storm Ingunn slammed into Norway on Wednesday with hurricane-force winds. A deep, multi-centred area of low pressure intensified as it moved eastwards towards Scandinavia, displaying signs of possible sting jet activity as it approached the Norwegian coast. A sting jet is a narrow channel of very strong winds – often more than 100mph – that can form when low pressure systems strengthen rapidly, with these winds descending from upper levels towards the surface.</p><p>The storm deepened to a lowest central pressure of 940hPa on Wednesday evening, approaching Norway’s official low pressure record of 938.5hPa, set in 1907.

Rory Carroll reports from Belfast</p><p>When the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) walked out of the power-sharing agreement in Stormont two years ago over the Brexit deal imposed from London, Northern Ireland was, in effect, left without a government.
