I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Tokyo, Japan 1920s, you can clearly see Ginza district and main street, NikkÃ´ Village main street, Asakusa district, Ueno district, KyÃ´to


Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
