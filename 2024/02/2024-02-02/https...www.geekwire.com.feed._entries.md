The layoffs hit workers in the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle and Portland, according to posts from impacted employees. We&#8217;ve reached out to Okta for more details. Okta acquired Seattle-area unicorn Auth0 for $6.5 billion in 2022, one of the largest acquisitions in Seattle tech history.

Case remembers his dad bringing home large Gantt charts — long rolls of paper with timelines and tasks — so that he could unfurl them across the living room floor and over the coffee table to annotate them manually. These days, as co-founder and CEO of the Seattle-based Omni Group productivity software company, Case works with his team to help project managers do the equivalent on their screens, no pencil or eraser required.
