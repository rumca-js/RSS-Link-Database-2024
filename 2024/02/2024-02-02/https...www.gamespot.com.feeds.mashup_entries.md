<p>Naughty Dog has teased it could make The Last of Us: Part III. Co-writer and co-director of the first two games, Neil Druckmann, said in a new documentary that he thinks there is "probably one more chapter to this story."</p><p>"I've been thinking--is there a concept there [for The Last of Us 3]? For, now years, I haven't been able to find that concept. But recently that's changed. I don't have a story. But I do have that concept that is, to me, as exciting as 1, as exciting as 2," he said. "As its own thing, and yet has this throughline for all three. So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."</p><p>Of note, this documentary was seemingly filmed some time ago. It's an official production made in partnership with Naughty Dog. As such, presumably it includes only the information that was deemed acceptable to share publicly, including Druckmann's comments on a potential new Last of Us game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of

Over the years, we've seen movies based on video games attempt to reach that level, with varying levels of success. We've seen adaptations of games for decades, but, to be fair, <em>a lot </em>of these were awful adaptations. Many of them missed the point of the source material and were clumsily executed--although we'll always have a soft spot for the 1994 Street Fighter movie--but lately, we've seen some big changes in this genre.</p><p dir="ltr">The Super Mario Bros.
