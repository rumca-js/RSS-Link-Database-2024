<p>Let's be honest: you deserve better than simply sticking with your TV's built-in speakers. Sure, modern TVs can pump out decent audio (and you can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-super-bowl-2024-tv-deals-we-could-find-164515222.html">find good deals on some at the minute</a>), but most folks would be far better served with a proper home theater setup. And, with the Super Bowl right around the corner, Sonos has picked a good time to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zb25vcy5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9ob21lLXRoZWF0ZXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImEzNzkxYjQ3LTAxMWEtNDViMS04NGJlLTQyZTZjZjFiY2NhMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaJTJGnlmR7eNdM13_42e-onVWfZj_5gIc3vxowaGJ6D&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fs

## NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti Super and 4080 Super review: Two faster GPUs, one better deal

<p>For the discerning gamer who didn't rush out to grab NVIDIA's RTX 40-series GPUs over the last few years, the company's new Super cards are genuinely compelling. They all deliver far more power than before — so much so that the $599 RTX 4070 Super is actually a decent 4K gaming card. But the $999 RTX 4080 Super is also a solid deal for power-hungry gamers, since it's $200 less than the original 4080. Between those two cards, NVIDIA now has desirable upgrade options for mid-range and high-end gamers.</p>

<p>But what of the new RTX 4070 Ti? It's stuck right between its two siblings, with no clear audience. After all, if you're ready to spend $799 on a video card, stretching a bit more for the 4080 Super might make more sense for the additional power. Otherwise, you might as well just get the 4070 Super, overclock it a bit, and spend the extra $200 on another SSD or more RAM. It's a conundrum entirely of NVIDIA's making, one that might have been solved by giving the 4070 Ti

<p>Samsung’s Galaxy S24 phones are all about AI, but how do they compare against Google’s AI tech? This week, Cherlynn and Devindra discuss what works and doesn’t about Samsung’s ambitious new smartphones, and why it may be a good thing for the Korean giant to directly compete with Google. Also, Senior Editor Karissa Bell joins to discuss the social media CEO Senate hearing, which, unsurprisingly, doesn’t really amount to much.</p>

## The Morning After: The FCC wants to make AI-voiced robocalls illegal

<p>AI-generated voices mimicking celebrities and politicians are making it harder for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to fight robocalls. FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel wants the commission to recognize calls that use AI-generated voices as artificial, making the use of voice cloning technologies in robocalls <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-fcc-wants-to-make-robocalls-that-use-ai-generated-voices-illegal-105628839.html">illegal</a>.</p>
<p>Under the FCC’s Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), artificial voice or recording calls to residences are against the law. If AI-generated voice calls are recognized as illegal under the existing law, it’ll give state attorneys general offices nationwide “new tools” to crack down on scammers.</p>
<p>The FCC’s proposal comes shortly after some New Hampshire residents received a call impersonating President Joe Biden, telling them not to vote in their state’s primary. A security firm performed a thorough analysis of the
