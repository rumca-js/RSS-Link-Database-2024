Over the past few weeks the internet has debated whether Xbox is going multiplatform, putting exclusives on PlayStation, leaving the console business forever, ending game pass, or any number of scenarios in between.

I decided to wait a bit to see how this panned out before making a video, and I’m glad I did.

Because to be honest I feel we’ve been left with more questions than answers.

Seemingly.

All the pieces are in place to figure out what happens to beloved franchises like “halo” and “the elder scrolls” and such.

Now it’s to me, a largely unqualified cartoon cat, to dig through this mess.
