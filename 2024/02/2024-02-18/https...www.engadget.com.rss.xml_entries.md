<p>The Biden administration plans to loosen the limits on tailpipe emissions proposed last year by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), giving automakers more time before they‚Äôll be required to sell significantly more electric vehicles than gas-powered cars, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/climate/biden-epa-auto-emissions.html#:~:text=In%20a%20concession%20to%20automakers,according%20to%20three%20people%20familiar"><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a> reported this weekend.
