another, and not least a game like Harold Halibut, which wears its influences openly - stop-motion, Wallace and Gromit-style Aardman animations, mixed with maybe a bit of Wes Anderson and in all seriousness, Postman Pat - but which also so clearly deserves to be seen as its own thing.</p><p>In this case though it's hard to ignore: the setup for Harold Halibut is very similar to First Contact, arguably the most interesting mission in Starfield (and one itself heavily influenced by a Star Trek: The Next Generation episode called The Neutral Zone), where - spoilers! - you discover a seemingly alien ship lurking in a planet's orbit, emitting weird garbled noises over the radio. You soon discover this is actually a ship from Earth - only one that's taken several hundred years to actually", "permanent": false, "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "title": "Harold Halibut turns Starfield's best side quest into a vividly human world", "page_rating_votes": 0, "age": null, "date_published": "2024-02-18T10:00:00+00:00", "language": "en-gb", "dead": false, "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0}, {"link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/my-special-power-in-arco-is-running-away?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source_obj__id": 343, "comments": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/arco-tree.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "tags": [], "page_rating": 0, "vote": 0, "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/arco-tree.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>I will always have a soft spot for simultaneous turn-based games. These are the games, taking a cue from the likes of Frozen Synapse, in which I make my move in secret, my enemy makes their move in secret, and then both moves play out at once and there's nothing we can do about it. The pleasure of these games comes from intuiting your enemy's move and foiling it. The humour comes from failing to do that utterly.</p><p>Arco takes this idea and makes it sing. It feels a lot more real-time than these games often do. During a battle, I move a cursor around that highlights how far I can move, and I shift through options covering things like heal, shield, and various kinds of attacks. In the Steam Next Fest demo I've been playing, I'm often fighting frogs and bugs, and learning to anticipate when a frog is going to jump and try to squa", "permanent": false, "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "title": "My special power in Arco is running away", "page_rating_votes": 0, "age": null, "date_published": "2024-02-18T10:00:00+00:00", "language": "en-gb", "dead": false, "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0}]
