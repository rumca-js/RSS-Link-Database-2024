When he showed a trigger board to keep a USB power bank on for small projects, I thought: Great idea, but this could be done better! And it is a perfect excuse to tinker with the new ATtiny chips. He used a 50-year-old 555 timer IC, and I want to use the same size and a similar price modern chip because this chip lets us put some \u201cartificial\u201d intelligence into the project. During this journey, we will learn about a very useful chip family and discover some unknown behavior of power banks as well as a new fake sold on AliExpress.\n\nOne of my long-term Paterons has a job offer where you can apply your learned skills: A side job offering for electronic professionals, hobbyists, and enthusiasts to work on IoT-focused Embedded System development projects by Passiv Energie Groupe: https://bit.ly/3wcQaUc\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks", "permanent": false, "artist": "Andreas Spiess", "bookmarked": false, "title": "Use the very attractive new ATTINY chips for your projects", "page_rating_votes": 0, "age": null, "date_published": "2024-02-18T08:00:24+00:00", "language": null, "dead": false, "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0}]
