<p>The ornithologist Seán Ronayne’s all-consuming quest has made him an unlikely celebrity in Cork, and his passion for nature is raising awareness about the seriousness of Ireland’s ecological crisis</p><p>One of Seán Ronayne’s earliest memories is walking in the countryside near his home with his father. “I cried a lot as a child and I was hyperactive,” he says, “When I was three or four years old, my dad would take me out to calm me down. In the woods, he’d mimic the sound of the birds and ask me what they were. Looking back, I was trained to be an ornithologist almost from the pram. That’s really where it all started.”</p><p>As he grew older, Ronayne, who was something of a solitary child, would spend a lot of time at his kitchen window in Cobh, County Cork, peering through binoculars at the birds feeding in his garden and writing down their names in a notebook. At 14, he could identify most of the birds he saw by the sounds they made.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian

<p>Roast veg with a luxurious twist and a simple rice pud to soothe away winter’s woes</p><p>There is an earthy sweetness at the heart of root vegetables that is most successfully brought to the fore by a good roasting in a hot oven. The cut edges of woody carrots, fat parsnips and Jerusalem artichokes caramelise on the roasting tin, their insides fluff up and they develop a certain soothing quality. I need such food at the moment, feeling the dampness of winter working its way into my bones.</p><p>Earlier this week, I roasted a pan of carrots, parsnips, artichokes and beetroot, letting their edges brown in the heat, then served them on a soft mound of citrus-spiked cream of cannellini beans. A double whammy of starch, yes, but exactly what is called for right now. I spiced the toasted roots with cumin, coriander and cardamom to balance their sugary notes. There were no loud seasonings here, just a plate of quiet flavours to soften the blow of yet another cold, wet day.</p> <

<p>Pontins allegedly used names to compile a list of ‘undesirable guests’, while other appellations are lucrative brands. My advice is to withhold judgment</p><p>Every name tells a story. We assume we can guess someone’s background from their surnames. And sometimes we can. Last week, I was stopped outside London’s Liverpool Street station by a young man who wanted me to donate to a charity that helped teenagers in the city stay away from knife crime. He asked me my surname. I told him. “Nigerian?” he asked. I said: “Yes”. “Yoruba?” he further asked. I smiled and nodded. “<em>Bawo&nbsp;ni</em>?” he said, which in Yoruba means something like “How are you doing?”. This young man did not come from a Nigerian background. I was impressed enough to give him £20.</p><p>But names can also conceal. I recently met a man called Lee Elliot-Major. He is a professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter and used to be the chief executive of the educational charity the Sutton Trust

<p>Investors in one of the country’s ailing financial trusts have realised that the state may no longer always protect them</p><p>Wang Jin felt sure that he could invest in Sichuan Trust, an institution that was part of one of what he describes as the “four pillars” of China’s financial system: banks, securities, insurance and trusts.<strong> </strong>Promised a return on his investment of 8.3%, he handed over 1.6m yuan (£178,000) in 2019. “The trust had a state licence, so we believed in its integrity,” Wang (not his real name) recalls.</p><p>Unluckily for him, in May 2020, the company said that it would be unable to repay 20bn yuan of investments.

<p>As the National Gallery in London turns 200, we ask celebrated artists, including David Hockney, Cornelia Parker, Jesse Darling and Lubaina Himid, to pick the artwork from the collection that means most to them</p><p>The National Gallery in London celebrates its 200th anniversary this year, a fact that seems at first to have little bearing on the spell it casts on visitors, who come in search of paintings both much older and much younger than the institution itself. But its history is a part of its charm, its existence, like its capaciousness, a miracle in retrospect. What began with 38 paintings, bought by the government from a banker, John Julius Angerstein, is now a collection comprising 2,300 works of art. In its early days, the gallery had no formal collection policy, its acquisitions dictated by the somewhat dusty tastes of its trustees; and even after it did, resistance was never far away. The promise in 1906 of a number of Impressionist paintings by the Irish art d

<p>​British photographer Suki Dhanda ​e​xplored ​young Muslims developing their own identities in ​the early days after 9/11</p><p>Suki Dhanda, whose work has been a brilliant feature of the <em>Observer</em> for 25 years, took this photograph of teenage girls in Whitechapel, east London, in 2002. It is included in a new book, <em>Shining Lights</em>, celebrating the work of Black female photographers in Britain. The picture was originally part of a series commissioned by the British Council focusing on ideas of community. Dhanda had already been working on a project with Bengali girls and used the commission to extend that work. The girls in the picture reminded her, she says, of the competing pressures she’d experienced growing up in Slough, with Indian heritage, to conform to both the expectations of her family, and the desire to be a British teenager no different from any other.</p><p>“I was looking at the life of this one girl in particular,” she says, “and how she devel

This must be the real foundation of any serious and original school of composition to be developed in the United States.” So wrote the Czech composer Antonín Dvořák, in an 1893 essay, a year after he had moved to America to teach at the newly created National Conservatory in New York.</p><p>Almost half a century later, a precocious Harvard student by the name of Leonard Bernstein wrote his undergraduate thesis on “<a href="https://archive.org/details/findings00bern/page/36/mode/2up?q=race+elements">The Absorption of Race Elements into American Music</a>”.

<p>This extraordinary true story of a couple lost at sea for 117 days in the 1970s is beautifully retold as an account of the rituals that sustain relationships</p><p>There was a time in the 1970s when daydreams of escape from suburban Britain seemed often to drift towards intrepid sea voyages. Thor Heyerdahl’s televised rafting adventures had something to do with it, and Francis Chichester’s fabled circumnavigation; those adventures stirred a salty restlessness in a generation of men who had grown up with the war stories of fathers and grandfathers and felt the need, in midlife, for tales of their own. One such individual was Maurice Bailey, a hot-metal typesetter from Derby. Bailey, a shy and awkward man, survivor of a miserable childhood, found love for the first time at 30, when he married Maralyn Harrison in 1963. Nearly a decade later, at a time when Britain had elected a yachtsman, Ted Heath, as prime minister, the Baileys abandoned their bungalow and their camping hol
