From Call of Duty and Battlefield to Ready or Not and Squad, there are few weapons in gaming that have been as divisive, or as rage inducing, as the grenade launcher. Games have had a fractured relationship with the grenade launcher, so often struggling to balance the weapon while also wrestling with the fact that an under barrel force multiplier can add a lot of excitement to a virtual firefight. 

With the help of Keeper of Firearms & Artillery, Jonathan Ferguson at the Royal Armouries museum in the UK, we dive into the weaponâ€™s history, and explore how it has influenced gaming and pop culture, all so we can answer the question, have games been getting the grenade launcher all wrong?

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson to chat about how games and pop culture have been getting the grenade launcher wrong.
