Frequent viewers know that I like GreatScott's channel because he greatly develops people’s interest in electronics. When he showed a trigger board to keep a USB power bank on for small projects, I thought: Great idea, but this could be done better! And it is a perfect excuse to tinker with the new ATtiny chips. He used a 50-year-old 555 timer IC, and I want to use the same size and a similar price modern chip because this chip lets us put some “artificial” intelligence into the project. During this journey, we will learn about a very useful chip family and discover some unknown behavior of power banks as well as a new fake sold on AliExpress.
