<p>The workers involved in the 1984 strike that changed Britain for ever get to have their say – without spin. It’s a lively, gripping tale that ranges from jollity and humour to heart-stopping tales</p><p>Miners’ Strike: A Frontline Story opens with a cliche. Like almost every oral-history documentary these days, we start with an outtake – an interviewee preparing to be interviewed, chatting casually with the film-makers as lights are set and cameras adjusted. “Let’s crack on,” says former South Yorkshire miner Dave Roper. But as Roper moves on to talking about why he has decided to participate, he says something that is not incidental at all. “My history [with the] media, especially the BBC, is they tend to twist what we say … it’s all about what they want, not what I want to put across.”</p><p>This programme puts that right. A Frontline Story lets miners tell the long tale of the 1984 strike, and they leave us in no doubt as to why the dispute occurred or how the result of

It’s a plaintive, echoing wail of fear in that big empty forest where no one is around to hear a falling tree; fear of climate catastrophe, fear of the ongoing environmental destruction in which we don’t even fully know what’s getting destroyed; fear of humanity’s own extinction.</p><p>And as the movie begins, maybe humanity is already extinguished.

<p>The bottom line from a suitably intense, frayed and sometimes alarmingly open encounter is that the good news keeps coming for Manchester United. This was their fourth league win in a row and it offered the latest confirmation that, in Rasmus Højlund, they have found a striker worthy of the handsome investment paid to Atalanta last summer. When the Dane converted twice in the first seven minutes, becoming the youngest player to score in six successive Premier League games, United appeared to have laid the platform for a straightforward evening.</p><p>It is to Luton’s huge credit, and a reflection of the lessons Erik ten Hag’s side must still learn, that no such thing materialised. They hit back through Carlton Morris and such was their ambition and application thereafter that nobody could have complained if Ross Barkley’s header had looped in, rather than clipping the crossbar, for a sensational equaliser in the final minute of added time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguard

<p>Lars Eidinger plays the man embarking on a major orchestral project, but whose professional status is threatened by family turmoil behind the scenes</p><p>Matthias Glasner’s epic is a black comedy of Franzenesque family dysfunction; maybe not profound exactly but terrifically watchable and entertaining. It is about the time-honoured subject of what we inherit from our parents and what is gained and lost by rejecting that inheritance. The film features that always formidable German actor Lars Eidinger as an orchestra conductor - and it will be no surprise that when he takes to the podium at the Berlin Philharmonic, it is the scene of the biggest and most embarrassing fiasco since Cate Blanchett’s fierce creation Lydia Tár had her own meltdown on the exact same spot two years ago.</p><p>Eidinger plays Tom, an emotionally withdrawn figure about to embark on the most serious project of his career.

<p>A fabulous family history expands into an account of the origins of Zionism and the extraordinary project to bring thousands of Russian Jews to Texas</p><p>When she started work on this fabulous book about her family, Rachel Cockerell was most intrigued by her grandmother Fanny and great aunt Sonia, who “raised [seven] children together in a giant, Edwardian north London house in the 1940s”. She envisaged only a few sentences about their father, David Jochelmann, who brought them over from Kyiv at the start of the first world war and lived in the same house until he died in 1941. But although the family remembered him only as a “businessman”, research soon revealed a fascinating backstory – a strange and largely forgotten project that saw about 10,000 Russian Jews set sail for Texas in the years between 1907 and 1914.</p><p>The Viennese journalist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/apr/05/antisemitic-attacks-hungary-israel">Theodor Herzl</a> fou

<p>The prodigious output of the great biographer and novelist, now 74, shows no sign of slowing. With distractions such as booze long abandoned, the ‘monkish’ figure has now produced a history of the English soul, and declares himself ‘eager to go on’ </p><p>The last time I sat down with Peter Ackroyd to talk about the idea of England was over a very long dinner, involving, at his cheerfully belligerent insistence, four bottles of wine, bookended by several rounds of whisky and brandy. That evening, 25 years ago, ended with the biographer of Charles Dickens and William Blake lying flat out on the cobble stones outside a restaurant in London’s Charterhouse Square, disputing the material reality of the moon, while repeating a demand to “take me home Timmy and tuck me up”, an invitation I declined.</p><p>When I arrived to resume that conversation a quarter of a century on, last Tuesday, Ackroyd recalled our previous encounter with a bit of a wince. “I think we did this before in

Everyday People in Nottingham is one of them. It was never meant to be a ramen bar. Chef Pete Hewitt, a 2015 <em>MasterChef</em> finalist, found his way to it, much as I imagine the questing find their way to God, and the flexible to Pilates. At first, he was all about Homeboys, a street-food operation knocking out massive flavours in handheld portions: confit duck doughnuts, stacked burgers, and chicken wings glazed with sweet, sticky sauces. In 2019, Homeboys won the <a href="https://europeanstreetfood.com/">European Street Food championship</a> in Sweden with their nuggets o

<p>Looking for a classic Iberian wine? Try the New World to see how these Spanish grapes thrive away from their homeland</p><p><strong>Stanton &amp; Kileen Arinto, Rutherglen, Victoria, Australia 2022 (from £16.50, <a href="https://vinewhisperer.uk/">vinewhisperer.uk</a>; <a href="https://swines.co.uk/">swines.co.uk</a>) </strong>Are French grape varieties just innately better than those with origins in other countries? That’s the question that inevitably comes to mind when you realise how many of the best wines made in the so-called New World are made with French varieties. Argentine malbec, New Zealand sauvignon blanc, Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon, Oregon pinot noir, South African chenin banc, Australian chardonnay etc, etc, and very much etc. The question came up again as I was tasting my way round the assembled offerings put together by the UK’s Australian wine importers at a recent tasting in London: so much of the good Australian stuff is built on French foundations,

<p>England’s state schools are desperate for money. Labour is right to say that their private counterparts should be treated as businesses</p><p>Anyone still unconvinced of the rightness of Labour’s policy on private school funding needs only to read last week’s front-page article (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/feb/10/teachers-facing-redundancy-as-record-number-of-english-schools-fall-into-deficit">Teachers axed as schools in debt hits record</a>”), which painted a hugely depressing picture of the state of England’s maintained schools. A&nbsp;rapidly growing proportion is facing increased numbers of children in need of special educational and mental health support, while simultaneously being forced by budget cuts to make teachers and support staff redundant. Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, reported primary class sizes now to be the highest in Europe and secondary ones the highest in almost 50 years.</p><p>When Finland,
