<p>Liverpool manager may be more loved at end of his time but no elite coach will come close to emulating 22 years at single club</p><p>Arsène Wenger grew up a devout Catholic, attended mass every day and often when it came to confession he had long forgotten the various misdemeanours he had committed over the course of the week. So he started making up sins, just so he would have something to confess. “You’re never completely happy because you never do well enough,” he told the BBC’s <em>Desert Island Discs</em> in 2020. “You feel always a bit guilty because the Catholic religion is like that.”</p><p>For Wenger, the man and the coach, the endless search for an unachievable perfection would come to define his life. We are reminded that the word “passion” derives from the Latin <em>patior</em>, meaning “suffering”. His passion for football was a Christian passion, the passion of wounded sides and dried blood, of giving something up now (mortal life/time and effort/the opportun

<p>Former world champions have switched to the Scuderia before but only Fangio and Schumacher have prospered at Maranello</p><p>Enzo Ferrari liked his English drivers. In 1958 the bow-tied Mike Hawthorn became the team’s third world champion. John Surtees won the title in 1964, ending a period of internal turmoil. When Ferrari died in 1988, aged 90, he had just signed up Nigel Mansell for the following season. He liked Mansell’s aggression, his competitive spirit. He would surely have appreciated Lewis Hamilton, too.</p><p>As Hamilton pointed out while the ground was still shaking from Thursday’s sudden announcement that he will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/01/lewis-hamilton-poised-shock-ferrari-switch-2025-mercedes-f1">join the Scuderia Ferrari in 2025</a>, he already knows about driving cars from Maranello.

Maybe a bit amused before a dulling, familiar sense of ennui set in? Mildly intrigued, with a big dollop of feeling like we have been here before, is perhaps the best way to sum up an England performance that left them scoring fewer than 30 points against Italy for the first time in 11 years, but left you clinging to the odd flicker they were able to produce before curbing their enthusiasm and numbing that of the supporters they so want to connect with.</p><p>The bar is pretty low when a willingness to pass, to avoid kicking the ball at every opportunity, to avoid a performance that is gutsy, defiant and all the other words to describe things that should be prerequisites at this level, is noteworthy. But there was something a little different to England in the odd spell here. Something that made you raise the eyebrow eve

<p>The Swedish artist Christopher Robin Nordström had wanted to visit Tokyo since he was a child and, when he finally went in 2018, he loved it. “If you like <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em>, Tokyo is as close as you get,” he says, “but I was really struck by how small the city felt, especially the houses with not more than 40 sq metres of living space.” At the time he was looking for a “kitchen-table hobby”. So he decided to recreate Tokyo’s houses in intricate miniature – a scale of 1:20 – with rust stains, broken gutters, electricity meters and all. “Overlooked architecture is extra interesting,” he says. “These are houses with lots of stories. They have personality, scars from their lives.”</p><ul><li>See more at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tokyobuild/">instagram.com/tokyobuild</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2024/feb/03/lovingly-reconstructed-miniatures-of-tokyo-houses-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

Kramer was so horrified, he tore the magazine up and flushed it down the nearest toilet.</p><p>He was in a federal prison in Kentucky, serving a four-year sentence for drug offences and, as he put it, “from where I was sat, ‘punk’ did not have a good ring to it”. “In jail, a punk is somebody that they knock down and make their girlfriend, you know: ‘I’m gonna make you my punk’,” he recalled. “That kind of talk could get you killed, right?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/feb/03/wayne-kramer-mc5-complex-and-influentia

<ul><li>Italy 24-27 England</li><li>Hosts have half-time lead but Mitchell’s try proves vital</li></ul><p>For the first time in five attempts since 2019 England have managed to win their opening Six Nations fixture. It did not come without the odd ripple of early alarm, particularly when Italy established a 17-8 lead in the first half, but tries from Elliot Daly and Alex Mitchell plus 17 points from George Ford’s boot ultimately kickstarted what Steve Borthwick’s squad are hoping will be a more productive campaign.</p><p>No one would remotely describe the visitors’ performance as perfect, as the new captain, Jamie George, had warned in advance.

The struggles of the Birmingham-born singer-songwriter are, however, not much in evidence. Her voice is remarkable, the delivery of her songs more poised and their accompaniments richer – a blend of guitars (both picked and jangling), cello, violin, brass and synth overseen by producer Simon Weaver. That the record is less startling than its predecessor is down to a lack of the arresting imagery Priddy pulled out on early standouts such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq34LkghY38"

The report was damning about the culture of the first-class counties, describing “instances of violent and degrading behaviour” towards female staff. One witness reported being forced to lock herself in her office to avoid sexual harassment by the club’s male cricketers; another, being called “an ’effing butch” by a colleague after she raised the issue of gender equity in a meeting.</p><p>So goes county cricket in the 21st century.

The tone was sensible and brisk, and about as far from a turn-on as could be imagined.</p><p>Still, as far as the British authorities were concerned, the suggestion that married couples might want to have sex for any purpose other than making babies was downright obscene. The biggest fear, so horrible that it could barely be articulated in polite company, was that, armed with the wherewithal to avoid pregnancy, women might choose to steer clear of the drudgery of marriage while still enjoying “s

<p>Through an Auschwitz commandant’s family life, Jonathan Glazer’s chilling new film reminds us of the banality of evil</p><p>In a letter to his former student Hannah Arendt about the Nazi war crimes trials, written in October 1946, philosopher Karl Jaspers told her that he was uneasy with her view that the very boundaries of crime had been exploded by the Holocaust: that line of thinking might offer a streak of “satanic greatness” to the Nazis, a hint of “myth and legend”. “It seems to me that we have to see these things in their total banality, in their prosaic triviality, because that’s what truly characterises them,” he wrote. “Bacteria can cause epidemics that wipe out nations, but they remain merely bacteria.” His letter had an obvious influence on Arendt, and on the way terrible human actions have been considered ever since. Everyone knows her phrase “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/hannah-arendt-adolf-eichmann-banality-of-evil">the bana

But now I’m back – and I’m blown away</p><p>Joy is the city that surprises you – that was my verdict as I wrapped up a recent long weekend in Paris. More than a decade had passed since I’d first visited the French capital, and I can recall very little from that two-day sojourn, just scattered memories of intimidatingly dressed women shopping in Saint-Germain-des-Prés and a trip to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/notre-dame">Notre Dame Cathedral</a>, which remained clad in scaffolding because of the terrible 2019 fire.</p><p>Back then, Europe’s fabled city of romance was lost on me. I had no friends there to help unlock it and, fearing tourist traps, I was lazy about putting in the legwork to get to know its streets. I suspect my inertia was also down to the fact that Paris is so easy to reach from the UK that I could afford to “put it in the bank”.</p>
