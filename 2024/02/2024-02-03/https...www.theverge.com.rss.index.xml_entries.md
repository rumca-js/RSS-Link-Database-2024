  <p id="jDU6sO">If you spend $3,500 on a laptop, it’s a near guarantee you know exactly what you’re getting and you’re probably going to be happy with it. But you have to... think different when you spend that kind of money on a new platform like the Vision Pro, Apple’s “spatial computer” that does a lot of rethinking about how face computers should work. The Vision Pro subreddit is naturally offering a taste of how Apple’s vision is landing with people who decide to take the plunge.</p>

  <p id="JAbbTo">Once upon a time, I bought a Surface Pro only to return it less than a month later. At the time, I felt it was a niche device lacking the foundational integrity of an iPad or a MacBook. I’ve grown a newfound respect for the Surface Pro line with the maturing of Windows, however, and now find the 2-in-1 nicely occupies the middle ground between a tablet and laptop.

And so we have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24041198/google-circle-to-search-samsung-galaxy-multi-search-generative-ai">Circle to Search</a>, a new way of looking up information on mobile devices.</p>

  <p id="Axrf5m">Allegations that Tesla mishandled hazardous waste point to a systemic failure at the company’s California facilities. This was no simple accident or one-off event. </p>
<p id="SeQt76">No less than 25 counties sued Tesla this week for allegedly illegally disposing of hazardous waste. Within a couple days, the Elon Musk-led company agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle the suit that says the company “intentionally” and “negligently” disposed of materials that should have been handled with care.</p>
