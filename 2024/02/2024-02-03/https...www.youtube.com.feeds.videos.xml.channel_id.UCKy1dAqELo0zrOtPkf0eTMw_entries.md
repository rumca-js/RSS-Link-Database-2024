Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a superhero game saddled with an unusual amount of baggage. It may be the follow-up to 2015’s much-loved Batman: Arkham Knight, but it’s also a game that’s been subject to numerous delays and concerns over its live service elements and gameplay choices. It also happens to be the final DC game featuring the voice of Kevin Conroy as Batman. Now that the game is finally out in the wild, one thing has become abundantly clear. This is not the sendoff Rocksteady’s Dark Knight deserved. 

Why does Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League miss the mark where Batman is concerned? Let’s take a deep dive into where the game goes so wrong, but beware of full spoilers ahead for the new Suicide Squad game!

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is available now on Playstation 5, Xbox and PC.

## How GTA 6 Will Impact GTA Online | GTFM

Whether or not GTA 5 Online will still be relevant when GTA 6 releases is not in question. It will be. There’s thousands of players online, with countless businesses, jobs, heists, and unique things to do in GTA Online - so as long as #RockstarGames continues to support it, its relevance will remain intact. But I guess the primary question I have for you watching is ‘Will we still care about #GTAOnline when #GTA6 drops?’ And how likely is it that we’ll still see support from Rockstar? Back in July of 2022, Rockstar Games abandoned support of Red Dead Redemption 2’s online component, stating that it wanted to put more resources towards GTA 6. So is GTA Online set to go the same way as Red Dead Online, no longer being supported by Rockstar as it puts more efforts towards GTA 6? Will there be a significant dip in online players when GTA 6 releases, or will it be a gradual decline as the years progress post-launch of GTA 6? Those are just some of the questions we hope to answer i
