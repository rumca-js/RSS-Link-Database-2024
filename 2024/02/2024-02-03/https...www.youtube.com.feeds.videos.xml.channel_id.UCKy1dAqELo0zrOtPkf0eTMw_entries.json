It will be. There\u2019s thousands of players online, with countless businesses, jobs, heists, and unique things to do in GTA Online - so as long as #RockstarGames continues to support it, its relevance will remain intact. But I guess the primary question I have for you watching is \u2018Will we still care about #GTAOnline when #GTA6 drops?\u2019 And how likely is it that we\u2019ll still see support from Rockstar? Back in July of 2022, Rockstar Games abandoned support of Red Dead Redemption 2\u2019s online component, stating that it wanted to put more resources towards GTA 6. So is GTA Online set to go the same way as Red Dead Online, no longer being supported by Rockstar as it puts more efforts towards GTA 6? Will there be a significant dip in online players when GTA 6 releases, or will it be a gradual decline as the years progress post-launch of GTA 6?
