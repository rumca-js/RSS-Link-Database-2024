<ul><li>Two goals from Nathan Tella keep Bundesliga leaders on top</li><li>Barcelona ease to victory over Alavés but remain third in La Liga</li></ul><p><strong>Bayern Munich</strong> came from a goal down to beat <strong>Borussia Mönchengladbach</strong> 3-1 in the Bundesliga and stay on the heels of the leaders, Bayer Leverkusen, going into their meeting next week.</p><p>The Bavarians, who scored three times after Gladbach took a first-half lead, moved to 50 points in second place, two behind Leverkusen. The result also earned a new record for Bayern’s veteran attacking midfielder Thomas Müller, who notched his 500th victory in all competitions for the club, the first Bayern player to reach that mark.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/03/european-football-harry-kane-helps-bayern-put-pressure-on-leverkusen">Continue reading...</a>

## Diakité’s 120th-minute strike sinks Mali to send 10-man Ivory Coast into last four

<p>How often can a side flirt with elimination before they finally go out? Ivory Coast had played the entirety of the second half with 10 men, were 1-0 down and seemingly on their way out when, in the final minute of normal time, the substitute Simon Adingra darted in from the right flank, squared for Seko Fofana and then, after inadvertently blocking his teammate’s shot, reacted quickest to stab in the loose ball. Another great escape for the hosts, and the prelude to a last-gasp extra-time victory.</p><p>It may not make much rational sense, but Ivory Coast are in the semi-final, where they will face Democratic Republic of the Congo. If any side can stop them, they will have had to overcome not just a fine squad and the passionate home support, but also a sense of narrative momentum that, at the moment, feels unstoppable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/03/ivory-coast-mali-afcon-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jeffrey Wright excels as a struggling Black novelist who dashes off a blaxploitation potboiler and hits the jackpot in Cord Jefferson’s Oscar-nominated comedy drama</p><p>“I just think we should really be listening to Black voices right now,” says a white jury member during the debate for a prestigious literary prize, in a pivotal scene in Cord Jefferson’s <em>American Fiction</em>. The irony is that she and the other white jurors have just brushed aside the opinions of the two Black writers on the jury; the unspoken caveat is that the gatekeepers of American literature are happy to tune into Black voices, but only as long as they are saying the right thing. It’s a toe-curling depiction of tone-deaf sanctimony that is almost too bluntly on the nose. It’s to the credit of Jefferson, who makes his feature directing debut with this savvy, jazzy, Oscar-nominated satire, and to a never-better <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/25/jeffrey-wright-on-finally-being-

<p>Channel 4’s The Battle for Britain brings back memories of Sheffield in 1984, when we thought Arthur Scargill would be a neighbour</p><p>How strange and unnerving to find that television is now being made about times I can actually remember.

<p>Bowl food made easy: a crunchy winter salad with loads of zing from its gingery lemon dressing</p><p>You can take the girl out of Scunthorpe, but you can’t take Scunthorpe out of the girl. This is possibly why I didn’t latch on to the bowl food movement a decade ago, but I’ve since grown, both as a woman and as a food writer (not physically, mind; I am still only 5ft 2in), and these days I can see the benefits of being able to fashion delicious ingredients, some of them ready-made, such as kimchi and hummus, over grains and binding them all together with a lovely dressing. It’s very useful to have a template with which to create a delicious, nutritious meal using whatever you have in the fridge, so now I’m on board with the bowl.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/feb/03/vegan-roast-cauliflower-kimchi-couscous-salad-recipe-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘People said it did in his career’: 33 pictures that defined British politicians

<p>From the Bullingdon boys to a bacon sandwich; Margaret Thatcher in a tank to Theresa May dancing … these landmark images shaped how we saw our leaders</p><p>There’s a type of hard-boiled political operative who always has the TV on in the office – sometimes more than one – permanently set to the news channels and almost always with the sound turned down. You might think that’s because they need quiet to work, and should something of interest appear, they would turn the volume up. But that’s not quite right. This brand of political professional believes that, when it comes to watching news coverage, the sound is all but irrelevant. What registers with people – with <em>voters </em>– are the pictures.</p><p>Does the leader look strong and in command? Or weak and hesitant? Is the candidate smiling, brimming with confidence? Or brooding, head in hands? Do they look natural, at ease with ordinary people – or gauche and awkward, a visiting alien from Planet Politician? For any o
