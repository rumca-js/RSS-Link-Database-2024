But India’s government may have taken that conspiracy theory, which is a joke that no one believes, very seriously. It appears they have interrogated and detained an innocent pigeon whom they wrongfully suspected of espionage for eight months. </p><p>Fortunately, the bird has finally been cleared of all wrongdoing and has been released back to the sky after it was confirmed he was not planning a coo. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

Beau" off of <a href="https://twitter.com/TimJGraham/status/1753749535963160935" target="_blank">Tim Graham from Newsbusters</a>, because it's hilarious.</em></p><p>Biden finally found enough effort to make a phone call with the parents of one of the three soldiers killed in a drone strike last week. But rather than give his genuine condolences to the grieving family, he decided it was easier to once again, repeat his false claim that his son Beau died in Iraq.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
