		Big money biometrics deals returned to the headlines this week on <em>Biometric Update</em>, and along with emerging applications provide encouraging signs for the market. A project to use Wicket’s biometric software at the Australian Open could expand next year, and a sobering report from Trust Stamp includes the seeds of a future growth area. A little further down the maturity curve, Incognia is the latest to raise millions to fuel further growth. Capping the investment, Vision-Box is the industry’s latest major acquisition, with Amadeus investing hundreds of millions of Euros.  ID card chips were also in the headlines, including a new scanning test kit from Regula.
