13:30 for the timestamp where he talks about the PSP3/Vita 2


So normally I don't dive into rumors like this, but the prospect of a new Sony handheld is just too interesting for me to not talk about.

The idea that Sony could make a new PSP, or PSVita, (and not just another PlayStation Portal), is admittedly quite exciting.

So today I want to talk about how this could work, why I think Sony is going to do this, and what it could mean for a potential next generation PlayStation 6.
