<p>According to a document leaked on <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/evowizz/status/1753795479543132248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1753795479543132248%7Ctwgr%5E3417705a555a087adbc511897b5737d391cbb224%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2024%2F02%2F03%2Fgoogle-bard-gemini-rebrand-android-app-date%2F"><ins>X</ins></a>, Google is planning to introduce some major changes to its Bard AI tool as soon as this coming week. The plans, which have not been publicly confirmed, reportedly include changing the Bard name to Gemini. It would make sense for Google to do so, if only for simplicity’s sake — the company introduced its <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-answer-to-gpt-4-is-gemini-the-most-capable-model-weve-ever-built-150039571.html">new multimodal AI model, Gemini</a>, at the end of 2023 and has begun integrating it into some of its products, including Bard.</p>

<p>Apple released a new <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213998"><ins>support document</ins></a> for the Vision Pro on Friday night, and it clarifies which accessories will — and won’t — work with the headset. While Apple says it is compatible with “most” Bluetooth keyboards, including its own and other manufacturers’, the Vision Pro doesn’t support Bluetooth mice. Vision Pro owners will be to use Apple’s Magic Trackpad, though.</p>
<p>Apple Vision Pro officially hit shelves yesterday, and there are hundreds of <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/here-are-the-most-useful-apple-vision-pro-apps-at-launch-222817206.html"><ins>apps for productivity and entertainment</ins></a> available at launch. With eye and hand tracking for precision navigation and controls, there isn’t necessarily a <em>need</em> for a mouse, but some people probably would have liked to use one for certain tasks. However, it is compatible with plenty

<p>Following failed negotiations with TikTok, Universal music has come good on its threat to pull music from the social media platform. That means <a href="https://www.engadget.com/taylor-swift-and-other-universal-music-tracks-are-disappearing-from-tiktok-134536998.html">no more TayTay</a>, no more Drake and no more... all the other artists that fall under its corporate umbrella.  Elsewhere, the CEOs of the world's most influential social media platforms got an (at times) genuine <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-tells-social-media-ceos-they-have-blood-on-their-hands-for-failing-to-protect-children-170411884.html">grilling</a> from the US Senate. While a few senators managed to come across as, once again, out of touch and out of their depth. X boss Linda Yaccarino might have said the most bizarre thing, stating that the once-Twitter social network was a &quot;brand new company,&quot; and that it was looking into parental controls. Twitter was founded in 2006, Linda.&nb

<p>New Yorkers can say goodbye — for now — to the robot the New York Police Department (NYPD) used to patrol the Times Square subway station. The Knightscope K5, which is a 400-pound machine that looks like it could be R2-D2's massive sibling, was one of Mayor Eric Adams' high-tech experiments for New York City. It was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/an-nypd-security-robot-will-be-patrolling-the-times-square-subway-station-130029937.html">deployed in a pilot last year</a> ostensibly to help keep commuters safe, but it had no actual capabilities that could be useful in situations that had to be addressed on site. &quot;The K5 Knightscope has completed its pilot in the NYC subway system,&quot; a spokesperson for the department told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/nyregion/nypd-subway-robot-retires.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The K5 has cameras that can record video and a button that people can press to get in touch with a live agent. It pat
