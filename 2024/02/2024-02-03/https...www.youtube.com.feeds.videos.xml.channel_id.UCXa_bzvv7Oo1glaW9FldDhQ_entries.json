The cast turns in solid performances, and the cutscenes are well-animated, even as the story goes off the rails. \n\nThere's even some fun loot to earn, and once you get the hang of the traversal, the gameplay isn't half-bad. However, those expecting a well-rounded story with a satisfying conclusion - or smooth segue into post-launch seasons - will be disappointed. Those hoping for a hefty endgame with fresh, fulfilling activities will also be left wanting. \n\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League isn't the worst game ever made, but it's a massive step down for Rocksteady and a reminder, once again, of the perils of live service.", "vote": 0}]
