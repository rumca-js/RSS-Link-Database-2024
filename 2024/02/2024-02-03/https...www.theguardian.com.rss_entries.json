It has an interesting history and has four phases of development historically \u2013 the original 16th-century farmhouse, an 18th-century coaching inn, and a 19th-century court room area and taproom bar. A lot of stone from the Roman fort behind the farm has been reused in building our farmstead.</p><p>In the spirit of sustainability, we have tried to source materials \u2013 and builders \u2013 as locally as possible. The oak came from our own woodlands and was processed in a sawmill in the Westmorland Dales. The lime plasterers live approximately three miles away, and are some of our nearest neighbours.
