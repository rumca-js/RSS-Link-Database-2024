<p>When Liverpool won the corner towards the very end of extra-time that would prove decisive, Jürgen Klopp applauded and just found himself smiling at the romance of it all. Depleted by a host of injuries and collecting more here, other ­players running on fumes, the manager had introduced a clutch of untested youngsters. But here his team were, fighting until the last breath. It was Liverpool who found the purpose and clarity in the extra period.</p><p>Klopp’s scriptwriter had something left, the detail to ignite his quest to collect four more trophies before he rides off into the sunset at the end of the season. The substitute Kostas Tsimikas swung over the kick and there was Virgil van Dijk, ­stealing away from Axel Disasi, to glance home with his head. The Liverpool captain had seen a header ruled out on the hour after a lengthy VAR intervention. There would be no denying him or his team on this occasion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/25/chel

<p>When Gary O’Neil arrived at Wolves four days before the start of the Premier League after Julen Lopetegui’s shock resignation, many were expecting Molineux to be the stage for a lengthy battle for survival. Wolves have, however, confounded expectations, securing their 11th win of the season - a tally no team has been relegated with in a 38-game season - thanks to Pablo Sarabia’s goal against a feisty Sheffield United.</p><p>Relegation is an inevitability for Chris Wilder’s side after a 19th defeat of the season. They had more than enough chances to secure a point but were unable to take any and most notable involvement saw a VAR review for a red card after teammates Jack Robinson and Vinícius Souza clashed, resulting in them rutting heads before pushing and shoving.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/25/wolves-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Where is the focus, calm and happiness I was promised?</p><p>I am living minimally for February – not a Veganuary sequel, just poor planning for my month in the US. Our last-minute Airbnb is exceptionally spartan: I suspect Scandinavia has better-equipped prison cells. There are three forks, two pans, a single teaspoon; there is barely any furniture and no decoration, except a handful of pastel canvas squares with “live, laugh, love”-style slogans and the largest TV I have ever seen. I’m using a breadboard as a desk (there is a table, but the breadboard office proved more comfortable).

<p>As creatures of comfort we rarely court hardships, but Lent gives us an opportunity to give something up for a greater outcome</p><p>I’ve been a Christian for 20 years but have only just discovered the church season of Lent, the six weeks or so in the lead-up to Good Friday, Easter Saturday, and Easter Sunday. Now, with the annoying zeal of a new convert, I’m convinced whether believer or agnostic, we’d all be better off leaning into the season.</p><p>As a society, we are already halfway converted. Familiar events in the annual calendar, like Movember, are Lent-like in their emphasis on giving up something, or focusing our collective efforts, in pursuit of a greater good. Feb Fast is a prompt to reset after the excess of Christmas, Dry July a mid-year pause to abstain from alcohol. Each event is time-bound and concentrated on a positive goal. When deployed like this, the argument goes, peer pressure is actually very good.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisf

<p>Nordic children are out in nature for hours a day – and they top rankings in both education and happiness. So here are seven parenting tips I’ve picked up along the way…</p><p>I knew I was in trouble the day my pre-schooler came home smelling of woodsmoke and told me he’d been practising “knife skills”. When his twin siblings requested a saw for their second birthday, I realised I’d crossed the Rubicon: I’d become an accidental mother of Vikings. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. I relocated from London to Denmark, carefree and childless, but despite planning on staying just a year I’m still here a&nbsp;decade and three children later. So I have skin in the Viking game. And Nordic children do things differently. They eat differently, learn differently, play, dress, even sleep differently – with babies left to nap outside in their prams in sub-zero temperatures. They sing, fight, climb, fall and get up again. They are out in nature for hours a day – despite the fact that

Of course, that is the easiest and most acceptable register in which to consider unthinkable violence: as a geopolitical problem happening at a far distance. But Russia’s aggression is an event of shocking magnitude in every individual life in Ukraine, and in lives elsewhere, too. The war is not only happening on the frontline but in homes and hearts. Deaths are mourned. Lives that were once straightforward have been propelled into directions that were never sought or wanted. Ambitions have been abandoned and plans have been cast aside. The war has crept like a mist into every chink of domestic life, into the tender, tremulous matters of love and sex, into the school day where cheerful young Ukrainian kids, alongside maths and English, g

<p>Head to Danieli, in Richmond, for the perfect cup</p><p>I am in London. I could either stay and write chapter one of my book or run away and go and do something, anything else. I opt, like all good writers, for the latter. So I take the tube to Richmond, having texted my friend, Natalie, in the meantime to join and enable me in my bunking-off. But there is purpose: a trip to what’s been described as the best hot chocolate in London.</p><p>Now, for a central London girl such as I was, Richmond barely counts as London (anything Zone 2 is suburbs to me), but that’s a compliment not a slight.

<p>A bereaved man’s unhealthy obsessions are upended by a dying artist in the Iranian-American poet’s kaleidoscopic debut novel</p><p>Cyrus Shams really doesn’t have much going for him. He is a barely recovering alcoholic and unpublished Iranian-American poet who scratches a living in Indiana by role-playing terminal patients for trainee doctors. His mother was blown out of the sky by the US navy – and even his name sounds like a criticism. Hardly surprising, then, that he would channel his search for meaning into a much-planned but largely unwritten book on martyrdom.</p><p>His mother was one of the 290 on board Iran Air flight 655 when the USS Vincennes fired at what they believed to be a jet fighter, and Cyrus needs her death to “matter”, to be more than a number. He wants her to have been a martyr and also craves that state for himself – a chance to still the “doom organ… throbbing in his throat”.</p><p><em>Martyr!</em> by Kaveh Akbar is published by Picador (£16.99).

Winstone is 67 now. In real life he resembles the characters he has spent a career perpetuating on screen. He maintains the east London accent he developed in childhood. He swears gruffly and nonstop. He chuckles at calling people “fuckers”. It would surprise no one if he were voted film and television’s most specific brand. When, partway through our discussion, I ask if he’s ever troubled by people considering him professionally one-dimensional, he replies, “Not one fucking bit – you typecast yourself.” Then, showing off a bawdy sense of humour that is never far from the surface, he adds,

It’s a solitary life. Hirayama can go days saying no more than a few cursory words. If members of the public notice him, they largely view him as an inconvenience. But mostly they don’t even see him.

<p>An insightful and illuminating biography of Keir Starmer is revelatory about the challenging childhood that shaped his character while acknowledging the fact that he remains hard to pin down</p><p>A cheap trick of opinion pollsters is to ask focus groups of voters to guess the favourite drink of a political leader. In the case of Sir Keir Starmer, respondents sometimes wrongly assume that his tipple has to be a gin and tonic when he is actually far more fond of a pint of real ale. Some voters are even under the misapprehension that his background is so posh that the knighthood is hereditary.</p><p>As Tom Baldwin points out in this highly informative, illuminating and insightful biography, this is one of the many paradoxes about his subject.

<p>The Slovakian photographer’s image of a girl holding aloft a bird captures the natural bond between the semi-nomadic people and their desert landscape</p><p>For three years from October 2019, the Slovakian photographer Petra Bašnáková lived with and documented the lives of Palestinian Bedouins, who for thousands of years have led a semi-nomadic life in the Judean desert between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea. After 1948 and the creation of Israel, much of that territory was incorporated into the West Bank, and the Bedouin were increasingly threatened and marginalised. Today, as Bašnáková writes in the introduction to <em>Born of Sand and Sun</em>, her book of the photographs she took in the desert, despite “military raids, the demolition of dwellings, bans on grazing goats and much more…” the Bedouins have not broken “the strong bond with the heart of their culture in the vast desert”.

<p>Artists, writers and film-makers have been inspired by the stories – and myths – of the 1984-5 strike for four decades. But how do those most affected by its legacy feel about the portrayals, from Brassed Off to Sherwood?</p><p>In last week’s BBC documentary <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001wm1x">Miners’ Strike: </a></em><em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001wm1x">A Frontline Story</a></em>, some of the history was inevitably told by those who were only coming of age in 1984. One of those was Lisa McKenzie, the daughter and granddaughter and great-granddaughter of Nottinghamshire miners, who turned 16 on the first day of the strike. Among other memories, McKenzie, now 55, recalled with a grin the time when a group calling themselves the Cambridge University Feminist Players had got in touch, back then, and wanted to come and do a play for the women of the pit village, in a show of solidarity.</p><p>When the students arrived they insisted that o

<p>Only regulation will stop fast food firms churning out products we are evolutionarily hardwired to find it difficult to resist</p><p>The 1970s was a confusing decade in which to be a smoker.

But despite government education programmes, hiked taxes and restrictions in selling to children, these warnings hadn’t fully permeated the atmosphere.</p><p>How could they? Daily life bathed&nbsp;the brain in the idea that smoking was fine.
