After the final whistle, social media videos captured Ronaldo cupping his ear before repeatedly pumping his hand forward in front of his pelvic area. The action appeared to be directed at Al-Shabab supporters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/25/cristiano-ronaldo-in-obscene-gesture-storm-after-al-nassr-victory">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This new series about the noises of nature has the perfect narrator. But the dubious audio choices (silence? frequencies inaudible to the human ear?) rob the show of some majesty</p><p>What is the sound of the natural world? For several generations of us, the answer is David Attenborough’s voice, its whispering lilt sing-songing upwards for cuteness and swooping down again for the drama of the hunt – or in more recent years, taking on a grain of anguish as it urges us to conserve what wildlife we have left. The best pictures that the cameras of the time can muster, backed by the sound of Attenborough: this is nature as we have known it for decades.</p><p>So there can be only one narrator for Sky Nature’s new series Secret World of Sound, a natural history show in which the audio is more important than the pictures. In between Attenborough’s words, we are invited to listen more closely than we have before, and with the benefit of better sound equipment than has previously e

<p><strong>Hackney Empire, London<br /></strong>Jude Christian’s staging for English Touring Opera is colourful and imaginative but lacks critical chemistry and coherence</p><p>The thing you really, really need to know about Manon Lescaut before the curtain goes up on English Touring Opera’s new production is that the heroine of Puccini’s opera is going to die of thirst. That idea does a lot of heavy lifting in Jude Christian’s staging. Designed by Charlotte Henery, act one opens in an empty swimming pool with water coolers standing like sentinels around the edge. In act two, the newly sugar-daddied Manon relaxes in a padded pink bath while watching images of splashing liquid on TV. In the final scene, with Manon and her equally doomed lover exiled in the Louisiana desert, it’s almost inevitable that Des Grieux will be flinging empty water-cooler canisters around in ridiculous despair.</p><p>Another thing to pay attention to at curtain-up is the sleeping figure slumped over a

<p>Stage and screen actor best known for playing the bombastic butcher Fred Elliott in Coronation Street</p><p>John Savident, who has died aged 86, was a skilled, colourful, sometimes broad but always memorable actor who played one of TV’s best loved soap opera characters – the bombastic but lovable butcher Fred Elliott in the ITV series Coronation Street – for more than a decade.</p><p>Fred, who first appeared in 1994 and became a regular two years later, was soon a favourite with viewers, thanks in part to the enjoyably imitable repetitive vocal tic that Savident invested him with: “Ashley, I say, Ashley,” he would utter when addressing his young nephew (later revealed to be his son), Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/25/john-savident-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A minister learns to communicate with the only inhabitant of his remote new island home in this memorable novel</p><p>It’s 1843, and along with hundreds of his fellow ministers, Reverend John Ferguson has broken away from the Church of Scotland to form a new denomination. His zeal is dented only by the worldly question of how he and his wife, Mary, are to survive without his stipend, which is why he agrees to sail to a tiny island halfway to Norway. Dispatched with scanty provisions and a pistol, he must inform its lone inhabitant, a crofter named Ivar, that he’s to be evicted as part of the Highland Clearances.</p><p>So begins Carys Davies’s third novel, <em>Clear</em>. But while the story is set in motion by two mighty upheavals in Scottish history, the book’s driving source of fascination – language itself – is revealed only once John reaches the island.</p><p><em>Clear</em> by Carys Davies is published by Granta (£12.99).

<p>Patients I’ve spoken to in the east of England were desperate for help, with dangerously low BMIs. On what possible grounds were they discharged?</p><p>Last week, I had a long conversation with a woman who is trying desperately to loosen the awful grip of an eating disorder. She wanted to remain anonymous; for the sake of this article, I’ll call her Jane. She is in her 30s and lives in Norfolk. Her illness, first diagnosed when she was a teenager, is known as the restricting type of anorexia, meaning that she has a long history of drastically limiting her food intake to the point of self-starvation.</p><p>Over the past 10 years or so, she has spent some of her time as an NHS inpatient. She told me about her first stay in a specialist ward, where there was “a massive turnover of staff.

<p>A strange and beautiful novel from a first-time author who skilfully wields mystery and unease </p><p>Appropriately enough, <em>Meet Me at the Surface</em>, an electrifying debut from Manchester-based but Cornish-born Jodie Matthews, dives deep. Heavily influenced by her place of birth, and in particular its folklore, the author plunges us into a twilight world of whispered secrets and otherworldly goings-on. Characters – some human, some quite possibly not – rise to the surface of the narrative then fall beneath, their shifting motives always remaining tantalisingly out of reach. Above all hovers the enigmatic Pedri – a strange word in a notebook that might refer to any number of things, none of them good – and in the middle of everything is Bodmin’s murky, mysterious lake, Dozmary Pool.</p><p>Anchoring us throughout is Merryn, who having escaped Bodmin Moor a year previously returns to its wilds for the memorial service of ex-girlfriend Claud.

It took 10 minutes to get past it, a testament both to its size and the dysfunctional nature of the nation’s motorway network. It looks horrible because, by convention, we don’t tend to beautify warehouses. Victorian ones can become beautiful as the passing decades apply a patina of post-industrial glamour – then they can be converted into desirable flats. It remains to be seen whether the warehouses we throw up these days will ever acquire an inhabitable ambience. But regardless of era, at time of building, nobody ever cares.</p><p>Not like cathedrals.

Campaigners stuck little flags with similar messages aimed at getting dog poo off streets and public play areas. In many ways it was a successful campaign. There’s now widespread consciousness of the dangers to children of toxocara disease c

<p>Homespun recipes for glowing skin and sleek hair</p><p>Bollywood sirens are the gold standard for smouldering Indian beauty. Their glowing skin and silken tresses are often down to brightening face masks or nourishing hair conditioners whipped up at home using recipes passed down the generations. My own grandmother’s recipe for brightening skin is a mix of yoghurt, gram flour and turmeric stirred into a paste and applied over the face for 20 minutes before washing off. These ready-made potions from a hydrating face serum with saffron to a brow oil that has cult status are inspired by the wisdom of the founders’ mothers and grandmothers.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Kama Ayurveda Kumkumadi Revitalising and Brightening Face Oil</strong> £122, <a href="https://www.kamaayurveda.com/uk/en_GB/">kamaayurveda.com</a> <br /><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Champo Vata Hydrating Shampoo</strong> £18.50, <a href="https://www.champohaircare.com/">champohaircare.com</a> <br /><strong>3

We are here to mark memories. To walk on the Danish beach we walked with my mother-in-law. Though not yet in the sea we swam in. Deep snow still huddles in hedgerows. It falls again as we leave.</p><p>The badger’s been. Grass and moss clawed through and lifted in search of food.

<p>The natural history legend presents a feast of sight and sound. Plus: a beloved character faces the music in Call the Midwife. Here’s what to watch this evening</p><p>Turn up the volume for David Attenborough’s wonderful symphony of nature’s acoustics. The three-part series follows eight animals per episode and is filmed in 4k ultra-high definition with 360-degree sound, for an experience that fully immerses us in the natural world. It starts with buff-tailed bumblebees using the “sonic assault” of their wings to loosen pollen, and that master of silence the great grey owl, whose uneven ears enable it to hear the rustle of voles in the snow. There are also musical performances from whistling and squeaking bottlenose dolphins, tap-dancing kangaroo rats and roaming, roaring lions. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/25/tv-tonight-david-attenborough-lends-an-ear-to-the-sublime-sounds-of-nature">Continue reading...<

<p>Inequality between regions, competition with cheaper imports, producers going into administration – just some of the problems affecting the production of wine on the Continent</p><p><strong>Tesco Finest Saint-Chinian, Languedoc, France 2020 (£9, <a href="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/283868185">Tesco</a>) </strong>Convoys of protesting farmers have been one of the features of the year so far across Europe, with scenes of tractors blockading cities and motorways, and angry protestors setting fire to hay bales and battling with police from Brussels to Barcelona. Among other things, the Continent’s agricultural sector is in revolt over rising production costs, shrinking margins, cheap imports and a set of new EU rules aimed at helping the bloc meet its environmental targets, plus a range of country-specific issues, all of which, they say, are making farming unviable. That French winegrowers have been among the protestors might try the sympathy of some, given
