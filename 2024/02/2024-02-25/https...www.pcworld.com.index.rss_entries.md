<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s ThinkPad brand is the go-to pick if you want a giant fleet of corporate laptops that can take a beating. But as they&rsquo;ve become sleeker and more modern, they&rsquo;ve also adopted a lot of the trappings of those modern designs, including more restrictive internals and fewer options for upgrading after purchase.

<p>Today at Barcelona&rsquo;s MWC 2024, Lenovo announced its ThinkBook Transparent Display Laptop concept and I&rsquo;ve never been as equally confused as I am delighted. The laptop&rsquo;s borderless display looks more like a pane of glass than an actual screen. The keyboard is transparent, too. Is it cool? Heck yeah! Will this concept ever come to exist in our reality? I&rsquo;m not sure (probably not), but I&rsquo;m hopeful. I enjoy innovative laptops as much as the next person, but I do have to wonder&hellip; who is this for? What can this transparent display do that a non-transparent display cannot?
