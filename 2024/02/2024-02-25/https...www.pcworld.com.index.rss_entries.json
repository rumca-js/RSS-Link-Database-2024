But as they&rsquo;ve become sleeker and more modern, they&rsquo;ve also adopted a lot of the trappings of those modern designs, including more restrictive internals and fewer options for upgrading after purchase. With the latest refresh of the much-loved T series, Lenovo got a little help from some experts on how to make a modern laptop that keeps your options open.

The laptop&rsquo;s borderless display looks more like a pane of glass than an actual screen. The keyboard is transparent, too. Is it cool? Heck yeah! Will this concept ever come to exist in our reality? I&rsquo;m not sure (probably not), but I&rsquo;m hopeful.
