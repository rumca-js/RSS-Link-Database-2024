I'm turning this week's episode of Ian's VR Corner up to Eleven with a look at the newly released Quest exclusive, TV tie-in title, Stranger Things VR!</p><p>From developers Tender Claws, Stranger Things VR is a dark and arty look into the minds of some of Hawkin's most famous residents as you inhabit the body of the shows mysterious villain Vecna. But is it any good? Find out in this week's epsiode of VR Corner as I play through the first 3 chapters of the game. </p><p>So, I'm going to be brutally honest here. Stranger Things VR is a wonderful companion piece for die-hard fans of the show who want more lore, but for your standard helmet-head who just wants a cool new game to play, the first three chapters at least are severely underwhelming.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scariest-thing-about-", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scariest-thing-about-stranger-things-vr-is-the-haircuts?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed"}, {"page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 0, "vote": 0, "permanent": false, "language": "en-gb", "bookmarked": false, "source_obj__id": 343, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "artist": null, "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "dead": false, "date_published": "2024-02-25T10:00:00+00:00", "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/nyt_mini_crossword.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "tags": [], "album": "", "comments": [], "title": "Inside the mind of New York Times Mini maker Joel Fagliano", "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": null, "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/nyt_mini_crossword.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>Joel Fagliano has always thought about puzzles. His father was an avid solver of the famed New York Times Crossword and would photocopy it every weekday for his son to solve on the train to school. When Joel was in 10th grade he started designing his own puzzles, submitting them to the NYT's crossword editor, Will Shortz. \"They were... quite bad,\" he jokes. But Shortz offered him feedback and when Joel was 17, he had his first puzzle published in the paper. Later, when Joel was at college, Shortz took him on as a summer intern and the two started working on the crossword together, the master sharing his knowledge on the arcane intricacies of puzzle authorship.</p><p>In August 2014, the NYT's product director Matt Hural started an experiment - a small, five by five word puzzle to go alongside the main crossword on the pap", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-mind-of-new-york-times-mini-maker-joel-fagliano?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed"}]
