505 Games' Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, directed by Josef Fares of It Takes Two fame, is the latest game to get the remake treatment. Developed by Avantgarden, it's out on February 28th for PS5, PC and Xbox Series X/S and completely overhauls the visuals while re-recording the soundtrack with a live orchestra.

The story of two brothers embarking on a journey to find a cure for their father's illness is still ostensibly the same. Gameplay still involves controlling both characters simultaneously, solving puzzles and exploring the fairy tale-esque world.

However, the remake promises smoother controls, improved cutscenes and boss fights, new secrets to discover and a local co-op mode for two players to work together. Check out everything you should know about Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons Remake before launch.
