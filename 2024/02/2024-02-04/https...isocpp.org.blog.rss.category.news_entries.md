		As most C++ programmers are aware, courtesy of Herb Sutter, programming lock-free data structures is akin to juggling razor blades. Reasoning about concurrent programs is already complex enough but modern CPU memory models are so complicated that they manage to make it even harder. The prevailing suggestion you often come across is to steer clear of lock-free programming entirely.</p>
	<p>
		In this article, I share the adventures of exploring methods for formally verifying lock-free C++ code. To showcase three different approaches, I delve into the
