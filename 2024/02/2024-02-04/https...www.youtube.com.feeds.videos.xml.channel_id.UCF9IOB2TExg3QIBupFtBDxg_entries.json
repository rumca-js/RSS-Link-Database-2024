More than two decades ago, the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, misled this House by promoting and endorsing the Post Office Horizon IT system as perfect, protecting the large corporation that created it and causing untold harm, damage and misery to innocent people. Can the current Prime Minister think of anything he has promoted, in partnership with huge businesses, as safe and effective that has ultimately harmed the British people? Will he use this opportunity to correct that safe and effective statement, or will he choose the same line as Tony Blair", "page_rating": 0, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "page_rating_votes": 0, "user": null, "tags": [], "source_obj__id": 294, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2skKkRwYj8", "permanent": false, "album": "", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/m2skKkRwYj8/hqdefault.jpg", "artist": "Dr. John Campbell", "bookmarked": false, "language": null, "dead": false, "title": "Covid vaccines are safe", "age": null, "date_published": "2024-02-04T19:10:41+00:00"}]
