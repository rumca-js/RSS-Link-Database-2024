Reasoning about concurrent programs is already complex enough but modern CPU memory models are so complicated that they manage to make it even harder. The prevailing suggestion you often come across is to steer clear of lock-free programming entirely.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIn this article, I share the adventures of exploring methods for formally verifying lock-free C++ code.
