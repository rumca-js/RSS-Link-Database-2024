When I proposed to leave the Raspberry Pi for home server applications, many viewers wrote that Proxmox is now also available on the Pi. The Raspberry Pi 5 is much faster than the Pi4, it comes with 8GB of RAM and, with its low power consumption, should be a perfect fit for a Proxmox server. So, letâ€™s check if this is true. And during this process, you will learn a few tricks for the new Pi5.
