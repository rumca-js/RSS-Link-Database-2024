But why exactly do video game weapon names sometimes seem so random? Is it a case of law? Licensing? Or a subject even more difficult to work around?\n\nWith the help of Keeper of Firearms & Artillery, Jonathan Ferguson, and a range of video game developers, we unpick the weird world of virtual firearm design and weapon names. \n\nNotes: In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson to chat about why video game guns tend to have weird names and designs.\n\nYou can check out more episodes of Loadout right here. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzSrmGkpWKk&amp;list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMzIemU1gyyLmg5VlKI2UvC\n\nYou can check out our Firearms Expert Reacts series here. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3zux8jMtgk&amp;list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMgYb13XjPgOKbm5", "page_rating": 0, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "page_rating_votes": 0, "user": null, "tags": [], "source_obj__id": 226, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okMhLCaPuuM", "permanent": false, "album": "", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/okMhLCaPuuM/hqdefault.jpg", "artist": "GameSpot", "bookmarked": false, "language": null, "dead": false, "title": "Why Video Game Guns Have Weird Names And Designs - Loadout", "age": null, "date_published": "2024-02-04T15:00:42+00:00"}]
