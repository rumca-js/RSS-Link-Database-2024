Among the PlayStation-exclusive titles launching this quarter, Rise of the Ronin from Team Ninja is one to look out for. Set in the Bakumatsu, it's an open-world title, a first for the Nioh developer and one that allows you to make choices (with differing consequences).

Ghost of Tsushima launched in 2020 and still stands out as an incredible title in its story-telling and combat. There's hope then that Rise of the Ronin can fill that void until a sequel launches.

It’s an experience which melds crafting and survival mechanics with engaging combat and portal traversal, but there’s a unique aesthetic at play here too, something of a departure from a team comprising devs who’ve worked on Mass Effect.
