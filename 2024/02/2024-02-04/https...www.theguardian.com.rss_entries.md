<p>Russia boasts of taking in 700,000 children and stands accused of trying to erase their Ukrainian identity</p><p>During the 14 months that Veronika Vlasenko attended school in Russia, she was regularly told by teachers and fellow students that she would never be able to go home to Ukraine. “Every day they said to me that I would be staying here for ever and would never leave Russia,” she said. “They told me that Ukraine doesn’t exist, that it never existed, that we’re all Russians … At times the other kids would beat me for being pro-Ukrainian.”</p><p>Veronika was one of nearly 20,000 children documented by Ukrainian authorities as having been taken from Ukraine to Russia over the past two years.

<p></p><p>Before the inquest into Chelsea’s latest implosion begins, it is worth pointing out that Wolves were outstanding. Gary O’Neil, such a bright young manager, outwitted a glowering Mauricio Pochettino. Matheus Cunha, who scored a ruthless hat-trick, and Pedro Neto destroyed Chelsea’s feeble defence. Mario Lemina and Joao Gomes dominated their expensive opponents in midfield. Craig Dawson was a tower of strength at the back. Rayan Ait-Nouri never stopped running on the left.</p><p>What a job O’Neil has done since taking over last summer. This triumph, a first for Wolves at Stamford Bridge since 1979, had nothing to do with luck. The difference was while one team had a plan the other merely resembled a group of confused, uncommitted individuals. Chelsea, back in the bottom half after shipping eight goals in two games, were nothing short of a disgrace.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/04/chelsea-wolves-premier-league-match-report">Continue readin

<p>Nottingham Forest’s recruitment has felt scattergun at the best of times in the last couple of years but Callum Hudson-Odoi’s arrival had a more obvious backstory. Hudson-Odoi worked with Steve Cooper, Nuno Espírito Santo’s predecessor, when England won the Under-17 World Cup in 2017 and so Cooper was influential in luring Hudson-Odoi, once a prodigious talent, to the City Ground.</p><p>Cooper may have departed but here Hudson-Odoi displayed some of the rich promise that elevated him into the Chelsea first team as a teenager, his fine strike on the cusp of half-time earning a point at Bournemouth, who ended the game with 10 men after Philip Billing was sent off late on. Billing’s red card, for clipping Hudson-Odoi on the achilles on halfway, seemed harsh. At the final whistle, both teams were left asking questions of the referee, Rebecca Welch, this her second top-flight match in charge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/04/bournemouth-nottingham-f

Made yesterday with the usual flour, yeast and water, it has been sleeping quietly overnight, allowing the yeast to work slowly. The simple dough is one I have sweetened with a little honey and today it will be kneaded once more, this time with dried fruits – cherries, figs and golden raisins – and spiked with chopped rosemary.</p><p>The bread is to be eaten with cheese in much the same way you might serve a rich fruit cake with a lump of Cheshire, or Eccles cakes with fat crumbs of a crumbly Lancashire.

<p>For years, Rebecca Seal’s monthly hormones made her life a misery. Finally, she was diagnosed with PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder). But why did it take so long – and what can be done to treat it?</p><p>The first time I learned anything useful about my hormonal cycle was when I was trying – and failing – to get pregnant in my early 30s, which is surprising given that I’d been having periods for more than two decades by then. The fact that my body was giving me clear and obvious information every month, and that I’d been missing it all that time, came as a shock. When I finally did get pregnant, via IVF, the hormonal savagery of it all was equally arresting. Then, a year after my second child was born, my periods became extremely hard to manage. Over the following couple of years, I also watched my mental health start to do what felt like cartwheels: mostly, I’d be fine, but there’d be weeks when I couldn’t sleep for wild and worrying imaginings, when rage would bubbl

The brick facades of the row of houses in Baltimore, Maryland, picked out by Power’s large format camera, also gesture towards that Delft hyper-realism – and the implied social questions in the image echo across centuries and continents.</p><p>Like the Dutch painter, Power invites you to look hard at each brick, window and railing in his frame.

<p>The new formulations are light yet hardworking</p><p>I’ve never understood how people can to go without moisturising their bodies. I know we are all in a hurry, but surely your skin feels uncomfortable when it’s starved of hydration. Some people may be able to get away with it on an aesthetic level. But when the climate is at an extreme and as your skin gets older, there are telltale signs. The skin looks dull, tighter, thirsty and lethargic. Still, it’s not too late for new habits. Start with exfoliation – body cream absorbs better when it doesn’t have to navigate dead skin cells. A bath scrunchie (cheap as chips at the supermarket) is the quickest route for this. Some people prefer lotions, but I have chosen creams and butters, because they are more effective at combating the effects of cold weather on our skin. I love that they are thick and creamy, but unlike old school formulations – too sticky or heavy – these are light yet hardworking, easily absorbed without leavin

The plural is important here because, as with any cuisine, the rather obvious answer is: ‘It depends what kind of Japanese food.’ There’s no reason a drink that works very well with, say, the delicacy of sushi, will also be a hit with the rich savouriness of thin strips of meat cooked briefly in a bubbling broth shabu shabu style. Still, for all its variety, there are certain qualities that run through Japanese food: a subtlety of flavour, forensic attention to texture and presentation, and plentiful helpings of umami. All, certainly, are present and correct across the menu at swanky St James’s Japanese restaurant Ginza, where London-based Italian sommelier Angelo Lorea picks o
