See, the woman had her testicles surgically removed, thus making her a woman. She kept those testicles in a jar in the refrigerator and claimed her ex refused to give her her testicles back. The ex-boyfriend countersued over being "humiliated" by the charge, but that also was dismissed by a Michigan judge.</p><p>We will be adhering to the AP Styleguide definition of "what is a woman."
