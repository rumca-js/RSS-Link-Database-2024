This project has you create a portable tracking device that sends its location to a web server over the cell network.  The locations are stored on the server in a SQLite database.

Users can then access a web app that shows the last 5 locations of the device in embedded Google Maps.

This class shows how architectures are designed for IoT projects and everything involved to make a "simple" project work.
