Inspired by the majestic colours of the Chinese New Year, we've painted a Freeguild Cavalier-Marshal in an alternative scheme that evokes the Year of the Dragon! We'll show you how to paint a dark and handsome green, warm red leather, and bright silver. You can use this guide to follow along with your own Freeguild Cavalier-Marshal, or duplicate the colours on other miniatures in your collection!

If you're new to painting, our Citadel Colour Painting Essentials playlist hosts an array of beginner-friendly videos to help you get started.
