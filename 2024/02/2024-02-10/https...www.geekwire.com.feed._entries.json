It&#8217;s part of a plan to sell up to 50 million shares during a period ending in January 2025, under a trading plan adopted by Bezos on Nov. 8, 2023, as disclosed in Amazon&#8217;s annual 10-K filing last week. According to the latest regulatory filing, on Friday afternoon, the 12 million shares were sold under that plan on Wednesday and Thursday of this week at prices ranging from $169.71 to&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/jeff-bezos-sells-2-billion-worth-of-amazon-shares-in-his-first-stock-sale-since-2021/\">Read More</a>", "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "source_obj__id": 338, "dead": false, "tags": [], "vote": 0, "artist": null, "album": "", "bookmarked": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-10T16:01:08+00:00", "language": "en-US"}, {"thumbnail": null, "comments": [], "title": "New esports team at Seattle-area middle school teaches teamwork, communication, and how to lose", "age": null, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "user": null, "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/new-esports-team-at-seattle-area-middle-school-teaches-teamwork-communication-and-how-to-lose", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_6328-1260x945.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />I turned off Interstate 90 and climbed the curving streets into Mercer Island toward Islander Middle School (IMS). Signs on traffic medians, roadside planters, and roundabouts advertised a slew of extracurricular activities for local kids. They could play basketball, lacrosse, and softball. The signs, clustered together in thicker and thicker bunches as I neared the school, advertised a world outside of school full of scout meetings and team sports.&#160; I was headed to the school to catch up with a different type of team sport, one made up of many kids who had never been on a team before.
