This suitcase TV from LG is something we haven’t seen before, and we needed to talk about it. Part portable monitor, part home theater in a box and part bluetooth speaker.  Is it for Van life? Work trips? Glamping? No matter what, it’s got HDR on-the-go, while you’re camping. The LG Stanbyme Go is... something.
