## The 10 Best Super Bowl Ads of All Time

Listen, whether you’re a pigskin-loving, team-colors-face-painting, $10,000-ticket-buying super-fan of America's, uh, other favorite pastime, or simply a casual observer who’s just here for the suds and wings, or maybe even – gasp – one of those filthy nerds who once referred to the uniforms as “costumes” by accident in front of all your friends, it’s safe to say that there’s one thing we’re all looking forward to when Super Bowl Sunday arrives: the ads.
The insanely expensive commercials are the advertisers’ chance to reach one of the most embiggened TV audiences of the year, and as such the ads are often memorable, celebrity-filled, and these days, of course, meme-ready. But in the pantheon of Big Game ads, what are the best of the best? Which commercials in the history of the Super Bowl have proven truly worship-worthy on the holiest day on the American calendar?
From Betty White's Snickers ad and the Budweiser frogs to Ridley Scott's iconic "1984" Apple commercial and the

## Florida Joker Wants to Voice Himself in GTA 6 - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:

The real-life Florida Joker, who just a few months ago threatened to sue Rockstar Games and Take-Two, is now offering to drop his lawsuit and provide the voice of the character who he allegedly inspired. The GTA 6 developer and publisher have not responded to this, but it's a pretty safe bet they won't. In other news, Helldivers 2 is doing insane numbers on Steam, bugs and glitches aside. In fact, it's Sony's biggest launch ever on that platform, better than God of War. Impressive, especially for a "budget" title. And finally, a new Baldur's Gate 3 patch is on the way, and it's pretty hefty. It fixes the kissing, apparently.

With the news and teaser for the third Sonic Movie 3, which is set to hit theaters in December, we finally got our first extended look at the upcoming Knuckles series! With it, we get a glimpse at what Knuckles and friends are up to in Green Hills, a new threat set to harness the echidna's powers, as well as a familiar face that Sonic Adventure fans might not have expected to see. Spotted at the minute and 53sec mark of the trailer, Pachacamac is seen working at a bowling alley. Pachacamac is the father of Tikal from Sonic Adventure, serving as the chief echidna of the Knuckles Clan. He’s the dude that attacked the Altar of Emerald, setting loose the immortal god Chaos, who killed him. He’s clearly not dead in the Knuckles series, so the events that have taken place in Sonic Adventure have not occurred just yet in the live-action adaptation. That’s not to say that we won’t see Chaos pop up at some point in this live-action universe; perhaps we’ll see Chaos unleashed in the So
