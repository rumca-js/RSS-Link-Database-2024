In the companies' filing seen by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-09/apple-is-settling-chip-secrets-theft-case-against-startup-rivos?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-settle-trade-secrets-lawsuit-against-chip-startup-rivos-2024-02-09/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, they told the US District Court for the Northern District of California that they have signed an agreement that &quot;potentially settles the case.&quot; Their deal would allow Apple to conduct a forensic examination of Rivos' systems, as well as of its activities.&nbsp;</p>
