  <p id="UTuuuM">From <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24034292/halo-season-2-trailer-paramount-plus">the first trailer alone</a>, I could tell <em>Halo</em> season 2 would go in a different direction than the first. Where season 1 was bogged down in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132662/halo-tv-series-season-1-review-paramount-plus">strange storytelling choices</a> that didn’t leave much room for its characters — namely, the Spartans — to do what they do best — namely, kick Covenant ass — season 2 feels more in line with what a <em>Halo</em> show should be about.</p>

  <p id="gGQbQE">You’ve no doubt allowed dozens (or even hundreds) of apps to live on your smartphone, and it’s important that you know what these apps are up to.
