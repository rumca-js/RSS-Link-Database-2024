<p>The midfielder on a ‘misunderstanding’ with Pep Guardiola and Gareth Southgate’s influence to stay in the Premier League</p><p>“Ooofff,” Kalvin Phillips says, smiling as he usually does but feeling the question in his gut. Like a low blow. What was the toughest moment for him at Manchester City? “There’s a few …” Phillips wants to look forward. To his new challenge at West Ham where he is on loan for the remainder of the season. To Sunday’s derby against Arsenal at the London Stadium. To the European Championship with England in the&nbsp;summer.</p><p>The 28-year-old knew that he had to get away from City in January because had he stayed and continued to warm the bench, he “definitely” would have relinquished his place in Gareth Southgate’s squad. He opens up on how the England manager influenced him to stay in the Premier League, leading him to shun Juventus for West Ham. More on that later.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/10/kalvin-phillips-int

In the hours before this unlikely title decider, posters had gone up near the Santiago Bernabéu declaring that Girona were forever dreaming; if so, a cruel awakening awaited them. Carlo Ancelotti had insisted that whatever happened here the title race was not run but by the end it was hard not to see this as definitive. It was not only that Real Madrid beat their nearest, most unexpected rivals for La Liga to go five points clear, it was the way they did it.</p><p>Two goals from Jude Bellingham and one each from Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo delivered a statement to go with victory. Girona have been superb this season but when it came to it, Madrid were simply too good, reasserting their superiority. It was, Ancelotti said, their best display of the season “in every sense” and the timing could not have been better. Vinícius in particular stood above, his coach calling him the best in the world, his countryman and opponent Yan Couto overwhelmed and left in

<p>In 1997, after moving to the South Korean countryside from Seoul, artist Lee Me Kyeoung came across a “beautifully dilapidated” old convenience store in her neighbourhood and was compelled to paint it. The two months it took her to complete the drawing, using ink pens, was such a “joyful experience” that she decided to seek out more. “These small, old mom-and-pop stores were more than just places to buy goods, they were essential to the community,” she says, but they were disappearing as shopping habits in Korea changed. Me Kyeoung’s drawings – she has committed about 500 stores to paper over 26 years, along with cherry blossoms and other trees that flourished over many of them – are a record of a slower, more community-centred way of life that is passing into memory.</p><ul><li><em>See more at <a href="http://instagram.com/lee_me_kyeoung">instagram.com/lee_me_kyeoung</a></em></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2024/feb/10/south-korean-conv

Alas, it was the television match official they were trying to inspire. Trailing by four with time up, Scotland thought Sam Skinner had driven over for the try that would have brought victory. But the referee, Nic Berry, had decided on the field that the ball was held up. Over to the TMO to find evidence otherwise.

<p>EVs heavily subsidised by Beijing are flooding Europe and the globe. If we don’t watch out, it could start a major trade war</p><p>Whenever people learn that I have an electric vehicle (EV) the conversation invariably turns to whether I suffer from “range anxiety” – the fear of running out of charge. The answer is that generally I don’t, though I might if I were contemplating a drive across the Highlands of Scotland to Aviemore, say. But otherwise, no. Why? Because I am able to charge the car overnight at home, and most of my trips are much much shorter than the vehicle’s 300-mile range.</p><p>In that sense I am statistically normal. Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electric-vehicles-costs-charging-and-infrastructure/electric-vehicles-costs-charging-and-infrastructure">estimates</a> are that 99% of car journeys in England are of less than 100 miles.

<p>The little-known digestive disease is hard to diagnose but can affect swallowing and require emergency treatment</p><p>Lisa Thornton was heavily pregnant and in her early 30s when she noticed the feeling of a blockage in her oesophagus, the muscular food pipe that connects the mouth to the stomach. “At the time, I just thought it was just the pregnancy,” says Thornton, now 50, who lives in the New Forest in Hampshire. “I thought it was everything pushing up. But a few years later, things started to get worse.”</p><p>During a Sunday roast with her family, a chunk of broccoli suddenly lodged in her throat, causing spasms that persisted for hours. Any attempts to wash it down with water failed as the fluid simply came straight back up. Thornton drove to a nearby drop-in centre, where doctors tried, without success, to free the blockage with muscle relaxants.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/10/asthma-of-the-oesophagus-the-alarming-rise-of-a-rare-infla

<p>Flat buyers across England and Wales have been shocked at the ‘feudal’ nature of the ground rent system. Even Michael Gove says it must change. But landowners are fighting back</p><p>When Lauren Stanley, an insurance broker from Kent, bought her two-bedroom new-build flat in Tonbridge for £180,000 in 2013, she had no idea that it came with a problematic ground rent arrangement. It wasn’t until she attempted to sell the property, and saw three buyers pull out, that she learned what was putting them off.</p><p>“Once my third buyer pulled out, I was advised that I have a rising ground rent clause, which sees the fee increase every five years in line with inflation,” she says. The first increase took it from £250 to £320, and if it carried on increasing by the same percentage, by the end of the 115-year lease term it would have been an extortionate amount.

<p>A shrine to Spain’s great writers has become the latest flashpoint in a battle to save a thousand mature trees that stand in the way of building works</p><p>The Plaza de Santa Ana, which sits at the heart of Madrid’s literary quarter, is home to statues of Spain’s two greatest dramatists – Pedro Calderón de la Barca and Federico García Lorca – as well as one of the many bars where Ernest Hemingway did battle with his thirst. It is also home to dozens of trees that are already beginning to bud in anticipation of spring.</p><p>The question on residents’ minds is how many more springs the trees will see. In recent weeks, the neighbourhood has become the latest flashpoint in a series of protests against the felling of mature trees during key building works in the Spanish capital.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/10/no-one-has-explained-this-stupidity-the-citizens-fighting-back-in-madrids-war-on-trees">Continue reading...</a>

Foley, a nurse practitioner at the clinic where her husband, John, was a doctor, was relieved to hear her son’s voice. A few months earlier, Jim had left the US for Syria to work as a freelance videographer. That decision, coming less than a year after he’d been kidnapped and detained for six weeks while reporting in Libya, horrified his family. Now the 39-year-old was in an even more dangerous war zone. Foley couldn’t really talk, she told her son; the clinic was busy. “That’s OK, Mom,” said Jim, cheerfully, and promised to call her at Thanksgiving. A few weeks later, he w

<p>Edward Carpenter, John Addington Symonds and Havelock Ellis were pioneers of their day – though their legacy has been overshadowed by the Irish playwright</p><p>Oscar Wilde always imposed. Meeting him in 1892, the French writer Jules Renard reported: “He offers you a cigarette, but selects it himself. He does not walk around a table: he moves the table out&nbsp;of the way … He is enormous, and&nbsp;carries an enormous cane.” The affectations of dress and manner; the&nbsp;extraordinary, magnetic talk; the&nbsp;flourished epigrams; the startling, needling essays, stories and plays –&nbsp;all&nbsp;these were impositions. They were how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/oscar-wilde">Wilde</a> forced himself on the&nbsp;attention of the world, made himself notorious, and then famous. And in the ugliness and despair of his&nbsp;downfall – in 1895 he was found guilty of homosexual offences (acts of “gross&nbsp;indecency”) and sentenced to two years of hard labour – he i

I immediately thought, ‘I have to do that again.’”</p><p>As he worked on the project, Michelet became increasingly fascinated by the chemistry between people who are related by blood or have simply grown up under the same roof – as he puts it, “the bond that unites and sometimes divides them”. Subjects were initially recruited from his circle of friends, with the net growing wider as word of the project spread. Michelet set up a separate WhatsApp group for each participating family, where creative discussions could take place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/art

<p>Some in Northern Ireland see themselves as British through and through – but on the mainland, we find we’re just ‘Irish’  </p><p>The polarisation and politicisation of identity in Northern Ireland, particularly within unionism today, is giving rise to the misperception that you can only be Irish or British – not both. Northern Ireland was constructed as a Protestant state for Protestant people, with an inbuilt Protestant majority to maintain its place in the UK. “Loyal Ulster”, as it became known, was proudly British. But many of the citizens who had spent considerable time on the so-called mainland would find their perception of British identity challenged, at odds with Britishness within the wider UK. As one woman who was born and grew up in Northern Ireland told me: “I moved to England, and everyone thought I was Irish.”</p><p>I recently interviewed a number of people about the question of shifting identities in Northern Ireland.

Something to share, maybe, Lady and the Tramp-style? Or food to eat by hand, signalling informality and ease? For some, it’s a full-on steak and champagne feast, eaten under candlelight, while for others a baked potato eaten on the sofa while wearing PJs does the trick. All good meals are a relationship match of sorts. Some pairings are clearly going to work from the start, while others take a bit longer to persuade, not least because they seem an odd fit: trout and tahini, say, are hardly the most obvious couple but, once tried, they make so much sense. It’s tempting to force the analogies when it comes to food and love, so let’s leave the ingredients to do what they do best.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/feb/10/valentines-meal-for-two-recipe-yotam-ottolenghi
