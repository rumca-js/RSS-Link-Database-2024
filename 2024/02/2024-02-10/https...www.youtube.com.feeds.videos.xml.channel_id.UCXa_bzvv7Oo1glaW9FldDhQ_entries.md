The original Helldivers launched in March 2015 for multiple platforms, and almost nine years later, we finally have a sequel. Helldivers 2 launched on February 8th for PS5 and PC, offering a bolder and arguably louder experience.

Despite shifting to a third-person shooting perspective and a live service, it's as you'd expect - Super Earth wants the Terminids and the new Automatons wiped out, and it's up to you to comply. Though it's seeing some strong player counts, breaking the record for PlayStation Studios' titles on Steam, there have also been some issues.

Matchmaking problems, controversy over nProtect GameGuard on PC - and that doesn't even get into the new War Bonds system, which some call "pay-to-win." Find out which issues are more substantial than others.
