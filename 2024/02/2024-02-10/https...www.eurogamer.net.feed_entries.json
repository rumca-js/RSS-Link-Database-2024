There's also been criticism of the game's PC optimisation and its kernel-level GameGuard anti-cheat software, whilst others have taken umbrage with Helldivers 2's monetisation.</p><p>However, game director Mikael Eriksson did admit earlier today on the game's Discord channel that whilst \"a full matchmaking solution is in works\", it may take \"a few more days\" to test before it can be rolled

It offered a powerful handheld experience, with well-designed software and plenty of hardware power. The screen, however, left something to be desired, with low contrast, poor colour reproduction and a decent amount of display lag. You could of course upgrade to Valve's Steam Deck OLED, which comprehensively solves those issues, or opt for a full display replacement in the form of the DeckHD, which offers a higher resolution and higher-quality LCD panel. Today we'll be evaluating each of those two options to see which upgrade path works best for original Steam Deck users.</p><p>First, let's take a deep-dive into the DeckHD.

It's not quite the first 40k video game that I dreamed of - that'd be the Primarch fighting game my friends and I dreamed up at age 11 - but ever since getting over my youthful \"wow, cool Space Marine\" phase, I've wanted a 40k game that really gets into the finer details of the setting. \n</p><p>\nThe Imperium, the form that human society takes in the grim darkness of the far future, is by far the best thing about 40k - but it's frequently obfuscated. 40k adaptations tend to either go all in on the action, or stick with the warfare and high level strategy of the tabletop game. On top of that, I suspect Games Workshop's need to market to children conflicts with how truly horrible the Imperium is.
