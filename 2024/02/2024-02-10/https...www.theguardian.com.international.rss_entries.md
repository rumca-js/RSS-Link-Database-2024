<p>World champion rogainers Geoff Lawford and Rod Gray have spent almost 50 years travelling the world facing sleep deprivation, wild animals and periodic fainting</p><p>Midnight in the Czech Republic’s Ore Mountains. Australians Geoff Lawford and Rod Gray pause for food, a brief respite after a punishing 12 hours of racing through the forests. Another 12 hours of competition remain. They turn off their head torches to conserve their batteries. It was pitch black, Lawford recalls. “Although Rod was only two metres away, I couldn’t see him.” And then they hear it, the sound of a large animal running through the forest towards them.</p><p>Competitors had been warned of possible encounters with wild boar or deer. Lawford senses<strong> </strong>the animal stop in front of him. Scrambling, he turns on his head torch to discover the maw of a “solid German shepherd cross” inches from his face. “Thankfully, the dog proved friendly,” says Lawford. “We had no idea who owned it, but it

<p>From Wim Wenders’ recent Anselm Kiefer documentary to Kirk Douglas’s tortured Van Gogh and Derek Jarman’s erotic ode to Caravaggio, cinema loves a brush with genius</p><p>Visual art, oddly, doesn’t always translate that naturally to cinema as a subject.

<p>A journal, scrambled then re-ordered by the first letter of each sentence, proves an oddly captivating experiment in writing</p><p>‘But isn’t it boring?” asked my partner. I had just explained the concept of Alphabetical Diaries, a book which delivers almost exactly what its title promises. The novelist Sheila Heti kept a journal for more than 10 years; she then culled sentences from the pages and arranged those sentences in alphabetical order. The book proceeds from A to Z: in the first chapter, each sentence starts with A, in the second each starts with B, and so on. The structure of the book is slick and oddly captivating. I read it over the holiday season, when lots of people were coming and going from the house, and everyone seemed to want to know more about it. Their curiosity turned quickly to scepticism – the historically correct response to the avant garde.</p><p>So, to answer the question: Yes. Absolutely. The book<em> </em>is boring. Sometimes. It’s also thrilli
