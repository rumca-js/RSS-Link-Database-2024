GenAI capabilities are vast, ranging from text generation to music and art creation. But what makes genAI truly unique is its ability to deeply understand context, producing outputs that closely resemble that of humans.</p><p>One of the primary challenges with genAI is the lack of access to private or proprietary data. AI foundation models, of which large language models (LLMs) are a subset, are typically trained on publicly available data, but they don't have access to confidential or proprietary information. Even if the data were in the public domain, it might be outdated and irrelevant. LLMs also have limitations in recognizing very recent events or knowledge. Furthermore, without proper guidance, LLMs may produce inaccurate information.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3712920/4-key-considerations-for-unlocking-the-p", "thumbnail": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2024/02/istock-1394199344-100960811-small.jpg", "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "source": "http://www.infoworld.com/index.rss", "vote": 0, "age": null, "comments": [], "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3712920/4-key-considerations-for-unlocking-the-power-of-genai.html#tk.rss_all", "tags": [], "dead": false, "album": "", "user": null, "date_published": "2024-02-14T14:21:00+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": null}, {"bookmarked": false, "language": "en-us", "source_obj__id": 563, "title": "5 things to consider before you deploy an LLM", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>If the screwdriver were invented by the tech industry today, then it would be widely deployed for a variety of tasks, including hammering nails.
