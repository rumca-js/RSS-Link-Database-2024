Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor reviewed in Early Access by Leana Hafer on PC.

While Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor’s Early Access status is clear in the limited number of modes and maps it currently contains, it doesn't feel unpolished or annoying to play at all. Translating the adventurous, raucous, party game spirit of its shooter big brother to a single-player roguelite about as well as anyone could have, it's an enjoyable addition to one of my favorite franchises. Whether it’s first-person or top-down, wielding a small arsenal of wonderful, punchy weapons as I sprint through critter-filled caverns on my murderous quest for loot and glory warms my stony heart.

Mario vs. Donkey Kong reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on Nintendo Switch.

"Coming in the wake of Super Mario Bros. Wonder’s psychedelic splendour, Mario vs. Donkey Kong’s update of the 2004 Game Boy Advance version is a markedly more modest Mario adventure in scope, but I still enjoyed puzzling my way through its trap-riddled rooms while they lasted – particularly those found in its playful pair of brand new worlds that have interesting new takes on the decades-old mechanics. The lopsided difficulty of its main levels could have perhaps been better smoothed out so that it becomes more challenging as you go rather than easier, and some occasional control flaws seemed below the standard I’ve come to expect from Nintendo platformers, but its completely overhauled art is packed with personality and its two-player co-op mode puts a fun new spin on familiar gameplay. Mario vs. Donkey Kong might not be as polished as a Mini-Mario toy fresh off the assembly line, but it's just as full o

## Madame Web Video Review

Madame Web tries to connect many plots and people together to a confusing, yet ultimately bland result. It tries to balance the comedic tone of a modern superhero movie with what could be a more interesting psychological thriller if it invested more time on developing its hero and villain, rather than spreading itself thin trying to connect all these new versions of characters together. It fails as a one-off and a franchise starter, not telling a fulfilling origin story for Cassie nor giving a compelling argument for the future Spider-Women. The weak dialogue unfortunately stands out, but the few action set pieces harken to the older Spider-Man movies of the early 2000s.

Take a look at IGN's review for Sony's latest non-Spider-Man Marvel movie, Madame Web.

## Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered Has a Warning for Racial and Ethnic Stereotypes - IGN Daily Fix

The newly-released remastered collection for the original Tomb Raider trilogy came with an additional warning: racial and ethnic stereotypes that would likely be problematic in a modern game are still present in this collection. Developer Crystal Dynamics explained that they thought it was better to leave them in unchanged—and with a warning—rather than remove them and pretend they never existed. In other news, the action RPG Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a certified hit, selling one million units in less than a month. JRPG fans are eating good this year, with Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Persona 3: Reload each selling a million. And of course, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is just around the corner, waiting to dominate sales charts. Finally, Diablo IV is in hot water again, and of course the culprit is microtransactions.
