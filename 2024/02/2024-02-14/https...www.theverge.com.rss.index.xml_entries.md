  <p id="W9Rl23">Slack is launching a suite of built-in AI features that serve up summaries of threads and channel recaps, while also allowing you to ask questions about what’s been going on at work. The workplace management platform first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/6/23861713/slack-ai-tool-recap-channels-threads-test">started testing Slack AI</a> last year, but now it’s rolling out as a paid add-on for Slack Enterprise users.</p>
<p id="xZlhux">In case you’ve fallen behind on a particular thread someone has tagged you in, you can use Slack AI to get a full summary of the conversation, as well as who has said what. There’s also a way to get a recap of the chatter that has been going on in channels.</p>
