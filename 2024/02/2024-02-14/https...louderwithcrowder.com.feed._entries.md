	Democrats want to overwhelm America with illegal migrants because, besides having a new crop of undocumented Democrats, they need people to pick their vegetables. 
	<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jerry-nadler-vegetables" target="_blank">Elected officials say so on the floor of the People's House</a>. So it's no surprise that a woke woman bragging about opening her home to an illegal migrant family would automatically turn the mother into her slave. Maybe slave is too harsh of a word because the migrant woman can always leave. Indentured servant?

	They don't call these broads AWFL (Affluent White Female Liberals) for nothing. Welcome to the Boston area!
