Draped in a traditional Ethiopian scarf at the Tiny Desk, he incorporates those elements to a T.\n\nSo much of the genre-fluid Am\u00e9n is about personal growth and finding home. His first trip to Ethiopia was the driving force behind the new project, but the storytelling prowess is carried over from 2019's HAN. Before closing his set with \"Going Home,\" he expressed his gratitude for the moment. \"It's because we live within this confined amount of time, that we're able to find meaning,\" he says. \"I've been trying to accept that a little bit more and be grateful for the little moments like this that I get to share with you guys right now.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Gone (Abebe Bikila)\"", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/h2YdwoZpVgE/hqdefault.jpg", "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "vote": 0, "age": null, "comments": [], "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YdwoZpVgE", "tags": [], "dead": false, "album": "", "user": null, "date_published": "2024-02-14T10:00:35+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": "NPR Music"}]
