<p>As a Marvel movie, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madame-web-review-marvels-first-slasher/1900-6418180/">Madame Web</a> deviates pretty wildly from the brand's big-screen norms: It didn't cost $200 million to make, it was mostly filmed on location rather than on soundstages, it's got a guy who looks like Spider-Man but he's evil, and it's got Marvel Easter eggs but tries to hide them rather than make them obvious. But perhaps the most surprising aspect of Madame Web might be that it focuses on a Marvel Comics superhero team like the Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy or Web Warriors--but this group has never had a real name.</p><p dir="ltr">In the comics, Madame Web is a sort of cryptic mentor to various Spider-folks, and she's specifically known for teaming up with groups of Spider-Women.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madame-web-review-marvels-first-slasher/1900-6418180/">Madame Web</a> is a Marvel movie, but it's completely standalone. It's not a part of the MCU, and it doesn't connect to the other Marvel movies that Sony has produced, like Venom and Morbius. But that's something that could change in the future, with Sony's Kraven the Hunter coming up later this year, and the MCU's preoccupation with the multiverse allowing any Marvel-related thing to theoretically be incorporated if Disney and Sony can make a deal for it.</p><p dir="ltr">And it helps that certain aspects of Madame Web, about a woman who gets the ability to see the future thanks to a mythical Amazonian spider, could make it pretty easy to integrate into a greater franchise if they want to. Let's talk about what exactly those things are.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Warning: The rest of this article will contain major spoilers for Madame Web, including details about its ending.</em></p><

<p dir="ltr">Forget about playing together this Valentine's Day. Instead, go solo with Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, an auto-shooter spin-off that takes inspiration from Vampire Survivors. The roguelike title is now available in Steam Early Access.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with not offering co-op, another main difference with Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is the three-quarters viewpoint. However, there are similarities between the original game and this new spin-off. For example, Survivor offers the same four classes for players to choose at the start of each run--with three subclasses.</p><p dir="ltr">"The idea to make a bullet hell spin-off of Deep Rock Galactic was born over a beer we had with the Funday team during Gamescom, and it's amazing to see what it has become," said Søren Lundgaard, CEO of the original game's developer Ghost Ship Games.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-spin-off-inspired-by-vampire-survivors-is-out-now/1100-6521079/?ftag

<p dir="ltr">Of the three Walking Dead spin-offs to debut following the main series' finale in 2022, surely <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-walking-dead-the-ones-who-live-gets-first-trailer/1100-6520245/">The Ones Who Live</a> had the most interest around it, and it's easy to see why. It is, after all, the "one with Rick and Michonne." While Maggie and Negan's Dead City and the simply titled Daryl Dixon each had their own conceptual merits, this is the one that has the most mass appeal and could pull lapsed fans back into The Walking Dead Universe (TWDU), as AMC calls it. But it would need to be high-quality, too. Fortunately, it is good--in the four episodes I've seen anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">The Ones Who Live has a lot of catching up to do given the multiple time-jumps this series has undergone since Rick, and later Michonne, departed the main series, and it smartly uses the early portion of its six-episode season to do just that.

<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has just received its first big post-launch patch, plugging several exploitable holes in the game with a variety of fixes. The most prominent of these was a bug found when dealing Burning damage, as players discovered that they could exponentially stack this elemental effect to be far more lethal than what was intended.</p><p>As it explained on the Suicide Squad Discord group, Rocksteady originally planned for Burn to scale more modestly as players took on tougher Mastery levels in the game's Elseworld missions. Instead, a "major unintended" bug saw those damage numbers soar and it "basically meant that if you used a Burn build, every Mastery Level had the same difficulty," the developer said.</p><p>This update will see Burning damage scale correctly, and Rocksteady plans to introduce a new leaderboard as well. All unlocked Mastery Levels, Finite Crisis rank, and gear earned in Elseworlds missions using the Burn exploit won't be remov

<p dir="ltr">The original Mario Vs. Donkey Kong on Game Boy Advance was a victim of its own success. A successor to the stellar and underrated Game Boy version of Donkey Kong, it brought back many of the same puzzle-platforming mechanics with adorable mini-Mario toys serving as stage collectibles and story MacGuffins. But the minis ultimately became the stars of the sub-series and took over its identity. We've received a steady stream of Lemmings-like spin-offs since then, centered mostly around guiding minis through trap-filled stages. While those games were charming enough, they never quite recaptured the magic of Donkey Kong on Game Boy or Mario Vs. Donkey Kong on GBA. Thanks to a combination of quality-of-life improvements and visual flair that showcase what made those older games special, this Switch remake gives that original design ethos a new lease on life.</p><p dir="ltr">The minis are the impetus for the story, though, which begins when Donkey Kong spots the little
