<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving at an unprecedented pace, and generative AI (genAI) is at the forefront. GenAI capabilities are vast, ranging from text generation to music and art creation. But what makes genAI truly unique is its ability to deeply understand context, producing outputs that closely resemble that of humans.</p><p>One of the primary challenges with genAI is the lack of access to private or proprietary data. AI foundation models, of which large language models (LLMs) are a subset, are typically trained on publicly available data, but they don't have access to confidential or proprietary information. Even if the data were in the public domain, it might be outdated and irrelevant. LLMs also have limitations in recognizing very recent events or knowledge. Furthermore, without proper guidance, LLMs may produce inaccurate information.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712920/4-key-considerations-for-unlocking-the-p

<p>If the screwdriver were invented by the tech industry today, then it would be widely deployed for a variety of tasks, including hammering nails. Since the debut of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689172/chatgpt-and-software-development.html">ChatGPT</a>, there has been a growing fervor and backlash against <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709489/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs). Indeed, many adaptations of the technology seem misappropriated, and its capabilities are overhyped, given its frequent lack of veracity. This is not to say there are not many great uses for an LLM, but you should answer some key questions before going full bore.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712900/5-things-to-consider-before-you-deploy-an-llm.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Svelte 5 brings improvements under the hood—namely functional components and the adoption of signals—but is otherwise a mostly incremental update. The one exception is the new Runes feature, which introduces a host of ideas for dealing with reactivity in a more modular, succinct, and fine-grained way. </p><p>In this article, you'll get a hands-on introduction to the main runes shipping with Svelte 5: <code>$state()</code>, <code>$derived()</code>, <code>$props()</code>, <code>$inspectI()</code>, and $effect().</p><h2 class="toc">Runes in Svelte</h2>
<p>At first glance, it might seem that the new runes feature adds complexity to working with Svelte. In fact, this idea offers a simpler approach to doing many things you likely already do. The term <em>rune</em> refers to a magical glyph, or an alphabetic letter with mysterious powers. In Svelte, runes are special tokens that tell the Svelte compiler to work behind the scenes in specific ways
