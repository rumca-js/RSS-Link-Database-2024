Today, I'm excited to share my conversation with Max Blumenthal, Editor-in-Chief and investigative journalist at the Grayzone. You can find more about their work at https://thegrayzone.com and support independent journalism.

During our discussion, we delve into the ongoing conflict in Israel-Palestine, focusing particularly on the thorough debunking Max and his team have conducted regarding a recent New York Times report on the events of October 7th. Additionally, we explore the growing influence of the censorship industry complex driven by Big Tech and governments. Plus, we uncover how the FBI has infiltrated lockdown protests. This conversation is a must-see for anyone
