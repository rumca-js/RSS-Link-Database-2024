<p>Apple is pushing into generative AI (genAI) in a big way with a new tool called Keyframer; it's designed to give users the power to animate static images using text prompts.</p><p>Keyframer is described in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06071.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">recently published Apple research paper</a> and what it does seems impressive. To create animated illustrations from static 2D images, users just need to pop in an SVG image, provide some text prompts, and let Keyframer build CSS animation code to animate that original image. Then you can fine-tune the creation.</p><h2><strong>Apple’s AI arms race is intensifying</strong></h2>
