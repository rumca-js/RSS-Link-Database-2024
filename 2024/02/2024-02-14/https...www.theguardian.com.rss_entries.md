Alice (Andrea Riseborough) is a successful financier whom I deeply suspect was described as “enigmatic” and “feisty” in the casting callout.

<p>A disparate anti-Tory voter coalition can carry the opposition to power, but governing will require a deeper galvanising purpose</p><p>British politics has been characterised by a combination of turbulence and stagnation for a number of years. The country has had three prime ministers in two years, all from a party that has been in power since 2010.

Yet the opposition radiates insecurity about this advantage.</p><p>There is both firmness and brittleness about the Starmer project.

Helldivers 2, the sequel to the 2015 topdown co-op shooter, is an online game in which beefy space marines blast down to alien planets and, spurred on by jingoistic slogans, pulverise anything that moves with super hi-tech weaponry.

And like the movie it borrows from, Helldivers 2 is a stupendously entertaining joyride.</p><p>There’s really not much to explain upfront.

Pratt and Smith had been discovered in a room by a nosy landlord and his wife, who had taken it in turns to peer through the keyhole before calling the police.</p><p>Even these busybodies, however, seemed shocked at how heavily the law had pressed on their errant guests. When the case came before the Old Bailey, Mr and Mrs Berkshire pleaded with the judge to show mercy – they liked to run a respectable house, but stringing up James and John was not what they’d had in mind.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/feb/14/james-and-john-by-chris-bryant-review-the-cost-of-being-gay-in-19th-century-london">Continue reading...</a>

That’s a bummer, of course, but in the grand tradition of divas such as Gloria Gaynor and Alicia Bridges, Houston reminds us that it’s better to hit the dance floor than lie in bed wallowing over a pathetic man. “I’d rather be alone than unhappy” is both a celebration of self <em>and</em> god-tier diss.

<p>Gina Rodriguez brings the charm as a sports fanatic dating in Brooklyn in an improvement on streaming romcom fare</p><p>Ever since Netflix declared the return of the moribund studio romcom with its “Summer of Love” in 2018, the company has churned out a steady stream of formulaic – or, to quote the burn in many a review, “algorithmic” – at-home fare. The genre didn’t so much reboot as mutate for a new streaming home with a now distinctive style: baseline watchable, sheen-y, disposable. I’ve reviewed probably a dozen of them and can only recall a handful. The few that have stuck – To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, Set It Up – have endured in large part because of its stars’ charisma, without which a romcom has little hope.

Designed so that the heel and ball of the foot hit the ground at the same level, the shoes enable their wearers to move as naturally as possible (imagine a caveman chasing a Smilodon wearing goatskins on his feet and you’ll get the idea). It’s also a trend currently running out of the locker room and pounding a course for your feet.</p><p>At the athletic end of the spectrum is Vivobarefoot. The company produces ultra thin-soled shoes designed to be worn while jogging (mercifully devoid of the defined toes found on their counterparts) as well as barefoot desert boots and loafers. The brand’s strapline: “Reconnect your feet with the ground, and move in the ways that nature inte

<p>Arsenal’s left-back is loving the food, ‘crazy’ football culture and challenge of the Champions League on loan at Real Sociedad</p><p>“See, just me saying this, I can see my mates saying: ‘You’ve changed, man.’” Kieran Tierney starts laughing. He knows but he can’t help it and if they were where he is, they wouldn’t either, he’s sure of that. The defender is talking <em>txuleton</em>, the Basque T‑bone. “I’m not big on taking pictures of food but every time I get one of those, I do: it’s different class. And there’s a dish that’s rice and clams,” he says, which is when he checks himself and cracks up, imagining pals back in Scotland shaking their heads. “Rice with clams?! You never got that growing up. But it tastes unbelievable, man.”</p><p>Things are going well in Spain, then? “I love every part of it,” Tierney says. Well, maybe not <em><em>every</em></em> part: there have been two hamstring tears, first against Athletic Club in late September then against Celta Vigo at

<p>My son says it means taking out the player without getting the ball, all while shouting ‘Brexit means Brexit’. Sound familiar?</p><p>For the umpteenth time, my son, with an Ikea stuffed ball he has had since infancy, is playing football in the living room. He is joined by one of his best friends, an equally football-obsessed 10-year-old who, before slide-tackling in what can only be described as a deliberate attempt to knock my son’s legs off, shouts: “Brexit means Brexit!” Confused, I pass it off as an example of tweenage precocity: which 10-year-old is happy to quote Theresa May while playing football?</p><p>Over the next year, however, I will hear the term used again and again when my son plays football at the local park. He turns 11 and is off to secondary school. There, too, the phrase seems to have become a “thing”.

Left to my own devices, however, there are only a handful of things I actually enjoy making for myself, and they tend to be things that undergo a magical transformation towards the end of the cooking, when they suddenly reveal themselves in all their deliciousness. The egg is a perfect example: fairly unpalatable raw, the fast application of heat turns it into something irresistible. The bean, meanwhile, is its much more patient counterpoint. Pulses are excellent: they are cheap, nutritious, good for the environment and for us, and wonderfully pleasing when cooked right. In many cases, they do need t

<p>Being cheated on feels like the end of the world. It takes hard work, but relationships can survive</p><p>The trouble with romantic betrayal – apart from the obvious pain – is that it is the salacious lifeblood of everything from tabloid headlines and box sets to true crime podcasts. Because of this, there is a tendency to view it in highly dramatic terms. That is fine when we are snuggled up on the sofa watching other people’s heartbreak at a distance, but less helpful when it arrives closer to home.</p><p>“He’s a cheater,” gossiped one friend recently about a mutual acquaintance’s partner. “She needs to throw him out and change the locks.” Well, maybe. But the man in question is a mild-mannered accountant who had, in the space of six months, lost his mother and his job.

<p>The electrifying story of a couple who set out on an ocean adventure – and got far more than they bargained for</p><p>When Maurice and Maralyn Bailey decided to build a boat and sail to the other side of the world, it was not on a whim. The couple from Derby had long hankered for adventures that would lift them out of their dreary suburban existence. Over six years, they diligently studied boat designs, routes, timetables and supplies. They gave up their jobs, sold their bungalow and the bulk of their belongings, and oversaw the building of a boat they called “Auralyn”, a composite of their first names. Auralyn would have no radio transmitter as Maurice was keen “to preserve their freedom from outside interference”.</p><p>By the time they set off for New Zealand in the summer of 1972, Maurice and Maralyn were confident sailors who had considered every eventuality. But even they couldn’t have anticipated a 40ft sperm whale, injured and in distress, smashing into their boat

<p>From side planks to standing on one leg while brushing your teeth, these are the key activities you should focus on to keep your joints in good shape</p><p>Children’s bones aren’t fully set, which makes them much less likely to suffer long-term problems after injury, even breaks. “They’ve got growth plates, which allow bones to get longer and develop,” says Mehmet Gem, a specialist hip physio and regional lead at Pure Physiotherapy in Exeter, speaking via the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy. The only drawback comes if a child plays their favourite sport too much and the plates become irritated. “If you have someone who plays tons of football, they might develop heel or knee pain.” If this happens, they can keep doing the activity, only less of it, “within what the pain permits and without further irritation. The less that they avoid, the better, so they stay strong and don’t feel scared to then get back to it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/
