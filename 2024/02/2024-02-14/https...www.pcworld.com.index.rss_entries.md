<p>Mozilla is best known for its Firefox browser, but compared to rivals, it&rsquo;s not nearly as popular. As part of the company&rsquo;s efforts to turn its attention back to Firefox, several of its standalone products are taking a hit&mdash;including a couple of stellar ones that provided extra anonymity online.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/13/mozilla-downsizes-as-it-refocuses-on-firefox-and-ai-read-the-memo/&amp;xcust=2-2-2236356-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">TechCrunch</a> on Tuesday, Mozilla is &ldquo;scaling back&rdquo; its attention to Mozilla VPN, Relay, and Online Footprint Scrubber, following the layoff of approximately 60 employees.

<p>Over the past few years we&rsquo;ve tested a good number of VPN services for the PC and compiled them into a list of our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">best VPN picks</a>. But we&rsquo;ve also done extensive VPN testing for Android apps, checking for performance, privacy policies, and extra features to see which service comes out on top on Google&rsquo;s mobile OS. While some services are good on any platform, others particularly shine when used on Android devices, and we&rsquo;ve curated a list of our recommendations to help you choose.</p>



<p>When determining the best VPNs for Android, we consider several criteria. First, it&rsquo;s crucial that it is a top performer on the OS. Also, since Wi-Fi can be inconsistent at times, we test these apps over the course of three days, running

<p>Back in my post-college days, a group of (single) friends would gather to celebrate Anti-Valentines Day, shunning anyone who had coupled up. It was an excuse to party, basically. But had the world offered it to us, we might have downloaded the HeartBlocker plugin for Opera GX.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.opera.com/gx/heartblocker&amp;xcust=2-2-2236277-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">HeartBlocker</a> works by filtering out words and imagery attached to Valentine&rsquo;s Day and replacing them with something less&hellip; precious. The plugin has two options: Normal Mode, which takes a more neutral approach, and &ldquo;Emo Mode&rdquo; &mdash; which dials up the angst in a big way. Think rain, dark colors, the works. </p>

<p>In recent years Chromebooks have entered the mainstream. No longer are they used to just run Google apps or access the internet. Chromebooks are capable of just about every productivity task that a Windows or MacOS laptop performs, and often for a more affordable price. They&rsquo;re also renowned for having long battery life and sturdy designs. Google has done a great job developing Chrome OS to be perfect for everyday tasks like working on documents and spreadsheets, browsing the web, and checking email. So if affordability and ease of use are what you&rsquo;re after, a Chromebook is likely to be the answer.</p>



<p>We understand that Chromebooks come in all sorts of varieties and with that in mind we&rsquo;ve curated a list of our favorites broken down by price points, feature sets, and intended use. Whatever your needs may be, PCWorld has you cover

Walmart&rsquo;s selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Lenovo-Legion-5-15-6-WQHD-165Hz-Gaming-Laptop-AMD-Ryzen-7-7735H-16GB-RAM-512GB-SSD-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-4060-8GB-Storm-Grey/5033748027&amp;xcust=2-1-2236087-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Lenovo Legion 5 for just $869.99</a>, which is a savings of $130. This machine is pretty powerful for the price, as it&rsquo;s packing an AMD Ryzen 7 7735H CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU. It also has loads of connectivity options as well as a spacious screen. According to the reviews on Walmart, this machine disperses heat well and the storage and RAM are easy to upgrade.</p>

<p>There are a ton of handheld, PC-based gaming machines on the market now, and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2177159/lenovo-legion-go-review-impressive-handheld-pc-flawed-ui.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go</a> is easily the most unique of the devices following in the wake of the Steam Deck. With a much larger screen, detachable Switch-style controls, and other little touches like dual USB-C ports, it&rsquo;s certainly a lot more adventurous than its fellows in terms of design. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the best of the bunch, and Adam Patrick Murray is going to tell us why in the latest PCWorld video on YouTube. </p>



<p>First of all, the Legion Go lacks a bit when it comes to the &ldquo;Go&rdquo; factor. Relatively heavy weight and a sharp edge on the top of the device make it noticeably less c

<p>Logitech&rsquo;s MX series of mice and keyboards are some of the best-regarded on the market.

<p>Slack will soon begin rolling out what it calls &ldquo;Slack AI&rdquo; to its customers, featuring smart search, channel recaps, and summaries &mdash; and a number of caveats, too.</p>



<p>Slack has been trying to integrate AI into its conversational interface for about a year now, and some of this sounds pretty familiar. Slack was talking about <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1807402/slack-gpt-will-bring-ai-chatbots-to-your-conversations.html">a &ldquo;Slack GPT&rdquo; app last spring</a>, with the eventual rollout of a sales-based AI, Einstein GPT, to leverage parent Salesforce&rsquo;s CRM technology. That&rsquo;s part of the message that Slack is reiterating today.</p>



<p>Some of what Slack is talking about makes sense. For one, Slack plans to launch an AI-powered &ldquo;smart search&rdquo; that hopefully solves one of the problems that

<p>Most people respect others&rsquo; privacy, but data brokers don&rsquo;t&mdash;not even remotely. They vacuum up information about everyone from existing databases and public records alike, then put it up for sale. End result: Your personal details, like where you live and your known relatives, become easily found on the internet.</p>



<p>You can request to have your information made private by using opt-out forms on each site, but data brokers have proliferated on the web like weeds. Take yourself off one website, and you&rsquo;re still on dozens (if not hundreds) of others&hellip;and you might reappear on the original site if those data brokers find new data about you.&nbsp;</p>
