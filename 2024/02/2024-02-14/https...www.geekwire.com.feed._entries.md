Planette&#8217;s AI-boosted technology is designed to help businesses plan for weather and climate risks that could impact resources and operations. There are a flurry of other weather forecasting startups but Planette says it differentiates by focusing on &#8220;near-term forecasts&#8221; — producing quarterly or seasonal reports, for example, versus week-to-week forecasts or longer-term climate predictions. The Bay Area startup is led by co-founders Dr. Hansi Singh and Dr. Kalai Ramea. The two have expertise in climate and atmospheric sciences, AI, machine learning, and quantitative modeling.

Microsoft and OpenAI say they&#8217;re doing their best to keep it from happening. That&#8217;s the takeaway from a new research report issued by the companies this morning, detailing the use of large language models by nation-state attackers affiliated with China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. &#8220;These actors generally sought to use OpenAI services for querying open-source information, translating, finding coding errors, and running basic coding tasks,&#8221; OpenAI said in&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-and-openai-say-theyre-watching-and-thwarting-ai-use-b

Breakwater Ventures is coming out of stealth after launching last year. Founded by former investors at SeaChange, the pre-seed and seed firm has raised $10 million for its first fund and is already deploying cash. &#8220;Not enough capital exists to satiate the needs of the companies that are rising in our ecosystem,&#8221; said William Finney, founding partner at Breakwater. Finney was previously managing partner at SeaChange, another early stage Seattle-based investment firm that is no longer active.
