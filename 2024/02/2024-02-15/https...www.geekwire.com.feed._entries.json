The idea is to secure reliability and prevent unintended outputs when working with large language models and other AI-related apps. Founded last year, Guardrails is led by CEO and co-founder Shreya Rajpal, a longtime AI engineer who built self-driving tech at Drive.ai and autonomous systems at Apple. Seattle tech vet Diego Oppenheimer is also a co-founder of Guardrails.
