Because a migrant teen beat up some <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nypd-attacked-by-migrants" target="_blank">cops </a>and was charged with second-degree assault. But he was released because no human is illegal in New York City. He then assaulted a security officer after he tried to rob a Macy‚Äôs on Tuesday. And I am sure you can guess that he was subsequently released.<br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

She didn‚Äôt even try to be disrespectful, she was generally confused. But the woke mob cannot even begin to deal with someone who asks for ‚Äúclarity‚Äù because they don‚Äôt even know how to clarify that nonsense. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

But ironically, their policies hurt the very people they claim to help, with the most vulnerable and innocent population taking the worst hurt. </p><p>In most states, if someone gets high on fentanyl or other drugs their children are removed from the home until the parents get their act together and can provide a safe and loving home for the child. The reason that addicts cannot provide for children is so painfully obvious that I never thought I would have to explain that to anyone. But every day progressives surprise us with the new levels of idiocy they reach. </p><p>Moronic Democrats thought that it was the ‚Äúcompassionate‚Äù thing to do by passing legislation that allows the drug-addicted and homeless t

	Coming off of Kansas City's deadliest year on record, chaos erupted at the Kansas City Chiefs victory parade. One person died, and over twenty more were injured when people started shooting.

Apparently in the eyes of the Left, this shows that he thinks "both sides are equally bad." </p><p>I should point out that the "three idiots on X-Twitter having the same dumb opinion" standard is in effect. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jon-stewart-biden-criticizing-white-house-1235824591/" target="_blank">The Hollywood Reporter, a mainstream "news" outlet used those three idiots to create content</a>.

Well, those things happen all the time in the wild. That is because hyenas are not strong animals and must go after easy prey. Otherwise, they would likely not stand a chance against the rulers of the jungle. </p><p>This makes these opportunistic feeders pretty pathetic since they can‚Äôt even win against someone their size. But it‚Äôs not only that, they attack in packs. But sometimes, the little guy has to stand up to these bullies. </p><p>A very adorable and brave lion cub tried to stand up to a clan.
