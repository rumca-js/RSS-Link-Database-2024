Can’t say we didn’t warn everyone. Last summer we pointed out that Sarah Silverman and a bunch of other authors suing AI companies for copyright infringement seemed to only demonstrate that they didn’t understand how copyright works.

As lots of folks are reporting, Senator Richard Blumenthal, this morning, released an updated version of the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA).

Blumenthal, as he always [&#8230;]

Cops shouldn&#8217;t be able to arrest you for saying things to them, even if they&#8217;re things they don&#8217;t like. But it still happens with alarming frequency. This is unconstitutional retaliation. But even if courts admit that much, if this retaliation doesn&#8217;t match up with the facts of a previous case they&#8217;ve handled, they&#8217;ll acknowledge the [&#8230;]

What is going on at Wired Magazine? A few years ago, the magazine went on a bit of a binge with some articles that completely misrepresented Section 230. While I felt those articles were extraordinarily misleading, at least they seemed to mostly live in the world of facts. Its latest piece goes so far beyond [&#8230;]

And here we go again. I have spent some time pointing out that the Xbox team has demonstrated an unfortunate inability to properly communicate both internally and externally about its various plans.
