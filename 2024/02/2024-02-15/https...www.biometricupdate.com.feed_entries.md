		An investigation of the relationship between humanitarian organizations and the private sector by Access Now makes a case that even assessing the ethics of corporate involvement is rendered difficult by a lack of transparency.

Humanitarian projects’ use of biometrics and digital ID are one among four areas of technology focussed on in “<a href="https://www.accessnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Mapping-humanitarian-tech-February-2024.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mapping Humanitarian Tech: exposing protection gaps in digital transformation programmes</a>” for their importance to digital rights.

Access Now argues that more disclosure is needed around procurement, data protection impact as

		Add “sextortion” to the lexicon of online threats prompting movement in the digital ID and age verification space. Wizz, the France-based social media app that matches people of similar ages similar to how Tinder matches potential romantic interests, is leveraging <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/yoti">Yoti</a>’s biometric technology for new mandatory user verification measures, in an attempt to ensure the app remains a “safe space for young people” amid shifting regulations.

A release from Wizz says new safety features added in its latest version include user verification that matches a selfie registered during onboarding with a user’s profile image, to ensure all users have been verified. Additional safeguards include content filters and moderat

		An investigation has been launched in the Philippines into corruption allegations against Land Transportation Office (LTO) Chief Assistant Secretary Vigor Mendoza II.

The LTO is responsible for driver’s license applications and other services that involve biometric authentication. The agency awarded a contract to Dermalog and local partners back in 2018, and has been <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/dermalog-addresses-call-for-investigation-bad-press-in-philippines">criticized</a> for delays in comments by government officials that were subsequently walked back.

		Ugandan lawmakers are worried that the rollout of the country’s new generation of biometric national ID cards by June 1, already late by one year, could face further problems due to hiccups in preparations and a lack of adequate funding for the project.

The lawmakers have also pointed to the inadequate number of enrollment staff of the National Identification Registration Authority (NIRA) and delays in procuring equipment as some of the problems requiring expedient action.

These concerns were raised this week as Uganda’s State Minister for Internal Affairs, General David Muhoozi, was in parliament to explain the project and the timeline for its implementation, Monitor <a href="https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/registration-for-upgraded-national-ids-t

A PIL, very common in the legal systems of India and Pakistan, is a case or petition filed to a court of law to either protect, safeguard or enforce public interest on an issue of wide concern.

		The agency that administers the U.S. immigration service says it cut its caseload backlog 15 percent year over year in fiscal 2023.

Biometrics are collected as part of the immigration application process, and automation of that process played a supporting role in the reported improvement in the caseload and customer experience.

It’s the first time in 10 years that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/us-dhs-awards-407m-immigration-biometrics-contract-to-amentum">USCIS</a>, had reduced its backlog.

The Garante has imposed a €50,000 (~US$54K) fine on the municipality of Trento in the Italian Alps, for overstepping legality in scientific research for its EU-funded smart city projects. Of particular issue were the initiatives dubbed Marvel and Protector. Marvel involved algorithmic monitoring of public video and audio surveillance footage for potential risks to public safety.

		<em>By Vincent Guillevic, Head of Fraud Labs at</em><a href="https://www.onfido.com"> <em>Onfido</em></a>

Has identity fraud experienced a coup? AI-powered synthesised media attacks, commonly referred to as deepfakes, have turned the fraud landscape on its head, <a href="https://onfido.com/landing/identity-fraud-report/">spiking 3000% in 12 months</a> and dominating discussions around what may destabilise digital integrity and trust in the years to come.

Deepfakes are fast becoming the tactic du jour for fraud. The increased availability of generative AI and face-swap apps are enabling cybercriminals to significantly increase their deepfake fraud attempts by impersonation. It can enable fraudsters to manipulate someone’s facial expression, voice, body lang
