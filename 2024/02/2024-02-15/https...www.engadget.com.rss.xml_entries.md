<p>Game Pass, Microsoft’s subscription service for games, has 34 million subscribers as of February 2024. Microsoft revealed the number in a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/02/15/xbox-promise-bring-more-games-to-more-players/">blog post</a> where it shared its plan about the future of the Xbox business.</p>
<p>The latest number reveals that Game Pass growth has slowed down drastically. It took Microsoft three years since Game Pass launched in 2017 to get to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-game-pass-10-million-subscribers-114529988.html">10 million</a> subscribers in April 2020.

<p>The first Activision Blizzard game to join Xbox Game Pass will be <em>Diablo IV</em>, and it's due to land on March 28. The move means <em>Diablo IV</em> will be playable on Xbox and PC at no extra charge to Game Pass members — of which there are 34 million, Xbox <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-confirms-four-of-its-games-are-coming-to-more-popular-consoles-201419203.html">announced today</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Times are a-changing at Xbox. The brand's leaders have confirmed plans to bring more Xbox games to other platforms, most likely PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. Both consoles have a far larger install base than Xbox Series X/S, which are estimated to have shipped a combined 27 million units, compared with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-predicts-itll-sell-fewer-ps5s-than-first-thought-091816189.html">54.8 million PS5s</a> and <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-switch-nears-140-million-lifetime-sales-tops-122-million-annual-playing-users">nearly 140 million Switches</a>.</p>

<p>OpenAI on Thursday announced Sora, a brand new model that generates high-definition videos up to one minute in length from text prompts. Sora, which means “sky” in Japanese, won’t be available to the general public any time soon. Instead, OpenAI is making it available to a small group of academics and researchers who will assess harm and its potential for misuse.</p>
<p>“Sora is able to generate complex scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details of the subject and background,” the company said <a href="https://openai.com/sora"><ins>on its website</ins></a>. “The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt, but also how those things exist in the physical world.”</p>

<p>YouTube just released a new feature that lets <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-shorts-remix/"><ins>users remix music videos</ins></a> and turn them into Shorts. This allows you to adjust various parameters from a full-length music video to create something wholly unique. Does this sound like TikTok? It definitely sounds like TikTok.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. Just tap “remix” on a music video. You’ll be presented with four options: Sound, Green Screen, Cut and Collab. You can only pick one, so choose wisely. The Sound tool does what you think. It strips the audio and lets you use it in your own YouTube Short. This is the kind of thing that’s hugely popular on TikTok, with many users lip-syncing to various audio clips. This Sound tool is available to any music video and most songs that were automatically uploaded to the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg has posted his own review of Apple's Vision Pro on Instagram, coming inexplicably for our jobs here at Engadget.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unsurprisingly-zuck-thinks-the-quest-3-is-a-better-product-than-apples-vision-pro-104001890.html">video</a> shot direct from a Meta Quest 3 (oh of course), Zuckerberg didn't mince his words. He said he expected the Quest to be the better value for most people, because it's &quot;like seven times less expensive&quot; than the $3,500 Vision Pro. Eventually, he concluded that the Quest 3 was “the better product, period.&quot;</p>
<p>Zuckerberg thinks the Quest is &quot;a lot more comfortable,&quot; noting that the headset’s field of view is wider and has a brighter display than the Vision Pro. He added that the Quest had a bigger library: Meta’s Quest, unlike the Vision Pro, has access to the YouTube and Xbox apps. And that’s definitely a fair criticism.</p>

<p>The team hopes to eventually offer a cheaper and more sustainable source of protein with a much lower carbon footprint than actual beef. It’ll also save time for those who enjoy a nice beef bowl over rice—the rice <em>is</em> the beef bowl.</p>

<p>Last month, Bose took an interesting approach to debuting a new product when it launched its Ultra Open Earbuds exclusively <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-clip-onto-your-ears-and-cost-300-172544076.html">through a collaboration</a> with fashion company Kith. Now, Bose is back with its own version, nixing the co-branding while keeping the same price. For both varieties, the $299 Ultra Open Earbuds sit outside of your ear canal and clip onto the ridge of your ear to stay in place. Due to the open nature of the design, active noise cancellation (ANC) is moot, but Bose does bring its Immersive Audio tech to the table for spatial sound.</p>
<p>Bose has gone the “open” route before, debuting the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-sport-open-earbuds-review-180058380.html">Sport Open Earbuds</a> in 2021.

The first robot vacuums had steep price tags, and you can still find high-end robo-vacs today that are worth the money for many reasons. However, their popularity over the past couple of years has led to a surge of new robot vacuum cleaners on the market that cost much less than the firsts in the category. Gone are the days where you had to spend $500 or more just to get one of these machines home. Now, some of the best budget robot vacuums come in at $300 or less. After testing dozens of robot vacuums at all price points, we’ve decided that any machine in this price range is what we’d consider to be cheap. Here’s everything you need to know before purchasing a robot vacuum while sticking to a budget, plus our top picks.</p>

<p>Intuitive Machines' Odysseus has <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1758022464326840739">started making its way to the moon</a> and could make history as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intuitive-machines-is-taking-its-shot-at-nailing-the-first-commercial-moon-landing-170024349.html">first privately built lander</a> to touch down on the lunar surface. The lander was ferried to space by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket using a booster that already had 17 flights under its belt before this one and could even fly again in the future, seeing as it had safely returned to Earth on the company's Landing Zone 1. Both SpaceX and Intuitive Machines have confirmed that Odysseus has successfully been deployed and has started its multi-day journey to the moon.&nbsp;</p>
