It doesn&rsquo;t introduce novelties in cards and dice or a new, more accessible connection to those novelties. It neither invented <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/mechanics/deckbuilding/best-games/best-deckbuilding-games">deckbuilding like Dominion</a> nor popularised worker-placement like Lords of Waterdeep.
