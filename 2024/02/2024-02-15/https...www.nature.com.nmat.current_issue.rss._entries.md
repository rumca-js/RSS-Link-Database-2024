<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 15 February 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01808-0">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01808-0</a></p>A nanoscale polymer layer formed by mucins at the surface of tumour cells protects them against immune cell attack. This shield can be circumvented through immune cell engineering, using chimeric antigen receptors to stimulate natural killer and T cells or by tethering glycocalyx-editing enzymes to immune cells.
