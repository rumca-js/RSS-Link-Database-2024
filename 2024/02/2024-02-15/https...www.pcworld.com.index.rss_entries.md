<p>Microsoft has released what appears to be the last build of the most recent &ldquo;Moment&rdquo; update to Windows 11, with some minor changes planned for PC users who live in America.</p>



<p>This new February 2024 Moment represents a fork of sorts for Windows: Customers who live in the European Economic Area will have far more flexibility to configure Windows, based upon Microsoft&rsquo;s compliance with the Digital Markets Act. U.S. customers won&rsquo;t be able to choose these options, unless they configure their PC as an EEA PC.</p>



<p>Specifically, Microsoft is releasing two Windows 11 builds, one for the current Windows 11 23H2 platform (Build 22631.3227) and one for Windows 11 22H2 (Build 22621.3227); as well as a &ldquo;February Windows Configuration Update&rdquo; (KB4035349) that will tweak a few Windows features.</p>

## No, Microsoft, Windows 11’s Start menu isn’t a ‘game changer’

<p>Microsoft is facing a problem. Years after launching Windows 11, customers simply prefer Windows 10 more. So the Windows marketing team is trying everything they can to migrate users to Windows 11 &mdash; and a recent video shows how they&rsquo;re, well, failing.</p>



<p>Look, we get it: transitioning to an unfamiliar way of doing things is hard. And if you&rsquo;re comfortable with even an inefficient way of navigating about (sorry, command-line Linux users) you&rsquo;re going to stick with it. But selling the Windows 11 with a Start menu that&rsquo;s a &ldquo;game-changer&rdquo;? Whew. No.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Start Fresh Without Stating Over&rdquo; is Microsoft&rsquo;s swing at just this. The video (embedded below) is well, oh man. </p>

<p>The best time to buy many seasonal products is the off-season when demand is low. With that in mind, take a look at this deal on Coleman&rsquo;s Weathermaster 10-person camping tent.

Either way, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001TS8Q94?tag=pcwdd-20&amp;xcust=2-1-2237713-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">today&rsquo;s price of $122.87</a> is the absolute rock bottom, having reached this point only a few times in the past year.

<p>Video editing can put quite a heavy burden on any computer. So, when shopping for a laptop for video editing, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure you&rsquo;re loading up on enough heavy hardware firepower to get the job done. While you might not need the absolute top-of-the-line gear, simply buying a gaming laptop and calling it a day is probably not going to cut it. Beyond just processor and graphics performance, serious video editors need to take into account a few things, such as the quality of the display, port selection, and onboard storage capacity.</p>

<p>AMD had a certified hit with its game-boosting Ryzen 7 5800X3D chip, sporting extra V-cache, back in 2022. The follow-ups to this design have only gotten better, and if you&rsquo;re building a PC for gaming, Ryzen chips are absolutely worth it on the high end. Today you can grab the Ryzen 9 7900X3D, AMD&rsquo;s penultimate CPU for gamers on the AM5 socket, for an unbeatable price.

<p>The new feature will hide your IP address when you&rsquo;re logged into Google Chrome, limit what data suspected trackers can see about your online habits, and redirect some content requests through privacy servers instead of sending them directly to websites.

<p>Lag is the bane and the scapegoat of PC gamers since time immemorial. There are various ways to reduce it, including some surprisingly effective local software like Nvidia Reflex. AMD tried its hand at the same trick <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2078814/amd-adrenalin-23-9-2-less-lag-in-starfield-with-new-driver.html">with its Radeon Anti-Lag+ tool&hellip;</a>but soon found itself the target of gamer wrath when the tool mistakenly tripped Valve&rsquo;s anti-cheat system and got players banned. The tool was swiftly disabled and hasn&rsquo;t been seen since, but an AMD executive says it&rsquo;s coming back soon. </p>



<p>Said executive is Frank Azor, AMD&rsquo;s chief gaming architect, whom you might recognize from PCWorld live coverage and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563626/the-full-nerd-special-episode-amd.html" rel="noreferrer

<p>A monitor arm is a device that attaches to your desk or wall and allows you to adjust the height, angle, and position of your monitor. Most monitor arms support one monitor, but some support two or more. An arm is usually a replacement for a stand. Most monitors don&rsquo;t ship with an arm included, so you&rsquo;ll have to buy it separately.</p>



<p>This raises the question: Is a monitor arm worth it? Yes, absolutely. Monitor arms have many positives and nearly zero downsides.</p>

<p>It only took three years, but Microsoft is finally fixing one of its annoyances in Windows 11&rsquo;s File Explorer.</p>



<p>The &ldquo;show more options&rdquo; double menu? No, unfortunately not. But Microsoft is at least adding explanatory labels to the icons within File Explorer, now describing what they do rather than forcing you to parse them like some unknown hieroglyphs. </p>
