From the Coast of Africa to the lush, tropical islands of the East Indies, the world of 'Skull and Bones' is a treasure trove to explore. Twitch Partner Andy Campbell (andycambellgg) joins Honest Game Trailer's head writer Bailey Meyers to teach her the ins and outs of Piracy on the Indian Ocean.

From shipbuilding, hunting and plundering, to forging temporary alliances to even the odds, Andy guides Bailey on her journey from shipwrecked nobody towards making a name for herself as a Pirate Kingpin. All while looking ultra-cool with a really dope hat and a lemur sidekick. 

Presented by Ubisoft.
