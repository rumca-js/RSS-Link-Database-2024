The Omega Expedition runs for four weeks.\n\nThe No Man's Sky Omega update also brings a complete overhaul of expeditions, new planet missions, a new pirate dreadnought, and more. Expeditions are now fully integrated into the base game and the new system allows players join expeditions with bespoke provisions, their favourite starships and custom multi-tools, and return to their main game save with rewards.\n\nFor the first time, players can also take on and defeat pirate freighters in combat, then board the Dreadnought to assume control. Talking to alien lifeforms now unlocks quests that are specific to their locale, climate, and personality, and there's a new Atlas staff, jetpack, and helmet up for grabs. Watch this No Mans Sky trailer for a closer look.\n\n#NoMansSky #Gaming #IGN", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydl7OpJbQs8", "page_rating_contents": 0, "tags": [], "source_obj__id": 210, "date_published": "2024-02-15T14:00:48+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "permanent": false, "language": null, "user": null, "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ydl7OpJbQs8/hqdefault.jpg", "page_rating": 0, "age": null}, {"artist": "IGN", "page_rating_visits": 0, "dead": false, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "vote": 0, "title": "PlayStation Pulse Elite Wireless PS5 Headset Review", "album": "", "comments": [], "description": "The PlayStation Pulse Elite headphones are true to their name and provide top-tier performance across multiple metrics.
