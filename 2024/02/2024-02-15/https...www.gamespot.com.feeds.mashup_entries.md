<p>It's a bold swing to dramatically change a formula that you know is working, but the gamble has paid off for Arrowhead Game Studios. Helldivers 2 opts for an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective as opposed to the original game's top-down view, making for a shooter that pulls you closer into the thick of its frenetic combat. This shift brings Helldivers 2's gameplay better in line with its ludicrous narrative tone, managing to create memorably explosive firefights despite the repetitive enemy types and map designs. Helldivers 2 is an incredible game--it sets out to be a rambunctious and entertaining shooter and hits that target with military precision.</p><p dir="ltr">Helldivers 2 sees you step into the patriotic boots of the titular fighting force, lowly grunts on the frontlines of an intergalactic war in defense of Super Earth. Missions take place on randomly generated planets, ranging from ice-covered tundras to lush jungles. You and your squad have a set amount of

Speaking to <a href="https://templeofgeek.com/exclusive-james-cameron-debunks-9-hour-avatar-cut/">Temple of Geek</a>, Cameron--unprompted--said he wanted to correct the online rumor, saying it stemmed from a simple misunderstanding.</p><p>"There is no nine-hour rough cut [of Avatar 3]," he said. "I would put a shotgun in my mouth if I ever did a nine-hour rough cut. What I said was it's nine hours of material, meaning Avatar 3, Avatar 4, and Avatar 5. That's three hours of movie."</p><p>A report suggested <a href="https://twitter.com/TheInSneider/status/1636477624892416003?cxt=HHwWhoCzqdfu97UtAAAA">Cameron turned in a nine-hour cut</a> of Avatar 3 and that Disney management was considering putting it on Disney+ as a mini-series after a theatrical run.

<p>Anyone looking to spread managed democracy to their fellow players in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> are out of luck, as developer Arrowhead Game Studios has no plans to introduce a PvP mode to the game, with CEO Johan Pilestedt going so far as to say that it'll "never" be added to the multiplayer shooter. The reason why? Because Arrowhead simply doesn't want to invite any toxic elements into the growing armies of Super-Earth.</p><p>"We'll 'never' add a PvP-mode," <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1757804756666339420">Pilestedt said</a> in response to a Helldivers 2 player suggesting the inclusion of the mode. "This is to reduce toxic elements from the community. We want an environment that's supportive, fun, and where we all are fighting on the same side!"</p><p>By its design, Helldivers 2 emphasizes teamwork and tactics in each squad. Friendly-fire is on by default and can't be disabled, so walking in front of a player

<p>Payday 3 developer Starbreeze said that sales and player activity for the game are at significantly lowers level than it would like. The studio is currently working with its publisher, Plaion, to implement changes.</p><p>"There are many examples from the game industry, where a problematic initial time on the market is turned into long-term success," said CEO Tobias Sjogren in Starbreeze's <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/2024-02-15-starbreeze-ab-publ-year-end-report-2023/">latest earnings report</a>. "There is no simple recipe available, but a common thread from the positive examples is to take players’ criticism to heart, dare to support your game and keeping an open and honest dialogue with your stakeholders."</p><p>He went on to explain that Payday remains a strong brand, as Payday 2 is actually faring slightly better financially than its sequel and has 400,000 active players. However, Starbreeze hopes to covert those still playing Payda

<p> LGBTQ media advocacy organization GLAAD has released its first annual report on LGBTQ representation in video games, finding that the games industry is lagging compared to the average gamer's opinions on representation.</p><p>In a study conducted with partner Nielsen Gaming, GLAAD polled gamers to find out how many identified as LGBTQ, as well as asking their opinions on representation. The survey revealed that around one in five, or 17% of active gamers are part of the LGBTQ community. This is an increase of 70% on a <a href="https://www.out.com/tech/2020/8/07/10-percent-gamers-are-lgbtq-nielsen-study-shows">Nielsen Gaming report</a> from 2020, which reported 10% of gamers were LGBTQ.</p><p>Despite the increasing numbers of LGBTQ gamers, only 2% of games include LGBTQ characters. "It is time to move past the idea that LGBTQ-inclusive games are a separate, niche category," GLAAD associate director of gaming, Blair Durkee said on the findings. "<strong></strong>All games s
