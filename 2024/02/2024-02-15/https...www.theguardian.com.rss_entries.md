He was clearly a cat of character.</p><p>We were told that he was not for rehoming, having survived cat flu and been rescued from a dysfunctional home with 22 cats, six dogs and several rabbits.

<p>During the carnival season, groups of <em>bate-bolas</em> roam the streets of their neighbourhoods in elaborate costumes</p><p>In the middle of the night, dozens of masked figures burst on to a street in a blaze of colour, each clutching a stick from which hangs a rubber ball. As they prance through a crowd of raucous onlookers, they repeatedly slam the balls against the ground with a dull thud that gets lost in the crackle of fireworks overhead.</p><p>These are Rio de Janeiro’s <em>bate-bolas</em>, or ball-slammers. In the working-class suburbs, a world away from the glitzy Sambadrome parades and beachside street parties, it is these clown-like figures who reign over the pre-Lenten revelry, delighting and frightening in equal measure with their mesmerising costumes and playful antics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/15/rio-carnival-bate-bolas-ball-slammers">Continue reading...</a>

With a playground, a bandstand and a little lake</p><p>On Sunday evening in Abidjan, the president of Cote d’Ivoire, Alassane Ouattara, was at the, er, Alassane Ouattara stadium, to watch his country win the Africa Cup of Nations. Well done, them. As for him, well, might I suggest it’s not a good look to have something named after your good self while you’re still alive? If you’ve insisted upon it, then that’s undeniably bad, but even if you’ve merely allowed it to happen, I’m afraid that’s no good either.</p><p>It wouldn’t be quite so bad if it was named after a living legend of Ivorian football, say Didier Drogba or Yaya Touré. Perhaps the two of them could have shared it. But if a politician’s got anything about them, this must be the hill they die on: thou shalt not name anything after me until after I’m dead and gone and only then if you think I really deserve it.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p

<p>A mother’s account of the life and death of James Foley, the journalist murdered by Islamic State</p><p>To westerners, the public beheading of the US journalist James Foley in Syria was grim confirmation of the brutality of Islamic State and, more specifically, of the cruelty of a trio of British militants nicknamed “the Beatles”. For Foley’s mother, Diane, who since his kidnapping two years earlier had been pressing Barack Obama’s government to rescue him or negotiate his release, his death was incomparably more painful. But that didn’t deter her from meeting Alexanda Kotey, the man found guilty of conspiracy to murder her son and three other hostages.</p><p>Warm but steely, buoyed up by Christian faith but not the least “saintly”, she wanted to see how much sorrow, if any, he felt for what he had done. The meeting took place in a Virginia courthouse in 2021, two months after the murder trial and seven years after the beheading. It was an “intimate standoff”, with Kotey s

<p>The semi-autobiographical sitcom from the musician/actor is a wonderfully surreal exercise in Black creativity. It’s a totally idiosyncratic vision that takes you on a wild ride. Buckle up!</p><p>Sidney Poiter once said he was tasked with “a terrific burden”. As the most high-profile Black actor of his era he felt he carried “the hopes and dreams of an entire people”, but in 2024, when the TV landscape has nurtured the talents of Will Smith, Issa Rae, Tracee Ellis Ross and Quinta Brunson, Black talent’s burden seems less terrific. Clearly musician/comedian/actor Vince Staples doesn’t feel the pressure to be the respectable role model that Poitier felt he needed to be, judging by his self-titled sitcom – in which he really lets his freak flag fly.</p><p>Staples’s latest project embraces the weird, with this self-titled, surreal comedy – in which his protagonist navigates the dream-logic of a disquieting reality. He plays a fictionalised version of himself, a successful perf

<p>Stories within a story tease readers and characters alike in Oyeyemi’s shape‑shifting hen weekend tale</p><p>Helen Oyeyemi’s latest novel is a story about stories; a tale that unpicks and exposes the threads that tie tales together. It’s set in Prague, with the city functioning as backdrop, cipher and, even, at times, narrator; the main characters slip, slide and transmute, and the bit-part players reappear in different roles and get-ups, like actors in a travelling theatre. Time in this city warps and winds backwards, contributing to the sense of the&nbsp;novel, and Prague itself, as a switchback ride: a “non-stop paternoster lift” that carries its passengers in circles rather than launching them along straight lines. The themes are love, history, identity, and – most fundamentally of all – the essential subjectivity of the act of reading; the notion that, when we open a book, we’ll each discover something different inside. Which, to be frank, makes for an interestingly h

The couple, both senior tech company executives who had returned to Greece after years in London, were in hospital with their daughter.</p><p>“Niovi was two and sick with bronchitis,” said Kalfaki, who heads the public sector division of Google Cloud in Athens. “Naturally we both wanted to be with her but when the doctors asked ‘Who is the mother?’ and they heard ‘We both are’, their response was ‘That’s legally not possible’ and they refused to let Christina in. There was a terrible scene as she argued and implored but they were adamant. Only I, as Niovi’s birth mother, could be with her.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/15/gay-greeks-mps-vote-on-legalising-same
