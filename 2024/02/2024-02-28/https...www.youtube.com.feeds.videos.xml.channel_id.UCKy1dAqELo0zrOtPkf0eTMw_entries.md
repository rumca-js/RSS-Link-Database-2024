Matt Reeves' sequel to The Batman is expected to begin production in England later this year, but one of its stars has yet to receive the script. Actor Jefferey Wright, who portrayed Jim Gordon in the first movie, told Variety, "I have not read the script. I have not received the script. I’m waiting patiently. But I’ll tell you what? As soon as I get it, I’ll call you. I’ll send a copy right over to you. On the off chance that Matt Reeves hears this, the hairs on the back of his neck are going to stand up." It is kinda odd that he hasn’t received the script for #TheBatman, given that filming for #TheBatmanPart2 is expected to begin in a few months. But maybe his role might be reduced? Not sure what’s going on there, but we’ll for sure see Jim Gordon in the Batman Part 2 film, it’s just a matter of how prominent will his role be in the movie? But there’s always secrecy regarding these superhero scripts, so it could just be Matt Reeves and company holding off till the time is r

In today's Daily Fix:
PlayStation Plus games for March have been revealed, and leading the charge is the excellent Destiny 2 expansion, The Witch Queen. Also on the list is the action game Sifu, and if you love kung-fu movies, you'll like that game. You also get Hello Neighbor 2, EA Sports F1 23, a bunch of cosmetics for The Finals, and more! In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is out now in Japan, but if you bought the physical edition you might have a confusing time installing the game. That's because the 'play' and 'install' discs are labeled wrong. Whoops. And finally, Skull & Bones is apparently doing well according to Ubisoft, who are reporting "record player engagement." But we don't have any sales data for the game yet, so it could be like 20 people playing that game all day.

Shōgun reviewed by Samatha Nelson on FX/Hulu.

Shōgun is television at its best, using its budget to create a gorgeous, immersive world but never letting spectacle detract from its emphasis on complex character arcs. The performances are compelling, aided by writing that flows from crude humor to poetic drama in a way that brings depth to protagonists and even minor characters. The series seamlessly blends intrigue, humor, romance and action in a beautifully executed limited series that keeps delivering surprises until its perfect ending.
