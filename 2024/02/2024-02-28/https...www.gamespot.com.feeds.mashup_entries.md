<p>Electronic Arts has announced that it will be laying off 5% of its staff, or around 670 employees, based on its stated headcount total of 13,400 in 2023. The company will also start "sunsetting" an unspecified number of games and move away from developing certain licensed IP games.</p><p> EA explained that it does not believe that some future licensed IP would be successful "in our changing industry." Among the licenses that EA works with are Star Wars and the NFL, although it's unclear if games related to either of those will be impacted.</p><p>"This greater focus allows us to drive creativity, accelerate innovation, and double down on our biggest opportunities," said CEO Andrew Wilson in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/continuing-to-evolve-our-business-and-teams">press release</a>.

Cortana had taken full control of Master Chief as the first season ended, with the enhanced soldier giving up control of himself to the AI. When Season 2 rolled around, not only had a time jump meant that Cortana was no longer anywhere near Master Chief, but she wasn't even played by the same actress.</p><p dir="ltr">In Season 2, Jen Taylor--who has played Cortana in the Halo games for over two decades--is no longer doing motion capture for the role.

<p>Reacher star Alan Ritchson has revealed he auditioned for the original Thor movie, but his approach to the try-out, looking back on it in hindsight, might have prevented him from getting the part. He told <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a46663668/alan-ritchson-reacher-interview/">Men's Health</a> that he "didn't take it seriously" because he thought he had the physique required for the role and not much else would matter to the casting department.</p><p>"I was like, 'They'll throw me the part if I look like the guy; nobody really cares about acting,'" he said.</p><p>The casting team for Thor apparently informed Ritchson after his audition that it was his part to lose but he didn't show enough "craft" to get the role. In the end, Chris Hemsworth landed the part, beating out his own brother, Liam, for the role. Chris Hemsworth later admitted that his first audition for the part <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chris-hemsworth-almost-didnt-play-tho

<p dir="ltr">It seems like Winston actor Ian McShane is okay spilling blood on The Continental--the Peacock show, that is. In a new interview, the John Wick star plainly states his distaste for the creation of the three-episode series that focuses on his character's origins.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://movieweb.com/ian-mcshane-the-continental-john-wick-cash-grab/">MovieWeb</a>, McShane says he "wouldn't watch it." He adds: "I have no intentions--nobody--I don't think Keanu [Reeves] watched it, neither has Chad [Stahelski, director of the John Wick movies]. It had nothing to do with our movies. It's just a question of a TV company cashing in on the series and taking the option to [air?]. They never asked us about anything, so why would I be interested in seeing it?"</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4265913-johnwickwinston.jpg"><img alt="Ian McShane portrays Continental manager Winston in the

<p>The hits just don't stop coming, as THQ Nordic has downplayed rumors of a classic Shrek video game getting a remake. Originally posted on Reddit's Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit, the poster claimed to have inside knowledge of the Shrek 2 remake--it was originally released on the GameCube, PS2, and Xbox in 2004--thanks to them having a friend inside of THQ Nordic's PR department.</p><p>"If you remember last year the head of Illumination announced that sister studio Dreamworks was rebooting Shrek and that he was involved. Around this time, THQ Nordic entered discussions with Universal to acquire the rights to more of their IP," the unsourced post read.

<p> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a>'s latest update dropped this week ahead of the launch of a new Stuff Pack, and players aren't happy about one of the new features added. A new "packs you may like" icon has been added to the top of the UI, encouraging players to buy expansion packs directly in game.</p><p>The new icon is in a prominent position in the game's UI, next to the icons for navigating between Build Mode, Manage Worlds, and the Gallery. Labelled "packs you may like" on hover, the new feature suggests a selection of packs available for purchase, allowing you to buy them directly from live gameplay, instead of having to exit to the main menu.</p><p>In my game, the menu showed a selection of four packs I don't already own, including both major Expansion Packs and smaller Stuff Packs. Purchasing any packs other than those recommended still requires navigating to the main menu.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-
