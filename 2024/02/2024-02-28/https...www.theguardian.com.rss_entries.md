<p>An outstanding junior runner, Bell returned to the sport via her local parkrun and will compete at the world indoors his weekend</p><p>“I think it was good old parkrun, really,” says Georgia Bell, as she explains her extraordinary journey from occasional runner during lockdown to earning selection for Great Britain for the first time at the age of 30 – while also holding down a full-time job working with artificial intelligence. “I got back into enjoying running for fun and fitness. Then, when I started to feel a little bit fitter, I wanted to see how fast I could go.”</p><p>The answer, it turns out, was very fast indeed. Bell has won all six of her races this indoor season, and goes into the World Athletics Indoor Championships this weekend with the fourth fastest time in the women’s 1500m field this year, having set multiple personal bests.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/28/georgia-bell-ai-parkrun-team-gb-place-olympics-world-indoor-championships

Now, an addictive new podcast aims to finally get to the bottom of it – with preposterous results</p><p>In 2011, a Brazilian blog called Avril Está Morta (Avril is Dead) put forth a ludicrous theory. What if Avril Lavigne wasn’t Avril Lavigne? What if she had been replaced by a lookalike shortly after the release of her debut album, 2002’s Let Go, and this lookalike had pursued her career for nearly a decade?</p><p>The theory quickly caught fire online. The story goes that Lavigne was plunged into a deep depression after the death of her grandfather and, her stresses compounded by the pressures of fame, killed herself in 2002. But the cynical, money-grubbing record executives who controlled her career couldn’t let go of this cash cow, so they drafted in a lookalike named Melissa to play Lavigne.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/28/is-avril-lavigne-really

<p>The evils of empire are brought to life in this fascinating imagining of Orwell’s days as a colonial policeman, but the perspective of Burmese people is sidelined</p><p>George Orwell’s years as a colonial policeman in Burma in the 1920s preoccupied him for the rest of his life. Straight out of Eton, he was thrown into a world that mirrored the public school with its rivalries and floggings; except that now it was the Burmese people who were being flogged. He wrote about it repeatedly: in his 1934 novel Burmese Days, several essays, and passages devoted to Burma in The Road to Wigan Pier. Even on his deathbed he was writing notes for a novella about Burma entitled A Smoking Room Story. Now, Paul Theroux has taken on this material, with a novel that explores Burma as the place where Eric Blair became George Orwell.</p><p>There has been so much written about Orwell recently, from DJ Taylor’s casually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/01/orwell-by-dj-taylor-r

Perhaps more unusually for the US, however, it also kicks off an election in which the foreign policy stakes are far higher than usual, and one in which the two presidential rivals offer radically different visions of the US’s role in the world.</p><p>Political scientists have long known that American voters do not typically vote on foreign policy issues, which pale in comparison with economic or social issues. In 2024, however, that rule is not likely to hold. A plethora of recent polls suggest that Americans are increasingly concerned about foreign policy; one survey found that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2024
