But an often-overlooked variable that can greatly affect the experience is a decent gaming headset. It&rsquo;s especially important if you plan on getting the best out of multiplayer games, where you&rsquo;re just as likely to use your headset to chat with friends as you are to use it as a strategic tool to help you win. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you&rsquo;d expect, there&rsquo;s no shortage of gaming headsets out there. No one wants to wade through the myriad options only to settle on one that ends up leaving you disappointed.

It is called <em>Scheduling </em>and allows you to send emails at a later time. The basic idea, of course, is that you can email others at a more convenient time, but you can also use the feature to email yourself.

At last year&rsquo;s MWC, Xiaomi demonstrated its impressive charging technology, which pumped a Redmi mobile phone with 4,300 mAh to a full charge with a whopping 300 watts in just five minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As fascinating as those figures above are, many smartphone users are becoming increasingly concerned. After all, can this be healthy for the mobile phone battery? A legitimate question, which we address in this article.
