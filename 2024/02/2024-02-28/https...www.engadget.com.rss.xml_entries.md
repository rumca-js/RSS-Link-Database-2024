<p>Apple has reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-car-project-is-reportedly-dead-203012885.html">pulled down the shutters on Project Titan</a>, its initiative to build the future of transportation. If the reports are accurate, the project chewed through billions of dollars and several high-profile leaders as its mission shifted and shifted again. What may have started as a control-free autonomous vehicle was eventually <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-car-apparently-still-exists-could-debut-in-2028-with-reduced-autonomy-203458008.html">scaled down to a generic EV</a> but, ya know, <em>made by Apple</em>. But, I’ll be honest, I never believed we’d see an Apple Car in the real world, because it seemed so impossibly far-fetched as to be fictional.</p>

<p>Nowadays, companies like Apple, Samsung and others are attempting to curb e-waste by not including USB phone chargers with the purchase of a new handset. This means you actually need to think about which one you should get instead, and how much you ought to spend. But it’s not all bad, because if you pick the right charging brick, it can act as a multi-purpose device that can top up a variety of gadgets while also reducing how much gear you need to carry while traveling.<br /><br />That said, before you buy anything, there are some important things to consider. First, are you looking for a fast charger strictly to pair with your phone, or do you want something that can charge a tablet or laptop as well? And if you do want an adapter for use with a notebook, you’ll need to account for its power draw (ultraportables typically only need a 65-watt brick, while beefier systems may require 100 watts or more).<br /><br />Alternatively, if you want something that can recharge a bu

<p>After roughly a decade, multiple leadership changes and a regular spot in Apple rumor reports, the Apple Car project, internally known as Project Titan, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-car-project-is-reportedly-dead-203012885.html">could well be dead</a>. A new report from<em> Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman says Apple has officially canceled the car, breaking the news to nearly 2,000 employees working on it.</p>
<p>Apple will reportedly move “many employees working on the car” to the company’s artificial intelligence division where they will focus on generative AI projects, which Apple is expected to share more about later this year.</p>
<p>Leaks over the years revealed the company’s ambitions to expand into a brand-new product category. At the beginning of the project in 2014, Apple wanted to build a fully self-driving car without pedals or a steering wheel, with a remote command center ready to take over for a driver. More recently, Apple pared down its ambitio

## This is what the Nothing Phone 2(a) looks like

<p>Nothing's drip feed of specs and line drawings gets us to this point. At MWC 2024, the company finally revealed its next phone in the flesh during its MWC soiree. Sadly, it was in a glass box — which seems to be the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unveils-the-galaxy-ring-as-a-way-to-simplify-everyday-wellness-080134421.html">not-great trend of this year's Mobile World Congress</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<div id="d2de3ac98ded4cfe961421ddc01d5819"></div>
<p>But, for a phone seemingly pitched as its cheapest device yet, it looks good. Cool, even. The Nothing design DNA is fully there, with an admittedly scaled-back version of its light-up Glyphs on the rear. The phone will seemingly mark the return of a centralized camera unit, gasp! What's next, a headphone socket?</p>

<p>President Joe Biden has signed an executive order that aims to limit the mass-sale of Americans’ personal data to “countries of concern,” including Russia and China. The order specifically targets the bulk sale of geolocation, genomic, financial, biometric, health and other personally identifying information.</p>
<p>During a briefing with reporters, a senior administration official said that the sale of such data to these countries poses a national security risk. “Our current policies and laws leave open access to vast amounts of American sensitive personal data,” the official said. “Buying data through data brokers is currently legal in the United States, and that reflects a gap in our national security toolkit that we are working to fill with this program.”</p>

<p>Nintendo has filed a lawsuit against the creators of a popular Switch emulator called Yuzu, which gives users a way to play games developed for the platform on their PCs and Android devices. In the lawsuit <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1762576284817768457">shared by Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, the company argued that Yuzu violates the anti-circumvention and anti-trafficking provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nintendo explained that it protects its games with encryption and other security features meant to prevent people from playing pirated copies. Yuzu has the capability to defeat those security measures and to decrypt Nintendo games. &quot;[W]ithout Yuzu's decryption of Nintendo's encryption, unauthorized copies of games could not be played on PCs or Android devices,&quot; the company wrote in its complaint.&nbsp;</p>

## Amazon accused of using AI to 'replicate the voices' of actors in Road House remake

<p>Amazon is being sued by the writer of the original 1989 Patrick Swayze version of the film <em>Road House</em> over alleged copyright infringement in the movie's remake, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2024-02-27/amazon-sued-over-roadhouse-copyright-jake-gyllenhaal"><em>The Los Angeles Times</em></a> has reported. Screenwriter R. Lance Hill accuses Amazon and MGM Studios of using AI to clone actors' voices in the new production in order to finish it before the copyright expired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hill said he filed a petition with the US Copyright Office in November 2021 to reclaim the rights to his original screenplay, which forms the basis of the new film. At that point, the rights were owned by Amazon Studios, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-mgm-acquisition-closed-135810387.html">part of its acquisition of MGM</a>, but were set to expire in November 2023. Hill alleges that once that happened, the rights would revert back to him.
