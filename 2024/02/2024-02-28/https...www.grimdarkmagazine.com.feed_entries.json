It was published in 1994 and introduced the character of Vannevar Thomas (popularized by web series LA by Night). It also imagined a complicated interlocking web of undead politics taking place behind closed doors in San Fransisco. With that history lesson out of the way, I&#8217;m going to admit my horrible bias towards this book. I read this book when it first came out in 1994 and would buy it used a couple of more times. It&#8217;s not just a good Vampire: The Masquerade story or even a good vampire story but a good novel period. It&#8217;s gritty, dark, and incorporates all the weirdness of the World of Darkness without requiring any knowledge of the setting beforehand. Indeed, that is probably my main selling point for Dark Prince. The lore of tabletop RPGs, especially the World of Darkness, is often impenetrable to outsiders.
