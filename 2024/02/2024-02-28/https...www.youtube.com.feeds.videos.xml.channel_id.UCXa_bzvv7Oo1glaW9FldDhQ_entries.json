Harkening back to dark fantasy shooters like Quake, Wrath: Aeon of Ruin throws players in a dying fantasy world filled with all sorts of grotesque monstrosities that must be taken down.\n\nWhile there isn\u2019t really much of an interesting story in Wrath: Aeon of Ruin, its emphasis on non-stop combat, the verticality of its level design, and its emphasis on exploration make it feel like one of the purest boomer shooters that still manages to maintain its own identity. The only real downside with the game is that its weapons don\u2019t really do anything unique; instead, they\u2019re basically just the same pistol/shotgun/railgun combination we\u2019ve seen countless times before.", "date_published": "2024-02-28T18:00:34+00:00", "page_rating_contents": 0, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE5vdxytqZ4", "album": "", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "language": null}, {"vote": 0, "source_obj__id": 208, "bookmarked": false, "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/r5P_7miQ38M/hqdefault.jpg", "dead": false, "comments": [], "artist": "GamingBolt", "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "tags": [], "user": null, "title": "What Is GOING ON In Pokemon Legends: Z-A?", "permanent": false, "age": null, "page_rating": 0, "description": "Pokemon Legends: Arceus was the best game we\u2019ve seen from the Pokemon franchise in well over a decade, so naturally, there\u2019s every reason to be keenly anticipating a direct follow-up. The recent announcement of Pokemon Legends: Z-A has stirred up plenty of excitement in the series\u2019 fanbase, and even though the trailer itself was brief and didn\u2019t show any gameplay whatsoever, it\u2019s easy to understand why. \n\nNot only can a sequel build on the first Pokemon Legends game\u2019s excellent foundations in key ways, based on its trailer, it\u2019s also looking like it\u2019s going to bring in plenty of its own intriguing ideas (like being set entirely within one city), while the prospect of a game that finally dives deeper into the Kalos region\u2019s fascinating lore is also an intriguing one.
