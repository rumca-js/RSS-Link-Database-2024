Other than that, there is no reason to visit the area - unless of course, you live there. And residents don‚Äôt take kindly to people who try to burglarize local businesses, which is pretty much what we have for you in this story. </p><p>A trans burglar ended up in the arms of a Venice Beach resident after he tried to rob a local store. And by "ended up in the arms," I mean the degenerate robber jumped into his arms. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

Because according to a workshop at Syracuse University, saying ‚Äòhey guys‚Äô to anyone other than a ‚Äúguy‚Äù is ‚Äúhurtful.‚Äù But that is not even the best part. Apparently, looking at someone's service animal is also considered a ‚Äúmicro-assault.‚Äù </p><p>And don‚Äôt worry, I looked up the term ‚ÄúMicro-Assault‚Äù for you because I also did not know that was a thing. According to a website called ‚ÄúEasyLlama,‚Äù which is probably really woke, ‚ÄúMicroassaults are damaging or discriminatory comments made to a person or group (verbally or nonverbally) that are motivated by that person's or that group's identity.‚Äù </p><p>Okay. That definition made me even more confused. So here is one from Auburn University, ‚ÄúA microassault is an explicit racial derogation characterized prima
