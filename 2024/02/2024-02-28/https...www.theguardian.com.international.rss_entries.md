<p>Legend has it that Mark Robins was the man to save Alex Ferguson’s ­Manchester United managerial career with an FA Cup winner against ­Nottingham Forest in 1990. That year United went on to win the trophy at Wembley and the pressure was lifted from their manager. Erik ten&nbsp;Hag will be hoping Casemiro’s late ­winner might have the same galvanising effect on his tenure.</p><p>The Brazilian’s header was the 36th attempt on goal on a night devoid of quality but the result is all that matters for Ten Hag, who will be ­holding on to hope United can reach ­Wembley in this competition as he looks to prove himself to Sir Jim ­Ratcliffe, the club’s new ­minority ­shareholder – although the small matter of ­Liverpool awaits in the next round as United look to go&nbsp;one better than being beaten ­finalists last season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/28/nottingham-forest-manchester-united-fa-cup-fifth-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anthony Vaccarello’s autumn/winter 2024 collection inspired by brand founder’s work with transparent textiles</p><p>If the “Free the nipple” campaign is a relatively recent phenomenon, designed to push back against Instagram’s female nipple ban, Yves Saint Laurent was playing his part long before social media. Back in 1968, he debuted what was quickly referred to by the press as the “see-through blouse”, a chiffon design worn with nothing underneath.</p><p>It’s an item that was surely on the mood board for Saint Laurent’s creative director, Anthony Vaccarello, on Tuesday night at Paris fashion week. His autumn/winter 2024 collection was dominated by see-through fabric, with the majority of models bare-breasted under translucent blouses, fitted T-shirts and sleeveless tops. Some also wore transparent pencil skirts, with high-legged knickers visible underneath.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/feb/28/saint-laurent-sheer-see-through-fabrics-dominate-paris

<p>A radical new history of the ancient world that challenges modern chauvinism</p><p>Like the railway and the telegraph, western civilisation was invented in the 19th century. It had located its noble roots in classical Athens and Rome, and from then, so the story went, white Europeans embarked on a smooth progression of gradual sophistication and enlightenment that culminated, not coincidentally, in the glories of the British empire.</p><p>That’s not quite how it all got started, argues ancient history professor Josephine Quinn in this fascinating account of the cultural and martial doings around the Mediterranean in the two millennia BC, and thence up to the middle ages. For her, “civilisational thinking” itself is the enemy, not only in historiography but in modern geopolitics. Samuel Huntington’s The Clash of Civilizations (1996), for example, notoriously predicted that future wars would occur not between states but between monolithic and homogeneous “civilisations” such

<p>Populations were recovering, but a new study reveals that numbers dropped by 20% coinciding with a period of record temperatures in the North Pacific</p><p>In 1972, a humpback whale nicknamed Festus was first spotted off the mountainous coast of south-east Alaska.

The primary cause of death was starvation, which scientists believe was likely caused by the most extreme marine heatwave on record.
