		In Ireland, the Justice Committee released a <a href="https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/committee/dail/33/joint_committee_on_justice/reports/2024/2024-02-27_report-on-pre-legislative-scrutiny-of-the-general-scheme-of-the-garda-siochana-recording-devices-amendment-bill-2023_en.pdf">pre-legislative scrutiny report</a> on the Facial Recognition Technology Bill that would determine how An Garda Síochána would use the technology.

The Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), Digital Rights Ireland, the Data Protection Commission, and academic experts, among others, have also voiced concerns with the technology.

These entities note wanting clarity on how police intend to use the technology as well as what image reference databases they would be leveraging

		Facial recognition is now being trialed in retail in Australia to curtail crime and streamline the customer experience, in addition to its use by immigration and law enforcement agencies. The wider implementation of the technology, however, is raising questions about consumer privacy, algorithmic bias, and cultural concerns.

Despite the expanding use cases, many are worried about the technology's inaccuracies in identifying people of color in particular. "The only safeguard [markets] have promised is no decision will be made to exclude anyone other than two staff members independently… checking that the matches are in fact accurate," says Gehan Gunasekara, associate professor at the University of Auckland business school

The implications of the new TSA PreCheck Touchless ID service for <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/clear">Clear</a> and its membership-based airport biometrics service are unclear.

Delta and United Airlines are each piloting processes to replace boarding pass and physical ID document checks with face biometrics

		Governments around the world are increasingly enacting legislation to ensure that there are adequate safeguards to protect children from  accessing adult related content online. One of the first countries to  pass legislation was the UK with the Online Safety Act coming into law in September 2023. The act takes a zero-tolerance approach to protecting  children and makes sure social media platforms are held responsible for  the content they host. If they do not act rapidly to prevent and remove illegal content and stop children seeing material that is harmful to  them, such as bullying, they will face significant fines that could  reach billions of pounds. In some cases, their bosses may even face prison.

		Facial recognition is the means to many ends across the United States. The mayor of St. Louis, Mo., for instance, wants it to resurrect red-light and speed cameras.

An eight-year program of using CCTV to convict dangerous driving in the city was ended in 2015 when the state Supreme Court judged it unconstitutional because it put the burden of a key proof on the accused.

The mayor and at least some city board members say facial recognition algorithms would impose on government the burden of proving the identity of suspect drivers. Using cameras alone forced the accused to prove they were not the driver caught on video surveillance.

St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones has issued an executive order spelling out AI surveillance policies for police. That order has not found ove

Additionally, other private entities are in the process of implementing the SSI protocol to offer their users decentralized verifiable credentials.
