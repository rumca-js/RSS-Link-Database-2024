We&#8217;ve been talking a lot about how as streaming subscription growth slows, streaming companies will begin doing whatever&#8217;s necessary to deliver Wall Street quarterly growth at any cost.

As we noted at the time, this was in the midst of a variety of scandals of [&#8230;]

The DMCA process remains as easily abused as ever, even as companies like Google (and, especially, Automattic) do what they can to head off this abuse. It&#8217;s a numbers game. When you&#8217;re the size of Google, it&#8217;s impossible to vet every takedown demand. The easiest thing to do is comply immediately and, if need be, [&#8230;]

Something strange is happening in the legal academy, and we’re worried about it. On January 23, 2024, the progressive policy organization American Economic Liberties Project filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court case NetChoice v. Paxton, in support of a Texas law prohibiting social media companies from moderating &#8211; “censoring” in the words of [&#8230;]

And here we go again. We&#8217;ve had many, many posts over recent years discussing how, in the digital age, you often don&#8217;t actually own what you&#8217;ve bought.
