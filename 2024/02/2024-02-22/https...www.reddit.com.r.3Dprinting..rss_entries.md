The printer is a bambu labs p1s. I'm running the bed at 55c and extruder at 220c. Its actually surprising how little it actually uses in power. I was thinking it was going to cost a lot more. The idea came when I started to sell prints and was doing a cost calculator. Some people were saying $1 per hour and others $0.50. So my formula is doing cost of filament + $0.50 an hour and that gets me my bare minimum. Then I'll add my time that I want to be paid to get the final price. Small model prints like this us
