You can‚Äôt have biology when you are pushing gender ideology because again, facts get in the way of that narrative. </p><p>That said, the leftist version of <em>truth</em> will never prevail over factual truth. That is why the biology teacher got his job back as reality was on his side. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
