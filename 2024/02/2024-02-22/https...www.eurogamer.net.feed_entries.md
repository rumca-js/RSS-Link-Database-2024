Behaviour Interactive has announced its latest Dead by Daylight collaboration, and it's none other than heavy metal band Iron Maiden. 
</p><p>
This team up will see the band's mascot Eddie arrive in the game as part of a new outfit collection, which has been inspired by various Eddie iterations over the years. These looks, which you can see in the trailer below, include The Dredge, The Doctor, The Deathslinger, and The Oni.
</p><p>
There are also new Iron Maiden T-shirts for Dead by Daylight's original Survivors.

To borrow from Game of Thrones, Minter is coming (please read that in Ned Stark's voice). Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story - an interactive documentary experience for PC, Xbox, PlayStation and Switch - will release next month, on 13th March. 
</p><p>
Coming from Digital Eclipse, this upcoming release invites us all to take a little trip back in time, to "an era of cassette tapes, photocopied zines, and README.TXT", as it tells the story of the British game designer's career. So, expect plenty of psychedelia, radioactive sheep, mutant camels and more.  
</p><p>
Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story will include 42 classic games from across eight different platforms. An interactive timeline will reach all the way back to some of Minter's earliest work on the Sinclair ZX81 and Commodore VIC-20, before heading onto projects

Fallout: London - the upcoming fan made DLC-sized mod for Bethesda's Fallout 4 - has added Neil Newbon to its cast.
</p><p>
The actor is known for many roles across the video game industry, including Karl Heisenberg in Resident Evil Village. More recently, he played Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3, for which he won the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">award for Best Performance</a> at last year's Game Awards.
</p><p>
Newbon's role in Fallout: London is still largely underwraps, with the mod's developer simply stating he is part of the voice acting team, as an in-game screenshot is shared (see below).

## Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth: accomplished and impressive but not above criticism

The original Final Fantasy 7 pushed technical boundaries on the PS1 and set new standards for storytelling within gaming. Its long-anticipated remake trilogy - starting with 2020's Final Fantasy 7 Remake - is similarly ambitious, seeking to flesh out and rework the RPG on modern hardware. Due on February 29th, the middle part of the trilogy, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, promises a much larger and more sophisticated entry exclusively on PS5 console hardware. How have graphical boundaries been pushed on PS5? Have the demo's image quality issues been resolved? And can the game hold a stable frame-rate, even with its open-world scope?

After a year on the market, Sony is now testing PS VR2 compatibility with PC.
</p><p>
This news comes courtesy of a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/02/22/coming-soon-to-ps-vr2-zombie-army-vr-little-cities-bigger-wanderer-the-fragments-of-fate-the-wizards-dark-times-brotherhood-and-more/">PlayStation blog</a>, which highlights a selection of games coming to its VR platform. </p><p>Along with details on titles such as Zombie Army VR and The Wizards - Dark Times: Brotherhood (which is out today), Sony said it is "currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5".</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-testing-ps-vr2-compatibility-with-pc?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_camp

## Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth review - an overstuffed but lovable re-imagining

Remakes are a precarious proposition. Do too much and you risk losing a fanbase. Do too little and fans question if it was even worthwhile. With a game as iconic and beloved as Final Fantasy 7, the risks are gigantic. This new trilogy, based on the PlayStation classic, is proving to be less remake and more a re-imagining of the original, a reinterpretation - a rebirth, if you will. But how do you balance old and new? How far can the boundaries of this story be pushed? 
</p><p>
These are the sorts of meta-narrative questions Final Fantasy 7 Remake posed. In that game's brand new finale twist, Cloud and co battled the physical embodiment of fate to break away from destiny and carve a new future. It was seemingly a message from Square Enix: just like Cloud, its developers wouldn't necessarily be stic

## Little Devil Inside re-emerges with an apology and some gameplay

After several years of silence, Little Devil Inside has resurfaced. You may need to cast your minds back to remember this one. Little Devil Inside first came to light - at least on Eurogamer - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-devil-inside-merges-wind-waker-with-bloodborne">back in 2015</a>, when the game achieved its Kickstarter funding goal, although trailers had floated about before then. 
</p><p>
Things then went quiet, before it popped back up in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-game-little-devil-inside-looked-marvellous">2020 at a PlayStation 5 reveal event</a>. The following year, we got word that Little Devil Inside would release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-little-devil-inside-will-release-towards-the-end-of-2022">towards the end of 2022</a>, which evidently did not happe

## Hi-Fi Rush will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 - report

Hi-Fi Rush will skip the current Nintendo Switch and instead arrive on the console's currently-unannounced successor. 
That's according to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-playstation-5-announcement/">Insider Gaming</a>, which states that the absence of a Switch version of the game in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-launches-on-playstation-in-april">yesterday's Xbox multi-platform announcement</a> was due to it launching on Nintendo Switch 2 instead.
</p><p>
Whether Hi-Fi Rush could still eventually launch for the current Switch as well - perhaps at the same time? - is unclear, the report concluded.
</p><p>
Certainly, a launch for Hi-Fi Rush on a Nintendo platform has been expected. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-t-shirt

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree will be available digitally only, even for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S exclusive physical versions.
</p><p>
A Shadow of the Erdtree Edition will be released, including both the base game and the DLC. However this will only be available physically on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the expansion an additional download not on the disc. PC editions are digitally only, while PS4 and Xbox One will only have the DLC as a digital extra.
</p><p>
The DLC, as a standalone addition, will cost &pound;34.99 across all platforms - a significant increase from, say, Bloodborne's The Old Hunters DLC that was &pound;15.99 on release. This perhaps speaks to the size of Shadow of the Erdtree as much as

Surprise! Dead Island 2 has popped up as part of the Xbox Game Pass subscription, despite not being listed by Microsoft when it revealed a list of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-titles-for-late-february-2024-announced">late February Xbox Game Pass titles</a> earlier this week. 
</p><p>
Dead Island 2 publisher Plaion has now confirmed the news, though in a <a href="https://deadisland.com/news/xbox-game-pass">blog post</a> noted the game was "for Ultimate members". Users have noted that the game's PC version was not added to Game Pass for PC.
</p><p>
The unexpected addition to Game Pass follows a free weekend of access to Dead Island 2 via Xbox's "Free Play Days" promotion last week.

One of my favourite pieces of writing about games, not that anybody asked, is from Sid Meier. It's the fourth, I think, of his 10 rules for game design. The first rules have laid out the scene: choose a topic you have passion for, define your axioms, refine your axioms. All good stuff. And then, suddenly:</p><p>Double it or cut it in half.</p><p>This is what really good film cuts are made for. We have moved from the theoretical to the densely practical. We were at the blackboard, we were pontificating, and now we're right in it, locked in the kitchen, spaghetti sauce everywhere, and we're trying to turn things around before the cooker explodes. Double it. Or cut it in half. This moment calls for big things, not small things. This moment counts.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingmakers-is-the-glorious-embodimen
