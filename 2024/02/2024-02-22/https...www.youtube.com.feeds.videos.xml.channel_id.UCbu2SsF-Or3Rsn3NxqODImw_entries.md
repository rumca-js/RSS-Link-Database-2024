Skull and Bones strips away everything great about Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, resulting in a dull live-service game that's often a chore.

The ending of Square Enix’s 2020 remake of “Final Fantasy VII” left everyone with some big questions concerning the appearance of a dark haired guy in a SOLDIER uniform, limping along the grasslands, dragging a comatose Cloud alongside him. While fans of the original game were shocked to see said SOLIDER, Zack, alive and well, newcomers were confused. Who the heck is this dude anyway?

Originally introduced in "Final Fantasy VII" published for the Sony PlayStation in 1997, Zack's role, while pivotal, was relatively small. However, as more lore was added to Final Fantasy VII universe, referred to collectively as the "Compilation of Final Fantasy VII", Zack's story was told in greater detail, particularly in the 2007 prequel, "Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII-", on the PlayStation Portable", remastered in 2022 as "Crisis Core: Reunion". For anyone who hasn't played either, or maybe just needs a refresher, we present a crash course on best boy Zack Fair, who plays a major role in

Rebirth keeps its narrative focus on characters while bringing a new dimension to combat, but it stumbles in pivotal moments.

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is a game about a struggle between fate and freedom, but also the delicate balance between authorship and agency. Through gameplay systems that encourage exploration, Rebirth empowers players to discover the world around them and chart their path through it. And through its story, it presents a compelling narrative about the destructive impact of exploiting natural resources, as well as the human causes and consequences of radical environmentalism. But it's a story that, ultimately, is defined and destined to end in very specific ways, for better or for worse. The equilibrium between contrasting ideologies is rarely perfect, and that's evident in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, a game that is rewarding for the dozens of hours it gives agency, but is frustrating in the few hours that author the series' future.

Thankfully, what Final F

FromSoftware just dropped the first trailer for Shadow of the Erdtree - an upcoming DLC to Elden Ring, and here to break it down is Dave Klein of DaveControl.

Miquella was the star of today's trailer, with the focus being on his quest to find out what Marika was doing in the Land of Shadow. Players got to witness spectacular looking new bosses, locations, and enemies, with the focal point being on the brand new boss Messmer the Impaler.

From interviews, we also know that the upcoming Land of Shadow will be a totally separate area from the Lands Between, and players will need to transport there via Miquella. According to director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, the Land of Shadow will be roughly the size of Limgrave, if not possibly even bigger in scale - filled with plenty of exploration and legacy dungeons.

Elden Ring: Shadow of the Eritrea is set to release June 21, 2024.
