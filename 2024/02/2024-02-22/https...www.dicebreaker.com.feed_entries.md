We previously described the RPG as a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/planet-fist/news/planet-fist-narrative-wargame-itchfunding">satirical sendup of wargames</a>&rdquo; that combines Edge of Tomorrow&rsquo;s narrative conceit with slice-of-l

Tomb Raider: Shadows of Truth will send teams of players into forgotten places in search of lost knowledge and those who would exploit the past for selfish means.</p><p>Shadows of Truth is the latest project from Evil Hat, the tabletop publisher behind <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/roleplaying-game/news/thirsty-sword-lesbians-nebula-awards-winner-2022">Thirsty Sword Lesbians</a> and <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/apocalypse-keys/news/apocalypse-keys-hellboy-evil-hat-rpg">Apocalypse Keys</a>.

But the humble island nation of five million is making its mark in another scene: the tabletop gaming industry.</p><p>In 2022, Auckland-based trading card game company Legend Story Studios, creators of Flesh and Blood, a <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/trading-card-game/opinion/are-we-in-a-new-golden-age-of-tcgs">heavy-hitting TCG competing with Magic: The Gathering</a>, topped Deloitte&rsquo;s Fast 50 Index with a stunning revenue growth of 6,416% over the preceding three years.
