<p>GitHub’s AI-powered coding assistant, <a href="https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/" rel="nofollow">GitHub Copilot</a>, may suggest insecure code when the user’s existing codebase contains security issues, according to developer security company Snyk.</p><p>GitHub Copilot can replicate existing security issues in code, Snyk said in a blog post published February 22. “This means that existing security debt in a project can make insecure developers using Copilot even less secure,” the company said. However, GitHub Copilot is less likely to suggest insecure code in projects without security issues, as it has a less insecure code context to draw from.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3713141/github-copilot-makes-insecure-code-even-less-secure-snyk-says.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>In the C# programming language, an object can be either a value type or a reference type. While an object is an object is an object, the difference between value types and reference types comes down to the nature of their variables. A variable of a value type contains an object, or an instance of the type. A variable of a reference type contains a reference to an object, or a reference to an instance of the type.</p><p>C# also lets us create what’s called value objects, a special type of object used in domain-driven design that allows us to articulate domain concepts simply, clearly, and concisely. In this article we will examine value objects, discuss their benefits, and illustrate how we can use them in C#.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3713120/how-to-use-value-objects-in-c-sharp.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
