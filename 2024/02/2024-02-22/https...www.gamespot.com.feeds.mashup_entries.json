Night Shyamalan. Could another live-action adaptation avoid the movie's pitfalls, even reliant as it is on child actors? Inversely, how could any adaptation make good on the stratospheric expectations of the original cartoon series that has attracted such a devoted fandom? With those questions at the forefront of my mind, I was surprised to find that Netflix's Avatar is a delight. It owes much of its success to finding a careful balance between the sprawling scope of the cartoon and the too-truncated movie. It won't replace the original animated series in the hearts of fans, but it's sincere, respectful of the source material, and includes just enough additions and nuance to make the material its own.</p><"}, {"title": "Elden Ring Shadow Of the Erdtree Trailer Breakdown", "user": null, "vote": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating": 0, "age": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "tags": [], "source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "album": "", "thumbnail": "https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1823/18237460/4263029-breakdwon_eldenring_v7_site.jpg", "page_rating_contents": 0, "dead": false, "date_published": "2024-02-22T01:51:00+00:00", "language": "en-us", "artist": null, "comments": [], "source_obj__id": 32, "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-trailer-breakdown/2300-6463467", "bookmarked": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1823/18237460/4263029-breakdwon_eldenring_v7_site.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> FromSoftware just dropped the first trailer for Shadow of the Erdtree - an upcoming DLC to Elden Ring, and here to break it down is Dave Klein of DaveControl."}]
