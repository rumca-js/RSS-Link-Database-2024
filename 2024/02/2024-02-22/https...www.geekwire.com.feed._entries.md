Maria Cantwell and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee traveled to Eastern Washington Thursday to visit companies leading the state&#8217;s rapidly expanding battery hub. Their tour included stops at Group14 Technologies and Sila, which are building factories that will produce next-generation materials designed to make lithium ion batteries &#8212; including those found in electric vehicles &#8212; more powerful and faster charging. Both companies previously received $100 million grants created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to fund the new facilities in Moses Lake. The U.S. Department of Energy awarded the funding.

Yet, Washington is falling behind when it comes to educating young people about computer science.&#160; A bill making its way through the legislature seeks to remedy these shortcomings by adding computer science learning standards to the state’s graduation requirements. Students in the graduating high school class of 2029 would need to demonstrate their competency in these areas either through completing a computer science class, a class which embeds computer science learning standards, or by taking a test.  The senate passed SB 5849 — its version of the bill. The house is now deliberating&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/computer-science-education-bill-would-add-new-graduation-requirements-in-washington-state/">Read Mor

The company&#8217;s aim is to help financial analysts speed up their investment workflows. It lets users ask questions about financial documents —  SEC documents, call transcripts, research reports, etc. — and spits out answers immediately. The answers are linked to original sources to avoid hallucination. &#8220;It is like using ChatGPT but for finance-specific use cases,&#8221; said CEO Lakshay Chauhan, a longtime machine learning engineer at Seattle hedge fund Euclidean. The product is currently in free beta. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have a self-serve business&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/finpilot-a-seattle-startup-usin

Founded in 2021, EigenLayer is developing an Ethereum-related technology known as &#8220;restaking.&#8221; The company has not yet launched its product but is generating plenty of attention — and investment dollars. Here&#8217;s how the company describes its tech, via a blog post: &#8220;EigenLayer provides blockchain developers with access to the highly crypto-economically secure and decentralized network that powers Ethereum, which enables them to more easily launch new protocols and applications with strong assurances of reliability and scalability.

Let’s go!&#8221; Blue Origin&#8217;s CEO, Dave Limp, agreed that the sight was incredible. &#8220;Its size alone — more than 30 stories high and a 7-meter diameter fairing with 487 cubic meters of capacity — is humbling,&#8221; he wrote&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-glenn-rocket/">Read More</a>

Jay Inslee in attendance. &#8220;It&#8217;s &#8216;software-defined&#8217; rather than a hard-point-constrained facility. Nearly every components shelf and assembly sequence is digitized for maximum speed and data management.&#8221; If the production requirements change, the floor plan can change accordingly.
