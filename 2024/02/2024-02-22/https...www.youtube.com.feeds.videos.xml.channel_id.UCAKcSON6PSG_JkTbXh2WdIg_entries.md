Recently on the Lipps Service podcast, singer-songwriter Pete Yorn was asked by host Scott Lipps to name five artists Yorn thinks are underrated.

The first band mentioned by Pete Yorn is Minneapolis group The Hang Ups. They’re no longer a going concern, but back in 2013, the Hang Ups original lineup reunited for a session in The Current studio. Here is a clip of the band performing their song, “Comin’ Through,” recorded live at The Current.
