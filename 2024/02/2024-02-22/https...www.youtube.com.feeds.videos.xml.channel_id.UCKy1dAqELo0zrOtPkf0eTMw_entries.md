The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live, reviewed by Matt Fowler. Narrated by Max Scoville.

With powerful performances from its two leads, The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live is an honest, arduous love story pitting Rick's stubbornness against Michonne's in a battle to give proper closure to one of the few remaining hopeful things about the entire saga. Its first four episodes hit their mark exceptionally, save for a few instances when the plot demands unconvincing character choices. For those who've waited years for answers, The Ones Who Live is equal parts sad, sinister, and satisfying.

In today's Daily Fix:
A new Helldivers 2 patch is on the way, and this one will add a much-requested feature: kicking AFK players to free up room on the servers. The game has proven so popular that the hard cap of 500,000 concurrent players is constantly being hit, and players lucky enough to get in will just stay logged in and idle to secure their spot. Some have admitted to staying logged in for days at a time so they can play whenever they want. Now the game will kick anyone who is idle for more than 15 minutes, so hopefully more players will be able to get in. In other news, Riot's new League of Legends fighting game, formerly known as Project L, now has an official title: 2XKO. And finally, EA's new college football game has revealed the compensation student athletes will receive for voluntarily being included in the game. One last thing: it's IGN Fan Fest all week long! Be sure to tune in February 23-24 for a special live stream with interviews and reveals on some of th

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth reviewed by Michael Higham on PlayStation 5.

"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion as both a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth, and as an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long. After 82 hours to finish the main story and complete a decent chunk of sidequests and optional activities, there's still much to be done, making this pivotal section of the original feel absolutely massive. Minigames, sidequests, and other enticing diversions fill the spaces of its vast and sprawling regions, painting a new and more vivid picture of these familiar locations. But more than just being filled with things to do, Rebirth is often a powerful representation of Final Fantasy VII's most memorable qualities. It does fumble the execution of its ending, getting caught up in the mess of its multiple twisting timelines, but new moments and the overarching journ
