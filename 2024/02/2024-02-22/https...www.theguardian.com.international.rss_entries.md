<p><strong>(Mom + Pop)<br /></strong>The newly viral US duo seem to take inspiration from Bowie, Simon and Garfunkel and the Gallagher brothers on an album of glossy, impressively melodic psychedelic pop</p><p>In 2021, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue published a report on extremist activity on TikTok. It made for thoroughly depressing reading, spiked with moments of incredulity. Chief among the latter was the apparent popularity of the title track of MGMT’s fourth album, 2018’s Little Dark Age, with neo-Nazis: it was “by far the most popular sound among extremist creators on TikTok”, soundtracking videos about the late American white supremacist George Lincoln Rockwell and “esoteric nazism”. The report’s authors seemed baffled as to why. Certainly, its adoption doesn’t say much for your average neo-Nazi’s ability to understand English. Little Dark Age’s lyrics are, fairly obviously, an excoriation of Trump-era America and racist police violence. You could even suggest th

<p>Tragedy severs five friends from their past in a subtly radical novel set in a working-class area of Birmingham</p><p>Keiran Goddard is a poet and novelist whose debut novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/13/hourglass-by-keiran-goddard-review-a-universal-love-story">Hourglass</a>, was longlisted for the Desmond Elliott prize in 2022. His second novel, I See Buildings Fall Like Lightning, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;worthy successor. A multivocal narrative focusing on&nbsp;a&nbsp;working-class community in Birmingham, it follows Rian, Patrick, Shiv, Oli and Conor as they grow up&nbsp;and grow apart. Rian has left Birmingham and got rich, more or&nbsp;less by accident, playing the stock market on his laptop; the other four stayed behind. As Goddard observes in&nbsp;a striking opening sentence, “And then none of it happened.” Life came at them fast, and none of their dreams has come true. Patrick works as a takeaway delivery biker, and has two children with Shiv; Oli

In other – more neutral – words, could the algorithm tell whether the brain patterns being looked at were from women or men?</p><p>The answer was “yes”, though rather more guarded in the paper itself than in the reports about it. What was interesting about the study was that it seemed to have moved beyond the stereotypical “size matters” agenda – asking whether male or femal

It looks like a reaction rather than over-reaction, drafting in Ollie Robinson and Shoaib Bashir on what he expects to be a spinning pitch.</p><p>Mark Wood and Rehan Ahmed are the players to drop out from the 434-run defeat in Rajkot that sees the tourists 2-1 down with two to play, Stokes attributing the former’s omission to his heavy workload and a desire to ensure he can operate at maximum pace. While Bashir, 20, returns to win his second Test cap – the scruffy surface in Ranchi appearing more conducive to finger spin, certainly – it could be viewed as Jimmy Anderson having been preferred to Rehan Ahmed in the final shake-up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/22/england-recall-robinson-and-bashir-for-must

<p>One of the industry’s most respected musicians committed a shocking murder in the 80s. A new book tells his difficult story</p><p>In the 1960s and 70s, no serious rock fan viewed the drummer Jim Gordon with anything but awe. By the 80s, none of them viewed him with anything but contempt, a 180-degree turn that led to his virtual erasure from the culture. Even four decades later, when the veteran music journalist Joel Selvin first tried to sell publishers on a book meant to tell Gordon’s story with nuance and depth, they balked. “They would debate it for months and then say, ‘Nope, can’t do it,’” Selvin said. “It was almost impossible for them because of what he had done.”</p><p>In 1983, he entered his mother’s house and began to attack her with a hammer, crashing it into her skull four times before grabbing a knife and stabbing her repeatedly, the final time with such force it pinned her to the floor. Soon after her resulting death, Gordon was arrested, charged and convict

<p>Furious farmers across Europe have blocked roads and railways as part of protests against new regulations and cheap imports. Jon Henley reports</p><p>The scenes are now familiar across Europe, from Poland to Portugal: angry farmers blocking roads, ports, railways and city centres. Parts of Brussels and Berlin have ground to a standstill in recent weeks. Farmers have closed down motorways, dumped manure, hurled eggs, trashed supermarkets, set fire<strong> </strong>to hay bales and pallets, and clashed with police.</p><p>As the Guardian’s Europe correspondent <strong>Jon Henley</strong> tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>there are several reasons for their anger, including rising costs of fuel and fertilisers, supermarket price squeezes and an influx of cheap imports crowding the marketplace. But there is a focus for their anger: what they see as onerous new green regulations from Brussels and their own national governments. The protests are working; politicians in recent

<p>Dozens of lawmakers stormed out of Britain's parliament on Wednesday with tempers flaring as the three biggest political parties sought to outmanoeuvre each other over a vote on a ceasefire in Gaza. The uproar followed a decision by the speaker to ignore precedent and allow a vote which helped the opposition Labour Party avoid a large-scale rebellion among its own lawmakers over its position on the Israel-Hamas war. Lawmakers from the governing Conservatives and the opposition Scottish National Party (SNP) left the debating chamber in protest and some tried to take the rare step of holding proceedings in private. The speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, eventually apologised and said he had made his decision to allow lawmakers to vote on a range of views because he was concerned about their security after some had faced threats of violence over their stance on the war.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/21/commons-speaker-issues-apology-after-gaza-ceas
