While an object is an object is an object, the difference between value types and reference types comes down to the nature of their variables. A variable of a value type contains an object, or an instance of the type. A variable of a reference type contains a reference to an object, or a reference to an instance of the type.</p><p>C# also lets us create what\u2019s called value objects, a special type of object used in domain-driven design that allows us to articulate domain concepts simply, clearly, and concisely. In this article we will examine value objects, discuss their benefits, and illustrate how we can use them in C#.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3713120/how-to-use-value-objects-in-c-sharp.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>"}]
