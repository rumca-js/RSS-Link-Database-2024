Maria Cantwell and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee traveled to Eastern Washington Thursday to visit companies leading the state&#8217;s rapidly expanding battery hub. Their tour included stops at Group14 Technologies and Sila, which are building factories that will produce next-generation materials designed to make lithium ion batteries &#8212; including those found in electric vehicles &#8212; more powerful and faster charging. Both companies previously received $100 million grants created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to fund the new facilities in Moses Lake. The U.S. Department of Energy awarded the funding.

Yet, Washington is falling behind when it comes to educating young people about computer science.&#160; A bill making its way through the legislature seeks to remedy these shortcomings by adding computer science learning standards to the state\u2019s graduation requirements. Students in the graduating high school class of 2029 would need to demonstrate their competency in these areas either through completing a computer science class, a class which embeds computer science learning standards, or by taking a test.\u00a0 The senate passed SB 5849 \u2014 its version of the bill.
