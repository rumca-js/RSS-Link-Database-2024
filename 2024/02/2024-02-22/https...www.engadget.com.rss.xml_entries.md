<p>Google said Thursday it’s pausing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-gemini-15-pro-is-a-new-more-efficient-ai-model-181909354.html">Gemini chatbot’s</a> ability to generate people. The move comes after viral social posts showed the AI tool overcorrecting for diversity, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-promises-to-fix-geminis-image-generation-following-complaints-that-its-woke-073445160.html">producing “historical” images of Nazis, America’s Founding Fathers and the Pope </a>as people of color.</p>
<p>“We’re already working to address recent issues with Gemini’s image generation feature,” Google <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/Google_Comms/status/1760603321944121506">posted</a> on X (<a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/technology/google-gemini-german-uniforms.html">via</a> <em>The New York Times</em>). “While we do this, we’re going to pause the image generation of people and will re-release an impr

<p>Google has struck a deal <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-and-google-expand-partnership">with Reddit </a>that will allow the search engine maker to train its AI models on Reddit’s vast catalog of user-generated content, the two companies announced. Under the arrangement,  Google will get access to Reddit’s Data API, which will help the company “better understand” content from the site.</p>
<p>The deal also provides Google with a valuable source of content it can use to train its AI models. “Google will now have efficient and structured access to fresher information, as well as enhanced signals that will help us better understand Reddit content and display, train on, and otherwise use it in the most accurate and relevant ways,” the company said in <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/expanded-reddit-partnership/">a statement</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-16-review-modular-wonder-mediocre-gaming-laptop-150026910.html"><ins>Framework</ins></a> is all about modular, upgradable laptops and now the company is offering people a more-cost effective entry point. It has dropped the price of its B-stock Factory Seconds systems (which are built with excess parts and new components). As such, it's <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/first-framework-laptop-16-shipments-and-a-499-framework"><ins>now offering</ins></a> a Framework Laptop 13 barebones configuration for under $500 for the very first time.</p>
<p>The 13-inch machine comes with an 11th-gen Intel Core i7 processor with Iris Xe graphics. So the CPU should be sufficient for most basic tasks and some moderate gaming. Here's the catch: Frameworks' barebones laptops don't include RAM, storage, Wi-Fi connectivity, power adaptor or even an operating system.</p>

<p>We only know one game that’ll be featured at the event, but it’s a doozy.

We’ll likely get a new trailer for the game, which was first revealed back in 2021. Panic also says the event will include a “release update” on the title. So, the long wait is nearly over.</

The new AI tool is called &quot;<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/14582048">Help me write</a>,&quot; because it can literally help you write more descriptive sentences or even full paragraphs from a short prompt. Google says the tool uses its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-answer-to-gpt-4-is-gemini-the-most-capable-model-weve-ever-built-150039571.html?_fsig=oVk_2A88FAunGZtXmN.uIA--%7EA">Gemini models</a> to understand the context of the web page you're on so that it could generate appropriate suggestions.

<p>Just like the other entries in the KeyLab Essential line, the 88 mk3 is intended to be a budget-friendly alternative to the flagship KeyLab controllers. The build is solid, with semi-weighted keys, though slightly less premium than the standard KeyLab 88.

<p>Sony is looking to make its latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/playstation/">PlayStation</a> virtual reality headset more useful by allowing folks to run PC games on it.

Sony hopes to roll out PC support for PS VR2 later this year and said to stay tuned for more updates.</p>

Now, a new and lightweight substance could provide a welcome substitute: Two material scientists from Kobe University, Fujii Minoru and Sugimoto Hiroshi, have discovered nanospheres that are near-invisible silicone crystals.

<p>Meta’s Oversight Board is expanding its purview to include Threads. The group announced that Threads users will now be able to appeal Meta’s content moderation decisions, giving the independent group the ability to influence policies for Meta’s newest app.</p>
<p>It’s a notable expansion for the Oversight Board, which up until now has weighed in on content moderation issues related to Facebook and Instagram posts. “Having independent accountability early on for a new app such as Threads is vitally important.,” board co-chair Helle Thorning-Schmidt said in a statement.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the Oversight Board, user appeals on Threads will function similarly to how they do on Instagram and Facebook. When users have “exhausted” Meta’s internal process, they’ll be able to request a review from the Oversight Board. Under the rules established when the board was formed, Meta is required to implement the board's decisions regarding specific po

<p>In the big Nintendo Direct presentation yesterday, we learned of two of the four Xbox titles Microsoft said would appear on “the other consoles.” One of them is <em>Pentiment</em>, coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4 and PS5, well, today.</p>

<p>X, formerly Twitter, is once again restricting content in India. The company's Global Government Affairs account announced that the <a href="https://twitter.com/GlobalAffairs/status/1760387644608192560">Indian government had issued an executive order</a> mandating that X withhold specific accounts and posts or face penalties such as "significant fines and imprisonment." X further stated that it doesn't agree with the order and is challenging it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The designated posts and accounts will only be blocked within India, however, there's no clear list of those affected. "Due to legal restrictions, we are unable to publish the executive orders, but we believe that making them public is essential for transparency," the Global Government Affairs post stated. "This lack of disclosure can lead to a lack of accountability and arbitrary decision-making." X claims to have notified all affected parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-teases-a-new-modern-look-for-sign-in-pages-including-gmail/">teasing it</a> for the past couple of weeks, Google is rolling out a <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/02/new-google-sign-in-page.html">new sign-in page</a> with a slightly cleaner design. The changes are small and don't affect functionality, but it's something that users encounter often, and Google has been using the previous version since it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-01-google-new-logo.html">changed its logo</a>, as far as I can see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The refresh puts the sign-in (and sign-up) page more in line with the company's Material Design ethic introduced back in 2014. To that end, it's now aligned left (instead of centered) and features an orientation that automatically adjusts to your screen's size — so it's wider on PC screens and narrower on smartphones. It shows up on all types of devices, but may not a

<p>You don't have to type in your password every time you log into your PlayStation account anymore. Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) has launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/passkeys-passwords-authentication-security-133024414.html?_fsig=PjBYecfp.._dpb3cV0YVcA--%7EA">passkey</a> support for PlayStation accounts, which means you can simply sign in through your mobile device or computer and use its screen unlocking method to log in. If you use a PIN, your fingerprint or your face to unlock your phone, for instance, that's also how you'll be able to get into your PlayStation account. On desktop, we were easily able to link our account with 1Password and use its passkey capability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/passkey/">official page</a> for the update, the company touches on the benefits of using passkeys, such as reducing account vulnerability. Passkeys can't be reused or given away, whether it's inadvertently or on purpose as SIE ex
