Sony has been attempting to attract some of Spider-Man success in the MCU by released several Spider-Man-Adjacent movies like Venom and Morbius in the past few years. Now Madame Web joins that list of movies that exist.

Madame Web definitely raises some questions. Like why is there so much spider-teasing? What’s the deal with the bad guy’s voice? How did Cassandra fly to Peru when wanted for kidnapping? Did she really decide to leave three kids in the woods? How did this movie get made?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Madame Web!
