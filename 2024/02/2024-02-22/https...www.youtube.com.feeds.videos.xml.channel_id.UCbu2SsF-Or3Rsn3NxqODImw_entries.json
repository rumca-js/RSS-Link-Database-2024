However, as more lore was added to Final Fantasy VII universe, referred to collectively as the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\", Zack's story was told in greater detail, particularly in the 2007 prequel, \"Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII-\", on the PlayStation Portable\", remastered in 2022 as \"Crisis Core: Reunion\".

And through its story, it presents a compelling narrative about the destructive impact of exploiting natural resources, as well as the human causes and consequences of radical environmentalism. But it's a story that, ultimately, is defined and destined to end in very specific ways, for better or for worse.

Players got to witness spectacular looking new bosses, locations, and enemies, with the focal point being on the brand new boss Messmer the Impaler.\n\nFrom interviews, we also know that the upcoming Land of Shadow will be a totally separate area from the Lands Between, and players will need to transport there via Miquella. According to director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, the Land of Shadow will be roughly the size of Limgrave, if not possibly even bigger in scale - filled with plenty of exploration and legacy dungeons.\n\nElden Ring: Shadow of the Eritrea is set to release June 21, 2024.\n\nTimestamps:\nHashTags (at least 2 more): #gaming #eldenring #gamespot"}]
