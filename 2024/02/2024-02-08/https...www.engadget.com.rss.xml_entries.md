<p>CRKD, makers of the beloved <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crkd-nitro-deck-review-the-switch-has-never-felt-this-good-130041763.html">Nitro Deck controller for Nintendo Switch</a>, launched a new gamepad on Thursday that resembles what a modern-day NES controller might look like. The wireless CRKD Neo S has Hall effect thumbsticks, swappable stick tops and a $50 retail price. It works with Switch, PCs, mobile devices, and smart TVs.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth gamepad carries over much of what made the Nitro Deck feel like the Switch’s “true and final form.” It includes two thumbsticks (both Hall effect-enabled with swappable tops), a D-pad, four action buttons, triggers, mappable back buttons and adjustable vibration.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The CRKD Neo S ships in various creative designs and colorways, several of which tap into Nintendo nostalgia. For example, the gold hue looks similar to Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-game-and-w

<p>The Apple Vision Pro has made my eyes work harder than ever before. It's not just because I have ultra-sharp, incredibly bright micro-OLED screens right on my face: The Vision Pro relies on eye tracking for navigating visionOS, its new &quot;spatial computing&quot; operating system. If you want to launch an app, visit a link or do just about anything that would typically require a mouse or a touchscreen input, your eyes have to look directly at them.</p>
<p>It's magical, almost telepathic. The Vision Pro's eye tracking makes it feel like you're discovering the power of the Force, a sensation that's buoyed by the intuitive hand gestures used to interact with whatever your eyes are focused on. But by relying so much on your gaze, the Vision Pro can quickly become exhausting when you run into issues, like trying to hit a tiny button on YouTube's visually overstuffed website. The eye strain is real.</p>

<p><em>Octopath Traveler</em> developer Acquire has been purchased by FromSoftware’s parent company, the Kadokawa Corporation, for an undisclosed sum. The Japanese conglomerate announced the acquisition in a quarterly earnings report published today, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fromsoftware-owner-acquires-octopath-traveler-developer"><ins>as revealed by </ins><em><ins>Gamesindustry.biz.</ins></em></a></p>
<p>The purchase makes Acquire a sister company to FromSoftware and Spike Chunsoft, among others. For the uninitiated, FromSoftware is the developer behind little known games like <em>Dark Souls, Elden Ring and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.</em> Spike Chunsoft is also no slouch, as it's behind the Danganronpa and AI: The Somnium Files franchises.</p>

<p>According to <em>The Information</em>, Apple has created <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-has-reportedly-made-foldable-iphone-prototypes-152804263.html">two clamshell-style foldable iPhone prototypes</a>, though they’re all in the early stages of development. If Apple were to move forward with foldable iPhones, they likely wouldn’t come to market until at least 2026.</p>
<p>Companies have so far been unable to address the technical issues of foldables. The first Samsung Galaxy Fold notoriously had a gap between the two halves of the screen, which debris fell into. Second, Apple’s designers have found it tough to create a foldable iPhone compelling enough to exist beyond the iPhone’s current form factor. On top of those challenges, engineers wanted to make each side half as thin as a regular iPhone, so it would be roughly the same thickness when folded. But the tech isn’t there yet, given battery sizes and display constraints.</p>
