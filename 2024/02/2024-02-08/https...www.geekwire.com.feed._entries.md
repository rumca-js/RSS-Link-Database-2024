He will be replaced by Ariane Gorin, currently president of Expedia for Business. Kern will continue to serve as the company&#8217;s vice chairman and remain on its board, which he has been on since 2005. Kern took over as CEO in the early stages of the pandemic, which torpedoed the travel market and crushed Expedia&#8217;s business. The company had also gone through a management shakeup the year prior. But the Seattle-based company has rebounded and its stock is now trading at above pre-pandemic levels.
