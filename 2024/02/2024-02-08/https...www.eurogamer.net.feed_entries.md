Satirical sci-fi shooter sequel Helldivers 2 has got off to a solid start on Steam, with today's launch propelling it to the number three position on the platform's best-sellers list, while its concurrent players have hit over 64,000 in less than a day. However, player reception has been mixed thanks to a range of issues on PC (it's also out on PS5), and developer Arrowhead Game Studios has now responded, saying fixes are on the way.
</p><p>
Helldivers 2 - which follows the same co-op template as its well-received predecessor, albeit with a switch from top-down perspective to third-person - has so far settled on a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/">Steam rating of "mixed"</a> after over 5,300 reviews, with players highlighting a range of launch-day woes.

Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds has moved to address fan concerns following publisher Krafton's announcement that the underwater survival sequel will be a multiplayer title adopting a "game-as-a-service model".
</p><p>
Krafton made the claims in its latest financial earnings report, which also brought the news Subnautica 2 - the third game in Unknown Worlds' series, following on from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-review">acclaimed 2018 original</a> and its 2021 continuation Subnautica: Below Zero - would be out this year.

Assassin's Creed: Codename Red - which takes the long-running series to feudal Japan - will launch before the end of Ubisoft's current financial year next March, CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed, with the publisher's open-world Star Wars Outlaws still targeting a release in 2024.
</p><p>
Guillemot shared the news as part of Ubisoft's <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/52CZPA6t2S0cuqWQNd7HFo/ab62998a8fb0eb39fd4d45106ddafb08/Ubisoft_FY24_Q3_PR_English.pdf">latest earnings results</a> - for the third quarter of fiscal 2023-24 - in which he touted a "very promising line-up" for the year to come.

A re-release of the 90s point-and-click Discworld game "may happen", designer Gregg Barnett has teased. However, the developer said because of the way intellectual property rights work in the UK, 50 percent of the game currently belongs to the crown, which complicates matters a tad.
</p><p>
Discworld was originally released in 1995, having been created with input from Discworld novels author Terry Pratchett. On its launch, the game was well-received, with many complimenting its humour. It became a classic of its time, and a source of many fond memories. I can still recall the voice of Eric Idle's Rincewind perfectly.</p><p>A sequel then followed in the form of Discworld 2: Missing Presumed...!? in 1996, before Discworld Noir arrived in 1999.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discworld-rerelease-may-happen-but-d

Artisan Studios has announced a new hand-painted RPG, with visuals and music from Final Fantasy veterans.

Hitoshi Sakimoto (who composed the scores for Final Fantasy 12, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Tactics Ogre among others) is providing music and audio direction, while Takeshi Oga (Gravity Rush, Siren, Final Fantasy 11 and 14) is providing illustrations.

A handful of brilliant games came about as a result of the late 90s-to-early-00s' somewhat ghoulish obsession with cross-market synergy (like Peter Jackson's King Kong, say, or GoldenEye 007) but the majority of them were, at best, forgettable.</p><p>As the obsession died down however, a younger, trendier opportunist stepped up and took its place: the anime tie-in game. Naturally, games based on anime aren't anything new. They are, however, popping up with more and more frequency - likely due in part to anime's ever increasing popularity outside of Japan - and one publisher is responsible for the majority of the most popular releases: Bandai Namco. Due to its collaboration with anime publishing giant Shueisha, Bandai Namco has the licensing rights to the most popular anime and manga t

Long hair covering her face, gun slung across her back, head turned down to the dirt - the sense is less of someone scoping their targets, and more that they're simply sensing the right place to finally take their shot.</p><p>Of course, it's you in control - sending The Girl left or right along a preset path as you scan the bright shapes in the distance: glowing golden figures amidst dark surroundings, highlighted as if by some sort of sixth sense. Does The Girl have some kind of special powers? Were the cult in question, the Children of the Sun, anything to do with that? The only information you're give

Take-Two Interactive and 2K Games have said that virtual currencies within games are "fictions created by game publishers" during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-and-2k-sued-over-in-game-currency-in-yearly-sports-series">lawsuit which alleges that money is effectively stolen from players when games are shut down</a>. 
</p><p>
The lawsuit, originally filed in November by a Californian minor and his mother, alleges that Take-Two is guilty of civil theft and unfair business practicies for closing down servers for various NBA 2K, WWE 2K and PGA Tour 2K titles, causing players to lose access to any remaining in-game funds they have paid for.

A city tour demonstrating the architecture of New York usually doesn't need to specify that it's "pacifist." But when it takes place in Tom Clancy's: The Division, avoiding violence is difficult. The digital tourists in Total Refusal's film Operation Jane Walk carry rifles and tactical gear, whether they want to use them or not. As they move towards Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive to discuss the work of urban planner Robert Moses and theorist Jane Jacobs, they have to avoid and ignore incoming fire. Next, they pause to watch an NPC endlessly beat something that looks suspiciously like a human corpse.</p><p>"If we don't disturb him, he'll continue his performance forever," says the tour guide.</p><p><a href="https://totalrefusal.com/home/operation-jane-walk">Operation Jane Walk</a> is one of Total Refusal's earl
