<p>The Oscar-winning screenwriter aims to recall 80s classics from Heathers to Beetlejuice but there are too many parts missing</p><p>The blindsiding success of 2007’s Juno gave Hollywood an unusual new star, a young and outspoken stripper-turned-screenwriter whose very existence upended dusty industry expectations, and one who became hard to easily pigeonhole. Diablo Cody, who wrote her first hit screenplay before she turned 30, was rewarded with an Oscar, and within a profession where household names are rarer than rare, she became a minor celebrity, all eyes fixated on whatever her next move would be.</p><p>Cody’s follow-up – the poppy supernatural horror Jennifer’s Body - turned those cheers to jeers, an Oscar winner suddenly attracting the unfair attention of the Razzies (an admittedly heinous institution with a profoundly stupid voting record) and repelling that of audiences.

<p>Polish contralto who displayed a great range and athleticism particularly in works by Handel and Rossini</p><p>The preternatural quality of the voice of the Polish contralto Ewa Podleś, who has died aged 71, inevitably divided opinion, but the relative infrequency of her appearances in both London and New York only enhanced the significance of the occasion for her many devoted admirers. Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of Podleś’ unorthodox vocalism was that her cavernous, all-engulfing instrument – dark, even elegiac in tone – was nevertheless supremely capable of negotiating the virtuoso passagework characteristic of the bel canto repertory in which she excelled.</p><p>She was a true “coloratura contralto”, her voice having a low centre of gravity, yet with a range of over three octaves. Nothing more thrilled her audiences than to hear her dipping down deep into the baritonal register, only to sail to a top D at the conclusion of an aria.</p> <a href="https://www.theg

For the first time, the EU’s climate change service <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-68110310">confirms</a>, global warming has exceeded 1.5C above preindustrial levels across an entire year.

<p>Not every big moment needs an elaborate frenzied celebration but it’s up to you whether you want to get annoyed about it</p><p>In my wild – drug-free and apocalyptically conformist – youth I used to play a drinking game called “finger’s on”. A group of us would each put an index finger on an empty glass and take it in turns to guess how many would remain, with participants deciding to leave their finger in place or remove it from the glass. “I think there’ll be&nbsp;… five” – cue frantic counting and success or failure.</p><p>If correct you were out of the game and poured a little bit of your pint into the glass – the last person remaining was required to drink the concoction in front of them. But the kicker was that you were not allowed to celebrate until you had high-fived each previously successful player in order of when they went out of the game. No glimpse of a smile, not even the slightest raise of one corner of your mouth; if your eyes even so much as glinted with

<p>The conductor’s orchestral suites explores the subtlety of Puccini’s scoring, and render Madama Butterfly and Tosca afresh</p><p>The Covid pandemic may have kept Carlo Rizzi away from the podium, but they did give him the time to fulfil his idea, originally inspired by conducting the orchestral suite from Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier, of extracting orchestral works from of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/giacomo-puccini">Puccini’s</a> operas. In creating these scores, Rizzi was clear that he intended his “suites”, as he calls them (though each plays continuously) as celebrations of Puccini’s brilliance as an orchestrator, and not as concert-hall surrogates for the operas themselves. His scores – the Madama Butterfly suite is 17 minutes along, the Tosca, just over 20 – never attempt to fill in missing vocal lines.</p><p>Certainly in these performances by the Welsh National Opera orchestra he takes the opportunity to revel in the imagination and subtlety of Puccini

But for the soprano, apparently, the Four Last Songs conjure up ideas of solitude, “not an unhappy solitude, rather a journey towards infinity”. In fact her disc contains two recordings of Strauss’s final work; there’s the usual orchestral version, with Mikko Franck conducting the French radio orchestra, and then the songs with piano accompaniments (none of them Strauss’s own arrangements). Grigorian’s rationale for doubling up is that each version of the cycle requires “differe

It’s kind of distracting,” she said. “It’ll only get worse,” she added. Her tone was neither kind nor unkind. No particular offence was taken.</p><p>She was right about one thing: it has got worse.

<p>1980s black comedy unravels the brutal legacy of a despot who is as ludicrous as his crimes are appalling</p><p>The sense of an ending is what this fascinating film delivers: an unimaginably painful ending and the moral reckoning that has to follow. This dreamlike satire from Georgian film-maker Tengiz Abuladze, was made in 1984 but suppressed for three years before release. This was not so much for its coded critique of Stalinism – of which the Soviet authorities had long since learned to parrot their regretful disapproval – but of the pusillanimous loyalty to the Stalinist memory that persisted in the USSR for generations, and the taboo that even then forbade serious reassessment of Stalinist crimes and exhumation of its buried horror. Now Repentance is revived and its strange theatricality and madness are more disturbing than ever.<br /><br />Partly a bizarre parable, it is an absurdist social-surrealist attack on power and state violence.

It is part how-to guide, peppered with frank lists that crunch hard-won advice into easily digestible bites, and will be useful for young film-makers – but the layperson will inhale it for the gossip and what&nbsp;it reveals about the frankly bewildering systems of power that prop up the entertainment business.</p><p>Zwick writes briskly and warmly, with a clear eye to keeping things moving. He admits early on that he is pulled between telling a good story and a desire “not to be excommunicated from certain Hollywood parties that I don’t care to attend any

With 280 million people, this is the fourth most populous nation on Earth, after India, China and the US, and the largest Muslim-majority country. It’s also one of the most overlooked, by western eyes at least. What proportion of anglophones could even place Jakarta on a map?

<p>Often overlooked in favour of larger, more charismatic cousins, we asked scientists to tell us about the smallest-known species, from a nano-chameleon to a miniature frog</p><p>In the 19th century, the German zoologist Christian Bergmann pondered a simple question: why are some animals so small? His answer, that a warm-blooded animal’s size increases as its habitat cools, remains a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/bergmann-rule">rule in biology to this day</a>.</p><p>“Bergmann pointed out that smaller species tend to live in warmer climes. This pattern is to do with surface area and volume: smaller animals lose heat faster and struggle to maintain their body temperature when it is very cold,” says Dr Simon Loader, the principal curator of vertebrates at the Natural History Museum. “Whatever the reasons, these small species are fascinating,” he says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/08/whos-the-smallest-

He describes his love for them – and how he survived the impossible pain</p><p>In the early years, Kevin Adkisson had what he describes as an “idyllic” childhood. He and his four younger brothers – David, Kerry, Mike and Chris – grew up on a farm in rural Texas. They spent their days drinking chocolate milk and eating blackberries from the fields, running around with their dogs and riding horses. When they became wrestling stars – known in the ring as the Von Erichs – their excursions got fancier. They would fly out to Hawaii between matches and spend a few days diving and fishing. “We always had fun,” he says. They were as close as brothers could be, often competing side by side in the ring.</p><p>But, one night in 1984, that life shattered. Adkisson was at home when he got a call from his sister-in-law Patricia. David, the second eldest brot
