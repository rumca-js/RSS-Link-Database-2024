Henry Cavill has gone on the record as not understanding sex scenes, and generally not being a fan of them. Interesting take from someone who's internationally recognized as a sex symbol and has done an intimate scene or two himself in different projects. And speaking of Cavill, he's super excited for the Warhammer 40K adaptation that's set up at Prime Video. In other news, Kumail Nanjiani has started therapy because of the backlack to Marvel's The Eternals. Ouch.
