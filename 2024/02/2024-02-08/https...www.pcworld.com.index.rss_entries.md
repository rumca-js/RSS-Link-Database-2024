<p>You might think that, as a generic text editor, Notepad would sit out Microsoft&rsquo;s AI roadmap. Nope. And Microsoft is also testing shortcuts in which Copilot can be used to trigger often-used actions, such as summarizing a page.</p>



<p>Microsoft made a number of proposed changes that it&rsquo;s testing out in its Canary and Dev Channels on Thursday. For one, both channels will operate under the same build numbers for a short time &mdash; and if you trigger the <strong>winver</strong> command, he builds will show up as &ldquo;24H2&rdquo;. &ldquo;This denotes that Windows 11, version 24H2 will be this year&rsquo;s annual feature update,&rdquo; Microsoft said in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/02/08/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26052-canary-and-dev-chann

<p>Now that wireless gaming mice are just as fast and feature-packed as their wired counterparts, going wireless can be a smart move, giving you greater flexibility as a gamer. But before you cut loose and buy one, it&rsquo;s worth noting they&rsquo;re not all alike. You&rsquo;ll still need to consider factors like weight, dots per inch (DPI), and battery life which can be telling factors in how your gaming mouse performs and ultimately how you will perform in games. </p>



<p>Our expert reviewers have put these mice through their paces, testing them across a range of scenarios, and over extended periods of time. Below are the results of that effort. While these are the current best wireless gaming mice available, for a no holds barred list, including both wired and wireless models, be sure to check out PCWorld&rsquo;s all-inclusive selection of the <a hre

<p>When I was a kid, the gadgets in any given movie or TV show were the real stars. John Connor&rsquo;s handheld Atari, Marty McFly&rsquo;s self-lacing Nikes, and about a million different variations on the radio watch were what I dreamed of owning one day. So I feel a certain kinship with YouTuber <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@abetoday&amp;xcust=2-1-2231086-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Abe&rsquo;s Projects</a>, who took his love for fictional gadgets one step further and made a real version of the Pokedex from the Pokemon cartoon. </p>



<p>If you weren&rsquo;t the right age in the late 90s, the Pokedex is a handheld computer riffing on the Palm Pilots of the day. Its sole purpose is to identify and catalog Pokemon creatures in the wild. Metatextually, it&rsquo;s a

<p>When it comes to PCs, it&rsquo;s important to know a thing or two about the hardware inside of them.

<p>Bitcoin and blockchain are on everyone&rsquo;s lips, but for many people they are a closed book. The topic is indeed complex. We&rsquo;ll try to explain the most important terms as clearly as possible.</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) is a digital currency. The name is a combination of bit (smallest binary unit of information) and coin. The quantity is limited to 21 million and 19.5 million of these have already been mined or generated. </p>



<p>However, as the amount of BTC distributed decreases over the years, it will be more than a hundred years before the last Bitcoin is mined. The smallest unit of Bitcoin is a Satoshi &ndash; 0.00000001 BTC. Theoretically, it could be scaled infinitely smaller, but this would only make sense if a BTC were worth much more. For a Satoshi to be worth one dollar, a Bitcoin would have to cost 100 million dollars (as  of the end
