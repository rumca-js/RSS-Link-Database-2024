<p>Jay Kristoff needs little introduction. He is the author of the Nevernight series, the Empire of the Vampire series and a range of YA novels. He also looks like Dave Grohl’s literary alter ego and regularly breaks bookstore websites when new editions of his work are released – a rockstar in the SFF world, if you want to put a label on him. His latest novel, The Empire of the Damned is the follow-up to the best-selling The Empire of the Vampire and out in spring 2024. Grimdark Magazine was able to snag one of the coveted interview spaces in the run-up to publication. [GDM] Is no horse safe in Empire of the Damned? Is this your way of disposing of all the ponies you demand from your readers asking you silly questions?  [JK] … It’s strange to think that “Horse” turned out to be the most dangerous occupation in a medieval vampire apocalypse. Funny thing is, I actually like horses irl! The way I write them, anyone would think a gelding murdered my parents in a mugging gone wron
