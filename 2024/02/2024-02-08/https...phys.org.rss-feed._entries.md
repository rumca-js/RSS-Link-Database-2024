For more than five years, scientists at the South Pole Telescope in Antarctica have been observing the sky with an upgraded camera. The extended gaze toward the cosmos is picking up remnant light from the universe's early formation. Now researchers have analyzed an initial batch of data, publishing details in the journal Physical Review D. The results from this limited dataset hint at even more powerful future insights about the nature of our universe.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, surfaces in public spaces have been cleaned more often. While disinfectant solutions eliminate germs, they don't leave behind a truly bare surface. They deposit a thin film that doesn't get wiped up, even after giving the surface a good polish. Researchers reporting in ACS ES&amp;T Air show that residues left by commercial cleaning products contain a wider range of compounds that could impact indoor air quality than previously thought.

Soil moisture can determine how quickly a wildfire spreads, how fast a hill turns into a mudslide, and perhaps most importantly, how productive our food systems are. As temperatures rise due to human-caused climate change, some researchers are concerned that soils will dry. However, between 2011 to 2020, soil moisture increased across 57% of the United States during summer, the warmest time of year.

In most materials, heat prefers to scatter. If left alone, a hotspot will gradually fade as it warms its surroundings. But in rare states of matter, heat can behave as a wave, moving back and forth somewhat like a sound wave that bounces from one end of a room to the other. In fact, this wave-like heat is what physicists call "second sound."

Plastic household items and clothing made of synthetic fibers release microplastics, particles less than five millimeters in size that can enter the environment unnoticed. A small proportion of these particles are so small that they are measured in nanometers. Such nanoplastics are the subject of intensive research, as nanoplastic particles can be absorbed into the human body due to their small size—but, as of today, little is known about their potential toxicity.

Superhydrophobic surfaces, characterized by their ability to repel water with a contact angle above 150° and a sliding angle below 10°, offer a range of applications from self-cleaning and anti-corrosion to oil/water separation and droplet manipulation. Traditionally, creating such surfaces has been challenging, requiring complex, time-consuming, or material-specific methods.

National University of Singapore (NUS) researchers have demonstrated that deep learning allows them to observe the dynamics of single molecules more precisely and with less data than traditional evaluation methods. They used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to observe the movement of single molecules in artificial systems, cells and small organisms. Their findings have been published in the Biophysical Journal.
