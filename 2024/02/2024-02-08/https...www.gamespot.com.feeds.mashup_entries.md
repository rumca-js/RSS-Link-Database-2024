<p dir="ltr">Christopher Nolan reiterated his perspective on his 2020 film Tenet, emphasizing that some aspects of his filmography, including that movie, are not necessarily meant to make complete sense--and audiences can still find enjoyment in them without fully comprehending them. Speaking on a recent The Late Show With Stephen Colbert appearance, Nolan addressed the film's complex narrative and viewers' vocal struggles to fully grasp its perhaps intentionally obtuse intricacies.</p><p dir="ltr">Nolan, known for his tangled storytelling in films like Inception, Memento, and Interstellar--and arguably also Oppenheimer, if you find security hearings hard to follow--responded to questions about the perceived ambiguity of Tenet. "You're not meant to understand everything in Tenet. It's not all comprehensible," Nolan said (via <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/christopher-nolan-loves-fast-and-furious-tenet-not-comprehensible-1235902301/">Variety</a>), likening this am

<p dir="ltr">The second season of Halo has arrived. For those that were hoping that in Season 2, Master Chief would keep his helmet on more, after unmasking during Season 1 now know that's simply not going to happen. If anything, Chief is going to take off his helmet more and even spend chunks of episodes in normal civilian clothing. It's something star Pablo Schreiber has spoken about previously, though he fears his words were misinterpreted and wanted to clear the air.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a group of people that would prefer that the helmet never came off, right? And yeah, there have been some quotes that have been attributed to me that I don't think, you know, display my exact words correctly," he told GameSpot. "And maybe [they] were taken out of context. But just to be clear, you know, I love acting with the helmet. I love and respect helmet acting.

<p>Madame Web star Dakota Johnson has been acting since she was a child and got to be involved with one of her favorite shows in a brief cameo. As it turns out though, the time on set was less than ideal.</p><p>While on Late Night with Seth Meyers, the NBC host revealed that he and Johnson co-starred in a project together, which was the series finale of The Office. Johnson briefly appeared as a new accountant named Dakota, replacing Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) a year after the documentary had aired. Meyers appeared in the series as himself alongside Bill Hader. The skit was performed during Weekend Update as Hader mocked Ed Helms' character Andy for a public breakdown he had on a singing reality show, meaning Meyers didn't film that part on set of the show.</p><div>          </div><p>"That was honestly the worst time of my life," the actress told Meyers.
