Anthracnose fruit rot (AFR), caused by the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum fioriniae, is the most destructive and widespread fruit disease of blueberry, impacting fruit quality and yield. The reliance on fungicides prompts the need for sustainable solutions, highlighting the importance of breeding AFR-resistant cultivars. Research points to quercetin glycosides in blueberries with potential antifungal properties against AFR, yet the genetic and biochemical underpinnings of resistance are poorly understood. This knowledge gap underscores the urgency to explore the genetic basis and phytochemical defenses against AFR to develop environmentally friendly, resistant blueberry varieties.

Unlike their naturally occurring counterparts, EM metamaterials derive their extraordinary properties from their unique structural arrangements, allowing them to exhibit unattainable electromagnetic characteristics in conventional materials.

Biological hydrogen-methane conversion refers to the production of methane through the action of microorganisms using hydrogen generated by electrolysis of water with residual power and carbon dioxide present in biogas. This approach promises to overcome the limitations of hydrogen storage, lowering the financial burden of biogas upgrading, and enabling carbon-negative utilization of CO2 in biogas.

This new NASA Hubble Space Telescope image shows ESO 185-IG013, a luminous blue compact galaxy (BCG). BCGs are nearby galaxies that show an intense burst of star formation. They are unusually blue in visible light, which sets them apart from other high-starburst galaxies that emit more infrared light. Astrophysicists study BCGs because they provide a relatively close-by equivalent for galaxies from the early universe. This means that BCGs can help scientists learn about galaxy formation and evolution that may have been happening billions of years ago.

A flash of lightning. A roll of thunder. These are normal stormy sights and sounds. But sometimes, up above the clouds, stranger things happen. Our Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has spotted bursts of gamma rays—some of the highest-energy forms of light in the universe—coming from thunderstorms. Gamma rays are usually found coming from objects with crazy extreme physics like neutron stars and black holes. So why is Fermi seeing them come from thunderstorms?

Earth's moon achieved its Swiss cheese appearance from celestial objects crashing into its surface, forming impact craters. But craters weren't all that was left behind; the intense pressure and temperature of such a collision also impacted the rocks and dust covering the lunar surface, known as regolith, altering its mineral composition and structure. Analyzing the resulting minerals provides modern researchers clues to the moon's past.
