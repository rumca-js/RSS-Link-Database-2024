They do this because leftism is literally a religion. And most people can agree that the worst group among progressives is probably vegans. This is why PETA has decided to make its own version of the “Ten Commandments” because they think they know better than God.<br /></p><p>But it’s worse than all that because they are also trying to push it in Oklahoma school classrooms. </p><p><a href="https://thenationaldesk.com/news/americas-news-now/peta-fights-for-ten-vegan-commandments-in-oklahoma-classrooms-in-response-to-bill-jim-olsen-biblical-bible-education-ryan-walters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to <em>The National Desk: </em></a></p><blockquote>“The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) wants Oklahoma classrooms to display the group's T

For quite some time now the Biden Administration has been slandering conservatives by claiming that many people are trying to “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/08/1180941627/biden-pride-month-book-bans" target="_blank">ban books</a>'' in schools. Everyone reading this knows that that couldn’t be further from the truth. But as I said, they subsequently berate everyone around them for the very things they are guilty of. This is why white house aids worked with Amazon to censor books related to “vaccine misinformation”.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

	Gutted to wake up to the news this morning of Toby Keith, 62, passing away after a battle with stomach cancer. His family made the announcement on his social media platforms that he passed peacefully on February 5th, sounded by his family, fighting his fight with grace and courage until the very end.
</p><p>
	Of course, the way Instagram's algorithm works, the next time I opened the app up I saw this post from the day before of Toby's last performance, about "getting back at it" after the end of another weekend.
