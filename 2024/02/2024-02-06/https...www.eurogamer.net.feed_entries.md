Square Enix will review its development system to improve the quality of its games, company president Takashi Kiryu has announced.
</p><p>
Kiryu's comments were made during Square Enix's latest financial results briefing, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2024-02-06/S8FCLCT0AFB400">Bloomberg</a> reported, during which he indicated a policy of reducing outsourced development and focusing on large-scale games developed in-house, with the aim of boosting both the quality of games and profit margins.
</p><p>
The new system is set to be announced in spring, with multiple sources at the conference call stating it will be in effect in April. That would align with the company's new financial year.

Valiant Hearts: Coming Home looks to be making its way to consoles in the future. 
</p><p>
The First World War Ubisoft sequel was previously exclusive to Netflix on mobile, having been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-brand-new-valiant-hearts-on-the-way">announced during 2022's Game Awards</a>. However, this exclusivity may be over soon, as a post by Brazil's ratings board (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisofts-valiant-hearts-sequel-is-coming-to-consoles/">VGC</a>) has the game listed for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. 
</p><p>
Valiant Hearts: Coming Home is described as a "dramatic narrative game" by Ubisoft, and sees players following the interweaving stories of James, Anna, Ernst and George. Walt (the first game's canine companion) returns in the sequel to help p

They had never actually had a lucid dream, but that inevitably only made them more into it. They read books on lucid dreaming and probably attended symposia on lucid dreaming. Their house was filled with Post-it notes on which they had written, over and over, "IS THIS A DREAM?" before plastering them to every surface, because the books and symposia had all told them that the key to this magical garden was teaching yourself to constantly question whether or not you were dreaming right now.</p><p>Reader, like my friend I have never had a lucid dream. But I imagine it's a bit like <a href="https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/">Infinite Craft</a>, the latest browser game from Neal Agarwal.

A Twitch streamer has had his custom Pok&eacute;mon emote removed due to sexual content - even though it's just an innocent Bonsly.
</p><p>
Pok&eacute;mon streamer SBCoop shared the response from Twitch on X, formerly Twitter, showing the emote in question. It's just a little Bonsly on its back crying with a hole in its base, isn't it?
</p><p>
According to the removal statement from Twitch, the emote includes "imagery of sexual content or nudity" in a "gasm-style".

The company has been making wave amongst audiophiles, and today we have in for review their most affordable headphones - the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/MEZE-AUDIO-99-Neo-Over-Ear-Headphones-neo-black/dp/B06XKJ2GK4?tag=eurgam-df-uk-21" rel="sponsored">&pound;185</a>/<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Over-Ear-Headphones-Adjustable-Closed-Back-Audiophiles/dp/B06XKJ2GK4?tag=eurgam-df-us-20" rel="sponsored">$199</a> Meze 99 Neos. These are far from cheap headphones at that price, but when the other end of Meze's range <a href="https://mezeaudio.eu/collections/all/products/elite-tungsten">tops out at &euro;4000</a> they're still relatively modest!</p><p>As you'd hope, the Meze 99 Neo still carry a certain air of authority wit

Nintendo remains tight-lipped on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-successor-reportedly-due-late-2024">widely-expected launch of Switch 2 this year</a> - except to say that its current Switch hardware would remain its "main business" heading into the year.

In an investor call today, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said the company would lay out its plan for the coming financial year at its next earnings briefing, expected in May (thanks, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-06/nintendo-lifts-profit-and-switch-sales-outlook-after-profit-beat">Bloomberg</a>).
