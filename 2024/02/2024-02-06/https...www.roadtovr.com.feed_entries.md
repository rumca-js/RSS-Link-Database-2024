<div>Yu-Gi-Oh! doesn&#8217;t have an official VR game yet, but after demoing a VR proof-of-concept of the card battler at the franchise&#8217;s 25th anniversary event in Tokyo, Japan, Konami says we may see more in the future. Last weekend at the Tokyo Dome, Konami held an event that, in addition showing off all things dedicated to [&#8230;]</div>

<div>Vision Pro isn&#8217;t supposed to be able to play SteamVR games, although an independent software developer has been able to modify a popular Wi-Fi streaming app that could open the door to PC VR games like Half-Life: Alyx (2020) on Vision Pro—if it weren&#8217;t for the Apple&#8217;s strategic omission of tracked motion controllers.
