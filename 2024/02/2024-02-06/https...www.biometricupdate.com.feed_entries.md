		Transforming your visa operations is the first step towards seamless, digital journeys that generates growth in travel and tourism.

As the world recovers from the effects of a global pandemic – a public health crisis which closed borders, grounded aircraft, confined ships to port, and left billions of passengers unable to travel for work or leisure – now is the time to re-think old ways of working and adopt new working practices to drive growth in travel and tourism; and ensure borders are secure and capable of identifying risk at the earliest opportunity.

In this paper by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/sita">SITA</a>, we examine the role and value of electronic travel authorization systems – particularly Electronic Visas (eVisas

		The rise of deepfakes is making it harder to distinguish real information from a well-crafted AI-generated imposter, threatening the integrity of democratic processes by compromising the media that citizens depend on to make informed choices.

2024 is a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202401/deepfakes-are-a-global-election-issue-and-a-major-threat-to-global-stability-wef">critical election year</a> around the world. This year, <a href="https://time.com/6550920/world-elections-2024/">voters will head to the polls</a> in at least 64 countries as well as the European Union. As many as 49 percent of people globally will participate in elections.

		Romance scams rose by 19 percent globally last year, according to data from behavioral biometrics cybersecurity company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/biocatch">BioCatch</a>. These scams target those looking for relationships by using fake photos to build a trusting relationship with a victim before asking for money to pay bills or travel to meet with the victim.

Some regions saw a particularly sharp rise in cases. North America saw a 183 percent rise in romance scams, while the Asia Pacific region saw an increase of 104 percent.

Phone calls and texts were the top communication channels for scams, while Facebook and WhatsApp were top platforms for scammers, according to a report from the <a href="https://www.gasa.org/product-page/globa

		Biometrics are among the top priorities for airports and airlines, who are spending more money than ever on IT upgrades to support customer journeys, data processing and optimized energy consumption, according to the latest insight report from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/sita">SITA</a>.

The newly published 2023 Air Transport IT Insights report says airports spent an estimated US$10.8 billion and airlines spent about US$34.5 billion on IT. Per a news release, biometrics are popular for helping to curb congestion, with 70 percent of airlines hoping to have biometric ID management in place by 2026, and 90 percent investing in further biometrics R+D.

		Generative AI could be listening to your phone calls and hijacking them with fake biometric audio for fraud or manipulation purposes, according to new research published by Security Intelligence. In the wake of a Hong Kong fraud case that saw an employee transfer US$25 million in funds to five bank accounts after a virtual meeting with what turned out to be <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/deepfake-videos-looked-so-real-that-an-employee-agreed-to-send-them-25-million">audio-video deepfakes</a> of senior management, the biometrics and digital identity world is on high alert, and the threats are growing more sophisticated by the day.

		If you’re confused by all the identity verification solutions on the market and how they’re different, you’re not alone. With everyone claiming to have the fastest and most accurate solution for helping you know and trust your customers, it can be hard to decide which one is really the best.

The technical jargon makes it even more challenging. Does your solution really need artificial intelligence? How is it different from machine learning? What is an algorithm, anyway? In this e-book, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/jumio">Jumio</a> explores all the angles you need to consider when evaluating identity verification solutions.

		A European data watchdog is scrutinizing a proposal to enhance Europol’s cooperation with Frontex and other agencies that would boost the exchange of biometric data of migrants.

The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), the body in charge of monitoring European institutions and bodies privacy and data protection practices, says that while the European Commission’s proposed regulation is aimed at fighting against migrant smuggling and trafficking, it also raises serious legal questions. Among the main questions is whether Europol will keep to its obligation to process biometric data and disseminate it to Member States in line with the GDPR principles of strict necessity and proportionality.
