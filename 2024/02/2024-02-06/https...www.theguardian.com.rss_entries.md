<ul><li>Coventry host Maidstone after win over Sheffield Wednesday</li><li>Leeds earn extra-time victory; Southampton see off Watford</li></ul><p>Three extra-time goals fired <strong>Leeds</strong> into the FA Cup fifth round with a 4-1 win at Championship rivals <strong>Plymouth</strong>. The substitutes Crysencio Summerville and Georginio Rutter combined to put the visitors 3-1 up before a 117th-minute own goal by Argyle striker Ryan Hardie capped a comprehensive Leeds win. They will now travel to Aston Villa or Chelsea on 28 February.</p><p>Leeds hit the woodwork twice in the opening 20 minutes of a hard-fought first half but the tie was goalless at the break. However their pressure eventually told in the second half as Wilfried Gnonto fired the visitors ahead in the 66th minute with a measured right-foot strike from the edge of the box which beat Conor Hazard. Gnonto benefited from a superb pass from Glen Kamara from the right.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/foo

<p>Nigeria and Ivory Coast start favourites over South Africa and DR Congo but this has been a tournament of remarkable upsets</p><p>A tournament of extraordinary drama has thrown up two semi-finals that each match one of the continent’s current giants against a team that has distant memories of glory. Neither South Africa nor Democratic Republic of the Congo arrived at the Africa Cup of Nations with especially elevated hopes but on Wednesday they face Nigeria and the hosts Ivory Coast respectively for a place in the final.</p><p>Ivory Coast, whose golden generation spent so long narrowly missing out on the trophy, are, like their opponents, looking to win the tournament for the third time. The difference is that it is 50 years since DRC last triumphed. They were one of the early powers of African football, winning the tournament in 1968 and then again, as Zaire, in 1974, the year in which they became the first sub-Saharan African side to play at the World Cup.</p> <a href="h

<p>Repetition has blunted the art museum protests so much that the pumpkin soup assault on the Mona Lisa felt pathetic. More effective tactics are needed</p><p>How many of the 38 environmental protests staged in museums in 2022 can you remember? How many of the more recent ones only generated widespread outrage? Did any of them lead to tangible change? The protesters’ cause is serious, the threat is very real, the message is important and urgent. But is it not getting through to the public?</p><p>Sixty years ago, Andy Warhol’s Brillo Boxes and multiplied Marilyn Monroe screen-prints exposed modern repetition as an ideal of mindlessness – an inescapable capitalist pattern ingrained in the oversaturated modes of production and consumption that distract and overwhelm while nurturing an irreducible sense of modern apathy.

## When the PM and Piers Morgan strike a £1,000 TV bet about desperate human lives, whom do you abhor the most? | Gavin Esler

<p>No wonder Sunak today seeks to extricate himself. None of the world leaders I have interviewed would have behaved this way</p><p>For Piers Morgan the most important thing in a Piers Morgan interview is the fact that Piers Morgan is doing it. He is the TV equivalent of the Bette Midler character in the movie Beaches. She finally stops talking about herself and says: “But enough about me. Let’s talk about you. What do you think of me?”</p><p>That’s comedy. Piers Morgan is real life, or what passes for real life in sections of the British media. But what is bizarre is that the prime minister of the United Kingdom – the prime minister! – willingly plays along as the the foil to Piers Morgan on an obscure television channel for which Morgan is likely to be paid more in pounds than there are viewers.</p><p>Gavin Esler is the author most recently of Britain Is Better Than This</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/06/pm-piers-morgan-1000-tv-bet-rishi-sun

All these women lived, if not their worst, then surely their most medieval, nightmare, and some are living it as we speak.</p><p>The natural question was: what the hell was going on?

<p>1990 had Rome, 2006 had Berlin, 2014 had Rio and 2026 will have East Rutherford. So how did Fifa decide on the venue?</p><p><strong>The World Cup final is being held in </strong><em><strong>New Jersey</strong></em><strong>? As in the industrial hellscape at the start of the Sopranos? And the Jersey Shore? The kind of place where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buK45NW_ikI">guys eat sloppy steaks</a>? </strong>Well technically, yes. But this is really a New York City final: MetLife stadium is only seven miles from Manhattan, and sits very close to the New York/New Jersey border. That the biggest match in world football will take place in (OK, very near) the biggest city in the United States makes sense [Disclaimer: New Jersey also has friendly people, beautiful countryside, charming small towns and stunning coastline].</p><p><strong>And because it’s the World Cup final and it’s in the richest country in the world, no doubt MetLife is a breathtaking venue. </strong>

<p>At Belong Chester, the older residents and young children have the chance to spend each day together, and it’s led to big improvements in all their lives. What’s the secret?</p><p>It is lunchtime in the bistro at Belong and half a dozen toddlers are tucking into sausage cassoulet, mash and seasonal vegetables. Anyone acquainted with the table manners of two- and three-year-olds may well be bracing themselves for carnage. Yet green beans are being happily pronged with forks rather than chucked on the floor and some faces don’t even need a wipe. To underline this dining miracle: one little girl is wearing a white top that survives a tomato-based sauce.</p><p>For this remarkable scene we can thank the calming presence of Bill Wall, who sits in the middle drinking a cappuccino and gently encouraging the children to have a few more mouthfuls. This 87-year-old former electrician has become one of the children’s “grandfriends” – “our Bill”, they call him. Since he moved into the

<p>Inspired by horror films, artist Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley’s lo-fi games tackle everything from addiction to walking home alone. Just don’t expect a high score</p><p>It’s a quiet morning at London gallery <a href="https://studiovoltaire.org/">Studio Voltaire</a> and Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley is challenging me to a trial run of her latest artwork. It’s a horror-inspired video game in which players fight to overcome the problems that are holding them back, from fear of failure to addiction. It’s also the centrepiece of her first institutional solo show, which takes on the theme of transformation. I grapple with the game but, by my fourth round, I’m still no good; synthetic screams echo around the empty gallery. “It’s supposed to be super hard!” laughs Brathwaite-Shirley. “It’s all based on things that I’m trying to overcome or have overcome. It didn’t take one turn, it took many.”</p><p>The Rebirthing Room is the latest of Brathwaite-Shirley’s participatory works. The id

However, there’s another round anniversary this summer that won’t be celebrated, because it marks a big failure. On 30 August 1954, a vote in the French national assembly killed the project of a European Defence Community (EDC). Instead, European integration proceeded around the economic community that remains the core of the EU to this day, and European security was built around the US-led Nato. But as the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, advances from the east and the US presidential contender Donald Trump threatens to withdraw from the west, it’s time to revisit the idea of Europe defending itself.</p><p>Historical circumstances were obviously very different 70 years ago, but there are some interesting echoes.

Chokas are usually served with a fluffy flatbread called <em>sada roti</em>, for dipping or stuffing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/feb/06/spicy-trini-breakfast-riaz-phillips-vegan-recipe-choka-roti">Continue reading...</a>

<p>These precocious literary fragments hint at the greatness the author might have achieved had she not died at 22</p><p>Among the raft of reissues from heritage imprints, this one stands out, partly because the author’s writing career lasted little more than six months before her death in a motorcycle accident in 1966 at the age of 22.
