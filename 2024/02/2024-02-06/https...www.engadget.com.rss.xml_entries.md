<p>Three of the biggest sports TV companies in the US — ESPN, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery — will launch a streaming sports service in the fall of 2024, the companies said in a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240206387529/en/ESPN-FOX-and-Warner-Bros.-Discovery-Forming-Joint-Venture-to-Launch-Streaming-Sports-Service-in-the-U.S.">joint statement</a> on Tuesday. It will stream sporting events from networks that all three companies own, including games from the NFL, MLB, NHL, and the NBA. Importantly, subscribers will also be able to stream linear channels, including ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SECN, ACCN, ESPNEWS, ABC, FOX, FS1, FS2, BTN, TNT, TBS, truTV, and ESPN+, helpful for anyone thinking about canceling cable.<br /><br />The name of the service and its pricing will be announced later this year, the companies said. It will be available as a standalone app that anyone in the US can subscribe to. But customers will also be able to bundl

<p>Four days after the death of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-12-star-wars-disney-plus-the-mandalorian-cast.html">former costar Carl Weathers</a>, onetime <em>The Mandalorian</em> actor Gina Carano is suing Disney and Lucasfilm for her departure from the series — with Elon Musk’s help. Carano, whose post-Disney credits include a film produced by conspiracy theorist Ben Shapiro, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/ginacarano/status/1754952279646437655">posted</a> Tuesday on X, “The truth is I was being hunted down from everything I posted to every post I liked because I was not in line with the acceptable narrative of the time.” X confirmed its assistance in a statement to Engadget.</p>
<p>Carano <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/ginacarano/status/1754952279646437655">shared</a> news of the lawsuit in a 694-word post on X. In the essay, she claims never to have used aggressive language, compared Republicans to Jewish people d

<p>Two companies based in Texas have been linked to a spate of robocalls that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elevenlabs-reportedly-banned-the-account-that-deepfaked-bidens-voice-with-its-ai-tools-083355975.html"><ins>used artificial intelligence to mimic President Joe Biden</ins></a>. The audio deepfake was used to urge New Hampshire voters not to participate in the state's presidential primary. New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella said as many as 25,000 of the calls were made to residents of the state in January.</p>
<p>Formella says an investigation has linked the source of the robocalls to Texan companies Life Corporation and Lingo Telecom. No charges have yet been filed against either company or Life Corporation's owner, a person named Walter Monk. The probe is ongoing and other entities are believed to be involved. Federal law enforcement officials are said to be looking into the case too.</p>

<p>Akai just <a href="https://www.akaipro.com/mpc-key-37.html">officially announced the MPC Key 37,</a> a standalone workstation and groovebox. This is the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/akai-mpc-live-ii-review-153032772.html">standalone MPC device,</a> following last year’s larger Key 61. The Key 37 has everything you need to make a beat or song from scratch without having to use an actual computer and DAW, with some limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 37 full-size keys, complete with aftertouch. There aren’t that many standalone devices out there with a full keybed, so this should excite musicians who lack experience with Akai-style pads. This device does have 16 velocity-sensitive pads for laying down drum parts and triggering samples, so it’s a “best of both worlds” type situation.</p>

<p>It looks like Elon Musk isn’t the only billionaire who doesn’t like having their private jet tracked. Pop star Taylor Swift has threatened legal action against a Florida student who set up multiple social media accounts that release real-time information as to the whereabouts of her personal aircraft, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/06/taylor-swift-jet-tracking-legal-threat/"><ins>according to </ins><em><ins>The Washington Post.</ins></em></a></p>

<p>The tech industry has been reeling from the combination of a rough economy, the COVID-19 pandemic and some obvious business missteps. And while that led to job cuts in 2022, the headcount reductions unfortunately ramped up in 2023 and so far, seem to be accelerating in 2024. It can be tough to keep track of these moves, so we’ve compiled all the major layoffs in one place and will continue to update this story as the situation evolves.</p>

Apparently, if the Shenzhen-based tech company's plan pushes through, fans are getting a free-to-play title with in-app purchases, similar to the gacha game <em>Genshin Impact</em>. That's a complete departure from the original <em>Elden Ring</em> action RPG, which sells for $60 from the get-go and isn't loaded up with microtransactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's pretty much all the details <em>Reuters</em> has reported — according to the news organization's sources, progress on the project has been slow, so it may take a while before we see the game.

<p>Apple Pay is one of the most popular digital payment services in the world, allowing users to buy stuff on iOS apps, the web and in real life. You can use it to pay with your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac, and it's accepted by thousands upon thousands of retailers. The cool thing about Apple Pay is that it actually digitizes debit/credit card chips, giving people the option of contactless payments. All you have to do is put your phone or watch up to the terminal.</p>
<p>However, you can’t do any of that stuff until you set up Apple Pay on your device. Here’s how to do just that.</p>

<p>Meta’s Oversight Board wants the company to update its manipulated media policy, calling the current rules “incoherent.” This follows the board’s decision about a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/maliciously-edited-joe-biden-video-can-stay-on-facebook-metas-oversight-board-says-110042024.html">misleadingly edited video</a> of President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The video featured footage from October 2022, when the president accompanied his granddaughter, who was voting in person for the first time. News footage shows him placing an “I voted” sticker on her shirt. A Facebook user later shared an edited version that looped the moment, so it appeared as if he repeatedly touched her chest, adding the caption that Biden was a “sick pedophile.”</p>
<p>The Oversight Board said the video did not violate Meta’s manipulated media policy because it wasn’t edited with AI tools, and because the edits were “obvious and therefore unlikely to mislead.” (Has the board been on Facebook?)</p>

<p>At almost seven years old, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-nintendo-is-reportedly-showing-off-switch-sequel-console-to-developers-111620441.html">Nintendo Switch</a> still has life left in it — so much so that Nintendo has upped its predicted sales figures for its current fiscal year. In its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html">third-quarter earnings release</a>, the company announced that it was increasing Switch's projected sales from 15 million to 15.5 million. The boost follows overall third-quarter net sales that were 29.9 billion Japanese yen ($201.1 million) higher and net profits of 6.4 billion Japanese yen ($43.1 million) higher than Nintendo's projections. However, it's worth noting that despite better than expected third-quarter net sales, the figure was still six percent lower than in the same period in 2022.</p>
<p>A few long-standing favorites and new games are likely fuelling additional Switch sales. Nintendo's <em>Su
