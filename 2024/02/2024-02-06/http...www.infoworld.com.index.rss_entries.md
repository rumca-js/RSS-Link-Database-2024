The board of directors wants one of these nifty generative AI systems that everyone is talking about to fundamentally change how the business functions. The expectation, fueled by many business articles, is that this new system will redefine the business. They want one badly, and you’re tasked with building and leading a team that can pull it off. So, how the hell do you do that?</p><h2>Not a new problem</h2>
