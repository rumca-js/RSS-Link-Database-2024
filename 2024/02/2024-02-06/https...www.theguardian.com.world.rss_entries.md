<p>Most of southern California remains under flood watches after storm battered northern part of state killing three people</p><p>Rainfall from one of the wettest storms in southern California history was to ease off on Tuesday, but forecasters warned that floods were still possible and soaked ground raised the threat of potentially deadly landslides.</p><p>The slow-moving storm that parked itself over the region on Monday, dumping a record amount of rain on parts of Los Angeles, could linger into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. Scattered showers and some possible thunderstorms would bring light to moderate rain, but there was still the threat that many places could see brief, fierce downpours dumping 0.5 to 1in ( 1.3 to 3cm) of rain in an hour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/06/california-storms-threaten-flooding-landslides">Continue reading...</a>

<p>PM says he is ‘not a betting person’ after making £1,000 bet during an interview with Piers Morgan</p><p>Good morning. <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> gave an interview to <strong>Rachel Burden</strong> on Radio 5 Live this morning and he was asked about £1,000 bet he appeared to accept from Piers Morgan about the success of his Rwanda policy. The move has been widely condemned as distasteful. Sunak did not argue that he did not accept the bet. (We saw him shake hands on it, although at the same time he was avoiding confirming verbally that he accepted Morgan’s challenge.) But this morning he did imply that he was bounced into it. He said that, twice, that he was taken “totally by surprise” and he insisted that betting wasn’t his thing. He said:</p><p>I’m not a betting person and I was taken totally by surprise in the middle of that interview.</p><p>No, well the point I was trying to get across – as I was taken totally by surprise – the point I was trying to get across was ac
