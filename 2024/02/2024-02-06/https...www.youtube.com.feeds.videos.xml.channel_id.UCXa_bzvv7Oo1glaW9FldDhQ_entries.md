Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the next part of Final Fantasy 7 Remake saga, is out on February 29th for PS5. The excitement is palpable as Cloud and friends venture outside Midgar. They'll meet new characters and party members, battle new enemies and explore gorgeous vistas.

However, Rebirth is also exciting for all the improvements and changes it offers over the first game. Instead of loading screens between different areas, there will be a seamless map to explore that's one-to-one with the original. New Summons and Materia await, and the side content is significantly larger, whether it's the new side quests or activities like Chocobo Racing.

Check out 15 differences between Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Final Fantasy 7 Remake before the former's launch later this month.
