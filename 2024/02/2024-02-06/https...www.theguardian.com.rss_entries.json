Helen Pidd reports</p><p>On Friday at Manchester crown court, Mrs Justice Yip sentenced two teenagers to life in prison for what she called the \u201cexceptionally brutal\u201d murder of Brianna Ghey in Warrington last year. Handing down the long sentences to Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, she said the killing was partly motivated by Brianna\u2019s transgender identity.</p><p>The Guardian\u2019s north of England editor, <strong>Helen Pidd</strong>,<strong> </strong>tells <strong>Nosheen Iqbal </strong>about how she covered the case from the start and watched the evidence unfold. Scarlett Jenkinson, who was described by the judge as the \u201cdriving force\u201d behind the murder, was sentenced to a minimum of 22 years for what the Crown Prosecution Service said was \u201cone of the most disturbing cases\u201d its lawyers had ever dealt with.</p> <a href=\"https://", "album": ""}, {"permanent": false, "tags": [], "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-02-06T02:40:50+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/06/thailand-pita-limjaroenrat-suspended-sentence-former-pm-candidate-unlawful-rally", "language": "en-gb", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": false, "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 167, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Thailand\u2019s former PM candidate Pita Limjaroenrat handed suspended sentence in latest legal blow", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d20b07cd05afbc4460dcbc345ae44148cd0f341/0_125_3729_2238/master/3729.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c20b7057dae8483a9bef2393f21eccd8", "description": "<p>Pita\u2019s sentence for holding an unlawful rally comes a week after a Thai court ruled that his Move Forward party had undermined the monarchy</p><p>A Thai court has handed suspended sentences to former prime ministerial hopeful Pita Limjaroenrat and seven other political figures for holding an unlawful rally in 2019.</p><p>The case adds to the legal trouble facing the opposition Move Forward Party after the country\u2019s constitutional court last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/31/thai-court-rules-move-forward-party-must-end-bid-reform-lese-majesty-law\">ruled that the party has undermined the monarchy</a> and national security amid its campaign to amend a law protecting the monarchy from criticism.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/06/thailand-pita-limjaroenrat-suspended-sentence-former-pm-candidate-unlawful-rally\">Continue reading...</a>", "album": ""}, {"permanent": false, "tags": [], "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-02-06T02:29:09+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/06/bruce-willis-wife-emma-heming-new-book-dementia-diagnosis-caregiving-release-information", "language": "en-gb", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": false, "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 167, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Bruce Willis\u2019 wife writing book about being his caregiver after dementia diagnosis", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c429f35c2d10e0a1a3a7245c4e7db5bebb14e39/462_0_3832_2299/master/3832.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b7e815a2390b6bf1d5e7b7735152eabb", "description": "<p>Announcing her untitled book, set to be published in 2025, Emma Heming Willis recalls having \u2018close to no resources or support\u2019 after her husband\u2019s diagnosis</p><p>Bruce Willis\u2019 wife Emma Heming Willis is set to publish a book about her experience as a caregiver to her husband after he was disagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.</p><p>The untitled book, which will be published in 2025 by Maria Shriver\u2019s publishing imprint <a href=\"https://www.mariashriversundaypaper.com/emma-heming-willis-open-field-announcement/\">the Open Field</a>, will \u201coffer a thoughtful, inspiring guide for those seeking support while navigating a loved one\u2019s dementia.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/06/bruce-willis-wife-emma-heming-new-book-dementia-diagnosis-caregiving-release-information\">Continue reading...</a>", "album": ""}, {"permanent": false, "tags": [], "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-02-06T02:24:58+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-713", "language": "en-gb", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": false, "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 167, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 713", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d45e91a24860758396dbccb4df05043cf52faee9/0_0_7987_4792/master/7987.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bc6e71daa9de543b2c6a544cb295d55a", "description": "<p>\u2018Bakery\u2019 attack targeted Russian officials, not civilians, say Ukrainians;
