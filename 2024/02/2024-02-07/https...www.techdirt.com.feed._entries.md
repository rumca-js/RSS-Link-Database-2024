In late 2022, the state of New York&#160;finally passed&#160;new right to repair legislation after years of activist pressure. The bill, which went live last month, gives New York consumers the right to fix their electronic devices themselves or have them more easily repaired by an independent repair shop, instead of being forced to only obtain [&#8230;]

Every week it’s some other dumb thing going on in the Senate. On Tuesday Senator Josh Hawley went to the (mostly empty) Senate floor to “seek unanimous consent” for the STOP CSAM bill. That’s basically a process to rush the bill forward before it’s ready. We’ve written about STOP CSAM before. Despite it’s name, it [&#8230;]

The FBI has done some heinous things in its pursuit of its counter-terrorism objectives. While it&#8217;s true the FBI has occasionally nabbed actual terrorists, it seems to prefer creating terrorists to going after those that are already avowed terrorists. The FBI utilizes informants and undercover agents to perform this highly questionable work. Investigations border on [&#8230;]

MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creating of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages. That&#8217;s all well and good, but it means nothing if you don&#8217;t have a firm grasp of the data types used within MATLAB. In this course you&#8217;ll cover not just data [&#8230;]

We’ve written a few times now about how the misleadingly named House “Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government” is not actually looking into the “weaponization of the federal government,” but rather is very much about allowing Chairman Jim Jordan to go about weaponizing the powers of the subcommittee himself to threaten and intimidate [&#8230;]

Back in December I wrote a feature for The Verge exploring the FCC&#8217;s long overdue effort to stop race and class discrimination in broadband deployment. For decades, big telecoms have not only refused to evenly upgrade broadband in low income and poor areas (despite billions in subsidies for this exact purpose), they&#8217;ve charged poor and [&#8230;]

Well, this is a new one for me. In all the stories we&#8217;ve done over the years on concerns over real life violence and violent video games, one point we&#8217;ve made over and over again is that people certainly can tell the difference between video games and real life. I, for one, abhor guns in [&#8230;]

Predictive policing programs were supposed to make police work smarter and more efficient. It was supposed to trim down on hours wasted where a police presence wasn&#8217;t needed and increase enforcement in areas where crime was a problem. But it hasn&#8217;t done this. It hasn&#8217;t made cops smarter. It&#8217;s possibly just made them lazier. No [&#8230;]
