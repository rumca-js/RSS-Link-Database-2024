This Splatoon-inspired multiplayer title pits teams of four against each other in soapy combat. At launch, Foamstars has eight characters, seven of which are available to you right off the bat. The eighth character, Mel T, is locked behind the premium version of Foamstars battle pass. Each Foamstar has their own weapon, along with two normal abilities and one ultimate ability, which can be used to coat your enemies in foam and send them packing.
