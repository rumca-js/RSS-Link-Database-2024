The world is a strange place, and its getting even stranger where Disney Lucasfilm is concerned. After firing Gina Carano from The Mandalorian a couple of years ago, she just announced that she's teamed up with Elon Musk in a major lawsuit against the company. Not only that, but Musk also hinted at a possible takeover bid with Nelson Peltz. Either way, Bob Iger is in a world of trouble right now.
