Steve Gray began making the birdhouses as a passion project during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Four years later he&#8217;s landed a coveted spot on season 15 of ABC&#8217;s hit reality show, where he&#8217;ll pitch the idea to potential investors&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/birdhouse-maker-with-an-eye-for-apple-design-ready-to-take-flight-with-appearance-on-shark-tank/">Read More</a>

Not a single tech company from the region went public via traditional initial public offering over the past two years, according to GeekWire&#8217;s M&#38;A tracker, amid a slowdown in the broader market. Will 2024 be any different? There is cautious optimism that a stabilized macroeconomic environment may get more companies off the sidelines and into the public markets this year. This would be a relief for startup investors, executives, and longtime employees, reopening a key pathway to unlock value from years of work. &#8220;We feel better at this point than at any&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/will-any-seattle-startups-go-public-this-year/">Read More</a>

But what&#8217;s most interesting is that it&#8217;s not about search. The 60-second spot reflects Microsoft&#8217;s gradual shift to presenting Copilot as a standalone product, no longer framing the AI assistant strictly within the context of Bing search, reports Tom Warren of The Verge, based on an interview with Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer.
