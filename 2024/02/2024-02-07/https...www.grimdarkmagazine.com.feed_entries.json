Here at Grimdark Magazine we are already big fans of El-Arifi\u2019s previous releases The Final Strife and Battle Drum. Although I have not yet read those two myself, the team hyped El-Arifi\u2019s writing up enough that I picked up Faebound with no hesitation. Faebound is the first in a new epic fantasy trilogy and I raced through it, so I am quite glad I still have El-Arifi\u2019s other books to get on with whilst I wait for the next Faebound instalment. In Faebound we meet Yeeran, a legendary Elven warrior, who has risen up the ranks to become the youngest colonel their army has ever seen. She has been a warrior for so long, from such a young age, that Yeeran knows nothing different. She must succeed because then her people might know peace. Lettle, Yeeran\u2019s younger sister, follows a different, more peaceful path, as a diviner. One day a prophecy of Lettle\u2019s influences Yeeran\u2019s battle tactics and causes", "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": false, "artist": null, "page_rating": 0, "age": null}]
