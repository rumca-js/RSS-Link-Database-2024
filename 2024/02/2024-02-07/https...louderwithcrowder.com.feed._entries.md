That is because officials believe the government should be the judge of truth. They believe the general public is too stupid to confirm what is factual and what is “<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/eu-elections-a-prime-target-for-disinformation/a-68085224" target="_blank">misinformation</a>”. But as history has shown us, no one who cares about “truth” would hide it. </p><p>According to Newsweek, Tucker Carlson may face sanctions over his interview with Putin. </p><p>We all know that this is newsworthy and that you don’t have to agree with anything Putin says or does to interview him. The fact that people are so mad about this is what makes people want to tune in even more. If the last thing you want is for people to watch the interview, then this is the last thing you sh

Because only there will you find evidence to back up the claim that “gender-affirming care is medically necessary, safe, and effective for trans and non-binary youth.” Thats where the evidence must be since HHS certainly does not have much of any data to justify that statement. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
