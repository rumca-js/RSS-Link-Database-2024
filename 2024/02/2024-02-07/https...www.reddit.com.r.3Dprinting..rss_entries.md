Custom behaviors for the printer‚Äôs buttons, a G-Code console, and improved wifi performance are some of the new features since our last announcement, and we‚Äôre taking the opportunity to clean up the UI.</p> <p>We now have an official website - <a href="http://www.x1plus.net">www.x1plus.net</a> . When we do have a release ready for the public, we‚Äôll link it there first.</p> <p>And finally, and most importantly - today, we received the first test version of ‚ÄòFirmware R‚Äô from Bambu Lab. We‚Äôre just starting to look at it now, and we‚Äôre working on porting X1Plus to it. Bambu Lab tell us that they‚Äôre hoping for a public release of Firmware R a few weeks after Chine
