<p>On the company's <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-q1-fy24-earnings-results-webcast/">quarterly earnings call</a> today, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the previously-announced standalone ESPN streaming service will arrive by the fall of 2025. The company had already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-is-reportedly-laying-the-groundwork-for-its-standalone-espn-streaming-service-172721356.html">tipped the service</a>, which Iger explained will offer &quot;the full suite&quot; of ESPN networks as a streaming option, but a general launch date or any additional details hadn't been revealed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iger said that the standalone ESPN offering will serve up the live games and studio programming that's currently available on a host of cable channels. What's more, the service will provide access to ESPN Bet and fantasy sports alongside detailed stats and shopping. Of course, all of that will also include &quot;robust personalization,&quot; according to Iger.&n

<p>One week after Microsoft laid off nearly 2,000 employees in its gaming division, the Federal Trade Commission is accusing Microsoft of contradicting its pledge to allow Activision Blizzard to operate independently post-acquisition. The FTC <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453.117.0_1.pdf">filed a complaint</a> in a federal appeals court on Wednesday, arguing that last week's downsizing, which affected employees of Activision Blizzard, &quot;contradicts Microsoft’s representations in this proceeding.&quot; The FTC is asking for a temporary pause of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard as it further investigates potential antitrust issues.</p>
<p>In its arguments to the FTC over the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-687-billion-activision-takeover-080920546.html">past two years</a>, Microsoft said it would treat Activision Blizzard as a vertical acquisition and suggested that it wouldn't need

<p>Bluesky, the open-source Twitter alternative, is now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bluesky-is-ditching-its-waitlist-and-opening-to-everyone-140026198.html">open to anyone</a>. After being in beta for a little less than a year and with just over three million users, the social media platform is an option if the ruins of X (formerly Twitter) or Threads aren’t doing it for you.</p>
<p>Bluesky began life as an internal project at Jack Dorsey’s Twitter, but it ended its association with the entity now known as X after Elon Musk’s takeover. “We really believe that the future of social is, and should be, open and decentralized,” Bluesky CEO Jay Graber tells Engadget. “This is something that we think is good for the public conversation overall.”</p>
<p>Decentralized status aside, the service is functionally similar to X and Threads. Posts aren’t tweets but ‘skeets.’ There’s a chronological timeline, but you can also follow numerous other algorithmic feeds created by fellow use

<p>Back in 2022, the European Commission released a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7644">proposal</a> for a directive on how to combat domestic violence and violence against women in other forms. Now, the European Council and Parliament have agreed with the proposal to criminalize, among other things, different types of cyber-violence. The proposed rules will criminalize the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, including deepfakes made <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-07-pornhub-bans-ai-generated-fake-porn-videos.html">by AI tools</a>, which could help deter revenge porn. Cyber-stalking, online harassment, misogynous hate speech and &quot;cyber-flashing,&quot; or the sending of unsolicited nudes, will also be recognized as criminal offenses.</p>
<p>The commission says that having a directive for the whole European Union that specifically addresses those particular acts will help victims in Member States that haven't crimina

<p>YouTube TV users are getting a higher-quality video option for everything from binging their favorite shows to catching a live game. Google is rolling out a new setting called 1080p Enhanced for YouTube TV and Primetime Channels subscribers. The 1080p Enhanced setting improves on the existing 1080p60 resolution with its upgraded bitrate.</p>
<p>Google confirmed the update after a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1af4s6m/comment/kon340w/">Reddit user posted</a> about it on the platform. The 1080p Enhanced setting &quot;delivers our highest video quality,&quot; according to the response. Reddit users who already have access to 1080p Enhanced report that the resolution is available for all of the same channels as 1080p60, such as Paramount and Syfy. The 1080p Enhanced option also follows <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-testing-1080p-premium-playback-option-112835174.html">YouTube Premium</a>, which boosted video quality for subscribers on the com

<p>Disney+ started getting strict about password sharing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-is-getting-strict-about-password-sharing-starting-in-canada-194038029.html">in Canada last year</a>, and now it's expanding the restriction to the US. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24063799/disney-plus-password-crackdown-us"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the streaming service has been sending out emails to its subscribers in the country, notifying them about a change in its terms of service. Its service agreement now states that users may not share their passwords outside of their household &quot;unless otherwise permitted by [their] service tier,&quot; suggesting the arrival of new subscription options in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Verge</em> says Disney+ told subscribers that they can analyze the use of their account to &quot;determine compliance,&quot; though it didn't elaborate on how its methods work exactly. &quot;We're adding limitations on sharin

<p>Just one more hand. Just one more attempt to win at the card game, Queen’s Blood. In my limited preview time with <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>, weeks before the game is due to be released, I may have spent a little <em>too</em> long learning the rules of this companion card game, introduced relatively early into the game. And I regret nothing. (For one, because I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-hands-on-broader-horizons-and-deeper-combat-030012766.html"><ins>previewed</ins></a> most of the changes to the battle system a few months ago.)</p>
<p>This early addiction bodes well for the wider game. It’s a sign that the team behind this sequel-of-a-remake is making a world bigger and richer than the occasionally on-the-rails one in <em>Remake</em>. I’m hoping for a more open-world experience, now that the characters have finally escaped Midgar. (See: the plot of <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em>) A change of location, too, shakes up the look of <em>R
