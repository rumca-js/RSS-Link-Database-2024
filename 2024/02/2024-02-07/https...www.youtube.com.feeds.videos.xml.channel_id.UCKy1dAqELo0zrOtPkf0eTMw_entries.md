From Blumhouse, the genre-defining masterminds behind FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY’S and M3GAN, comes an original horror that taps into the innocence of imaginary friends – and begs the question: Are they really figments of childhood imagination or is something more terrifying lying just beneath?
 
When Jessica (DeWanda Wise) moves back into her childhood home with her family, her youngest
stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun) develops an eerie attachment to a stuffed bear named Chauncey
she finds in the basement. Alice starts playing games with Chauncey that begin playful and become
increasingly sinister.
 
As Alice’s behavior becomes more and more concerning, Jessica intervenes only to realize Chauncey is much more than the stuffed toy bear she believed him to be.
