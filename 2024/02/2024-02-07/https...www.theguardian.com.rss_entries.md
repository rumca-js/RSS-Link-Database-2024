<p>Some countries plan for tournaments for years, work on plans and development and DNA, meticulously lay out their blueprint for success. And some just wing it, finding amid the chaos a sense of purpose and momentum that, being unexpected, somehow makes them all the more potent. Ivory Coast have looked out of this tournament on at least three occasions and replaced their coach but they will face Nigeria in Sunday’s final.</p><p>Nobody could say they dominated but, after an edgy start, it was probably Ivory Coast’s most impressive display of the tournament so far as the Saudi-based pair of Franck Kessié and Seko Fofana gave them control of midfield in the second half and their first 90-minute win of the knockout phase. Sébastien Haller, making his first start of the tournament, got the only goal after 65 minutes which, by recent Ivorian standards, felt almost like scoring in the prelude.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/07/hallers-volley-knocks-out-d

<p>Conservatives fretting about “the nanny state” have failed to see people’s desperate need for compassionate government</p><p>The capacity to form an orderly queue is sometimes held up as an admirable quality of the British character, perhaps from historical association with rationing and stoical patience in wartime. But the queue is also an emblem of failure. A famous political advert that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/may/30/advertising.marketingandpr">helped propel Margaret Thatcher</a> to power in 1979 depicted a line of people waiting to be seen by an unemployment office under the slogan “Labour isn’t working”. Now it is Conservative government that plainly isn’t working, and the queue is for public services.

Covid, Brexit and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/05/radon-liz-romps-home-in-a-pyrrhic-victory">Radon Liz</a> (her again) have seen to that.</p><p>Nor is he wholly to blame for the NHS being on its knees.

<p>The Oscar nominee does her brittle shtick well enough as a mother caring for her dying son in a so-so comedy drama</p><p>Premiering at Sundance 2024 yet assembled as if it were primed for the festival two or three decades earlier, Suncoast is the kind of broad, sunny Searchlight crowd-pleaser that aims to make up for its lack of originality with an abundance of heavily shoveled charm. It’s a strategy that just about works when the stakes are low and soapy but films in this subgenre ultimately demand a full-on assault to the heartstrings and the first-time writer-director Laura Chinn can’t quite muster enough genuine emotion to get us there, her so-so debut working best when investment is at its lowest.</p><p>It’s a busy patchwork of dynamics we loosely know from Searchlight indies all too well.

I noted a Just Eat bloke standing there and was vaguely cheered that he was being paid enough to afford a Caffè Nero coffee.

<p>Health secretary defends Conservative NHS dental recovery plan after scathing response from the British Dental Association </p><p>Good morning. Labour has been campaigning hard recently on the dire state of NHS dentistry, which is near-impossible to access to many places, and today the government is responding by publicising its<a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2024/02/millions-more-dental-appointments-to-be-offered-under-nhs-dental-recovery-plan/"> own NHS dental recovery plan</a>. The <strong>British Dental Association</strong> has been scathing about it. It is normal, with a government initiative like this, for the relevant to professional body to say that it is a step in the right direction but does not go far enough etc. But, <a href="https://www.bda.org/media-centre/nhs-recovery-plan-unworthy-of-the-title-say-dentists/">in its response</a>, the BDA does not even bother with the usual niceties.

<p>This mystery comedy from 1986 stars Lucy Sheen, and has some pointed comments on the racism Chinese communities faced in the UK</p><p>There’s a sweet charm to Leong Po Chih’s 1986 mystery-comedy Ping Pong, set in and around the restaurant businesses of London’s Chinatown, now rereleased. It was produced by Film Four, who two years later brought out Mike Newell’s comparably set <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soursweet">Soursweet</a>, based on the Timothy Mo novel, although that is more serious. Ping Pong is eminently likable, though for me there is something perhaps a little soft-edged and carefully paced which dampens the energy a bit. It is a cheerfully far-fetched caper that could have taken some influence from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughter_in_Paradise">Alistair Sim classic Laughter in Paradise</a>, and there’s sharp comment on the racism and enforced invisibility for Chinese communities in Britain, then as now.</p><p>Lucy Sheen made her act

<p><em>Triturus cristatus</em> is increasingly hard to find in UK with its habitat – clear ponds without fish – in short supply</p><p>The great crested newt, <em>Triturus cristatus</em>, has been around for at least 40m years and looks like a dinosaur. At this time of year in the UK it is mostly asleep but not hibernating, merely waiting for the warming spring weather in March to move towards its breeding ponds. The newts are dark on top, have a warty appearance and a bright orange underside. They can be up to 17cm (6.6in) long, which makes them unmistakable; the two other British newt species are half their size.</p><p>Like much other British wildlife, numbers have plummeted through the destruction of breeding ponds and pollution from farms. Because they are a protected species, the newts are blamed by developers for holding up their projects because they have to be relocated.

<p>Photographer Hilina Abebe has created a personal body of work examining Ethiopian Orthodox faith and its cultural significance</p><p>Like many Ethiopians, I grew up hearing about the churches of Lalibela. Carved out of rock in the 13th century and said to have been built with the help of angels, the 11 Unesco-listed churches in the mountainous Amhara region remain a revered pilgrimage site for Orthodox Christians in Ethiopia. Embedded in my early childhood memory were images from this holy site that often graced Ethiopian Airlines’ Selamta magazine. But it was not until my 20s that I was able to travel the 600km from Addis Ababa to see them for myself.</p><p>I took this photograph in 2017 on my fifth trip there. It was part of a personal body of work titled The Faithful, which delves into the Ethiopian Orthodox faith and its significance in society. As I wandered through the sacred sites, a veiled woman walked past me. Our encounter was fleeting, and I couldn’t see her fac
