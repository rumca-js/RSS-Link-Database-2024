<p>In 2024, there&rsquo;s no reason you can&rsquo;t have a wireless keyboard anymore. From the most complex mechanical boards to the sleekest designer sets to the flashiest gamer machines, and everything in between, there are plenty of options for wireless excellence.

<p>Microsoft is once again increasing the pressure on Windows 10 users to finally upgrade to Windows 11. Windows Latest <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowslatest.com/2024/02/05/microsoft-again-reminds-windows-10-users-its-time-to-get-windows-11-with-renewed-pop-ups/&amp;xcust=2-1-2229814-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a> that Microsoft is now showing some Windows 10 users a full-screen advertisement for Windows 11. This appears to be the case whenever you install an optional update from January 2024 on their Windows 10 PCs. </p>



<p>Microsoft is going all out here. You&rsquo;re not presented with a small pop-up; the advert for Windows 11 upgrade covers the entire screen and, on top of that, there are several sliders to click through. According to Windows

<p>After we spent years looking at televisions, smartphones, and even laptops with envy, OLED panels are finally starting to show up on desktop monitor panels. Well, they are if you have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2194092/alienware-aw2725df-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a lot of disposable income</a>. But as wonderful as it is to see perfect black levels and vibrant colors, some users can&rsquo;t help shake the fear of the kind of burn-in that plagued early versions of OLED panels elsewhere, especially given that PCs often hold static images for a long time. Asus and MSI are doing something about it. </p>

<p>Hardware acceleration uses specialized hardware components of your computer to perform certain tasks more efficiently than the system&rsquo;s main processor (CPU) alone could. This is particularly useful for graphics- or audio-intensive tasks where specialized hardware such as the graphics (GPU) or audio processors can improve performance. </p>



<p>A succinct example is graphics processing. Instead of burdening your CPU with calculating every single pixel, the GPU takes over this task and enables a smoother and more appealing graphical display. </p>

(Not as good a time as before the AI boom, pandemic, and cryptocurrency bubble, but hey, whaddayagonnado.) Today one model of the Radeon RX 7900 XT, AMD&rsquo;s current penultimate GPU, have hit $699. That&rsquo;s the best price yet for this card, and an impressive $200 off its initial retail price just over a year ago. </p>

<p>The new Raspberry Pi 5 model is two to three times faster than its predecessors. This article summarizes how the mini computer has proven itself in the first two months and what its downsides are.</p>



<p>In the logic of earlier Raspberry Pi models, this article deals with the &ldquo;5B&rdquo; model. As there are currently no other models of the Pi 5, I will not use this exact model designation below.</p>
