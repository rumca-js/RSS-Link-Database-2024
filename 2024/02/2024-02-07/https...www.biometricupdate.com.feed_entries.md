		Global access control company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/assa-abloy">Assa Abloy</a> has prevailed at its second patent dispute with a well-known patent troll in two months. In December, Abloy lost a challenge to intellectual property collector CPC Patent Technologies.

The U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board this week sided with Abloy on the validity of a biometric security patent held by CPC, <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1792921/assa-abloy-nabs-ptab-win-against-biometric-security-patent">according to</a> trade publication Law360. CPC is held by <a href="https://www.charpac.com.au/">Charter Pacific</a>.

The patent in question is No. 8,620,039. The claims in the document disputed by Abloy were ruled as obvious work based on previou

		The latest threat intelligence report from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/iproov-limited">iProov</a> addresses the algorithmic elephant in the room, as implied by its subtitle: “The Impact of Generative AI on Remote Identity Verification.” Specifically, the report zooms in on tools and techniques that threat actors use to launch <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/clr-labs-compares-biometric-spoof-evaluations-urges-attention-to-injection-attacks">digital injection attacks</a> that pose a risk to secure digital identity verification.

“In the last 24 months,” reads the report, “the threat landscape has undergone significant changes. Organizations considering incorporating facial biometrics into their remote identity platforms n

		The UK police have been ramping up the use of facial recognition, biometric data and artificial intelligence with <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/uk-police-promise-more-fingerprint-matching-facial-recognition-in-efficiency-revamp">plans</a> to double down on these technologies in 2024. A university in the country wants to investigate the ethics of applying such technologies.

Northumbria University has received £286,000 (US$360,000) from the government-funded Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) to examine the responsible use of AI in policing.

“The deployment of AI and emerging technologies by the police promises more effective use of data for the prevention and detection of crime but brings with it considerable threats of disproportion

		A problem with trying to create a legislative super-regime like the EU’s AI Act is that every aspect of the law is so complex that anyone can mount a winning ideological attack on it.

The lawmaking is byzantine and fluid. Broad potential impacts on government functions, citizens and industry are really only understood by experts, who typically are not in government.

Few people outside the EU even know what the act’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/eu-reaches-deal-on-technical-details-of-ai-act-biometric-surveillance-criticism-remains">finish line</a> looks like or where it is.

So now, in the hoped-for waning days of the AI Act’s assembly, come critiques designed to destabilize it and its biometric provisions. Seemingly solid analysis is bei

		Asylum and migration management systems across the world are seeing rapid adoption of digital technologies, including the collection of biometrics and facial recognition surveillance. In a new brief, Amnesty International analyzes the dangers these systems pose to human rights.

Governments in the European Union United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries have been deploying solutions such as digital alternatives to detention, border externalization technologies, data software, algorithmic decision-making systems – and biometrics.

“The creation of permanent biometric records of refugees and migrants poses particular human rights concerns,” explains the <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol40/7654/2024/en/">report</a> titled Defending the Rights of

		Japanese ID verification service provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/liquid-inc">Liquid Inc.</a> has announced it has completed a cumulative 40 million KYC checks.

With Liquid eKYC, a user scans their ID or reads an NFC chip and compares the image on the document to a selfie using biometrics to verify identity. It can also use public personal authentication methods.

Liquid's use of biometrics increases completion rates and minimizes the proportion of unclear images. Its automatic facial recognition has a high level of accuracy.

Over 200 companies have subscribed to Liquid. The ID verification provider has facilitated the expansion of overseas services entering the Japanese market by simplifying compliance. Depending on what services

		Those who see face surveillance by law enforcement as a danger to civil rights keep hoping that their warnings will stir the public or convince governments.

That was the case during an October conference in Ireland about covert police surveillance including the use of facial recognition. That conference was <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/leading-facial-recognition-technology-experts-have-warned-against-garda-use-of-frt-saying-use-of-the-toxic-tool-would-result-in-a-massive-step-change-in-police-sur/">dominated</a> by sobering and, for the community, familiar statistics.

Generally speaking, anyone anywhere not a middle-aged white male is at a disadvantage when facial recognition is used in relation to a crime, according to conference speakers. In

		Identity trends in 2023 saw generative AI facilitate the creation of fake IDs. Notable breaches affected millions around the world, while some approaches to digital identity, like passkey authentication, rose.

Data breaches go hand in hand with synthetic identity theft, in which real PII is mixed with falsified information to create a new identity. It's no coincidence that half of all consumers had their personal information leaked, while half of all businesses saw a growth in synthetic fraud, according to the <a href="https://www.authenticid.com/2024-state-of-identity-fraud/">2024 State of Identity Fraud Report</a> from identity proofing and verification provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/authenticid">AuthenticID</a>.

		There is said to be a national ID card issuance crisis in Kenya since the close of last year when a Nairobi High Court <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/history-repeats-with-kenyan-high-court-blocking-maisha-namba-for-lack-of-dpia">put the brakes on a government plan</a> to roll out a new digital ID project.

Some Kenyan media report that since the plan to begin issuing the digital ID known as Maisha Namba was halted, thousands of citizens in the East African country have been unable to get the ID cards they applied for. About 10,000 Kenyans apply for an ID card each day, per figures attributed to the Immigration and Citizen Services Permanent Secretariat.

From major corporate theft to voice scams targeting individuals, the prevalence and scope of the problem confirms the urgent necessity of deploying technological safeguards that can keep pace with rapidly evolving criminal threats.
