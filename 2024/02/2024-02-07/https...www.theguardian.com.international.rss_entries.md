<p>Interest in the concept of niksen has grown rapidly over the past five years – and it has become a publishing sensation. But just how easy is it to let go of all outcomes?</p><p>I am standing on the sand at Scheveningen, The Hague’s most famous beach resort, in the act of <em>niksen</em>, the Dutch term for doing absolutely nothing. I try not to think about whether I am really doing nothing if I am standing on a beach. Maybe I should be sitting down? But then I would be sitting down. How do you niksen <em>properly</em>? Being effortlessly aimless next to me is Olga Mecking, the author of Niksen: Embracing the Dutch Art of Doing Nothing. In the three years since the book was published, she has become the Netherlands’ go-to authority on doing sod all. I suddenly remember there is a pancake house back on the promenade. Does eating pancakes count as doing nothing, or is it too much like doing something? Maybe I am not cut out for niksen.</p><p>It’s very common, says Mecking, t

<p>The 1974 spin on westerns sees Mel Brooks pointing at the absurdity of racism and the history of human evil while always ensuring a steady stream of laughter</p><p>Though it rarely gets mentioned in the same breath as The Wild Bunch, McCabe and Mrs Miller and the wave of revisionist westerns that came out of Hollywood in the late 60s and early 70s, Mel Brooks’s Blazing Saddles doesn’t need any artfully hazy Vilmos Zsigmond cinematography to upend Old West mythology. True, it is a comedy where a horse gets cold-cocked, a Native American chief (one of three characters played by Brooks) speaks Yiddish and Count Basie’s orchestra makes an appearance on the plains. Yet from the opening sequence, where Chinese immigrants and recently freed Black slaves work under the white man’s whip to build a railroad, this irreverent Looney Tunes spoof of the genre takes a dimmer view of frontier life than the classics it parodies.</p><p>One of the more popular things to say about Blazing Sad

The Italian side signed the young Dane from Sturm Graz for a reported €17m. The risk initially appeared miscalculated. Højlund scored on his second league appearance for <em>La Dea</em> but that was to be his only goal in 11 outings for Atalanta after joining.</p><p>Any doubts over whether they’d made a mistake on Højlund were quickly put to rest at the turn of the year. The young striker kicked off 2023 with a four-game goal run and ultimately ended the season with nine Serie A goals. For a player that started only20 of 38 Serie A matches, that was a fairly solid return, and enough to convince Manchester United to spend big on him last summer.</p> <a href="https://www.the

<p>Shelters are full of old, unwanted animals no one wants. Or almost no one ... Here are the heroes giving cats and dogs their final homes</p><p>In a car on the way back from an animal shelter, with a 12-year-old chihuahua on his lap, Steve Greig felt peace. For months, since the death of his dog, Wolfgang, he had been inconsolable. “I couldn’t make sense of it,” he says. Wolfgang had been hit by a car. Greig had the idea that he could adopt a dog that nobody else wanted, to give an animal a last chance of a loving home. The chihuahua, whom he named Eeyore, was the oldest dog in the shelter and had a heart murmur and four bad knees. Eeyore spent that car journey looking out of the window, tail wagging. “It was not a no-kill shelter, so his future didn’t look that good, but he had a new lease on life,” says Greig. “I’ll never forget it. It felt like Wolfgang had a hand in letting this dog live and it was exactly what I needed.”</p><p>It was so rewarding that he soon adopted a
