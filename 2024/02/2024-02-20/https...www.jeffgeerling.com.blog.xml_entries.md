<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">My TODO list is a .txt file on the desktop</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>About six months ago, I finally reached a breaking point: my email-based TODO system stopped working.</p>

<p>It was beyond its breaking point for a few years, actually... ever since I my average daily email volume increase from maybe 5-10 'important' emails to deal with to 50+.</p>

<p>My email-based TODO system used to go like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Email myself things I deemed important enough to do the next day</li>
<li>Next morning, when I checked my email, knock off the top item in that list, and try to work down the list a bit</li>
<li>Anything else, forward that email again for the next day</li>
</ol>

<p>Once an item got maybe 5-10 <code>Fwd:</code>s in the Subject line, I would decide whether to nix the TODO
