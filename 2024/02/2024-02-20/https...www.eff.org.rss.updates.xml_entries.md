However, the fundamental technologies and services that make it work are already being hit with overreaching legal threats.</p>
<p>Exhibit A: the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS operates via a ‚Äúdistributed hash table,‚Äù essentially a way to look up the number (or ‚Äúhash‚Äù) corresponding to a given file and see which network locations have chosen to offer the file. Using the hash, a machine then learns where to request the file from, and then retrieves it in pieces from those locations. IPFS gateways in particular perform these functions on behalf of a user who tells it what hash to retrieve the file for. It‚Äôs a conduit, like a traditional proxy server, virtual private network, or ISP.</
