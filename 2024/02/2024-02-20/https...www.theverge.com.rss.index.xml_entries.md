Announced in Adobe’s press release as “AI Assistant in Acrobat,” the new tool is described as a “conversational engine” that can summarize files, answer questions, and recommend more based on the c

  <p id="nfyXP2">Garmin watches ain’t cheap. While the running community loves them, they’re often an investment, costing more than $500 for a midrange watch and going up from there. Which is why it’s neat that the new $249.99 Forerunner 165 and $299.99 165 Music are pretty affordable by Garmin’s standards. </p>
<p id="iky02N">In terms of features, the 165 sits between the $200 Forerunner 55 and the $450 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23632332/garmin-forerunner-265s-review-oled-smartwatch-running">Forerunner 265</a>. But for the extra $50 over the 55, the 165 series comes with a 1.2-inch OLED display instead of

  <p id="InbW27">Sony’s new PlayStation Portal has been hacked by Google engineers to run emulated games locally. The $199.99 handheld debuted in November but was limited to just streaming games from a PS5 console and not even titles from Sony’s cloud gaming service.</p>
<p id="R0UY1D">Now, two Google engineers have managed to get the PPSSPP emulator running natively on the PlayStation Portal, allowing the PSP version of <em>Grand Theft Auto 3 </em>to run on the Portal without Wi-Fi streaming required. “After more than a month of hard work, PPSSPP is running natively on PlayStation Portal. Yes, we hacked it,” says Andy Nguyen in a <a href="https://twitter.com/theflow

  <p id="kgwl6l">Fujifilm’s X100V became so wildly popular that it felt like the camera was endlessly backordered at every camera retailer around. On the secondary market, prices for the rangefinder-style mirrorless camera shot up into truly silly territory after it had a big viral moment on TikTok. The X100V was so in demand that Fujifilm could’ve taken the easy route for a successor and still been guaranteed to have a hit on its hands. </p>
<p id="k7ve7m">The new model, being announced today, looks practically the same on the outside, but the X100VI includes meaningful improvements that will make it a more capable camera — in far more shooting envir
