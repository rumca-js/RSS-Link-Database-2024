She said the company has no plans to change the fee, despite restaurant owners losing revenue and consumers complaining about higher prices. &#8220;We would like to see a repeal of the ordinance,&#8221;&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-mayor-stands-strongly-in-support-of-new-gig-worker-wage-law-as-tech-companies-push-back/">Read More</a>
