Rebel Moon is another Snyderverse universe from Zack Snyder, on Netflix following Army of the Dead. And as you may expect, it's not very good. That's because, despite being a talented visual director, Zack Snyder has a problem. A problem that has made his movies really meh and made him fall off from his best work like 300.

So today, let's analyze Zack Snyder's problems so that hopefully he can get over them as well as himself.
