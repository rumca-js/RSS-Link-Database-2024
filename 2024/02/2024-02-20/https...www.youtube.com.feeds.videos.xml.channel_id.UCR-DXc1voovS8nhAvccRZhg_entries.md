Seeed Studio and 52Pi partnered up to make a Water Cooling Kit for Raspberry Pi 5, and they sent me one to test.

(They did not pay me to make this video, nor do they have any input into the contents, but they did provide me with a kit for testing, therefore I'm marking the video as 'sponsored'.)

If you want to take a look at one for your own Pi 5, check out their product listing: https://www.seeedstudio.com/High-Performance-Liquid-Cooler-for-Raspberry-Pi-5-p-5854.html
