The PS4 Pro was launched about 3 years after the base PS4, so it stands to reason that an pro model for the current-gen PlayStation is overdue. It's also worth noting that the PS5 \"slim\" model was recently launched, and the base PS5 really only had about a year or two of wide availability, as supply chain issues kept the PS5 rare during its first year. In other news, the second batch of Game Pass games for February is hitting the service, with Maneater, Return to Grace, and more available today. And finally, Helldivers 2 is a hit with critics and gamers, and it's proven so popular that the servers can't handle everyone.
