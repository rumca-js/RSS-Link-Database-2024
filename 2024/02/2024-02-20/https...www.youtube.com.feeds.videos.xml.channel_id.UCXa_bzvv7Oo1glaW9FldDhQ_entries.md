You've probably heard that another potential live service failure has entered the market. Then you realize it's Skull and Bones and question whether it was cancelled.

But no, Skull and Bones is finally available after reportedly starting development in 2013, being announced in 2017 and facing multiple delays. Reviews are mixed - some appreciate the combat and presentation, but the live service elements, bugs, always-online nature, pointless story and repetitive gameplay are hard to ignore. 

Some feel it would have been better if priced lower and launched several years ago. Nevertheless, it's a disappointment despite the lack of expectations. The various ways it went wrong are extensive, but above all else, it showcases how the lack of a coherent vision can be a project's downfall, regardless of the amount of time or money devoted to it.
