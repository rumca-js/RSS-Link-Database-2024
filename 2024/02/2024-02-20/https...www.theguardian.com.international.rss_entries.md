<p>An intruder strikes fear into a family in a brilliant debut, while a life of luxury turns very dark indeed. Plus, one of Nicci French’s finest novels yet </p><p>A woman wakes up in the middle of the night. “There was someone in the house.” She’s imagining it, she tells herself. But then she sees him – a man, tall, with “the distantly familiar rancidness of something wrong and rotten she’d tasted before and couldn’t quite place”. As he moves through her dark home, she realises she has seconds to decide what to do: pretend to be asleep, run, or wake her children and hide them away. “‘We have to be quiet,’ she whispered. ‘We have to be quiet! If we’re not quiet the monster will get us!’”</p><p><strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/nightwatching-9780241639863">Nightwatching</a></strong><em> </em>(Viking) by Tracy Sierra plays on old fears and nightmares to create one of the most terrifying – and brilliant – thrillers I have ever read.

<p>Clichy, who is Thierry Henry’s assistant with the France U21s, reflects on the managers who shaped his career</p><p>By <a href="https://www.coachesvoice.com/">The Coaches’ Voice</a> for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/guardian-sport-network">Guardian Sport Network</a></p><p>I joined Arsenal as an 18-year-old in 2003. By the time I signed for Manchester City in 2011, football had changed. There was more focus on detail. We were starting to see that a player could make a difference with the ball, but make things difficult for his team without the ball. Out of possession, they may not cover enough ground or be placed in the right position.</p><p>I was always the type of player who wanted to find out how the team could be better. At City, I learned to enjoy defending. We knew that if we were leading 1-0 with 20 minutes to go, we weren’t going to concede. We had Joleon Lescott, Vincent Kompany, Micah Richards, Pablo Zabaleta and Aleksandar Kolarov. The man

<p>The lines of credit and responsibility in football are unclear, so how can Manchester United put a value on a sporting director?</p><p>Newcastle United are demanding around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/19/manchester-united-20m-fee-sporting-director-newcastle-dan-ashworth">£20m from Manchester United</a> for their sporting director, Dan Ashworth. That’s a lot of money, and I wanted to know whether he could possibly be worth it, but it was hard to tell for sure.</p><p>I went on the popular search website Google and there were lots of articles saying that he definitely was, that Dan Ashworth is a genius who buys footballers for tiny amounts and sells them for hundreds of millions. And lots of articles saying that Newcastle wouldn’t miss him at all, that football is played on a pitch by actual players, and so in an ideal world you probably want to be spending your £20m on&nbsp;them, instead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2024/

I have had dreams</strong><strong> – but very rarely</strong><strong> – where I wake up having extremely intense multiple orgasms that can go on for a very long time.

The PSV striker has just been told he was included in a Daily&nbsp;Mail list of the 100 worst Premier League strikers – at No&nbsp;75. His half-season on loan at Newcastle 10 years ago has long faded into the distance but was clearly not quickly forgotten by&nbsp;everyone.</p><p>When that countdown of “the biggest flops”, dating from 2017, is brought to his attention, De&nbsp;Jong says: “Really? When I only played 12 matches and not all of them from the start? And not in my position, either? Oh well, that’s the football world, you know. I was young. I think I am better armed now to take on Premier League defenders.
