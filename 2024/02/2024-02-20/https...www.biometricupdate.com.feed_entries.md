		Major League Baseball in the U.S. is introducing its facial recognition ticketing program, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/mlb-go-ahead-entry">Go-Ahead Entry</a>, to Houston sports fans.

The digital ID process works in standard fashion. Anyone older than 17 downloads the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/apps/ballpark">MLB Ballpark app</a> and takes a selfie within the app on an iOS or Android phone. The images are tokenized and then deleted.

It also works with groups, <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/texas-sports-nation/astros/article/astros-go-ahead-entry-facial-authentication-ticket-18658018.php">according to</a> the Houston Chronicle.

		In Bangkok, adoption is low for biometrics at check-in, while airports in Spain and the Philippines are implementing it for the first time. India sees an uptick in adoption for the Digi Yatra system. In the U.S., officials are looking to get special treatment at <a href="https://nytimes.com/2024/02/18/travel/facial-recognition-airports-biometrics.html">check-in</a>.
<h2>Bangkok and Philippines airports see adoption of biometric gates</h2>
In Bangkok's airports, the adoption of biometric gates has been slow due to system instability and a low level of tech proficiency among travelers, according to the <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/2744489/changes-coming-to-airports">Bangkok Post</a>.

		The Thai government says to launch a physical/digital identification program as early as September. It will be integrated with a new 10-year visa program already in place.

Officials reportedly say 5,000 people in the Eastern Economic Corridor will be part of the digital ID project. The corridor spans 35 special business-development zones in three Thai provinces.

		The Chinese government in Tibet is linking the various biometric surveillance systems and databases. It’s the next logical step after deploying so many of the systems to maintain control of the region.

It’s unlikely that remote and sparsely populated Tibet is monitored in the same blanket fashion as China’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=uyghur">Xinjiang region</a>, but according to <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c6d7c35b2cf790541327f25/t/65c37a41187a2f23f89f4b82/1707309647227/Weaponising+Big+Data-+Turquiose+Roof+%26+Tibet+Watch.pdf">a new report</a> what information has been collected is being tied into numerous biometric and other databases controlled by the autocratic government in Beijing.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/sensetime">SenseTime</a> and other technology companies based in China are investing in local firms in Saudi Arabia, often in the form of joint ventures, to qualify for contracts in the country worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/21f9ca35-7170-4eab-bf0b-2f3d0df9bad1">Financial Times</a> reports.

The facial recognition developer has also won a contract with Saudi Arabia’s megacity project, Neom.

A joint venture formed in 2022 was formed by SenseTime with $207M in support from the Saudi Company for Artificial Intelligence (SCAI) to develop AI applications in the Middle East. The SCAI is owned by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund. The terms of the deal stipulate that if the JV

		Germany’s digital ID may come under threat from malicious attackers, according to an analysis from a digital security expert.

A white hat hacker recently demonstrated how a cybercriminal could perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack on the online version of the German National Identity Card, known as eID. The vulnerability could potentially pose a danger to the approximately 10 million people currently using the system.

"I was surprised at how easy it was to compromise the system," the hacker <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/elektronischer-personalausweis-hacker-deckt-schwachstellen-bei-der-nutzung-des-onlineausweises-auf-a-6cf8712f-e713-4da8-a78d-947dd114fd61">told</a> news outlet Der Spiegel.

		Deepfake products might not be booming, according to some market watchers, but short-term projections show them easily outgrowing most areas of biometrics.

A new report by digital identity research firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/liminal">Liminal</a> says detection in the U.S. will grow at a compounded annual rate of 42 percent between 2023 and 2026.

The report, which <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/65b929b26bb0a84854c0ecbd?modal=open">leans</a> on news media accounts and other industry research for its conclusions, picked up the 42 percent figure from a Bloomberg article. That story indicates that deepfake detection will grow from $5.5 billion last year to $15.7 billion.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/suprema-inc">Suprema</a> has developed an on-device biometric authentication method that integrates with organizations’ physical access control systems. The new “Template on Mobile” (ToM) is designed to enable access authentication with face biometrics while protecting the privacy of users from data breaches and other threats.

ToM authentication keeps the user’s biometric data stored on their smartphone for data protection and management. It was originally developed as an integration feature for Suprema’s access control systems like the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202209/supremas-latest-face-biometric-access-control-terminal-offers-new-data-security-controls">BioStation 3</a> and t
