<p>Apple has updated the iPhone 15’s battery lifespan. The company said on Tuesday its latest iPhones can retain 80 percent of their original charging capacity after 1,000 cycles —&nbsp;double the company’s previous estimate —&nbsp;without any new hardware or software updates. Not so coincidentally, the change will arrive in time for upcoming EU regulations that will assign an energy grade for phones’ battery longevity.</p>
<p>Before today, Apple’s online support documents quoted iPhone batteries as maintaining 80 percent of their original full charge after 500 cycles. But after the company retested long-term battery health in its 2023 smartphones  — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-15-review-the-most-substantial-update-to-the-regular-iphone-in-years-173204712.html">iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-15-pro-max-review-apple-makes-a-strong-case-for-its-biggest-phone-130018980.html">iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> —&nbs

<p>Acer unveiled a pair of AMD Ryzen 8040 series laptops on Tuesday. Unsurprisingly, given their chips’ dedicated neural processing units (NPU), the company is marketing the 2024 Acer Swift Edge 16 and Swift Go 14 as AI workhorses. The Windows 11 machines support OLED displays, Radeon 780M graphics and 32GB of RAM.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-8040-chips-remind-intel-its-falling-behind-in-ai-pcs-200043544.html">Ryzen 8040 chip series</a>, revealed in December, has a dedicated AI Engine that AMD claims makes it up to 1.4 times faster than its predecessors in Llama 2 and AI vision model performance. Acer says the Swift Edge 16 and Swift Go 14 will deploy the NPU for AI-related tasks like PurifiedVoice (remove background noise in calls and recordings) and PurifiedView (blurring backgrounds in images and correcting your eyes’ positioning on video calls).</p>

The company is notorious for drip feeding details about its products and while it has yet to reveal some key information about the wearable, OnePlus has offered up a few juicy morsels.</p>
<p>For one thing, the company has made the lofty claim that the OnePlus Watch 2 will run for up to 100 hours on a single charge. That’s with “full Smart Mode” enabled rather than a battery saver mode, according to OnePlus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’re a content creator or YouTuber, camera companies increasingly want your business. Last year was no exception, with several new vlogging-specific models released by Canon, Sony, DJI and others. That means there are now over a dozen on sale, alongside regular mirrorless cameras that also do the job well.<br /><br />Models specifically designed for vlogging include Sony’s new ZV-E1 full-frame mirrorless that launched last year, DJI’s Osmo Pocket 3 or Canon’s compact PowerShot V10. Others, like the new Panasonic G9 II and last year’s Canon EOS R6 II are hybrid mirrorless cameras that offer vlogging as part of a larger toolset.<br /><br />All of them have certain things in common, like flip-around screens, face- and/or eye-detect autofocus and stabilization. Prices, features and quality can vary widely, though. To that end, we’ve updated our guide with all the latest vlogging cameras designed for novice to professional creators, in all price ranges.

<p>AirTags are a great way to use Apple's Find My network to keep track of your things. But, like it or not, most AirTag owners will need a holder or case for their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html">Bluetooth tracker</a>. Unlike similar devices from Chipolo and Tile, Apple’s trackers don’t have built-in keyring holes with which to attach them to your keys or other objects. That means you’ll have to secure them to your stuff in a different way. Thankfully, there’s a plethora of AirTag cases out there and most of the best ones cost less than a single tracker itself. After testing numerous accessories, these are our top picks for the best AirTag holders.</p>

<p>Nintendo’s Switch 2 (not its official name) was widely expected to arrive sometime this year, but that may not happen. Now, the company is reportedly telling publishers the next-gen console is slated for release in the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendos-switch-2-may-not-arrive-until-2025-090934042.html"> first quarter of 2025</a>.</p>
<p>If that did happen, it would mimic the release of the original Switch, which was announced in October 2016 and came out in March 2017.</p>
<p>What can you expect from Nintendo’s next console? We don’t know much yet, including the name. Rumors suggest it’ll have backward compatibility with Switch, along with 4K capabilities and visual quality similar to that of the PS5 and Series X. It could use NVIDIA’s<a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-is-said-to-be-showing-the-switch-2s-dlss-and-ray-tracing-capabilities-to-developers-161050817.html"> DLSS</a> upscaling tech to ramp up the graphics of older games, too.</p>

<p>Fujifilm's X100V was <em>the</em> toy to have over the last couple of years (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kyliekatich/video/7145570781404089643">thanks, TikTok</a>) and the company has now released its successor, the <a href="https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/products/cameras/x100vi/">40.2-megapixel X100 VI</a>, with large improvements across the board. While keeping the same retro form, it offers much faster shooting speeds, in-body stabilization, 6.2K 30p video and more.</p>
<p>The X100VI looks identical to the previous model, with the same styling and control positions. The series was conceived as a street photography camera, borrowing a lot of styling cues from Leica's famous rangefinder cameras. As such, it doesn't have the world's great ergonomics, but is light at 521 grams, discreet for shooting and can slide into a jacket pocket.</p>
