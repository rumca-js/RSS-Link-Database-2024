<p>OpenAI last week unveiled a new capability for its generative AI (genAI) platform that can use a text input to generate video — complete with life-like actors and other moving parts.</p><p>The new genAI model, <a href="https://openai.com/sora" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">called Sora</a>, has a text-to-video function that can create complex, realistic moving scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details of the subject and background "while maintaining visual quality and adherence to the user’s prompt."</p><p>Sora understands not only what a user asks for in the prompt, but also how those things exist in the physical world.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3713001/openais-sora-text-to-video-tools-impact-will-be-profound.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>A civil tribunal in Canada has ordered Air Canada to pay for a mistake made by a customer-service chatbot, highlighting the need for companies to better train and monitor their artificial intelligence (AI) tools.</p><p>British Columbia resident Jake Moffatt visited Air Canada’s website in November 2022 to book a flight for his grandmother’s funeral in Ontario. The website’s chatbot told him he could be refunded a portion of the next-day ticket and the return ticket, if he applied for the discount within 90 days.</p><p>That information was incorrect; Air Canada’s policy, available on its website, is to provide bereavement discounts if the customer applies in advance. After Air Canada refused to provide the discount, a Canadian tribunal ordered the airline to pay about $600 in bereavement refunds and tribunal costs — about half of what Moffatt paid for the tickets.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3713100/air-canada-chatbot-error-unde
