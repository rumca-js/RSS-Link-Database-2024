Full of mythical creatures and action and found family, this is definitely the cozy dark monster hunting fantasy you&#8217;re looking for. In The Hidden Legion Aemilius is a young, well off Roman noble, with few cares in the world. Playing in the hills with his friends, Aemilius is taken from his life of certainty and comfort and thrown into a world of danger when he meets a group of misfit soldiers and they charge headlong into chasing down the growing presence of monsters in Roman occupied Greece. Aemilius\u2019 found family are the foundation this story is built on. Thrown together from the conquered lands of Rome, and including the gruff and fatherly Quintus, to Rizkah the angry, snarky assassin, to a cold Carthaginian noble, two wizards, and a Gaul barbarian. The soldiers have an easy friendship in that common way soldiers are written\u2014full of rough ribbing bordering on danger, ", "thumbnail": null, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-02-20T04:38:30+00:00", "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "age": null, "dead": false, "source_obj__id": 571, "vote": 0}]
