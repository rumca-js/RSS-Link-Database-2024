Reviews are mixed - some appreciate the combat and presentation, but the live service elements, bugs, always-online nature, pointless story and repetitive gameplay are hard to ignore. \n\nSome feel it would have been better if priced lower and launched several years ago. Nevertheless, it's a disappointment despite the lack of expectations. The various ways it went wrong are extensive, but above all else, it showcases how the lack of a coherent vision can be a project's downfall, regardless of the amount of time or money devoted to it.", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/2b6HcwFoDuE/hqdefault.jpg", "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-02-20T11:30:01+00:00", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "age": null, "dead": false, "source_obj__id": 208, "vote": 0}]
