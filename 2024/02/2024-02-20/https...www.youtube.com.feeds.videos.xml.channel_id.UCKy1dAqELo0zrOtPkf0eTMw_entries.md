## PS5 Pro "Likely" Coming in 2024, According to Analysts - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
Video Game industry analysts are saying that the mid-gen update for the PS5 should be arriving sometime this year. 2024 will mark the fourth anniversary of the PlayStation 5, which hit stores in November 2020. The PS4 Pro was launched about 3 years after the base PS4, so it stands to reason that an pro model for the current-gen PlayStation is overdue. It's also worth noting that the PS5 "slim" model was recently launched, and the base PS5 really only had about a year or two of wide availability, as supply chain issues kept the PS5 rare during its first year. In other news, the second batch of Game Pass games for February is hitting the service, with Maneater, Return to Grace, and more available today. And finally, Helldivers 2 is a hit with critics and gamers, and it's proven so popular that the servers can't handle everyone. Server issues have gotten so bad that the developer is even asking people to not buy the game until the bugs have been worked out.

## Skull and Bones Review

Skull and Bones reviewed by Travis Northup on Xbox Series X|S and PC, also available on PlayStation 5. 

Skull and Bones isn’t the successor to Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag that many seem to want, and it isn’t many of things Ubisoft itself said it would be at various points in its storied development, but the seafaring RPG we ultimately got is still surprisingly good. Sailing around the Indian Ocean firing cannons, mortars, and giant ballista at your foes is a fun time, the RPG mechanics and cooperative buildcrafting is as deep as the ocean with plenty of awesome gadgets to grind for, and the economy simulation is impressively in-depth. It doesn’t quite fulfill the promise of a decade-long cruise to port yet either, with a thin endgame, almost no story to speak of, and general instability that sometimes makes the adventure feel like a rough draft. But here’s hoping some of those shortcomings can be washed away by the waves of content already planned to come in an ambitious
