At the heart of advancing semiconductor chip technology lies a critical challenge: creating smaller, more efficient electronic components. This challenge is particularly evident in the field of lithography, the process used to create intricate patterns on semiconductor materials (called wafers) for the production of chips.

Since the first report of metal-organic framework (MOF)-based flame retardants in 2017, this research area has exploded. However, improving the flame-retardant efficiency of MOFs and expanding their application areas remain critical challenges. The physicochemical properties of MOFs are closely dependent on their topology, pore characteristics, and chemical composition, which can be modulated by targeted design.

Divers are essentially tourists who love coral reefs and invest a lot of time and effort in watching them. Unfortunately, divers also cause damage to corals, often unintentionally, by disturbing and resuspending sand, touching them, hitting them with their equipment, and scaring fish away. Artificial reefs have been proposed as a means of diverting diving pressure from the natural reef to alternative sites, thus preserving both dive tourism and the coral reef.

Bats carry some of the deadliest zoonotic diseases that can infect both humans and animals, such as Ebola and COVID-19. In a recently-published article in the journal Cell Genomics, a Texas A&amp;M research team has revealed that some species of bats are protected against the viruses they carry because they commonly exchange immune genes during seasonal mating swarms.

Many animals, including apex predators, move in groups. We know this collective behavior is fundamental to the animal's ability to move in complex environments, but less is known about what drives the behavior because many factors underlie its evolution. Scientists wonder, though, if all these animals share a fundamental drive, such as for mating, safety, or perhaps even to save energy.

Electronics are based on electrical charges being transported from one place to another. Electrons move, current flows, and signals are transmitted by applying an electrical voltage. However, there is also another way to manipulate electronic currents and signals: using the properties of the spin—the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron. This is called "spintronics," and it has become an increasingly important field in contemporary electronic research.

Community-based natural resource management has been dominated for several decades by the design principles of Nobel Prize laureate Elinor Ostrom. These principles provide guidelines for improving the governance of resource systems, from small-scale forest management groups to global commons like the high seas. Four of these principles (boundaries that control access, rules that fit the local context, community determinations of regulations, and monitoring and enforcement), are nearly universally used across successful governance institutions worldwide. Simply put, "manage your resource and keep outsiders out."

Wild-caught or farmed? If you have no idea how to answer this question, don't worry—you aren't alone. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, most Americans know little to nothing about seafood farming, also known as aquaculture. Those familiar often have negative associations based on the U.S. media's tendency mainly to cover the environmental risks of farming and the health risks of consuming farmed Atlantic salmon.

Children's interest in nature is crucial for their understanding and appreciation of the natural environment, as well as for their mental health and efforts to biodiversity conservation. The primary school stage is very important for developing an interest in nature. It is worth exploring whether a school garden with abundant natural components can be used to cultivate primary school children's interest in nature while helping to alleviate their study-related stress.

Compound leaves are composed of several leaflets and show great complexity and morphological diversity. The milestone of compound leaf development is the formation of separate leaflet primordia during the early stages, which involves leaflet initiation and boundary establishment for leaflet separation. Researchers are exploring which molecular mechanisms are responsible for the regulation and integration of leaflet initiation and boundary formation during compound leaf development.

Without physical differences in strength, how do we explain why the top level of such games tends to be dominated by men?

Oocytes are immature egg cells that develop in almost all female mammals before birth. The propagation of future generations depends on this finite reserve of cells surviving for many years without incurring damage. In mice, this can be a period of up to 18 months, while in humans it can last almost half a century, the average time between birth and menopause. How the cells accomplish this remarkable feat of longevity has been a longstanding question.
