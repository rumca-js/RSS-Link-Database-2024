<p>Fun, funny and full of messy joy, this coming-of-age comedy drama about five Black students in an Eton-like institution is a treat – and as full of talent as Skins</p><p>Posh people are weird with their private school rituals, double or even triple-barrelled names, complaints about the expensive upkeep of their ancestral homes and their penchant for red trousers. There are perks, of course. For one, it seems going to Eton makes the odds of being a future cabinet member as likely as winning the toss of a coin. So, when a social outreach programme offers the five Black underprivileged protagonists of BBC Three’s comedy drama Boarders the opportunity to attend the elite private school St Gilbert’s, they take it – and set themselves up for glittering futures.</p><p>Of course, there is a catch: their inclusion is part of the school’s PR strategy to save its reputation after a video was leaked of some of its students mocking a homeless man while spraying vintage champagne in his

<p>On 70 minutes, delight for Manchester City and heartbreak for Brentford. Thomas Frank’s ploy of defending with 10 and hoping for a breakaway strike had disrupted the champions who appeared bereft of ideas. But, then, came the hosts’ sheer quality in a lightning sequence that had Rúben Dias finding Rodri near their area. He passed to Julián Álvarez whose ball landed at the thus-far ineffective Erling Haaland. Not now, though, because as he raced in, Kristoffer Ajer slipped and the lethal 23-year-old beat Mark Flekken to the goalkeeper’s right from inside the D.</p><p>Game over, despite Flekken’s appearance in City’s area at a 95th-minute corner. Haaland’s winner moves them to one point behind Liverpool, setting up their trip to Anfield on 10 March as a seismic clash that hands the victor total control of their destiny. So, strap yourself in for that one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/20/haaland-strikes-against-brentford-as-city-move-to-within-a-

<p>Most schools in England already ban mobiles. If it wants to make a change, the government should fund youth clubs and social activities</p><p>Look around next time you are out and you will see that children’s addiction to smartphones nowadays often begins long before they’ve started school. By the age of 12, 97% of children will own their own phone. There is a growing body of evidence pointing to an alarming link between the time children spend on smartphones, and the access they provide to social media, with the likelihood of experiencing bullying, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55826238">problems with self-esteem</a> and even self-harm.

<p>For decades, no one cared about the Swiss photographer and his hyper-hued images. But the social media explosion has made him the toast of the Insta generation. Our writer takes tea with a cult hero who triumphed over endless put-downs</p><p>Walter Pfeiffer’s hands have trembled ever since he was a little boy at primary school. The problem, recalls the Swiss photographer, only intensified as he aged. “It amuses me,” he says, “when people call me a genius for using flash from the very beginning. It gave me my style – but I only did it because a flash stabilised my images.”</p><p>Pfeiffer’s photographs exude a perpetual summery warmth, as if all the harshness of life has been banished. Before gaining recognition in the art world, he spent years shooting for the underground gay zine scene. Remarkably, after achieving success, he refused to change his approach: it has always been just him and his subject, like a painter with a muse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/art

And if you like one of their bottles, chances are you’ll want to try others</p><p>We all have our ways of picking wine from the great big, baffling wall of bottles at the supermarket or local merchant. Some of us choose by grape variety. We know roughly what we’ll get from malbec or sauvignon blanc, chardonnay or pinot noir, no matter where it’s grown. For others, it’s the place that is most significant, the particular style of wine they make in Bordeaux or Rioja, Marlborough or Mendoza. Labels and brands might play a role but not as much as they do when buying cereal, chocolate, or beer. There are few wine brands that retailers consider as essential as Corn Flakes, Cadbury’s or Stella. As for independent merchants, bars and restaurants, they will actively seek out the unfamiliar.</p><p>For me, one of the best ways of navigating a set of unfamiliar wines is to

<p>Six settlers arrive in a Scottish forest 45,000 years ago, where ‘bloodthirsty things’ await but bathos fails to arrive</p><p>‘Forty-five thousand years ago …” So begins this ambitious, confident feature debut from Scottish director Andrew Cumming. It’s a horror movie set in the stone age where a poor old early human is yomping about the Highlands in winter; no Gore-Tex or warm pub, just a tough bit of elk meat to chew on and the odd run-in with a hairy Neanderthal. What a god-awfully grim time to be alive – even before things go bump in the night.</p><p>The premise is simple: this movie is “Alien in the stone age”. It begins with six intrepid early humans washing up on a Highlands beach, all of them quickly and efficiently sketched out as characters. Adem (Chuku Modu) is in charge and evidently sees himself as a mighty leader of men. He’s travelling with family: his pregnant partner (Iola Evans), son, and younger brother.

<p>The Conservatives have taken pragmatic, everyday charity and kindness and used it to shore up the cruel state they have created</p><p>Even before the endless years of Tory immiseration, there was a steady buildup of language around poverty that was depressing because it wasn’t honest. What does “child poverty” mean? Aren’t all children poor? None of them work, all they do is learn, eat and ask for weirdly expensive magazines. All it can conceivably mean is to be a child in a poor family, which is to say, adult poverty. What does “fuel poverty” mean, for that matter? Does it have its own currency, benchmarked against something other than the dollar, which you can run low on for reasons unrelated to the exchange of your labour? Because if not, aren’t we, in fact, talking about “stuff poverty” or, for brevity, “poverty”? And on and on: period poverty, funeral poverty, clothing poverty, the endless fragmentation of need, so that a problem that, actually, is very simple and wid

It was only after years of turmoil that she finally plucked up the courage to seek help – and found she was the only woman in the room.</p><p>“Going into Gamblers Anonymous meetings, it was very male-dominated. So I felt that pressure, I didn’t feel like I could speak as openly,” said Vanderson, now 23. “I was on my own at 21 years old and couldn’t understand why I was like this. I had never seen a young woman who had gone through a gambling addiction, ever.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/20/uk-charity-gordon-moody-helping-female-gambling-addicts-wolverhampton">Continue reading...</a>

The American painter John Singer Sargent is a great artist of identity, fascinated with the nature of social being. He paints people not in isolation but as players in a social world in a way that is startling, modern and so truthful it hurts. Trained in 19th-century Paris, he brought brushwork tinted by Manet and Monet to portraying late Victorian and Edwardian British society, and was especially drawn to those who didn’t fit the old order – such as the young Jewish women joyously proclaiming their individuality in <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/sargent-ena-and-betty-daughters-of-asher-and-mrs-wertheimer-n03708">Ena and Betty, Daughters of Asher and M

<p>Matt Vesely’s debut references 2001: A Space Odyssey and Arrival, but ably stakes its own territory as a compelling and fastidious piece of work</p><p>It takes some guts for any sci-fi film – especially a no-budget one – to pick that title, and to include some eerie wisps of Ligeti-like sounds to get the cosmic hairs rising on the back of your neck. When Monolith isn’t referencing 2001: A Space Odyssey, it also bears some resemblance to Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival, with its alien artefacts turning out to be filled with indecipherable glyphs when scanned. But Matt Vesely’s impressive debut ably stakes out its own territory, not least in the vast distances covered by a single on-screen actor and a handful of vocal performances.</p><p>After being fired for not doing due diligence on her journalism, the Interviewer (Lily Sullivan) is now slumming it for Beyond Believable, a paranormal podcast.
