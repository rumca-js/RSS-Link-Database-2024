Lady Gaga is coming to Fortnite, having famously once asked what "Fortnight" was all about. 
</p><p>
Her arrival in the game marks something of a full-circle moment for the global music megastar, after her social media <a href="https://twitter.com/ladygaga/status/1184174532124266496">post</a> in October 2019 simply asking "What's Fortnite" went viral. Five years on, Lady Gaga's account reposted her original message today with an image of her upcoming in-game character model, and the correction: "*fortnite".
</p><p>
The image is labelled with Fortnite Festival, which is the game's Rock Band/Guitar Hero-style rhythm game mode that launched late last year. Festival's second season kicks off this Thursday, 22nd February, following its first season that spotlighted The Weeknd.

Everywhere developer Build A Rocket Boy has confirmed a round of layoffs at the company, which was founded by ex-Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies in 2016.
</p><p>
An unconfirmed number of job losses were first reported yesterday by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/everywhere/build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs">PCGamesN</a>. Now, the studio has confirmed "the removal of a number of roles globally" in a statement to Eurogamer.
</p><p>
Build A Rocket Boy is headquartered in Edinburgh, though also operates offices in Budapest, Montpellier and in China. The company is backed by investment from NetEase, and last month <a href="https://www.buildarocketboy.com/feeds/10">completed</a> a further $110m funding round.

Microsoft has announced the next wave of titles headed to Xbox Game Pass, which are set to be added to the subscription service over the tail end of February. 
</p><p>
This includes the excellent Tales of Arise, the epic role-playing game from Bandai Namco's Tales studio that originally launched to a warm reception back in 2021. "There are missteps and a few bumps along the way, but this soft reboot of a long-running series emerges a triumph," we wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-arise-review">Eurogamer's Tales of Arise review</a>.

It was a proper blockbuster phenomenon, and a reminder that when it comes to video game characters, the Mushroom Kingdom remains home to the most universally recognisable cast around. Still, it doesn't feel like chance that Nintendo seems to have smartly scheduled its subsequent year of Switch game launches with follow-up adventures for all of that film's supporting cast: a Luigi's Mansion 2 remake, a new Mario vs. Donkey Kong, and - no less than 18 years after her last solo outing - a fresh vehicle for Peach.</p><p>If you played the slightly odd Super Princess Peach on Nintendo DS, there are happily few hangovers here. Gone, thankfully, is the need for Peach to power-up by picking one of four emotion

Sony is expected to launch a souped up version of the PlayStation 5 later this year, analysts have suggested.
</p><p>
A new <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/20/ps5-pro-sony-to-release-refreshed-playstation-5-in-2024-analysts-say.html">CNBC</a> report notes that there was now "broad concensus in the game industry that Sony is indeed preparing a launch of a PS5 Pro in the second half of 2024," quoting Tokyo-based games analyst Serkan Toto.
</p><p>
However, the report cautions that Sony is unlikely to see a large uptick in year-on-year sales as a result of the Pro's launch, and is also unlikely to cut the cost of the base PS5 model as a result. (Sony, unsurprsingly, has not commented on CNBC's report.)

There's no room for mistakes in Assassin's Creed Mirage's new Full Synchronisation Challenge mode, which arrives in the game via a fresh update due today. 
</p><p>
The option essentially lets you try a permadeath run of the full game, which will end if main character Basim dies or commits any illegal actions (ie. killing civilians) that would normally see you kicked out of the Animus. 
</p><p>
Full Synchronisation Mode will become available when you install today's patch 1.0.7 for Mirage, which launches at around 1pm UK time.

A new Pok&eacute;mon Presents digital event will broadcast next week, on Tuesday 27th January at 2pm UK time. That's 9am Eastern or 6am Pacific.

The showcase will contain "exciting news", a post on social media today teased, without going into further detail.

We're expecting to hear from The Pok&eacute;mon Company on what the next Pok&eacute;mon project to launch will likely be - and while it feels too early for a new generation of Pok&eacute;mon, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-the-ambition-is-betrayed-by-the-performance">2022's Pok&eacute;mon Scarlet and Violet</a>, it seems likely that some sort of game will arrive in the next 12 months.
