<p>A few weeks ago I made the case that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2202972/we-need-more-anime-girl-graphics-cards.html">we need a little more variety</a> when it comes to style in our PC components. While accessories don&rsquo;t have nearly the same problem &mdash; you can get keyboards in an almost literal rainbow of colors &mdash; &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; devices seem to be stuck on black and RGB lighting, with only the occasional white variant. Cooler Master&rsquo;s latest keyboard design is bucking that trend, specifically with its &ldquo;Macaron&rdquo; colorway. </p>

<p>Gaming laptops can be downright expensive. It takes a complex cooling system to keep the heat-generating hardware running without issue. Plus, laptops are smaller than desktop PC towers, which means there&rsquo;s less space to disperse the heat. Fortunately, you can score a laptop with reliable processing and graphics performance for under $1,000 these days. If you&rsquo;re not sure where to begin your quest for a budget-friendly machine, don&rsquo;t sweat it. We did the heavy lifting for you.</p>



<p><em>Note that laptop prices can fluctuate and there might be times when the price of one of our picks hovers over $1,000.</em></p>

<p>VPNs, or virtual private networks, are a great way to protect your privacy and keep your activities anonymous while online. Unfortunately, they also tend to slow down your internet connection while in use.</p>



<p>This comes down to the very nature of how a VPN works. By connecting to a VPN, your data is rerouted through the VPN&rsquo;s server(s) and encrypted. This process can adversely affect both the speed of your connection as well as the latency.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re curious about how a particular VPN is affecting your connection speeds there are a couple of easy steps you can take to determine any speed loss.</p>

<p>Last year was dominated by artificial intelligence. The release of Chat-GPT in autumn 2022 triggered such huge hype that every software manufacturer rushed to integrate real or supposed AI functions into their products and advertise them heavily. </p>



<p>The share price of Microsoft, which has direct access to the technology thanks to its stake in Chat-GPT manufacturer Open AI, rose from $230 in January to over $370 in November 2023. The topic of AI will also be with us in the coming year: New tools with AI functions continue to appear.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the topic of ransomware will also continue to appear in the headlines in 2024. There are even fears that its frequency will increase. More and more criminals are using viruses and encryption programs for their blackmail attempts. </p>



<p>At the same time, phishing attacks have increased, whe

<p>Just the other week, ExpressVPN, one of the industry leading VPN services, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2236499/expressvpn-disables-split-tunneling-on-windows-due-to-dns-leaks.html">had to take its split-tunneling feature down for Windows users due to a DNS leak issue</a>. The problem is believed to have first begun with version 12.23.1 way back in May of 2022, but wasn&rsquo;t noticed until recently.</p>



<p>While the DNS leaks were confirmed by ExpressVPN, it was believed to be a relatively small number of users, around 1 percent,&nbsp; who were affected.</p>



<p>Windows users can breathe a sigh of relief though, as according to ExpressVPN the issue has now been resolved. Split-tunneling is once again available to Windows users after the service&rsquo;s engineering team was able to identify and fix the issue.</p>
