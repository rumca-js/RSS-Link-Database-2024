WB Discovery CEO David Zaslav promises the new series will dive deep into the series of books, meaning we\u2019ll see the iconic stories retold for the small screen. The plan is to tell the stories made famous by the series of novels for next 10 years, after the series premiere sometime in 2026. This means we\u2019ll see adaptations of the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows. Apparently each planned season will explore one of the books in the Harry Potter series, but as stated previously, the plan is to run it for 10 consecutive years, so it sounds like they\u2019ll potentially stretch certain books for a couple seasons. That shouldn\u2019t be an issue for the later years, and would be a major improvement on the original movies, which really should have been two-parters from Goblet of Fire Onwards David Zaslav", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm5LuFEmnNs", "age": null, "source_obj__id": 210, "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "permanent": false, "artist": "IGN", "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 0, "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/hm5LuFEmnNs/hqdefault.jpg", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw"}, {"tags": [], "user": null, "title": "Knox Goes Away - Official Trailer (2024) Michael Keaton, James Marsden, Suzy Nakamura", "vote": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-23T23:00:13+00:00", "dead": false, "description": "Check out the trailer for Knox Goes Away, an upcoming thriller movie starring Michael Keaton (Spotlight, Beetlejuice), James Marsden (\u201cWestworld,\u201d \u201cDead To Me\u201d), Suzy Nakamura (\u201cAvenue 5\u201d, \u201cSnowfall\u201d), John Hoogenakker (\u201cDopesick,\u201d Teacher), Joanna Kulig (Hanna, Cold War), Ray Mckinnon (\u201cDopesick,\u201d Chaos Walking) and Lela Loren (\u201cAmerican Gods,\u201d Bruised) with Marcia Gay Harden (\u201cSo Help Me Todd,\u201d \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d) and Al Pacino (House of Gucci, The Irishman).\n\nAcademy Award nominee Michael Keaton directs and stars in this unpredictable thriller as John Knox, a hit man attempting to make amends before his recently discovered dementia takes over.

Developer Rocksteady, though, still has more DLC for the game in the works, including a playable Joker. In other news, Helldivers 2 dev Arrowhead is working on a patch that will rise the cap of concurrent players from 500,000 to 700,000. This, along with the new feature to auto kick idle players, should help alleviate long wait times, especially as the game heads into its second weekend. And finally, Sony is looking into making the PSVR2 compatible with PC.
