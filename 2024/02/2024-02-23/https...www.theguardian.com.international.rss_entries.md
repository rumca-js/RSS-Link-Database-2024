<p><strong>Queen Elizabeth Hall, London<br /></strong>The violinist leads an unsparing assault of pieces from Biber’s dissonant Battalia à 10 to Ustvolskaya’s Composition No 2 as sirens bellow and metronomes tick down our existence </p><p>‘This piece of theatre without a plot is designed as an assault on our senses,” violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja writes of Dies Irae, a complex multimedia piece of her own devising, part concert, part installation, that aims to combine a ferocious enactment of the day of judgment with fierce invective against war and the climate crisis as instruments of our own potential self-destruction. It was first heard at the Lucerne festival in 2017. Kopatchinskaja has performed it with multiple ensembles since, including the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, in Glasgow, during Cop26 in 2021. For the London premiere her collaborators were the Aurora Orchestra and Aurora Voices, whose intensity match Kopatchinskaja’s uncompromising vision and the almo

<p>The desire to avert catastrophe in Rafah has given fresh impetus to talks in Paris – and a plan that could lead to peace</p><p>Both sides in the war between Israel and Hamas now face a fresh set of fateful choices. The decisions they take in the next two weeks are not only a matter of life and death for many thousands of Palestinians, and for the remaining 134 hostages held by Hamas.

<p>Conversation card games can be entertaining at parties – and help us foster deep connections and intimacy, which can otherwise be elusive</p><p>Last summer I was at a friend’s barbecue when he pulled out a game called We’re Not Really Strangers. The small box contained cards featuring questions like “Do you think plants thrive or die in my care?” and “Do you think I’ve ever been fired from a job? What for?”</p><p>Prompted to share about ourselves or speculate about each other, we revealed funny, personal truths. During one round, everyone weighed in on whether or not they thought I was “a romantic”, which led me to process my love of love and simultaneous aversion to weddings out loud. Progressively, the cards became more probing: “What do you think my weakness is?” “What privileges do you think I have?

Call it the Masters of the Air effect, but aviator jackets are having a moment.</p><p>According to the high street retailer John Lewis, searches for the garment have increased by 68% since this time last year. They are soaring at the luxury end, too, with Matches Fashion reporting that sales have more than tripled in the same period. “The sexy older brother of a shearling coat, the aviator jacket is a wardrobe staple that stands the test of time,” says Damien Paul, the head of menswear at Matches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/feb/23/aviator-jackets-fly-high-as-masters-of-the-air-effect-takes-off-on

Across three albums since his 2016 debut Sangue Negro, Freitas has honed a style of muscular, complex rhythm within jazz improvisation. Often playing different metres in each hand, he encompasses everything from folk maracatu polyrhythms on 2018’s Afrocatu to staccato, mechanical repetitions on 2021’s Sankofa.</p><p>His latest album, Y’Y, puts this rhythmic playfulness in service to a spiritual theme. Dedicated to the preservation of the Amazon, the nine tracks of Y’Y (meaning “water” or “river” in Sateré Mawé dialect) use whistles, prepared piano and percussion to evoke the sounds of the rainforest and its mythical beings.

This was accompanied by a jolly theme tune, an uplifting soundtrack and a <em>lot </em>of humour – much of it directed at straight people. It was clearly unlike anything I’d seen on TV before.

He’s speaking to Ellie (Claudette Colbert), the missing heiress and potential story serving as his traveling companion, and he doesn’t get a definitive answer.</p><p>For that matter, Ellie isn’t particularly dizzy on the scale of screwball dames of the 1930s. She’s a little spoiled, sure, not especially wise to the ways of waiting in line with the common folk, and by her own admittance never before alone with a man. But within those parameters, she’s relatively levelheaded and frequently resourceful – she knows her way around hitchhiking, anyway – and Peter’s question seems especially rhetorical.

Israel Zangwill, from Kilburn, was variously described by contemporaries as “the homeliest man I ever saw” and “one of&nbsp;the worst-dressed men in London”. His novels were bestsellers, but he was so clumsy that when his arrival at a meeting was heralded by a clatter out in the hallway, one of those waiting for him exclaimed: “Israel must be coming. Something’s falling downstairs.”</p><p>When Herzl first presented himself at Zangwill’s home in 1895, saying: “Help me to rebuild the Jewish state,” the two of them had no fluent language in common. “I don’t even know whether he understands me,” wrote Herzl. No matter. Their rapport was immediate and lasting, and together they established the Zionist mov

<p>Two years ago this weekend, Russia invaded Ukraine. Two weeks ago, Donald Trump admitted that he would encourage Russia to ‘do whatever the hell they want’ to the US’s Nato allies, if they did not meet Trump’s demand to ‘pay their fair share’ of Nato funding. He also compared himself to the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny when discussing one of his many legal woes. All the while, the military aid package passed by the Senate last week, which includes $60bn for Ukraine, has stalled in the House of Representatives.</p><p>So how worried should the US’s allies be about a second Trump presidency? What happens if the Republican party’s isolationist streak becomes the policy of the entire US? And in the meantime, how can Biden protect Ukraine when Congress refuses to act?</p><p>Jonathan Freedland discusses these questions with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/trumps-threat-to-nato-is-the-scariest-kind-of-gaffe-its-real">Susan Glasser
