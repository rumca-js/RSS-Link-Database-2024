More than a third of these frozen moorings, known as pinning points, have decreased in size since the turn of the century, experts say. Further deterioration of pinning points, which hold in place the floating ice sheets that fortify Antarctica's land ice, would accelerate the continent's contribution to rising sea levels, scientists warn.", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/02/240223103904.htm", "age": null, "source_obj__id": 342, "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "permanent": false, "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 0, "thumbnail": null, "source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml"}, {"tags": [], "user": null, "title": "Wetlands, parks and even botanical gardens among the best ways to cool cities during heatwaves", "vote": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-23T10:38:43+00:00", "dead": false, "description": "Botanical gardens are not just beautiful -- they can cool the city air by 5 C during heatwaves, according to the most comprehensive review of its kind.
