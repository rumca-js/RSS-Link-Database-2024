While taping Cinder Well's Tiny Desk, gray clouds hung over NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C., urging the same kind of introspection \u2014 sympathetic scenery for a set of folk songs that wind around the passage of time.\n\nCinder Well's Amelia Baker grew up in California, but has spent much of her time on the Western cliffs of Ireland, soaking in the sea air of both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Her songs, too, reflect the Laurel Canyon's wandering spirit and the droning qualities of Irish folk music. Yet there's space between that Baker occupies, illustrated by this performance: A crimson glow surrounds the dark undercurrent of Cinder Well that only grows brighter as the music goes deeper into the unknown.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Two Heads, Grey Mare\"\n\"Overgrown\"\n\"No Summer\"\n\"Crow\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAmelia Baker: vocals, guitar\nMarit Schmidt: vocals, viola\nPhillip Rog", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgQw-xNsQe8", "age": null, "source_obj__id": 186, "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "permanent": false, "artist": "NPR Music", "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 0, "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/BgQw-xNsQe8/hqdefault.jpg", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A"}]
