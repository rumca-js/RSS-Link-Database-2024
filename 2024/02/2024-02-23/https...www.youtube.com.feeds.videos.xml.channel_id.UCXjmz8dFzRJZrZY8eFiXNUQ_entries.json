Though when David Yates was finishing Harry Potter and the two part Deathly Hallows installments, one deleted scene could have added world of closure to Harry Potter's life at Number 4 Privet drive.  When Harry Potter is leaving his childhood home in the finished film, it all seems very quick and emotionless.  But with just a few minutes of deleted dialogue added back in, it could have given audiences the closure Harry needed from the Dursley's and his childhood home. \n\n#harrypotter #deletedscenes #harrypotterfan #nerdstalgic \n\nSOURCES\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrHrrRVNofY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYWbgPWdkwg\nhttps://collider.com/harry-potter-deathly-hallows-part-1-no-third-act-david-yates-comments/", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLF0FLG1s_4", "age": null, "source_obj__id": 169, "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "permanent": false, "artist": "Nerdstalgic", "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 0, "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/OLF0FLG1s_4/hqdefault.jpg", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXjmz8dFzRJZrZY8eFiXNUQ"}]
