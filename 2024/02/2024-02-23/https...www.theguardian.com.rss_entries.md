<p>Not so long ago Leeds were a receding speck in Leicester’s rear-view mirror but suddenly Daniel Farke’s second-placed team are tailgating the Championship leaders.</p><p>A once seemingly unassailable gap at the top of the second tier has now been cut to six points. That is far too close for comfort for Enzo Maresca and his players who will doubtless have headed back down the M1 cursing their inability to see out a game they led for a long period and dominated until the latter stages.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/23/bamford-completes-comeback-win-as-leeds-close-gap-on-leaders-leicester">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Significance of Calcutta Cup encounter is elevated to higher plane with both sides standing at a crossroads in their development</p><p>Some games are bigger than others and this year’s Calcutta Cup encounter sits firmly in that category. The World Cup may have been and gone but, for reasons both ancient and modern, the 142nd edition of rugby’s oldest international fixture feels more significant than usual. A defining encounter awaits all concerned, in the short and medium terms.</p><p>In differing ways Scotland and England have reached a fork in their developmental paths. Get it satisfyingly right and the high road beckons. Stumble and a whole host of thorny old questions will swiftly resurface, particularly for the visitors to Murrayfield. Narrow wins <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/03/italy-england-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report">over Italy </a>and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/10/fraser-dingwall-try-helps-edge-england-to-c

<p>Scotland’s fly-half has the ability to force individual errors and his speed of thought will be a huge test for unbeaten visitors</p><p>The most decisive factor in Saturday’s Calcutta Cup match can be summed up in one word: belief. England have to believe in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/22/scotland-england-six-nations-townsend">their blitz defensive system</a>, they have to show confidence in it even when mistakes happen and they have to keep doing that for 80 minutes. Because they can be certain that Finn Russell has belief in bucket-loads and an uncanny ability to move on from mistakes in an instant.</p><p>Make no mistake, mastering a brand new defensive system is difficult, all the more so in the middle of a Six Nations championship. I first encountered a blitz defence at Harlequins in 2005 and that was the year we were relegated. There were other factors that contributed but the way that our defence performed was certainly one of them.</p> <a hre

<p>Victory against Liverpool in the final at Wembley would prove to owners and fans that the plan is starting to take shape</p><p>When the ambition is to build a dynasty there is little point in reading too much into the outcome of one game. At Chelsea, where preparations for the first men’s final under Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital are almost over, they know that it is too soon to get carried away. Nobody, not even an ownership that has received so much criticism since arriving in English football, will fall into the trap of thinking that the job has been completed if Mauricio Pochettino’s side beat Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday.</p><p>Equally there will be people within Stamford Bridge claiming some form of vindication if Chelsea see the first tangible return on Boehly’s and Clearlake’s investment in the squad during the past two years. The mockery has not gone unnoticed. Schadenfreude is the best way of describing the reaction to Chelsea sliding into mid

As the most powerful form of non-verbal communication, clothes tell us a lot about people – from their occupation, to religion, to their Indigenous heritage. The now thriving academic discipline of fashion studies rose from schools of anthropology, ethnography, sociology, philosophy, curatorial scholarship and art history. The first postgraduate course in the history of dress was set up in 1965 at the Courtauld Institute – a bastion of the art establishment – to enable curators and art historians to date paintings and describe garments in them accurately. Sadly, many of them continue to get it wrong.</p><p>Jonathan Jones’s review of the Sargent exhibition at Tate Britain (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/feb/20/s

<p>Any British person who has a foreign-born parent will feel their status is more precarious after the court of appeal decision</p><p>The court of appeal ruled this morning that Shamima Begum had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/23/shamima-begum-loses-appeal-against-removal-of-british-citizenship">lawfully deprived</a> of her British citizenship.

She challenged that decision at a special immigration appeals commission last year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/22/shamima-begum-loses-appeal-removal-british-citizenship">and lost</a>. This latest ruling might represent the end of her hope to return home, although given the young woman’s circumstances – all three of her children have died, she lives in a refugee camp they call the “mini caliphate”, and is thought of only periodically by her countrymen in order to be pilloried then forgotten again – it would be foolish to try

They’re back in Ibiza after 30 years to celebrate Chris’s 50th birthday, relive the memories of their time in a band and maybe pull a girl or two.</p><p>Neil D’Souza’s script is a giddy feast of nostalgia and abandoned dreams. Manchild Chris (Peter Bramhill) has his head in the past and still performs the tunes he wrote with best mate Dev (also played by D’Souza) back in the day. “I’m not an old man,” he insists. Dev has moved on, he’s a music lecturer at a university and spends his days in therapy lamenting his lack of family. Their third group member, the elusive LA-living music manager Michael, is at first nowhere to be seen.</p> <a href="https://w

He’d heard an orchestral suite Stevens had written, The BQE, and thought this was perfect music for dance. “So I just wrote: ‘Hey, if you would ever want to collaborate or, you know, make a dance or make a ballet, let me know.’ And of course, I didn’t hear back.”</p><p>But here I am, talking to Peck on a video call about his new show, entirely set to the music of, you’ve guessed it, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/sufjanstevens">Sufjan Stevens</a>, specifically his 2005 album, Illinois.

The stocky 34-year-old actor, dressed in checked shirt, black jeans and weather-beaten trainers, is affable and matey when we first meet. An hour later, there is a vigorous goodbye handshake, a mumbled “legend, legend”, and a wish for my “safe onward journey” as though he is a flight attendant and I’m a holidaymaker. To himself, however, he is less kind. He huffs and puffs when he can’t find the right word, and clasps his head in his hands while he hunts for an honest answer. Our meeting is punctuated by silences, though they are of the ruminative rather than the awkward sort. “I’m talking shit,” he says after one circuitous reply. “This is impossible!” he exclaims after another.

<p>Dress up nice and open a door to upscale but naughty New York</p><p>As we limp through February towards the warmer months, one particular dining hurdle we’ve cleared is the pressure to dine romantically. Mid-February brings a yearly glut of “restaurants for romance”: places with views, places with booths, places with plastic indoor floral displays and places serving a special Valentine’s set menu with asti spumante and a helium balloon. None of these things makes my heart beat, but I’ll tell you what does: acoustic absorption. This, to me, is the sexiest phrase in the modern restaurant landscape, so when someone told me that the Dover, a New York-style Italian restaurant on Mayfair’s Dover Street, was a place one could hear and be heard, it was duly noted. Having now been, I can attest this is true: velvet curtains, wood panelling and not one but two tablecloths on each cover make every table feel like its own private island, where diners can hear their friends and, crucia
