Nelson, elected to the council in 2021 and appointed as president in January, spoke to GeekWire this week about the ordinance that went into effect last month and sets a\u00a0minimum\u00a0per-minute and per-mile amount for app-based workers. DoorDash and Uber Eats responded by adding\u00a0substantial new fees for consumers \u2014\u00a0$5 for each order \u2014\u00a0and say demand has fallen substantially in the subsequent weeks.

What does it mean for the city&#8217;s startup ecosystem? That&#8217;s a question on our minds in the immediate aftermath of the surprising news this week from Techstars to shut down its Seattle program. &#8220;It&#8217;s a serious loss for our remarkable community,&#8221; Isaac Kato, former Techstars Seattle managing director, told GeekWire. More than 160 startups participated in the core Techstars Seattle accelerator since it launched in 2010. The program, based at the University of Washington&#8217;s Startup Hall, served as a key hub for budding startup founders who needed mentorship and capital as they built the next great&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-tech-leaders-lament-departure-of-techstars-but-remain-bullish-on-new-opportunities/\">R", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-tech-leaders-lament-departure-of-techstars-but-remain-bullish-on-new-opportunities", "age": null, "source_obj__id": 338, "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "permanent": false, "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 0, "thumbnail": null, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/"}, {"tags": [], "user": null, "title": "Techstars CEO responds to former Seattle managing director, tells him to check his facts", "vote": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-23T05:47:39+00:00", "dead": false, "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_5136-1260x945.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Techstars CEO Ma\u00eblle Gavet on Thursday criticized a blog post penned by Chris DeVore, a longtime Seattle investor who ran Techstars Seattle as managing director from 2014 to 2019. In the blog post, titled &#8220;What went wrong at Techstars,&#8221; DeVore called out strategic decisions such as leaning on corporate sponsors &#8220;at the expense of founders&#8221; and altering the incentive system for local managing directors. DeVore published his post Wednesday following news that Techstars was shutting down its Seattle program amid other changes at the global accelerator company.
