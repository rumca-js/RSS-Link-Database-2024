Often times when a film director leaves a scene on the cutting room floor, it's for a good reason.  Though when David Yates was finishing Harry Potter and the two part Deathly Hallows installments, one deleted scene could have added world of closure to Harry Potter's life at Number 4 Privet drive.  When Harry Potter is leaving his childhood home in the finished film, it all seems very quick and emotionless.  But with just a few minutes of deleted dialogue added back in, it could have given audiences the closure Harry needed from the Dursley's and his childhood home.
