And when you believe that, there is no such thing as ‚Äúinalienable‚Äù rights that you are born with. And because of that, rights can change as society ‚Äúprogresses.‚Äù </p><p>The problem with all that is that none of that is true.

Yes, Taylor Swift's boyfriend's team. The team your favorite MAGA influencer lied to you about being part of a deep state psyop.</p><p>Which, as a Bills fan, I know how this turns out. After going undefeated all season, the Buffalo Bills will lose to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship off of a fake punt that actually works, just to make sure it's Araiza who beats us.
