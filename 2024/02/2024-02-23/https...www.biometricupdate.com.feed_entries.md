		A reckoning is on the way for porn sites, social media platforms and other age-restricted online content, as regulators move to pass mandatory <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/lawmakers-activists-pornographers-haggle-over-the-future-of-north-americas-children">age verification laws</a> aimed at preventing children from exposure to online harms. But the issue crosses a political nexus at which distaste for obscenity meets the treasured status of personal privacy, particularly on the issues of biometrics and digital identity. For both tech giants and politicians jockeying for votes, choices will have to be made.

		Satisfied with IAM systems after a six-team trial last season, the U.S. National Football League appears ready to go league-wide with biometric ID verification.

The <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/nfl-tackles-access-security-with-staff-face-biometrics-pilot">pilot</a> came at the end of 3.5 years of digital IAM testing by the NFL. No sports leagues like to lose money when people get unpaid-for stadium access, but NFL owners are particularly upset by it compared to others.

League owners are expected to set up a centralized facial recognition IAM service based on its Express Access authentication platform in the 2024 season. That would be for all 30 stadiums for the 32 teams, beginning in late summer.

		A U.S. consumer rights watchdog has ordered a recall of more than 119,000 biometrics-enabled safes used for storing valuables and weapons. One of the faulty safes was opened by a 6-year-old boy even though he was unauthorized to access the biometric lock.

In its recall order published Thursday, the U.S. Consumer Rights Protection Committee <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/Machir-Recalls-Biometric-Personal-Safes-Due-to-Serious-Injury-Hazard-and-Risk-of-Death">warned</a> that the safes could be opened by users with unpaired fingerprints, posing a “serious injury hazard and risk of death if the safe is used to store firearms.” The agency received over 90 complaints.

The recall includes more than 24,000 safes designed by Missouri-based <a href="ht

		A toothless bill that would create a minimum rate for digital patient records has been proposed in the lower house of the U.S. Congress.

If passed, the White House would have to define what patient record matching means and set a standard of 99.9 percent. Matching patients with their digital records to such a high degree of accuracy would likely mean issuing digital identities. The regulation would cover health care providers, software developers and health care IT organizations.

The <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/kelly.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/KELLPA_039_xml.pdf">legislation</a> is called the Patient Matching and Transparency in Certified Health IT Act, or Match IT. But it would be a voluntary standard and results woul

		Kuwaitis have been given three months to complete mandatory fingerprinting for the country’s central biometric database.

The final countdown for registering the biometric data starts on March 1st and will continue until June 1st. After that deadline, citizens and residents who fail to complete the registration will face a suspension of all transactions with Kuwait’s Ministry of Interior, the agency warned in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Moi_kuw/status/1760532626199175243?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1760532626199175243%7Ctwgr%5E1844aba25e1171c2f954616da29a7cc40d42dd11%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgulfbusiness.com%2Fkuwait-urges-mandatory-biometric-fingerprinting%2F">statement</a> on Twitter.

		Hackers may have a new way of obtaining your biometric data – by secretly listening in to the sound of your finger swiping on your smartphone.

A team of scientists from China and the United States say they have devised a side-channel attack on minutiae-based automatic fingerprint identification systems (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/afis">AFISs</a>) which allows them to extract fingerprint patterns from the sound of friction produced by swiping on a touchscreen. Side channel attacks exploit information that is inadvertently leaked by a system.

The researchers have named the new attack PrintListener. They claim that the new attack method could increase the efficiency of MasterPrints, ringing alarm bells for the security of fingerprint authentic

		Metamaterials are being applied to biometrics and the results are likely to include surveillance and ID verification systems that are cheaper, more efficient and stealthier than anything on the market.

Metamaterials are those devised to operate in ways that seem to mock physical laws. Assembled into devices, they typically deal with waves – such as seismic, acoustic and electromagnetic.

Electromagnetic waves are being experimented with in Taiwanese labs <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c05002">to create</a> surveillance systems that are startling in how they operate and what they can do.
