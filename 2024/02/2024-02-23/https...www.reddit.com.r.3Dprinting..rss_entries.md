The impression is superb in front and on the sides, but it’s behind the print that it gets spoiled. My outside wall seems to suffer a little.</p> <p>The under extrusion is close to the z seam position so i changed my retraction a little. In this print i got 0,8mm retraction distance and 45mm/s retraction speed. I also use combing mode not on outer surface. My print speed was 60mm/s and the temperature was at 210.</p> <p>I also did a little box before where the front was perfect, but the back got under extrusion. Retraction was at 1.0mm and 55mm/s retract speed.</p> <p>What can i do to fix that ? </p> <p>Thanks !</p> </div><!

I’m a vet tech myself so the moment I saw the X-rays I was able to get her amputation 2 days after. She is undergoing chemo and doing well. She has arthritis in her other legs and back so she does tire easily. I’m working on making her a wheel chair but would love some help making a template to make a prosthetic for her. I haven’t used a 3d printer but my mom is a teacher and has access to one. The ones that I can buy online are $1000+ and we have already spent a lot on her chemo and amputation so I’m trying to see where I can save some
