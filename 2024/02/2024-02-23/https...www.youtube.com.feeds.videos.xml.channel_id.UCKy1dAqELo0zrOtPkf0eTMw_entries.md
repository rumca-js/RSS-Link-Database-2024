## Everything You Need To Know About The New Harry Potter Max Series - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

We’ve got so many updates on the upcoming Harry Potter series, coming to Max in 2026. WB Discovery CEO David Zaslav promises the new series will dive deep into the series of books, meaning we’ll see the iconic stories retold for the small screen. The plan is to tell the stories made famous by the series of novels for next 10 years, after the series premiere sometime in 2026. This means we’ll see adaptations of the Philosopher’s Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows. Apparently each planned season will explore one of the books in the Harry Potter series, but as stated previously, the plan is to run it for 10 consecutive years, so it sounds like they’ll potentially stretch certain books for a couple seasons. That shouldn’t be an issue for the later years, and would be a major improvement on the original movies, which really should have been two-parters from Goblet of Fire Onwards David Zaslav

Check out the trailer for Knox Goes Away, an upcoming thriller movie starring Michael Keaton (Spotlight, Beetlejuice), James Marsden (“Westworld,” “Dead To Me”), Suzy Nakamura (“Avenue 5”, “Snowfall”), John Hoogenakker (“Dopesick,” Teacher), Joanna Kulig (Hanna, Cold War), Ray Mckinnon (“Dopesick,” Chaos Walking) and Lela Loren (“American Gods,” Bruised) with Marcia Gay Harden (“So Help Me Todd,” “The Morning Show”) and Al Pacino (House of Gucci, The Irishman).

Academy Award nominee Michael Keaton directs and stars in this unpredictable thriller as John Knox, a hit man attempting to make amends before his recently discovered dementia takes over. Aided by a trusted friend (Academy Award winner Al Pacino) with his own shady past, Knox races against the police — and his own rapidly deteriorating mind — to save his estranged son (James Marsden) from a vengeance-fueled mistake and “cash out” before it’s too late. 

Knox Goes Away opens in theaters on March 15, 2024.

## Warner Bros. Admits Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League 'Fell Short' - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
WB execs have admitted that the AAA game, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, had missed their sales mark and fell short of company expectations. The game was met with middling reviews, with many critics and gamers taking issue with the divisive story. Developer Rocksteady, though, still has more DLC for the game in the works, including a playable Joker. In other news, Helldivers 2 dev Arrowhead is working on a patch that will rise the cap of concurrent players from 500,000 to 700,000. This, along with the new feature to auto kick idle players, should help alleviate long wait times, especially as the game heads into its second weekend. And finally, Sony is looking into making the PSVR2 compatible with PC. This could do a lot to convince VR fans to shell out the dough for the pricey PS5 peripheral.

Cross soon discovers firsthand the chaos and awe of a job that careens from harrowing to heartfelt, testing his relationship with Rutkovsky and the ethical ambiguity that can be the difference between life and death. 

Based on the novel Black Flies by Shannon Burke, and directed by Jean-Stéphane Sauvaire, Asphalt City arrives in theaters on March 29, 2024.

The stars and director of the upcoming horror movie, Imaginary bring us an exclusive sneak peek of Imaginary as part of IGN Fan Fest 2024. Coming to theaters on March 8, 2024. 

From Blumhouse, the genre-defining masterminds behind FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY’S and M3GAN, comes an original horror that taps into the innocence of imaginary friends – and begs the question: Are they really figments of childhood imagination or is something more terrifying lying just beneath?
 
When Jessica (DeWanda Wise) moves back into her childhood home with her family, her youngest stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun) develops an eerie attachment to a stuffed bear named Chauncey she finds in the basement. Alice starts playing games with Chauncey that begin playful and become
increasingly sinister.
 
As Alice’s behavior becomes more and more concerning, Jessica intervenes only to realize Chauncey is much more than the stuffed toy bear she believed him to be.

At this year’s Game Awards, actor Abubakar Salim treated the audience to a look at his upcoming game Tales of Kenzera: ZAU. Inspired by Salim’s journey of grief after losing his father, Tales of Kenzera is a Metroidvania that follows warrior-shaman Zau as he works with the god of death Kalunga to bring his father back to life. The game marks the first project out of Salim’s Surgent Studios. For IGN Fan Fest, Salim sat down with Daemon Hatfield to give us insight on what we can expect from the latest EA Original. 

Games about grief–Gris, What Remains of Edith Finch, and even God of War to name of few–have emotionally resonated with players and Tales of Kenzera looks to strike a similar chord as a fascinating new entry in a burgeoning thematic genre. From gorgeous gameplay to level biomes that encapsulate varying emotional states--expect all that and more when Tales of Kenzera: ZAU drops on PC and consoles April 23.

Dune: Part 2 introduces a number of new characters to this epic sci-fi universe, but perhaps none more important than Austin Butler’s Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen. As if Timothee Chalamet’s Paul Atreides didn’t have enough enemies already, now he’s forced to face off with the heir apparent of House Harkonnen. 

It’s safe to call Feyd-Rautha Paul’s arch-nemesis in the new movie. These two young men truly are two sides of the same coin. But what makes Feyd-Rautha the twisted mirror image of Paul? And how are both men connected by the Bene Gesserit and their centuries-long breeding program? Here’s what you need to know about the Paul/Feyd rivalry heading into the new Dune movie.

Dune: Part 2 also stars Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Zendaya, Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and Léa Seydoux. The film releases in theaters on March 1, 2024.

With Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC expansion on the horizon, plenty of Tarnished are undoubtedly revisiting The Lands Between, something that’s incredibly easy to do thanks to the most basic consideration on FromSoftware’s part: Elden Ring’s tutorial is basically optional. 

When the appeal of so many open-world games is the freedom to go anywhere, you’d think more of them would be quicker to get out of the way and let players explore. Sadly, some of the best open-world games ever made are front-loaded with several hours of mandatory objectives designed to explain the basic gameplay mechanics or establish characters and story. The Legends of Zelda Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are both guilty of this, as is Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain. Don’t even get us started on the Assassin’s Creed or Far Cry series. Worst of all, every return visit to Skyrim starts with that insufferable wagon ride, and before hitting the streets of Los Santos, GTA V insist
