<p>You can never be too safe in the digital age, and for PlayStation users looking to get both convenience and extra security, a PS5 passkey service is now available. The appeal of a passkey system is that it provides an easier and secure method for accessing your PlayStation Network account, especially when you don't want to type out a long password key every time. Using this system, you can sign in through your mobile device or computer using a pin or a biometric safety feature like your fingerprint or a face scan.</p><p>It's faster and allows you to access your games more quickly, and because passkeys are only generated once per session, you have an added layer of protection against cyberattacks.</p><h2>How to set up a PS5 passkey</h2><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4263808-safekey-1.jpg"><img alt="The settings menu can be found in the top corner of the screen." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/origin

<p>When James Cameron's first Avatar film premiered in 2009, it was a game-changer with visual effects and became the biggest movie of all time--a record it still holds almost 20 years later. It also redefined the brand of the word "Avatar." The epic Nickelodeon animated series had just wrapped the previous year and had a movie in the works, which was going to be retitled The Last Airbender to avoid any sort of confusion. </p><p>However, that still didn't completely help actor Ken Leung when auditioning for the Netflix adaption of the animated series, as he thought he was going after a role in Cameron's movies.

<p dir="ltr">Penny's Big Breakaway is a loving homage to a somewhat awkward period in gaming history. The early days of 3D mascot platformers were defined by garish saturated colors, exaggerated character designs, and a variety of gimmicks as the genre found its footing in this new environment. Penny's Big Breakaway fits right into that legacy, like a lost gem that just got a shiny new remaster. But while its stylized look will probably be an acquired taste, it makes good use of its gimmick to avoid some pitfalls of the era it emulates.</p><p dir="ltr">The story revolves around Penny, an aspiring yo-yo performer who goes to a talent show audition put on by a stodgy Emperor. Along the way, her toy prop fuses with a creature, becoming a sort of sentient and voracious pet. The creature grants her all sorts of special abilities but also causes trouble at the talent show, angering the Emperor and putting her on the run from his army of penguin goons. Her "big break" turned into a
