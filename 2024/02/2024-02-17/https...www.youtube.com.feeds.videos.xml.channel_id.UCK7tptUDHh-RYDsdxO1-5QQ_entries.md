Royal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas carries up to 7,600 passengers and more than 2,300 crew. The world’s largest cruise ship is nearly as long as the Empire State Building is tall and even has a water park on board. But its main amenity is its food; so how does the company plan meals and maintain its 40 restaurants for 10,000 people?

WSJ goes behind the scenes on the Icon of the Seas to see how employees stock, prepare and serve so much food so guests can have an all-you-can-eat experience while minimizing waste.
