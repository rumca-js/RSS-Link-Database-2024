<p>Frantic, open and featuring an ­83rd-minute Rodri rocket of a Manchester City equaliser that went in off Trevoh Chalobah’s knee to send the home faithful ballistic: this scintillating contest ended with Chelsea earning a point and the champions dropping two in their bid to defend the title again.</p><p>After 11 successive victories the expected narrative was a 12th for City that would match Liverpool and Arsenal earlier, who had each won.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/17/manchester-city-chelsea-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

His ageing mother must travel to the Arctic Circle to search a prison colony and a morgue for his body.

His courageous fight against the venality and brutality of Russia’s regime, and his championing of democratic choice and human rights, placed him at the forefront of today’s global struggle between liberalism and authoritarianism.</p><p>Yet unlike Pechorin, the central character in Lermontov’s 1840 novel of rebellion and disillusion, Navalny did not see himself as a hero or in any way exceptional. He was essentially a man of the people. He spoke for the common man and woman – and he spoke with a smile. And that, more than anything, was what Russia’s humourless, uncharismatic killer-presiden

<p>(Partisan)<br />There’s less seething, more singing as the band’s fifth album finds them evolving musically, artistically and emotionally</p><p>Idles’ fifth album starts with an arpeggiating piano and ends on a short, unshowy sax solo. One bouncing track, Dancer, is about the pleasure of bodies moving “cheek to cheek” and “hip to hip”; it features backing vocals by James Murphy and Nancy Whang from club-rock deities LCD Soundsystem. Another <em>Tangk</em> high point, the slow-burning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnd4jIBRfHE">Grace</a>, imports the pensive synth reverberations of LCD’s track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwoLACv_srQ">Someone Great</a>.</p><p>Given that Idles’ pulverising first three LPs were fuelled by terse menace and guitar firepower, a major shift is clearly under way. This was a Bristol band who made their name taking down xenophobia and toxic masculinity with righteous, punk-adjacent aggro, one whose attention to musical detail a

<p>João Luís Barreto Guimarães, a breast cancer specialist and prizewinning poet, is pioneering the teaching of poetry alongside medicine to help trainee doctors empathise with their patients</p><p>In an unremarkable lecture hall on a rainy Monday afternoon, Cândida Pereira is expounding passionately on the intricacies of a poem by the Portuguese politician-poet <a href="https://www.poetryinternational.com/en/poets-poems/poets/poet/102-4659_Graca-Moura">Vasco Graça Moura</a>. Her classmates listen closely as the second-year university student enthuses about lyric form, poetic voice and Moura’s use of “perceptual imagery” and “sensual tone”. Nothing unusual for a standard poetry module, perhaps. Yet once the bell goes, Pereira will repack her well-thumbed poetry anthology and replace it with more prosaic textbooks on neuroanatomy and pharmacology. The 19-year-old is one of 20 or so trainee doctors at Porto University’s medical faculty taking a new elective course on the fundam

<p>The Bristol-born multi-instrumentalist’s bass vocals, oblique lyrics and taste for the atonal make for unsettling, off-kilter lounge music</p><p><a href="https://linktr.ee/bingofury">Bingo Fury</a>’s music is ruled by chance moments, as likely to feature the sound of breaking glass as a chord sequence. Taking cues from Captain Beefheart and Laurie Anderson, the 24-year-old Bristolian, real name Jack Ogborne, creates noir ballads characterised by their dissonance, his guttural baritone underscoring experimental orchestration and fragmented noise. There are competing horn sections, scrambled piano interludes, moments of static and droll lyrics. “This is a new kind of pain before you cross-stitch my soul,” he croons on Leather Sky. Latest single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmKM0CVXGfQ">Mr Stark</a> is a semi-improvised patchwork of skittish rhythms and laconic one-liners.</p><p>The convenience of a studio is not for Fury; he prefers more atmospheric locations.

<p>Huge 25-13 victory with ‘mercurial’ Finn Russell providing the Murrayfield cheer ended the one-way traffic against England</p><p>It is an immutable law of the Six Nations that everyone loves beating England. It follows that everyone hates losing to them, and Scotland lost to the auld enemy <em>a lot</em> in the previous decade. No one knew it at the time, but England’s 2009 win at Twickenham was a result that ushered in 10 years of Scottish pain. Ugo Monye, Riki Flutey and Mathew Tait scored tries for the hosts, captained by Steve Borthwick, while the scrum-half Danny Care added a drop goal in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/23/six-nations-england-scotland-report">a 26-12 victory</a>.</p><p>Granted, the reunion at Murrayfield a year later finished 15-15, Scotland’s dynamic back row excelling in an encounter the hosts arguably deserved to win, as Ben Youngs came off the bench for his international debut.

<p>Kenny Everett, Alistair Cooke, now Wright: some voices are so familiar that they become part of the fabric of our own lives</p><p>The great illusion of radio, the magic trick, is making each of us think that the voice coming out of the air is talking just to us. Not everyone will like a particular voice. That’s their loss. But those of us who do will tune the radio to the same place at the same time on the same day to catch it. When the programme’s time slot changes, or even if the voice leaves and goes to another radio station on another day at a different time, we will follow. When this voice dies, our loss is personal. We may never have met them but, somehow, we’re connected.

Statement No&nbsp;1: I don’t really think we should be pumping sewage into the sea, or the waterways. “Oh, it’s actually all right,” you, a bigwig water boss, keep trying to explain to me in a patronising voice. “It’s not fully raw sewage. It’s been treated a bit. Stop swimming in the sea if you have a problem with it.” No, thanks, actually! I don’t think we should be pumping sewage slurry into the water round our island!
