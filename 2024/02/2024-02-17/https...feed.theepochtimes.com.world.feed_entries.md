SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA - JANUARY 20: A QantasLink plane taxis on the runway ahead of takeoff at Sydney Airport on January 20, 2024 in Sydney, Australia. Transport Minister Catherine King signed off on a deal that will allow Turkish Airlines to start serving the Australian market, rising to 35 flights a week by 2025. The decision came as the government was under mounting criticism from many for a perception that it was protecting the profits of Qantas and stymying competition in the market by limiting additional capacity for other carriers, such as Qatar Airways.
