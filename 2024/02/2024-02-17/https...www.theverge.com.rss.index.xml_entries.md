  <p id="aZCjYH">It appears that Apple Pay is down, particularly for Chase customers — Verge staffers have had their cards declined while trying to pay with Chase cards using Apple Pay, while using the same physical card works just fine.

  <p id="nFNgpV">Reddit will let “an unnamed large AI company” have access to its user-generated content platform in a new licensing deal, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-16/reddit-is-said-to-sign-ai-content-licensing-deal-ahead-of-ipo">according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a> yesterday. The deal, “worth about $60 million on an annualized basis,” the outlet writes, could still change as the company’s plans to go public are still in the works.</p>

  <p id="rqRdLQ">The <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> developers won Game of the Year, again, during the <a href="https://www.interactive.org/">27th annual DICE Awards</a>. But in stark contrast to their 2023 Game Awards win, this time they actually got to speak.</p>

  <p id="OxNAmy">I hate to be the bearer of bad-for-the-waistline news, but yes — you can now buy a 3D printer that prints chocolate. <a href="https://cocoapress.com/">The Cocoa Press</a> has been in development for an entire decade. Now, it’s finally here, and I’m pretty sure it’s singlehandedly responsible for one of the pounds I put on over Christmas.</p>

  <p id="Q6tK8v">Five months ago, we wrote about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/8/23865255/wyze-security-camera-feeds-web-view-issue">how your Wyze webcam might have let strangers peek into your house</a>. Today, it happened again. Wyze cofounder David Crosby confirmed the issue in an email response sent to <em>The Verge</em>, saying, “We have now identified a security issue where some users were able to see thumbnails of cameras that were not their own in the Events tab.”</p>
