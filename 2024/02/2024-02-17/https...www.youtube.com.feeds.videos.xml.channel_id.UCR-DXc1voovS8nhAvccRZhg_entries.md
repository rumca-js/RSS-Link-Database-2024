A Total Solar Eclipse is coming up on April 8 across North America. Here's how to photograph it.

Here's the equipment I'll be taking to the eclipse (some links are affiliate links):

  - Manfrotto 128RC Micro Fluid Head: https://amzn.to/3SZ1Bb8
  - Sony Alpha A6600 APS-C Camera: https://amzn.to/48jfoO7
  - Sony 70-350mm F4.5-6.3G OSS Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3OKL349

I'll probably take my GoPro and a second tripod, to set it up on the whole scene to remember our reaction to the whole thing.
