The MCU as we know it wouldn’t exist without Robert Downey, Jr. While that sounds hyperbolic — and not particularly original — it is a fact. His embodiment of Tony Stark, a character who up until that point was best known for his stint as an alcoholic in Bob Layton, David Michelinie, and John Romita Jr.'s fantastic Bronze Age Iron Man arc, gave the Marvel film franchise its first smash hit and a beating heart to keep its blood flowing. However you feel about the movies that have been released since Tony's death in Avengers: Endgame it's fair to say that the MCU has struggled to find that same consistency without Iron Man around to anchor the ever-more cosmic and sprawling franchise.

But with the massive Valentine's Day casting announcement of the Fantastic Four which finally confirmed that Pedro Pascal will be taking on the role of Reed Richards, the MCU may have found its next North Star. The fan-favorite actor has proven his chops time and time again and could change the M

## Helldivers 2 Review

Helldivers 2 reviewed by Will Borger on PlayStation 5, also available on PC.

Helldivers 2 is the rare modern multiplayer game that does almost everything right. It gives you a ton of freedom, feels fantastic to play, and has a smart progression system that doesn’t nickel and dime you or rely too much on a paid battle pass. It manages to keep its missions fresh by introducing a ton of enemies, modifiers, and objectives, and varying them in interesting ways. There are some matchmaking and performance issues that still need to be worked out, and you can only go so far by yourself or with random players – but if you’ve got a solid squad, it’s an incredible time, and certainly one of the most fun multiplayer shooters in years.

Joker: Folie a Deux, the sequel to 2019’s Joker is still on track to release October 4th of next year. and to hold us over till then, director Todd Phillips took to Instagram to give us new looks at the clown prince and his new partner in crime. In the first photo, we have actor Joquin Phoenix suited up with the infamous Joker makeup, pictured alongside Lady Gaga’s version of Harley Quinn. In the next photo, we’ve got Arthur Fleck behind bars, presumably in Arkham Asylum, budding noses with Dr. Quinn. And finally, the two share an embrace on a rooftop in Gotham. Keep in mind this movie is also supposed to be a musical, so this could be one of those scenes. With Lady Gaga in the mix, it’s no surprise there’ll be musical elements throughout the film. Definitely a different take from what we’ve gotten in the past pertaining to Harley Quinn, as we’ve only gotten Margot Robbie’s take on the DC villain on the big screen. #Joker2 will be part of the DC Elseworlds set of films within
