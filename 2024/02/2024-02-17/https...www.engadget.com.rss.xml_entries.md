<p>Intuitive Machines‚Äô lunar lander is well on its way to the moon after launching without a hitch on Thursday, but it managed to snap a few incredible images of Earth while it was still close to home. The company shared the first batch of images from the IM-1 mission on <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/Int_Machines/status/1758899202174685589?s=20">X</a> today after confirming in an earlier post that the spacecraft is ‚Äúin excellent health.‚Äù Along with a view of Earth and some partial selfies of the Nova-C lander, nicknamed Odysseus, you can even see the SpaceX Falcon 9 second stage falling away in the distance after separation.</p>

<p>Sometimes, timing ruins things. Take this week, instead of detailing the disgust I feel towards this 'meaty' rice, this week's Morning After sets its sights on Mark Zuckerberg, the multimillionaire who's decided to review technology now. Does he know that's <em>my</em> gig?</p>
<p>The Meta boss unfavorably compared Apple's new Vision Pro to his company's Meta Quest 3 headset, which is a delightfully hollow and petty reason to 'review' something. But hey, I had to watch it. And now maybe, you'll watch me?&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We also look closer at Waymo's disastrous December, where two of its robotaxis collided with a truck. The ... same truck.</p>

<p>Some Wyze camera owners have reported that they were suddenly given access to cameras that weren't theirs and even got notifications for events inside other people's homes. Wyze cofounder David Crosby has confirmed the issue to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075369/wyze-security-camera-stranger-feeds-glitch"><em>The Verge</em></a>, telling the publications that &quot;some users were able to see thumbnails of cameras that were not their own in the Events tab.&quot; Users started seeing strangers' camera feeds in their accounts after an outage that Wyze said was caused by an Amazon Web Services problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crosby wrote in a <a href="https://forums.wyze.com/t/wyze-outage-and-investigation-of-security-issue/290462">post on the Wyze forum</a> that the company's servers got overloaded, which corrupted some user data, after the outage. The security issue that resulted from that event then allowed users to &quot;see thumbnails of cameras that were not thei

<p>Ever posted or left a comment on Reddit? Your words will soon be used to train an artificial intelligence companies' models, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-16/reddit-is-said-to-sign-ai-content-licensing-deal-ahead-of-ipo?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The website signed a deal that's &quot;worth about $60 million on an annualized basis&quot; earlier this year, it reportedly told potential investors ahead of its expected initial public offering (IPO). <em>Bloomberg</em> didn't name the &quot;large AI company&quot; that's paying Reddit millions for access to its content, but their agreement could apparently serve as a model for future contracts, which could mean more multi-million deals for the firm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon, a company that employs more than 1.54 million people, has claimed that the National Labor Relations Board Relations Board (NLRB), the federal agency responsible for protecting the rights of workers, is unconstitutional. Amazon made the claim in a legal document filed on Thursday as part of a case in which prosecutors from the Board have accused the e-commerce giant of discrimination against workers at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island who had voted to unionize, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/economy/amazon-labor-nlrb.html">according</a> to <em>The New York Times</em>.<br /><br />Amazon is not the first company to challenge the Board‚Äôs constitutionality. Last month, Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX sued the NLRB after the agency accused the company of unlawfully firing eight employees and called the agency ‚Äúunconstitutional‚Äù in the lawsuit. Weeks later, grocery chain Trader Joe‚Äôs, which the NLRB accused of union-busting, said tha
