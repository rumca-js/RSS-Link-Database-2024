<p><a href="https://www.opemipo.com/">Opemipo Aikomo</a> is a self-taught digital designer based in Lagos, Nigeria. He started out making posters at university and it was an early attempt to create a magazine that sparked his interest in Nigerian albums. “I struggled to piece together a story about the history of Afrobeats, but in the process I got interested in the designers creating cover art for what is now a big cultural export,” he says. Working with the makers’ collective <a href="https://www.wuruwuru.com/">Wuruwuru</a>, Aikomo created <a href="https://www.albumcoverbank.com/">Album Cover Bank</a>, a digital archive of album artwork reaching back to the 1950s.

<p>While some technological advances are nothing short of miraculous, there are plenty of downsides, too …</p><p>Let’s be fair: technology has improved my life in ways that still surprise and delight me on a daily basis. My phone is also a torch! My TV remembers how far I got in last night’s episode, even if I don’t! The bus stop knows when the bus is ­coming, and I can watch my ­pizza’s entire journey from the restaurant to my house! These are, frankly, miracles.</p><p>But there have been corresponding sacrifices. Over 20 years, I have turned over whole areas of competence, memory, authority and independence to the machines in my life. Along the way, I have become anxious about problems that didn’t used to exist, indecisive over choices I never used to have to make, and angry about things I would once have been wholly unaware of.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/17/no-focus-no-fights-and-a-bad-back-16-ways-technology-has-ruined-my-life-tim-dowling

<p>Turning off the phone and focusing on wild camping, sailing, foraging, fishing or beachcombing puts our authors in a state of mindfulness</p><p>I was deep in the folds of the mountain of Tryfan when it first happened. When time seemed to stop ticking at the breakneck pace it always does when I’m sitting at laptop, working on a deadline. Instead of blue light from a screen, I was sitting at my tent door, basking in the purple glow of dusk as it crept into the Ogwen Valley, in Eryri/Snowdonia national park. The luscious green of the grass on the mountainside had turned a more muted shade and the blue of the Menai Strait in the distance had become barely distinguishable from the twilight sky.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/feb/17/art-of-slow-travel-five-writers-activity-connect-to-natural-world">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Learn how to make a pizza base from scratch, then layer it with kale, taleggio and hot honey topping, or spice things up with fennel, chilli, mushrooms, basil and ricotta  </p><p>In theory, making pizza at home – particularly with kids involved – should be fun. In practice, making pizza at home – particularly with kids involved – is total mayhem. Flour goes everywhere, there’s dough stuck to every work surface and everyone remembers just that bit too late that they should have put the base on the baking tray <em>before</em> the toppings went on. The solution? <em>Pizza al taglio,</em> or “by the cut” pizza, with which one large, traybake pizza serves four happy (and flour-free) people. I’ve given ideas for two toppings below, but what goes on top is really a free-for-all, so play around as much as you (or any kids) like.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/feb/17/pizza-by-the-slice-recipes-al-taglio-mushrooms-basil-ricotta-kale-taleggio-honey-yotam-ottolengh

Caesar salad is all about the umaminess of its dressing, in which parmesan, anchovies and Worcestershire sauce are mixed into an unctuous, egg-based emulsion to make the ultimate salad sauce.
