The experiment, described in this week&#8217;s issue of the journal Science, required &#8220;freezing&#8221; the motion of the atoms with which the electrons were associated, on a scale of mere attoseconds. An attosecond is one-quintillionth of a second &#8212; or, expressed another way, a millionth of a trillionth of a second. Attosecond-scale observations could provide scientists with new insights into how radiation exposure affects objects and people.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/freeze-frame-electrons-wate", "age": null, "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/freeze-frame-electrons-water", "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "title": "Researchers take a freeze-frame reading of electrons energized in a stream of water", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-17T00:45:13+00:00", "thumbnail": null}]
