It highlights the difference between struct and class definitions and discusses the role of class invariants in guaranteeing the correctness of class objects. The article also touches upon the trade-offs between strong and weak invariants and provides insights into when to define a new class with proper invariants.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<h3>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2024/01/07/class-invariants/\">Class Invariants</a></h3>\n\t<p>\n\t\tby Andrzej Krzemie&#324;ski</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFrom the article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThe primary motivation for defining a class in C++ is to reflect and maintain a&nbsp;<em>class invariant</em>.
