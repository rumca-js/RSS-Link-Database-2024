## Ask HN: Why do recommender systems not seem good?

<p>I personally find recommender systems on platforms that I am on to be very poor.<p>I would expect with all the effort that has gone into these, and all the progress in machine learning, these systems would be fantastic and provide recommendations that I really enjoy. But they don’t.<p>YouTube seems to have a massive recency bias and music, film, and TV recommendations rarely end up being things I enjoy.</p>

## Show HN: Darwin – Automate Your GitHub Project with AI

<p>Hey HN!
I've been working on a project called Darwin that I'm thrilled to share with you.<p>Darwin is essentially your GitHub agent powered by large language models (LLMs). It checks out your projects, understands them through natural language prompts, and automates tasks  such as fixing issues, documenting code, reviewing pull requests, and more.<p>What drove me to create Darwin was a desire to harness the power of LLMs in a way that's seamlessly integrated with the tools I use daily. The motivation came from my curiosity about what could be possible when writing code that understands code.
Darwin stands out because it's designed for developers who want to leverage AI without needing deep expertise in LLMs or prompt engineering. It offers:<p>- hands-off approach to automate routine development tasks.<p>- Novel and creative ways of making LLMs work for you<p>- A unique API for each project, allowing for customized automation tools.<p>Currently, Darwin is in alpha. It's fun

<p>I gave up drinking and started getting more into exercise recently, which has helped my mental clarity a lot. As a daily drinker for over 15+ years, I was in quite a mental fog and I expect to need a lot more time to come out of it.<p>However, as I began to emerge from said fog over the last few months, the lack of purpose in my life was clear. Work is just a job, I have a few hobbies I enjoy (cooking, running, reading), but none of them would equate to a purpose in life. I have no kids and no desire to have them. A great marriage. A few friends, but most of them have kids and never see them anymore. My dog is great, and I enjoy spending time with him.<p>I can't stop asking myself: is this enough? Why am I not feeling content? Why do I feel like every day is a repetitive exercise in near futility?<p>All the generic self-help stuff online around purpose isn't connecting with me for some reason. I am looking to this more analytically-minded crowd to source ideas for how to a

<p>Hey, HN! We're Karun and Selin, co-founders of Delve (<a href="https://getdelve.com">https://getdelve.com</a>). We help companies get HIPAA compliant fast, with 1-click infrastructure, streamlined legal policies, and real-time monitoring. Here’s a quick demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/mQbb5mprsUA" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/mQbb5mprsUA</a>.<p>HIPAA is a US federal law passed back in 1996 that sets standards for protecting sensitive health information. Here’s an article that breaks it down pretty simply: <a href="https://www.getdelve.com/blog/quick-guide-to-hipaa">https://www.getdelve.com/blog/quick-guide-to-hipaa</a>.<p>Most companies that process health information in the US need to become HIPAA compliant, a process that can be long and expensive. At our previous health tech company, we spent 6 weeks (and tens of thousands of dollars) on getting compliant. We had to complete a lot of manual work, even after purchasing an industry-standard compliance solution, and fel

## Show HN: AboutIdeasNow – search /about, /ideas, /now pages of 7k+ personal sites

<p>Hi HN!<p>It’s hard to find interesting people to work with on your ideas.<p>Our solution: index the /about, /ideas, /now pages of 1000s of personal websites. There are thousands of cool personal sites out there, with amazing ideas on them, but there’s nowhere to easily search through. So we built a simple site that indexes 7k+ personal sites [0]. We were inspired by Derek Sivers’ Now page movement [1] and other IndieWeb directories [2], but we figured that it would be more useful if we:<p>* Let you search directly across personal sites without having to visit them<p>* Take the content from 3 specific pages, /about, /now and /ideas, to structure everything<p>* Define /ideas pages as a space to articulate things you want to work on<p>We hope this’ll be a cool place for people to find others to collaborate with - would love your feedback. If you’d like your site to appear at the top, add it via the form and add a last updated date of today (any format). It’s completely open s

## Show HN: R2R – Open-source framework for production-grade RAG

<p>Hello HN, I'm Owen from SciPhi (<a href="https://www.sciphi.ai/" rel="nofollow">https://www.sciphi.ai/</a>), a startup working on simplifying˛Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Today we’re excited to share R2R (<a href="https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R">https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R</a>), an open-source framework that makes it simpler to develop and deploy production-grade RAG systems.<p>Just a quick reminder: RAG helps Large Language Models (LLMs) use current information and specific knowledge. For example, it allows a programming assistant to use your latest documents to answer questions. The idea is to gather all the relevant information ("retrieval") and present it to the LLM with a question ("augmentation"). This way, the LLM can provide answers (“generation”) as though it was trained directly on your data.<p>The R2R framework is a powerful tool for addressing key challenges in deploying RAG systems, avoiding the complex abstractions common in other projects.

## Ask HN: What do I do with my side projects?

<p>I’m trying to decide what I should do with my side projects before I find a job related to my degree. I could release some of them as open source and ask for donations, or release them as closed source and sell a license. I have invested a lot of time into them and am hoping to make at least a little revenue from them.<p>Even if I don’t make any revenue, I think they will help me stand out in the job market. I think some of them would be a better fit for open source than others. Most of them would probably be more useful to power users than general users. I would be a little upset with myself if I give them away and get nothing when there is a chance to make some income.<p>Either way, I’ve heard that marketing is important. Now that they are mostly done, this will probably be what I work on  next.<p>If you have an personal experience with side projects you can share that might relate to my situation I would appreciate it. Did you release the project as open source or close

<p>Especially when they are the kinds of people who only care about money, which has been always the case. Our CEO for example always repeats "It is all about cash." and never asks if we are happy with our work or not. Vacations get rejected because it doesn't follow the rules even if it doesn't make any sense, if an employee doesn't have any tasks to do and wants to take a day off at the end of the week, they can't, it has to be after two weeks. We are being asked to submit 40-hour timesheets every week, no matter what happens, to the point that some employees started lying about the numbers.<p>The world seems to go crazy and it would be nice if some managers noticed that and tried to help the employees through these stressful times, but no, it is like they insist that this capitalist thinking that doesn't make anyone happy should continue no matter what.<p>Now, I always feel as if I am in the army tbh.</p>
