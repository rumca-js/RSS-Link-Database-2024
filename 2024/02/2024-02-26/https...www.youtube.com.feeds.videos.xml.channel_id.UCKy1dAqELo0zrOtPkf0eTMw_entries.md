For its shortcomings, the Apple Vision Pro is an absolutely incredible device that completely obliterated my skepticism. It does everything it promises to do at a level of craft that is Apple at its absolute best, it's just goofy looking and costs way too much.

Nebraska City, summer of 1991—Inseparable best friends AJ (Conor Sherry – “Are You Afraid of the Dark?,” The Terminal List) and Moose (Gabriel LaBelle - The Fabelmans) seize the opportunity to run the local pool's rundown snack shack after their plan to gamble on dog races and sell home-brewed beer goes down the drain. Dreaming of striking it rich, things take an unexpected turn when they meet summer visitor Brooke (Mika Abdalla – Sex Appeal, SWAT), an effortlessly cool lifeguard who puts their big summer plans, and their friendship, at risk. 

Written and directed by Adam Rehmeier (Dinner in America, The Bunny Game) and produced by T Street, MRC and Paperclip productions, SNACK SHACK is a nostalgic journey for those who came of age before the era of cell phones, and a hilarious escape for those who wish they had.

The film also stars Nick Robinson as Shane (Love, Simon, Jurassic World), and David Costabile as Judge (“Billions,” “Breaking Bad," Lincoln).
