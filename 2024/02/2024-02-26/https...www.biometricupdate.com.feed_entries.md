		Samsung’s Isocell Vision 931 image sensor has been chosen by meta-optics chip company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/metalenz">Metalenz</a> for its Polar ID imager.

Metalenz executives claim their Polar ID is unique in its ability to sense the full polarization of light in consumer-grade electronics. Early evaluation models of Polar ID cameras are out now, and more are expected in the second quarter.

Having that range reportedly makes it possible to recognize and authenticate a human face based on its polarization signature, in near infrared, collected from a single image.

Other sensors, according to the company require multiple images, which increases the sensor’s footprint and cost by 50 percent.

		The UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has warned community and fitness center operator Serco Leisure that facial recognition and fingerprint biometrics cannot be used to monitor employees’ time and attendance.

The regulator posted a notice of its warning to Serco “and seven associated leisure trusts,” stating that the use of biometrics was not proportionate, and no alternative method was offered. They must end the practice and delete the biometric data collected within three months.

Serco used biometrics to track the time and attendance of more than 2,000 employees at 38 facilities for multiple years.

The facilities operators notified of non-compliance by the ICO are Serco Leisure, Serco Jersey, Birmingham Community Leisure Trust, Bolton Community L

		If this is what AI is doing in its pre-school years, its teen years should be a scream.

Google executives are trying to appear forthcoming and responsive about troubling responses from its Gemini conversational app. Recent responses – at least those getting the most attention – seemed specifically designed to enrage U.S. nativists.

Until further notice, Gemini will not generate images of people.

The problem is that a new, and apparently faulty, image generation feature was added to Gemini three weeks ago that.

In one case, the AI responded to an illustration instruction by substituting the white male Founding Fathers in an image with representations of other races and American Indians, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/22/google-gemini-image-p
