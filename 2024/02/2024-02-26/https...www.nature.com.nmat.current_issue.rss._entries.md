<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 26 February 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01813-3">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01813-3</a></p>Understanding mesoscale structure and dynamics in organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors is crucial. Mesoscale strain kinetics and structural hysteresis have been studied, and they uncover the coupling between charge carrier dynamics and mesoscale order in organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors.
