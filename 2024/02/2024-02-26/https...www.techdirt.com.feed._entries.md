Law enforcement says laws are the rules that apply to everyone, but especially to people who aren&#8217;t in the law enforcement business. We have to follow the laws or face the consequences. But it often appears cops hold themselves to a lower standard. They only have to follow the laws that won&#8217;t get in the [&#8230;]

This morning, as you likely heard, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the NetChoice/CCIA cases regarding Texas&#8217; and Florida’s social media laws. The outcomes of these cases will have a pretty major impact on the future of online speech. While a lot of people have suggested that the states’ arguments are supported by conservatives, [&#8230;]

We’ve noted for decades how, despite all the political lip service paid toward “bridging the digital divide,” the U.S. doesn’t truly know where broadband is or isn’t available. The FCC’s past broadband maps, which cost $350 million to develop, have long been accused of all but hallucinating competitors, making up available speeds, and excluding a key metric of [&#8230;]

Sometimes, an advertisement is worth a thousand op-eds. Last week, one of us co-authored an op-ed criticizing an amicus brief filed by the American Economic Liberties Project and several prominent law professors in the pending Supreme Court case NetChoice v.
