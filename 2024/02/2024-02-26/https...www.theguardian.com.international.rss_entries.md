<p>Liverpool’s teenagers have more medals than Kane but even if Bayern end the season empty-handed the joke won’t be on him</p><p>There was another Harry Kane moment at the weekend: those moments when the air feels thin and the pulse races just a little faster and the margins have sharpened to a fine point. Kane has spent most of the last decade of his career being the most watched, the most scrutinised and the most outnumbered player on the pitch. The percentages in this job are staggeringly low. Still he checks and feints and shuffles and drifts, looking and longing for that elusive yard of space.</p><p>It finally arrives in the 91st minute against RB Leipzig, the game level at 1-1, Bayern Munich’s title challenge crumbling right here on the Allianz turf. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting brings down a long ball and flicks it over the head of the defender. The touch is heavy. Choupo-Moting was trying to keep the ball for himself. But now it sits up unexpectedly for Kane, and all tha

They were close to home in Waltham Forest and felt safe in a part of east London that they knew well. But, as they stepped out, the car in front of them suddenly, inexplicably, accelerated, one of the women later alleged.</p><p>It is said that Kulsum was thrown to the ground by the force of the impact and that Misbah was dragged under the vehicle.

Rightly, the Conservative whip was withdrawn after he claimed that Islamists had “got control” of the mayor of London. But while he is the locus of the current row over Islamophobia in Tory ranks, he is hardly unique. Rishi Sunak’s belated response, the leadership’s unwillingness to acknowledge his comments not just as prejudiced but as racist or Islamophobic, and the lack of reaction to the inflammatory words of colleagues, all speak to a broader problem and a failure to tackle it.</p><p>Mr Anderson was responding to an article by Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, stating t

<p>Darwin Machís’ last-gasp equaliser against Celta Vigo brought relief to a side who haven’t won in La Liga since September</p><p>“This was a light of hope,” Mauricio Pellegrino said, a sudden flash that brought them back to life. Cádiz had tried everything. They had changed the coach, changed the players and even changed their shirt. They had tried free transfers and free tickets too. They had hosted Valencia, Athletic, Real Sociedad and Betis, been to Pamplona, Villarreal, Vitoria and Granada, and it didn’t do any good. They had been through all the centre-forwards they have, and that’s a lot, but it wasn’t happening. They hadn’t scored in five matches, soon to be six; they had got just one in eight, and that was a penalty in a pasting. They hadn’t won in 21 league games, nearly six months. They were done. And then someone had a bright idea. Have you tried just hitting it?</p><p>On Sunday afternoon in the 100th minute of the biggest game, Darwin Machís did. As hard as he c

<p>The race for best actress Oscar is a tight one, so it’s important to understand that Stone really did stuff herself for her role in Yorgos Lanthimos’s movie</p><p>The final round of Oscar voting began last week. As we speak, thousands of Academy members are getting down to the important business of choosing who will win and who will lose come the ceremony next month. As ever, their decisions are likely to be swayed by the never-ending swirl of smaller awards ceremonies that have taken place over recent weeks, which means that many of the categories are essentially foregone conclusions at this point. Oppenheimer will probably win best picture. Robert Downey Jr is the surest best supporting actor winner for decades. Barbie will have a disappointing night, and all the worst people you follow on Instagram will make an almighty fuss of it.</p><p>But there is one category that is still up for grabs.

<p>A take-off zone, called an ‘April Fool’s joke’ by Carl Lewis, is a bad idea. But we need jeopardy. Why not make it a knockout?</p><p>Even at 55 years’ distance, Bob Beamon’s gravity-defying leap at the 1968 Olympics takes the breath away. I watched it again after World Athletics floated plans to scrap the long jump board in favour of a large “take-off zone” to eliminate fouls, and it remains six seconds of sporting perfection. Those 19 rhythmic strides down the runway, the board hit with millimetric precision. Then Beamon’s long legs launching and fluttering high through the Mexico air, like a man pedalling furiously on an imaginary recumbent bicycle, before landing 8.90 metres away.</p><p>The American didn’t just break the world record that day. He shattered it by 55 centimetres.

But as you have asked for advice, let’s start with skincare. In perimenopause we lose collagen, which dermatologist <a href="https://drsambunting.com/">Dr&nbsp;Sam Bunting</a> tells me can “worsen the appearance of acne scarring”.

<p>Like millions of doting parents, I wanted to keep others abreast of my child’s milestones. But the ‘likes’ weren’t worth the risks</p><p>Social media is a strange place. On the one hand it can be a relentlessly toxic, dark cluster of ill intent; on the other, it can act as the glue that binds us to new communities, friends of the past and family we’ve almost forgotten.

Living in Poland, a country riddled with anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, Andrzej brings a pop of colour to the concrete, Soviet-build apartment block where he lives alone.</p><p>As Lulla, Andrzej represents a bridge of knowledge between older and younger generations of the queer community. Andrzej talks of saunas and public bathhouses, long before the age of apps, where gay men could cruise in secret. At the same time, the film also frankly and empathically grapples with the challenges of ageing. When it comes to partying and drinking, Andrzej can’t quite keep up with his thirtysomething friend
