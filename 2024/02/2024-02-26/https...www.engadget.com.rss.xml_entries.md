<p>Just ahead of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mwc-2024/"><ins>Mobile World Congress</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nvidia/"><ins>NVIDIA</ins></a> unveiled its latest laptop GPUs and, what a surprise, they’re designed largely to assist with AI processing. The RTX 500 and 1000 Ada Generation graphics cards are primarily for thin and light laptops. While they won’t offer as much TOPS AI performance as current higher-end mobile GPUs, they could be a handy option for on-the-go AI processing for the likes of researchers, content creators and video editors. It's worth noting they're workstation GPUs rather than ones designed for gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-ada-ai-workflows/"><ins>NVIDIA says</ins></a> the GPUs, which are based on the Ada Lovelace architecture, offer up to twice the ray-tracing performance of previous-gen GPUs (they employ third-gen ray-tracing cores). Fourth-gen Tensor Cores, meanwhile, deliver up to twice the

## AMD's budget version of the 7900 XT GPU is coming to the US for $549

<p>AMD will start selling the Radeon RX 7900 GRE (Golden Rabbit Edition) graphics card in the US, offering users a detuned version of its 7900 XT flagship for $549. For a savings of around $350 over the latter, it has performance on par with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-review-a-1440p-powerhouse-for-599-160025855.html">NVIDIA's RTX 4070 Super</a> for some games at some settings, according to AMD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It offers impressive specs for that sum, including a Navi 31 XL GPU with 80 compute units (5120 stream processors), 160 AI accelerators and 16GB of GDDR6 memory. That's just a bit less than the 20GB of GDDR6, 96 compute units and 168 AI accelerators in the 7900 XT. With that, it offers 26 to 46 FP32 TFLOPS, a bit lower than the 700 XT's 32 to 51.6 FP32 TFLOPS. However, that means it also consumes less power — 260W TGP compared to the XT's 315W.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since I started testing Bluetooth trackers, they’ve helped me find my keys buried in couch cushions, stopped me from leaving my wallet in a friend’s car and made sure I didn’t forget my bike lock key as I took off on a ride. Through their respective apps, these useful gadgets let you ring your items when they’re nearby and they’ll send you an alert when you’ve strayed too far from them. Larger finding networks rely on signals from other phones to help you locate trackers lost in the community. We’ve tested tags from the most popular brands so you can determine which Bluetooth tracker is best for you.</p>
<h2>What to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device</h2>
<p>Bluetooth trackers are small discs or cards that rely on short-range, low-energy wireless signals to communicate with your smartphone. Attach one to your stuff and, if it’s in range, your phone can “ring” the chip so you can find it. These tracking devices offer other features like separation alerts to tell you wh

<p>After complaints that Google’s image generator built into its Gemini AI was (ugh) woke, Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-explains-why-geminis-image-generation-feature-overcorrected-for-diversity-121532787.html">explained</a> why it may have overcorrected for diversity. Prabhakar Raghavan, the company’s senior vice president for knowledge and information, said Google’s efforts to ensure a wide range of people generated in images “failed to account for cases that should clearly not show a range.”</p>
<p>Users criticized Google for depicting specific white figures or historically white groups of people as racially diverse individuals. In Engadget’s tests, asking Gemini to create illustrations of the Founding Fathers resulted in images of white men with a single person of color or woman among them. When we asked the chatbot to generate images of popes through the ages, we got photos depicting Black women and Native Americans as the leader of the Catholic Church.

<p>After teasing it (again) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-ring-will-officially-make-its-public-debut-this-week-at-mwc-152740877.html">yesterday</a>, Samsung has finally <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/editorial-solving-the-digital-health-dilemma-samsungs-vision-for-an-intelligent-health-platform">shown off</a> the Galaxy Ring in physical form at Mobile World Conference (MWC 2024) and revealed some additional details. The device is of course centered around health and wellness and will come in three colors, platinum silver, gold and ceramic black. It's set to go on sale later this year.</p>
<p>Samsung didn't say much about the Galaxy Ring when it first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-announces-a-render-of-its-new-fitness-device-the-galaxy-ring-192012919.html">displayed a render</a> of the device at Unpacked last month.

<p>Google has announced a slew of <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-february-2024">Android updates</a> to kick off MWC this year, including Gemini integration with Messages and AI-powered text summaries for when you’re driving. As of this week, Messages users will be able to access Google’s chatbot without leaving the texting app. Gemini in Messages can handle basic tasks like drafting messages and helping to plan events, or you can just chat with it if you’re bored. The feature is still in beta, and it’s only available to English-language Messages users for now, Google says.</p>
<p>Android Auto is also getting a boost from AI that could help minimize distractions from people texting you while you’re on the road. If the group chat is blowing up your phone with nonstop messages or if someone is sending you novels of text, Android Auto will automatically summarize the messages and read you its more succinct version. It’ll also suggest replies an

<p>Google Docs is getting an annotation feature that will let you mark up your documents just like you might with a pen and paper. With today’s <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-february-2024">update</a>, announced at MWC 2024, Google Docs users on Android devices can use a finger or stylus to write notes, highlight text and circle words to their heart’s desire. Google says the feature will work on Android tablets and smartphones, so it’s got some real potential to give devices like foldables even more of a productivity boost. It should also make for a smoother way to sign digital documents.</p>
<p>Android users will have access to multiple pen colors and highlighters with the new annotation tool for Google Docs, which is good news for anyone who loves color-coding their notes. If the popularity of digital notebooks like reMarkable’s tablets or Amazon’s Kindle Scribe has taught us anything, it’s that, as speedy as typ

<p>Google is finally giving Android smartwatch owners a feature they’ve been wanting for years: Google Wallet passes. Among its many announcements at MWC, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-february-2024">Google</a> said today that it’s officially bringing boarding passes, event tickets, gym memberships, loyalty cards and other passes that might be stored in your Google Wallet to Wear OS. It’s one area where Wear OS has lagged way behind the Apple Watch, which has long had passes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While some users have sporadically reported seeing the feature pop up over the last month or so, Google is only now confirming its arrival. Any passes you’ve added to Google Wallet will show up with a QR code or barcode on your Wear OS watch with the update, and you can choose to hide whichever ones you don’t need at the moment. Google is also adding the ability to get detailed public transit directions on your watch so you don’t
