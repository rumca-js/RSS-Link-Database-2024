<p>Rosie Jones, Judi Love and Katherine Ryan are the comedy supergroup we didn’t know we needed. But you might want to save this wild panel show for Friday night</p><p></p><p>Out of Order feels like the sort of energetic, Friday night, post-pub series that television commissioners have been trying to claw back since the pre-streaming days, so I’m not sure why it is coming out on a Monday evening, second only to Sunday evening in the gloom stakes. It assembles Rosie Jones, Judi Love and Katherine Ryan, three of the biggest women in British comedy, into a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/02/boygenius-the-record-review-julien-baker-phoebe-bridgers-lucy-dacus">Boygenius</a>-style panel show supergroup.

## The Jury: Murder Trial review – surely this is the end of the UK legal system as we know it

<p>This brilliant reconstruction of a real-life trial lifts the lid on the usually secret deliberation room – and the results are agonisingly close to Big Brother. TV doesn’t get more addictive … or more harrowing</p><p>It’s a premise so simple and so brilliant that you wonder how on earth it hasn’t been done before. Rerun a trial – verbatim, from the records, using actors – in front of another jury, film their usually secret deliberations and see if they come up with the same verdict as the real jury did. That is the premise of Channel 4’s The Jury: Murder Trial, with the added twist that they have not one but two juries attending the same trial, unbeknownst to each other.</p><p>It is absolutely terrifying. You know how they say you should never see how a sausage is made? Well, my friends, better a thousand sausages than any of the workings of this foundational piece of the criminal justice system – the best method of dispensing fairness we have been able to invent, and upon

<p></p><p>Nobody could accuse David Moyes of failing to lay on enough entertainment. Only Brentford, perched precariously above the bottom three after their fifth defeat in six games, had cause for complaint. Thomas Frank will have focused less on West Ham’s creative mojo returning and more on his defence’s meek attempt to deal&nbsp;with a resurgent&nbsp;Jarrod&nbsp;Bowen.</p><p>It promises to be a nervy end to the season if Brentford continue to ship goals at such an alarming rate. West Ham, who delighted in ending <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/17/nottingham-forest-west-ham-match-report">a mini-crisis</a> that had raised questions over Moyes’s future, were rampant. Bowen’s first hat-trick for the club was enough for West Ham to end an eight-match winless run in all competitions and move up to eighth place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/26/west-ham-brentford-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>So heartening, magical and, at times, mesmeric has the Maidstone United story been this season, there is a line of thinking that George Elokobi and his side are to thank for singlehandedly saving the FA Cup, having reminded us of its raw charm. Elokobi is viewed as something of a saviour given Maidstone’s unforgettable ride through seven rounds of this competition but in these parts Coventry have their own untouchable manager in Mark Robins, the man who scored a pivotal goal en route to winning this competition with Manchester United in 1990.</p><p>Robins has steered Coventry through many a storm and here they breezed into the quarter-finals, Ellis Simms scoring a first-half hat-trick before Fábio Tavares capped victory approaching full time with two late goals, halting Maidstone’s incredible charge. Maidstone, the first team from outside the top five divisions to reach this stage since Blyth Spartans in 1978, depart with a rich tapestry of tales to remember.</p> <a href="

<p>Gaza is an issue that Labour cannot simply finesse away. It is about real life, real death and the sympathies of millions</p><p>Amid the fallout from last week’s chaos in the Commons, one question has gone largely unexplored: is Labour out of the woods on Gaza? Despite all efforts to manoeuvre itself into a safer position, the party seems to have only inflamed things further. Its ostensibly successful face-saving amendment to the SNP’s ceasefire motion – and its apparent pressure on the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to upturn parliamentary convention – brought about a crisis in the Commons, and has done little to appease angry voters.</p><p>The resulting waves of claim and toxic counterclaim are still building: Lee Anderson’s outburst of anti-Muslim rhetoric has led to him being stripped of the Tory whip. No matter how much analysis says otherwise, particularly the sort that treats Westminster as a self-contained theatre of political gamesmanship, Labour’s victory was a pyrrhic

<p>Far-right Hindu nationalists are giving women prominence to mobilise others, but regressive patriarchal systems are embedded in their ideology</p><p>It all started in the family WhatsApp group. A member of my extended family posted photos and videos of fireworks with the caption “a very good day” and many smiley emojis. When I asked, “what are we celebrating?” she replied, “the temple in Ayodhya”. It quickly escalated into a heated discussion about the decision to build a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/modi-inaugurates-hindu-temple-on-site-of-razed-mosque-in-india">Hindu temple in place of a mosque </a>that was razed to the ground, and the rise of far-right<strong> </strong>ideology.</p><p>As someone who left India 20 years ago for the UK, I am often seen as an “outsider” who cannot really understand Indian politics. If I comment on the political climate I’m accused of being brainwashed by the foreign media and discriminating against India. But I se

<p>The ex-boss of Classic FM is rebooting the BBC’s venerable home of classical music, with new shows and presenters – including a special slot for ‘perfect fit’ Jools Holland</p><p>The office of the controller of Radio 3, in Old Broadcasting House in London, has one solitary wood-panelled wall, a remnant of a more stately era of the BBC, before the glassy, shimmering heights of New Broadcasting House rose up to overshadow its 1930s predecessor. The current incumbent is Sam Jackson. He is, perhaps, the least suited-and-booted of any of his forerunners – he is wearing jeans, sneakers and a printed blue shirt straight out of the wardrobe of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-3F0j5FIhQ">Simon Harwood, W1A’s director of strategic governance</a>.
