It seems today there is an influx of pro wrestlers making their way into Hollywood.  Whether it's the countless Dwayne Johnson movies, or Dave Bautista attempting to not act like Drax the Destroyer, its seems only one has escaped the type cast of muscle bound action star....AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA!
