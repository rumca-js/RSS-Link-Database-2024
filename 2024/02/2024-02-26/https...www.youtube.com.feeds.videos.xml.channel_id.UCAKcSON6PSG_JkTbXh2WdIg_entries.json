But wherever she is, making music remains the constant. \u201cIt's just what I do,\u201d Wyatt says. \u201cJust writing songs and singing them has proven to be really healing, whether it works out or not, whether it's lucrative or popular or not. It's just important for me to do that.\u201d\n\nDescribed by Pitchfork as one of music\u2019s \u201cmost exciting and skillful storytellers,\u201d Wyatt writes honest lyrics and delivers them with her powerful voice. Her most recent album, \"Feel Good,\" released in November 3, 2023, on @NewWestRecords. Produced by Adrian Quesada of Black Pumas, Feel Good is a genre-spanning collection of songs that contain a delicous Americana gumbo of soul, roots music, and R&amp;B.\n\nBefore Wyatt had to press pause on her tour due to a case of flu, Wyatt and her band visited The Current studio to play a couple songs from \"Feel Good.\" Watch those performances above.\n\nSongs Performed\n0", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/men-mcMgLbI/hqdefault.jpg", "language": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-26T13:00:43+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "tags": [], "dead": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "vote": 0, "age": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "album": "", "page_rating": 0, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=men-mcMgLbI", "artist": "The Current"}]
