Disney Dreamlight Valley's first major content update of 2024 arrives this Wednesday, 28th February, introducing Monsters, Inc.'s Sully and Mike Wazowski to the village - and ahead of its arrival, developer Gameloft has detailed everything this week's free patch will bring.
</p><p>
Mike and Sulley arrive as part of what Gameloft is officially calling the Laugh Floor Update, and both make their Dreamlight Valley debut via a new playable Realm - giving players the chance to experience a day-in-the-life at Monsters, Inc. before the duo become available as villagers - each with their own friendship quests and associated rewards.

Other features coming in this week's Laugh Floor Update, as detailed in Gameloft's <a href="https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/en/news/update-feb-28-2024">newly shared patch notes

Stardew Valley is celebrating its eighth anniversary today (yes, I couldn't believe it either) and developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has marked the occasion by announcing a release date for his beloved farm-life sim's eagerly awaited 1.6 update - which is coming to PC on 19th March, with a console and mobile release to follow "as soon as possible".
</p><p>
Stardew Valley's 1.6 update was revealed to be in the works <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-patch-16-is-on-the-way">back in June 2022</a>, when Barone warned it would be relatively modest in scope and 'mostly modding-focused'. Since then, however, it's ballooned substantially, with Barone so far <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-16-includes-new-late-game-content-and-another-major-festival">confirming</a> it'll bri

Developed in a modified Quake engine with levels designed by contributors to mods like Arcane Dimensions, it looked set to conquer all in its path when it arrived in 2019. Its Early Access showcased amazing weapons, splattering enemies, a knotty, secret-filled hubworld, and maps you'd sell your soul for.</p><p>Then it went back to sleep for five years. In 2021, developer KillPixel admitted the project had been sorely hindered by the Covid 19 pandemic. But the full game would be out in Summer 2022. That became Spring 2023, which then became February 2024. In that time the retro shooter continued to evolve, giving us its Doom (Prodeus), its Duke Nukem (Ion Fury) and its Hexen (AMID EVIL). Al

What the Golf? developer Triband is bringing its absurdist racing game What the Car? to Steam later this year, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-arcade-adds-20-games-including-new-what-the-golf-follow-up">debut last May</a> as an Apple Arcade exclusive.

What the Car? follows in the wonderfully daft footsteps of What the Golf? - and indeed its VR-exclusive baseball-inspired successor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-the-bat-is-the-casual-hit-vr-has-been-waiting-for">What the Bat?</a> - by taking a relatively sensible sport (in this case racing) and sillying it up to the extreme.

If you've long been of the opinion racing games would be a whole lot better if the cars had legs and the racing was spiced up a bit with some cooking, rope jumpinga, CAR-aoke, or even fishing, the

Supermassive Games, the Guildford-based developer behind Until Dawn, The Quarry and the Dark Pictures anthology horror series, has announced job losses "with deep regret". 
</p><p>
The studio confirmed it would shed staff via a <a href="https://twitter.com/SuperMGames/status/1762125258159431750">statement</a> posted to social media platform X, in which it blamed "significant challenges" facing the games industry to which it was not "immune".

A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-26/british-game-maker-supermassive-set-to-lay-off-90-workers">Bloomberg</a> report states around 150 people were told their jobs were at risk this morning, with around 90 staff eventually expected to leave the business following a consultation period.

## AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE review: the most compelling RDNA 3 graphics card yet

Previously available in the Chinese region and selectively to the OEM market elsewhere, the idea is very straightforward. Similar to the well-received RX 7800 XT, AMD readily admits that it lacks the same level of ray tracing performance of its closest Nvidia counterpart, but makes up for it in spades elsewhere. RX 7900 GRE has 16GB of framebuffer memory where the 4070 Super has just 12GB, paired with a 256-bit interface where the Nvidia card has a 192-bit bus. It's also significantly faster in rasterisation.</p><p>In effect, AMD is delivering excellent value for users who still aren't fully buying into the ray tracing dream, or

Fortnite's next big collaboration will be with Avatar: The Last Airbender, the hit anime series that's now a live-action show on Netflix. 
</p><p>
(To be clear, this is nothing to do with James Cameron's blue people.)
</p><p>
Word of the crossover appeared online last night courtesy of prolific Fortnite leaker iFireMonkey, as spotted in the game's code. It looks like Avatar will be Fortnite's next themed event  pass, following the current Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles event.

Nintendo is currently set to launch its under-wraps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> console in March 2025 - but this could be delayed further, a new report has cautioned. 
</p><p>
The fresh report, this time from Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF196OV0Z10C24A2000000/">Nikkei</a>, has further confirmed this month's reports that Switch 2 will now arrive next year, after having previously been set for a late 2024 launch.

"As far as Final Fantasy is concerned, I'm still involved by writing the main themes for the games," he said. "But I don't think I'll compose music for a whole game again.
