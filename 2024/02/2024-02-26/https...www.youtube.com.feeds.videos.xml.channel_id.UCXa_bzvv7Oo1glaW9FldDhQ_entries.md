Not yet confirmed but an absolute certainty is PlayStation’s mid-generation refresh. PS5 Pro will undoubtedly feature performance boosts, shorter loading times, smoother frame rates, higher resolutions, and rumours courtesy of industry analysts are pointing towards a late 2024 release window. 

The question is, do we really need a PS5 Pro? Arguably, developers are still yet to push the base PS5 console to its limits, so what good does a PS5 Pro serve? Well, there’s points for and against outlined in this feature, but no matter what side of the fence you’re on its undeniable Sony – if the rumours of a late 2024 release are true – will be releasing the PS5 Pro at an inopportune time. Principally, no new existing franchise titles until April 2025 is a blow. Sony will need to drum something shiny up to showcase the improved capability of the PS5 Pro.

February is nearly over, but perhaps the biggest surprise is how popular Helldivers 2 has been. From a sequel to a niche but beloved overhead shooter to a popular live service shooter that could barely facilitate player demand, it's gone from strength to strength since its launch.

Perhaps the most impressive part is how developer Arrowhead Game Studios has achieved this despite all odds. Even with other live service titles failing to make an impact at launch, Helldivers 2 continues to see hundreds of thousands of players on PS5 and PC. Even Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer indicated that he wants it on Xbox.

Join us as we chronicle the shooter's rise and how it went from a sudden success story for its developer to one of the most-talked-about games this month.
