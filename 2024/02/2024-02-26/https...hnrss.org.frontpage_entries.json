For example, it allows a programming assistant to use your latest documents to answer questions. The idea is to gather all the relevant information (\"retrieval\") and present it to the LLM with a question (\"augmentation\"). This way, the LLM can provide answers (\u201cgeneration\u201d) as though it was trained directly on your data.<p>The R2R framework is a powerful tool for addressing key challenges in deploying RAG systems, avoiding the complex abstractions common in other projects.

Vacations get rejected because it doesn't follow the rules even if it doesn't make any sense, if an employee doesn't have any tasks to do and wants to take a day off at the end of the week, they can't, it has to be after two weeks. We are being asked to submit 40-hour timesheets every week, no matter what happens, to the point that some employees started lying about the numbers.<p>The world seems to go crazy and it would be nice if some managers noticed that and tried to help the employees through these stressful times, but no, it is like they insist that this capitalist thinking that doesn't make anyone happy should continue
