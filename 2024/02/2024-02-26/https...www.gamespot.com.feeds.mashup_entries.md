<p>Following the box office bomb of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi left Square, as did a few folks who worked with him.

<p>One of the most-quoted lines from 2008's The Dark Knight is "you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain." Director Christopher Nolan has now responded to the fervor of this quote, saying he wants people to know he did not write it and didn't originally understand what it meant.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/02/oppenheimer-christopher-nolan-cillian-murphy-interview-1235829241/">Deadline</a>, Nolan said he feels "plagued" by that line, which was written by his brother, Jonathan Nolan. "It kills me, because it's the line that most resonates.

<p>Helldivers 2 has seen incredible success over the past few weeks, and now that its servers are mostly stable, players are finally free to spread democracy across the galaxy. However, folks on Xbox are left out of the fun, as the cooperative shooter is only available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Helldivers-2-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CJGPSXG4?tag=gamespot-promos-20">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/helldivers-2">PC</a>. It's not clear if Helldivers 2 will ever see the light of day on Xbox Series X, but there are tons of alternatives to check out that offer a similar gameplay loop.
