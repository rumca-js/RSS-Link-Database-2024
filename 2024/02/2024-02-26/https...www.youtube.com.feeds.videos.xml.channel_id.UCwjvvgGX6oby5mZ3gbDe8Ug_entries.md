On February 13, 2024, an emergency notice issued by a local municipality was making bounds on overseas social media platforms. Dated February 11, it "requires the establishment of a daily reporting system for possible social conflicts."
It calls for "focusing on the investigation of risks and potential hazards that may lead to extreme cases." It names 16 categories of people to be screened. They are individuals who are involved in real estate, have medical problems, face labor disputes, and face marital and neighborhood disputes; people who experience petition and appeal, investment failure, and unemployment; people who are disillusioned with their lives, under emotional distress, or having relationship problems; people who are out of sorts or mentally ill; delinquent teenagers; people who have a violent tendency, who threaten to take revenge on the society, and those who may provoke violent conflicts, etc.
