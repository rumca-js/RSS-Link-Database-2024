<p>The next Nintendo Direct is scheduled for this Wednesday, the company just announced. It's being billed as a "partner showcase," with Nintendo saying it'll show off Switch games coming in the first half of this year from "our publishing and development partners." It'll kick off on February 21, bright and early at 9AM ET.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Nintendo holds these showcases on a regular basis, this one is potentially more significant than usual. Last week, Microsoft <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-confirms-four-of-its-games-are-coming-to-more-popular-consoles-201419203.html">made an expected but still surprising announcement</a> that it would begin bringing some of its titles to "other consoles," a phrase that's hard not to interpret as games coming to the Switch (and Sony's PlayStation 5 as well).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Biden administration is granting $1.5 billion in funding to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/globalfoundries/"><ins>GlobalFoundries</ins></a> to bolster semiconductor production under the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/chips-act/"><ins>CHIPS Act</ins></a>.

<p>First, GlobalFoundries will build a new fabrication facility in Malta, New York, where it aims to produce "high value technologies not currently available in the US," the Department of Commerce said in a statement. <a href="https://gf.com/gf-press-release/globalfoundries-and-biden-harris-administration-announce-chips-and-science-act-funding-for-essential-chip-manufacturing/"><ins>GlobalFoundries says</ins></a> it will use the facility to build chips for a range of industries and applications, including the automotive, aerospace, defense

<p>It’s rarely a bad idea to have an extra controller on hand. Being able to switch to another gamepad when the battery runs out is always welcome, and you don't want to be caught short when a buddy wants to hop into a local multiplayer game with you. Being able to toss an extra controller and a phone clip into your bag for cloud gaming is useful too. So you may be pleased to find out that the official <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwODhHSlI0QjkvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC12LTV3LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzOGE0ZWI1Ni02NTMxLTQxZDUtYTA5Yi02NThjYWRjMDdhNjcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVWSiHa7-a9HJ6Umym6MFOMCqbtSBX6nQ1YV4HDFFdA3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB088GJR4B9%2F"><ins>Xbox Wir

<p>Mobile phone ownership has become standard for people of most ages, and, while there's a convenience argument, experts and regulators alike have expressed concerns about children's well-being and distraction while learning. To that end, the UK government has become the latest to announce <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-launches-crackdown-on-mobile-phones-in-schools">guidance for banning the use of phones during school</a>. It follows other European countries like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-01-france-bans-smartphones-schools.html">France</a> and Italy, which prohibit phones in classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some schools in the UK already have no-phone policies in place, but these guidelines could bring widespread adoption and uniformity. &quot;This is about achieving clarity and consistency in practice, backing headteachers and leaders and giving staff confidence to act,&quot; Gillian Keegan, the UK's secretary of state for education, said in

<p>TikTok is in the EU's crosshairs over potential <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">Digital Services Act</a> (DSA) breaches around the safety of minors and other matters. The formal proceedings will focus on addictive algorithms, the &quot;rabbit hole effect,&quot; age verification issues and default privacy settings. The European Commission is also probing ad transparency and data access for researchers, it said in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_926">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The probe is focusing on the privacy and safety of minors. The Commission will look at the potentially negative aspects of TikTok's design and algorithms, including addictive behavior and &quot;rabbit hole effects&quot; that can lead to harmful content.

<p>We use passwords for everything. From our bank accounts to free social media sites, our password footprints spread all over our digital landscape. But that means if you’re reusing the same ones over and over again, you’re opening yourself up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-lastpass-hack-was-worse-than-the-company-first-reported-000501559.html">hackers</a> potentially finding one in a leak and getting into your most sensitive accounts. That’s where password managers come in. They store all your credentials in one place, taking the burden off of you to remember them all, and even offer stronger password options to help prevent reuse in the future. Yet, it’s a confusing space filled with extra features and security gaps that can make it hard to navigate. We tested out nine of the best password managers available now to help you choose the right one for your needs. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=29d07367-7ffa-4e05-9a7f-c

<p>After letting rival camera companies catch up for the last few years, Sony laid down a gauntlet with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-sony-a9-iii-is-the-fastest-full-frame-camera-ever-thanks-to-a-global-stacked-sensor-175522418.html">24.6-megapixel A9 III</a>. It’s the world’s first mirrorless camera with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-29-panasonic-8k-organic-sensor-global-shutter.html">global shutter</a>, a much-awaited holy grail feature. It completely eliminates rolling shutter distortion found on CMOS cameras by reading the entire sensor at once. It also boosts speed and removes the need for a mechanical shutter.</p>
<p>As a pioneering product, it’s not cheap at $6,000, but you can expect the technology to come down in price in the future. And there is a downside: Image quality is reduced compared to regular cameras, due to the nature of a global shutter.</p>

<p>NASA wants volunteers for its second year-long simulated Mars mission, the Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog (CHAPEA 2). For the mission’s duration, starting spring 2025, the four selected crew members will live in a 1,700-square-foot 3D-printed habitat in Houston. It’s paid, but we don’t know how much. At least living costs will be nil.</p>
<p>The Mars Dune Alpha habitat at NASA’s Johnson Space Center simulates life for future explorers on the red planet, where the environment is harsh and resources limited.</p>
<p>Applicants must be US citizens aged 30 to 55, speak English proficiently and have a master’s degree in a STEM field, plus at least two years of professional experience, a minimum of one thousand hours piloting an aircraft. Or two years of work toward a STEM doctoral program.</p>
<p>I barely qualify for two of those requirements — good luck to the rest of you.</p>

<p>Nintendo's &quot;Switch 2&quot; was widely expected to arrive sometime this year, but a new rumor is putting that timeline into question. Now, the company is telling publishers that the next-gen console is slated for release in the first quarter of 2025, according to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-could-now-launch-in-2025-its-claimed/"><em>VGC</em></a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> and other sources. That would line up with the release of the original Switch, which was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-20-switch-is-nintendos-next-game-console.html">announced in October 2016</a> but came out in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-02-nintendo-switch-day-one-patch.html">March 2017</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Publishers were reportedly briefed recently on the launch date change from late 2024 to early 2025. Several sources said they were working on Switch 2
