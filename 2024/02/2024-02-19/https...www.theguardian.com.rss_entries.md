<p>The headline act at London fashion week sees designer Daniel Lee aiming for a mix of style, comfort and warmth</p><p>As the UK’s only substantial luxury player, Burberry is the undisputed headline act of London fashion week. The football pitch-sized eight-mast tent that the brand spent two weeks erecting in east London’s Victoria Park is to London fashion week what the Pyramid stage is to Glastonbury.</p><p>The pressure on 38-year-old Bradford-born designer Daniel Lee is intense.

But, having seen half a dozen productions, I would suggest that it works best when you realise that, within a classical structure, it contains all the anguish of family life. You could argue that O’Neill’s characters are exceptional: the father is a miserly actor who has wasted his potential, his wife is a morp

Western officials have estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have died in the conflict, which has evolved into what experts call the world's first full-scale drone war, with hundreds of drones firing explosives every day. But in the past 12 months, the frontline has barely moved and some say a stalemate has been reached.

Much has been rightly made of their forward players but Gareth Taylor’s side demonstrated how mature and resilient they have become. Whether it was Yui Hasegawa’s calm presence in front of the back four, Laura Coombs’ consistency, the strength of the ever-developing centre-back partnership between Alex Greenwood and Laia Aleixandri or the emergence of Jess Park, it was a display that emphasised their position as title contenders. It wasn’t always pretty and they had to dig deep as Chelsea dominated the ball and pushed them back in the second half, but confidence is a powerful tool and once they had their no

<p>NHS midwifery is in crisis and unmedicated birth in vogue, but doing it at home without medical support is simply dangerous</p><p>“Could you do a poo like this?” There’s a sentence I will never forget. I was in my second trimester and doing a hypnobirthing course.

Amiable but downtrodden waitress Ana (Nina Bergman) has her bacon saved by chance diner David (Allen Leech) when her abusive husband Vincent (Yan Tual) comes calling. Eerily calm in the face of having his dessert desecrated and a potential shanking, David drives off unharmed.

<p>Minestra maritata is a juicy marriage of many pork cuts and vegetables –&nbsp;think of it as stovetop polygamy</p><p>The principle of <em>minestra maritata</em> is simple: various cuts of pork are simmered in water to make a broth, which is then strained and used to cook a large quantity of mixed greens, before the boiled meat is returned to the pot and the dish is finished with cheese. The name comes from the idea that the vegetables and the meat <em>si maritano</em> (get married). It’s a bit of stovetop polygamy, because all of those involved contribute to the flavour of this brothy, deeply tasty soup that’s traditionally served at Christmas or Easter, and on most days at Hosteria il Brigante in Salerno, which is run by a man who used to be a dentist and where I first tasted it.</p><p>As well as the excellent memory of dark greens and bits of pork in a slightly gelatinous broth, and red wine, my starting point was Jeanne Caròla Francesconi’s magnificent <a href="https://

<p>When fugitives from a tyrannical future US take cover in a mysterious building, you might expect more thrills than are on offer here</p><p>Bo Mirhosseni’s dystopian horror drama opens with a onscreen text explainer, detailing how in the year 2045 the US became the North American Federation, a fascist state patrolled by roving militia in the name of God and country. There must’ve been some debate among the film-makers over how far into the future the ominous date should be but the vision of the US presented in History of Evil doesn’t feel two decades away. In the film’s first scene, a child is transported in a van through a checkpoint with a tracking device on her ankle, which is inspected by armed men. It’s horrific of course, but the bar is different for dystopian fiction in 2024. The US, after all, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/us/border-migrant-children-cages-ursula-warehouse.html">cramming migrant children into freezing, overcrowded cages</a> to sleep

<p>He penned the hymn Jerusalem and barely left London in his lifetime but, as a new exhibition shows, Blake wasn’t immune to the creative revolution sweeping through the continent</p><p>The idea of William Blake as a figure representing an aspect of Britishness, or more specifically Englishness, is a well-established one. His poems – The Tyger, London and many others – are fixtures of school syllabuses; his brand of fervent spirituality casts him in a line of free-thinking visionary eccentrics (a&nbsp;view not harmed by his keenness for&nbsp;nudity and belief in the powers of&nbsp;sexual liberation); but most of all it is his words for the hymn Jerusalem that have cemented what has become a determinedly Anglocentric, if also idiosyncratic, reputation.</p><p>“Jerusalem as a kind of unofficial national anthem is the usual way into&nbsp;Blake,” says Esther Chadwick, co-curator with David Bindman of William Blake’s Universe, a new exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridg

<p>Has anyone behind ACE’s ban on ‘political statements’ been to Unravel? As this tumultuous show about textile art proves, even a quilt can tell a story of outrage, exploitation and horror</p><p>At first glance, an artwork might not appear outwardly political. Yet it is not enough to see it for aesthetic purposes only. Art requires us to pay attention, to question – and appreciate – what we are looking at, but also to see what lies beyond it. Take textiles, an art form historically deemed as “decorative” by the establishment, because of its association with women’s work. But what this categorisation actually reveals is a deep political subtext – the struggle for women’s rights of the last 500 years.</p><p>Relegated from the high arts in the Renaissance, the lowly status of textiles was cemented by the Royal Academy in 1769, when the newly founded society banned embroidery from its exhibitions. This influenced women to reject the medium if they wanted to be taken seriously as

<p>Cosmin Gârleșteanu has been documenting Bucharest over the past decade. He was born there in August 1984 and studied at the Academy for Economic Studies, but his passion for music drove him to a different kind of job, in radio. Nowadays he works as a video editor in television. Photography has always been among his passions, due to the feeling of freedom it gives him. He has exhibited at street photography festivals in London, Miami and Brussels. His work is a celebration of the ever-changing landscape of Bucharest, a testament to its resilience and adaptability</p><p></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2024/feb/19/cosmin-garlesteanus-bucharest-street-photography">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh</strong><br />David Greig’s entertaining and immaculately performed new play is about adults seduced by memories of their own emotionally heightened teenage pasts</p><p>Two Sisters smells like teen spirit. Before the three leads come on in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/davidgreig">David Greig</a>’s entertaining new play, the stage is filled with youth-theatre actors. They look like a nice bunch: a little surly perhaps, prone to whispering, plotting and occasional recklessness as they hang out on the climbing frame and beach wall of Lisbeth Burian’s sea-view set, but generally good natured.</p><p>Addressing the audience directly, they ask us to recall our own 16-year-old selves; our enthusiasms, our crushes and our summer soundtracks. Amusingly they incorporate our pre-show questionnaire responses into the script: no two performances are the same, though the memories of exuberance, vulnerability and hormones will surely be simila

He talks about coming to terms with depression, fear of failure – and loving Mumford &amp; Sons</p><p>At the Grammys the other week, Noah Kahan looked around – at Beyoncé, at Taylor Swift – and thought: “No one’s going to tell me that I belong here.” Never mind that he had been nominated for best new artist, or that his album was riding high in the US and UK charts. The impostor syndrome was strong.</p><p>He took his mother, who had a wonderful time. “I was sitting by myself, like: ‘Whoa, I am the least cool guy at the party right now.’ My mom is killing it, everyone around me is killing it. It played into this idea that I have about myself – which isn’t healthy – that I don’t belong.” He smiles. “I could have gotten up and said hello to somebody – it’s my own making.” Sitting on a sofa at his record label’s office in London, he
