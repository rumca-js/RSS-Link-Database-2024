  <p id="0S6d3W">Porsche announced two new plug-in hybrid Panameras, as the German automakers looks to hedge its bets by offering a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/13/23637493/porsche-electric-suv-cayenne-ev-2024-macan-718-earnings">broader set of electrified options</a>. </p>
<p id="4t4iFO">Late last year, Porsche unveiled the third generation Panamera, which included the Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid as the first of four Panamera E-Hybrid models that will eventually be offered. Today, the automaker is adding two more: the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid and the Panamera 4S E-Hybrid. The fourth model will be announced at a later date.</p>

  <p id="OTwgx1">Getting water on phones happens to the best of us. Lucky for us, there’s one household staple the internet consistently suggests will draw that liquid out and save phones: uncooked rice. But contrary to popular advice, Apple, like most people in tech support, explicitly advises <em>against </em>putting your wet phone in a bag of rice. </p>
<p id="HBuoyz">“Don’t put your iPhone in a bag of rice. Doing so could allow small particles of rice to damage your iPhone,” <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102643">Apple support documents</a> said.</p>

  <p id="R6FRtx">Wyze’s problems with letting its security camera customers briefly see into other customer homes is a lot worse than we thought. </p>
<p id="nDcDvK">Last week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075369/wyze-security-camera-stranger-feeds-glitch">co-founder David Crosby said</a> that “so far” the company had identified 14 people who were able to briefly see into a stranger’s property because they were shown an image from someone else’s Wyze camera. Now we’re being told that number of affected customers has ballooned to 13,000.</p>
<p id="ulE1y7">The revelation came from an email sent to customers entitled “An Important Security Message from Wyze,” in which the com

  <p id="E9J1q7">Slowly but surely, Apple TV Plus has morphed itself into arguably the premier destination for streaming science fiction. (Or at least streaming sci-fi not named <em>Star Wars</em> or <em>Star Trek</em>.)
