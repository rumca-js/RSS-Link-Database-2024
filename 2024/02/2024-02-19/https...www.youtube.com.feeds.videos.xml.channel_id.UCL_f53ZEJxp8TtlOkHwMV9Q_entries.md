Dr. Jordan Peterson speaks with nuclear fusion expert Dr. Dennis Whyte. They walk through how fusion differs from fission, the harnessable energy found at the center of the sun, how to recreate it on earth, the fourth state of matter known as plasma, and facing the consequences of technology while acknowledging that we must push forward.

Dennis Whyte is the Hitachi America Professor of Engineering, and prior director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center at MIT (He stepped down in November 2023). Whyte is considered a leader and innovator in fusion research, and currently leads the project SPARC - a compact, high-field, net fusion energy fusion device.
