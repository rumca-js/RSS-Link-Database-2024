<p>The manner of his arrival as Crystal Palace manager was unfortunate, to put it mildly, but Oliver Glasner will have drawn encouragement from his first view of Roy Hodgson’s former team as they earned a valuable draw at fellow strugglers Everton at Goodison Park. The point and the performance was of far more help to the visitors than Sean Dyche’s toiling team.</p><p>Jordan Ayew swept Palace into a fine lead in front of the former Eintracht Frankfurt head coach but a late header from Everton substitute Amadou Onana salvaged a point for the badly out-of-form hosts. The point took Everton out of the relegation zone on goal difference from Luton Town, who have played a game fewer, but they will need a vast improvement to stay out of it regardless of the outcome of their appeal against a 10-point deduction.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/19/everton-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Habituation is a key component of human nature, and knowing how to manipulate it can make the things you enjoy even better</p><p><strong><br /></strong>Imagine you’re out for dinner at your favourite restaurant and the waiter seats you at the best table. It is nice and quiet, so you can have a pleasant conversation with your partner. The table is also right next to a window with great views. You drink your wine and enjoy some delicious food. The dinner lasts a couple of hours. Do you think you’d enjoy the evening more if you sat at the nice table the whole time, or if you were occasionally sent to the back of the restaurant where it was crowded and noisy?</p><p>“Well, that’s a stupid question,” you’re probably thinking. Who would want to go somewhere rowdy if they had a lovely spot exactly where they were? That’s certainly what intuition suggests. But it’s wrong. Studies show that people enjoy good things in life (like listening to music or getting a relaxing massage) more

<p>Erling Haaland had an off-day in front of goal while Liverpool and Arsenal’s attacking units kept firing</p><p>Erling Haaland had nine shots and failed to score a single goal against Chelsea. It will get many people supremely worked up, so they can knock down one of the best strikers in the world. Has Haaland lost his powers? No, he’s just had an underwhelming game. There were a couple of poor finishes, a fine save and a few last-ditch blocks to prevent Haaland adding to his 16 Premier League goals this term. How will Haaland recover from this heinous 90-minute slump? Probably by taking his frustration out against Brentford on Tuesday where he should get a similar number of chances. He is the top scorer in the league for a reason and has the best goal-to-game ratio around, so there’s little need to be too harsh. Annoyance might have taken hold on Saturday but Haaland knows how to harness that. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguar

You’re right, perfume molecules don’t “cling” to dry skin as well as they do to oilier skin. But you can moisturise the area with an unscented lotion (so it doesn’t fight the perfume for attention) or use a little Vaseline on your wrists and behind the ears before you spritz, to lock the scent in for longer.</p><p>Perfumes evolve throughout the day. Top notes have a maximum of 15 minutes before they disappear, leaving behind the scent of the middle notes. Around six hours later you’re left with those warmer, deeper base notes, but by this point you’ll also be used to the smell of the fragrance, so you won’t register it as much, but others will.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/19/i-have-dry-skin-how-do-i-make-perfumes-last-on-me">Continue reading...</a>
