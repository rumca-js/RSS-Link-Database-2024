The English language is famous for the large number of words that express the idea of being drunk in a humorous way—so-called drunkonyms like "pissed," "hammered" or "wasted." British comedian Michael McIntyre even argues in a comedy routine that posh people can use any word to mean "drunk" in English, e.g., "I was utterly gazeboed" or "I'm gonna get totally carparked." With the myriad of possibilities, how can people understand new drunkonyms then?

Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are filaments of intense moisture transport in the atmosphere. These weather systems drive a large fraction of the extreme precipitation events over coastal regions. Detecting ARs in satellite observations has long been a challenging task due to the lack of wind information. In a study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, scientists derived an approximation of the 3-dimensional (3D) wind field based on the spatial distribution of the satellite-based temperature.

Uncovering the biochemical mechanisms underlying different types of cell death has the potential to provide targets for the treatment of various diseases. A physiological cytokine combination (TNF+IFNγ) has been identified that induces cell death in several cell lines in vitro. However, because TNF and IFNγ are multi-effector cytokines, their individual and combined use has complex effects. In disease situations, it is difficult to distinguish which effects are triggered by TNF+IFNγ cell death.

But making the transition to greater use of renewable energies, such as solar, is being hampered by a number of factors. Chief among them is corruption, which is affecting the quality of institutions.

Wheat, a globally important food crop, derives its yield from factors such as number of spikes per unit area, thousand-grain weight and grain yield per spike. Spike shape directly affects spikelet number, grain yield, and overall wheat productivity. Uncovering the key regulators of wheat spike development and investigating their molecular mechanisms holds great promise for precision breeding and molecular improvement of spike morphology.

They found that a combination of macroscopic and microscopic traces can tell us how stone edges were used. Their criteria help separate tools used for wood-felling from other activities. In addition, dated stone edges may be used to identify when timber use began for early humans.
