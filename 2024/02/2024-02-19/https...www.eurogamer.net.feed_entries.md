The bottom line looks stark and very straightforward: the audience for PlayStation and Xbox consoles is not increasing gen-on-gen, while the costs of making games to service that audience is increasing dramatically. Something has to change. </p><p>Let's deal with the Xbox business update first. My take on this is that Phil Spencer and his team really <em>want</em> to take a multi-platform strategy forward, and it's the obvious, logical solution to addressing the problem of the limit in total addressable audience. Not only that, with its owners

## Baldur's Gate 3 developers use award show win to address state of the industry

Baldur's Gate 3 won Game of the Year at the DICE Awards last week, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-will-never-represent-our-industry-in-the-way-it-needs-so-what-next">unlike at The Game Awards</a>, the developers were actually allowed to take some time with their acceptance speech. And let it be known, Larian used that time wisely, addressing both the current state of the industry and the importance of player experience. 
</p><p>
When Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse took to the stage, he acknowledged that while this is a "really human industry" it can also be very "bad sometimes at showing developers what they're worth". He then discussed the wave of layoffs that have affected so many people and game development studios over the past year.

Since then, we have seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-lara-croft-mixes-classic-and-reboot-tomb-raider-designs">Lara Croft pop up in Call of Duty</a> with a design which mixed that 'Classic Lara' look of old, including her dual pistols, tank top and braid, alongside elements from the more recent rebooted games. A subsequent image shared on the Tomb Raider website earlier this month also gave us another look at a unified Lara (see header image above).</p><p>But while we have a pretty good idea of how

Capcom has shared a post to celebrate the eighth anniversary of Street Fighter 5, where it apologised for the game's original state at launch.
</p><p>
"From the beginning to the middle of the release, there were network issues, lack of content, etc... We are truly sorry for the content that did not meet the expectations of many of you," Capcom's Japanese Street Fighter social media account shared over the weekend. 
</p><p>
This is something we touched on in our own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-5-review">Street Fighter 5 review from 2016</a>. As we said at the time: "Street Fighter 5's brilliant combat is let down by a barebones launch and server troubles."

Nintendo shares have dropped slightly from a record high last week, following reports the company has internally delayed its expected <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> release window into 2025.
</p><p>
Eurogamer reported last Friday that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">Nintendo was now looking to launch Switch 2 in early 2025</a>, a change from previous, unannounced plans that had the new console pegged for later this year. Sources with knowledge of the delay told us it was designed to ensure the strongest possible line-up of launch games.

And, of course, he brought some nu metal energy with him, as he only spoke in lyrics from the band's discography. All very standard modding community stuff.</p><p>However, the mod had a very short shelf-life on Nexus Mods when it was first released around seven years ago, and there was very little evidence of it left online - an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FalloutMods/comments/53ku8n/fnv_limp_bizkits_in_the_house_yall_fred_durst/">old Reddit post</a> and YouTube video (which you can see below), were about all that remained.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-new-vegas-missing-limp-bizkit-mod-rediscovered?utm_sourc

## Helldivers 2 continues to dominate Steam, beats GTA5, Destiny 2 all-time player peaks

PlayStation-published Helldivers 2 had a hugely successful weekend on Steam, despite some continuing server issues, with a fresh player peak of 409,367 users yesterday. 
</p><p>
That's a new record for Helldivers 2, according to official <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?compare=553850&amp;select=1">Steam</a> figures, and puts the game's all-time player peak  higher than Steam stalwarts such as GTA5, Rust and Destiny 2. 
</p><p>
To say that Helldivers has been a hit on PC would be something of an understatement, especially in comparison to the middling popularity of some other PlayStation PC launches.

The Convergence mod for Elden Ring is out now, offering an "exhaustive overhaul" of the game.
</p><p>
Available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/3419?tab=description">NexusMods</a>, The Convergence makes major changes from the very beginning of the game. Now players will need to choose from one of 27 new classes - each with its own unique progression path - that will determine the player's starting location in the world.

</p><p>
The original game features 10 classes, but these are starting points from which the player has freedom to develop in any direction. The Convergence, then, has a more formal structure for players to follow that cements typical builds.

The upcoming return of Crazy Taxi will be a "AAA" game, Sega has said. 
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-offers-first-details-on-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-revivals">Sega first announced it was making a long-awaited new Crazy Taxi</a> title in December last year, as part of a new wave of entries in many of its classic series.
</p><p>
Now, a <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2024/02/17/digital/sega-sapporo-studio-games/">Japan Times</a> interview has shed more light on its scope, and revealed it is being worked on in part by Sega's relatively new Sapporo Studio, which was founded in the capital of Japan's Hokkaido prefecture in December 2021.

The formula hasn't really changed since the 1999 original - terrorists and counter-terrorists sparring to eliminate the other side or plant/defuse a bomb at one of two designated locations - but Valve's 2023 release runs better on modern hardware than 2012's Global Offensive and offers sparingly more gameplay possibilities too. Fundamentally though, the core combination of tactical, round-based 5v5 competition and satisfyingly difficult shooting mechanics remain as enrapturing and enraging as ever.</p><p>Competitive play is at the heart of the game, even more so than in CS:GO, with the Premier ranked mode taking centre stage. Here, solo and grouped players are placed into teams of five, go through a map veto process to select the stage and starting sides, then compete in a
