<p>In Daniel Polansky&#8216;s The Builders, the Captain is getting his crew back together for another tilt at the job they failed to complete ten years ago during the war of two brothers. The last time they were betrayed. This time, he’s going to find out who did it, and finish the job. In this magnificent Tor.com novella, Polansky delivers an almost perfectly paced and weighted story that every grimdark and dark fantasy fan needs to pick up. Set in the The Gardens, and seen through the eyes of a series of animals, each more vicious than the last, The Builders is The Magnificent Seven set in a fantasy world. The Captain, an angry, bitter Mouse with a face of granite, wants revenge and calls his crew together at Reconquista&#8217;s bar, a tavern owner who followed the Captain into battle last time and now has had half of his body replaced with machines to keep him alive and moving. Bonsoir the Stout is a heartless, soundless killer with a savage sense of loyalty to the Captain
