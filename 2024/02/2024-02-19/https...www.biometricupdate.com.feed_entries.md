		Facial recognition and its use by U.S. federal agencies is becoming a new target of investigation for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.

Its main task will be to examine how agencies such as the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are using the technology.

The Commission’s first step in this direction is a briefing on the civil rights implications of facial recognition which will invite government officials, researchers, legal experts and software developers. The briefing is <a href="https://www.usccr.gov/meetings/2024/03-08-civil-rights-implications-federal-use-facial-recognition-technology">scheduled</a> for March 8th, 2024.

		The tug-of-war between legislators aiming to protect kids under 13 and activists who say their efforts curb freedoms could soon see the balance shift decidedly in favor of the law, as U.S. senators announced they had finally secured more than 60 backers for the major changes tabled in the <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/21424kosabilltext.pdf">Kids Online Safety Act</a> (KOSA).

		The UK government has updated guidelines for employers for Right to Work digital identity checks, clarifying details on using digital identity service providers (IDSPs).

Since April 2022, IDSPs have been allowed to offer additional checks aside from the standard checks for passports and some ID cards held by British and Irish workers. One of the main difficulties of this arrangement, however, was that employers had no protection, <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/uk-employers-issued-update-right-to-work-check-requirements">explains</a> Shara Pledger, senior associate at Pinsent Masons law firm.

		The Cameroon country representative of the United Nations Children’s Fund (<a href="https://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a>), Nadine Perault, has held talks with Decentralization and Local Development Minister on building a stronger partnership for the issuance of birth certificates.

This was the main item on the agenda when the UN official met Georges Elanga Obam recently at the ministry in Yaounde. The UN agency official said they talked about how to build up synergy with government and other ecosystem partners in order to increase the number of children who possess the foundational identity credential.

Birth registration and birth certificate issuance rates remain pretty low in Cameroon, more so in remote and somewhat neglected parts of the country suc

		India is facing a proliferation of deepfakes that could spread misinformation during elections. More importantly for the biometrics industry, deepfakes could pose a major challenge for user verification, including video KYC, a new report from tech-focused media outlet Medianama warns.

The <a href="https://www.medianama.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Event-report-Deep-Fakes-and-Democracy-2024-1.pdf?mc_cid=2f52df7e3e&amp;mc_eid=3b79aa821a">report</a> drew its conclusions from a discussion on “Deep Fakes and Democracy” conducted by MediaNama on January 17 with support from Meta and Google. The debate centered on strategies to curb the dissemination of deepfakes and included speakers from India’s technology sector.

		The Kenya office of global rights advocacy organization, Amnesty International, has issued an advisory policy paper outlining what the country must do in order to balance its digital ID and digital government efforts with respect for fundamental human rights.

The policy advisory, detailed in a <a href="https://www.amnestykenya.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Digital-ID-in-Kenya-FINAL-POLICY-PAPER_Print.pdf">44-page publication</a> released in January, was drafted in collaboration with Nairobi-based Strathmore University and the Centre for Intellectual Property Information and Technology Law, a research and training center under the university.

		The Australian government is working on expanding the national digital ID system to include more digital ID providers – and making it safer.

Legislators are currently working on the Digital ID Bill to ensure the digital ID system is consistent by establishing an Accreditation Scheme that will help companies and businesses provide digital ID services.

“The Bill will require Digital ID providers to meet high standards of security, privacy protection and fraud controls to be accredited. This means greater consumer protection,” says First Assistant Secretary from the Department of Finance, John Shepherd.

Australia’s Parliament introduced the Digital ID in late 2023, paving the way for the rollout of the nationwide digital ID system which has been <a href=
