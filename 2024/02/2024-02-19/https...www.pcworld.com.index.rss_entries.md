## It’s time to upgrade OneDrive’s paid storage, Microsoft

<p>It&rsquo;s been literally a decade since Microsoft raised the cap on its paid Microsoft 365 storage plans to 1 terabyte of OneDrive cloud storage. It&rsquo;s time for an upgrade, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>



<p>Last week, Google <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2230933/google-bard-ai-is-officially-gemini-unofficially-irrelevant.html">changed its name of its Bard AI assistant to Gemini</a>, launched Gemini Advanced, and &mdash; in the most important change of all &mdash; made 2TB of cloud storage the foundation for its new premium pricing tier. Okay, that last point is a lie. Because Google offered a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/401942/google-one-subscription-price-features.html">free upgrade to its Google One plan six years ago</a>, granting 2TB of cloud storage for $9.99 per month &mdash; the same price as Microsoft charges for 1TB

<p>Time and time again, there are reports of a new company that has suffered a computer breach where hackers have obtained user account information. Databases containing millions of login details are openly circulating on the internet and show the extent of the problem. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how long your password is if the company doesn&rsquo;t protect it.</p>



<p>Moreover, most people today have not just a few but tens or hundreds of accounts on different websites. Some may not be that important, but many are. Either by their nature, like email and social media, or because of what they contain and their sentimental value to you. Imagine you&rsquo;ve spent 20,000 hours on an online role-playing game and suddenly hackers get in, change your password and email address and rename your character &ldquo;Same password everywhere.&rdquo; Bummer.</p>
