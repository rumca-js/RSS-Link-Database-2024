								<p>Games Workshop just dropped the first CGI trailer for upcoming Warhammer Plus show Broken Lance, and all I can think is &ldquo;this is the intro to a 90s RTS game from another dimension&rdquo;. Showing Imperial Knights clashing with the forces of Chaos, the animation is weightless and lethargic in a way that I absolutely love. &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/warhammer-40k/warhammer-plus-broken-lance-90s-rts-cinematic">Continued</a></p>

								<p>There are quite a few seriously <strong>rare Pokémon cards</strong> out there, and they can get staggeringly expensive. While you might love playing the Pokémon TCG for its snazzy card battles, some Pokémon cards are so scarce, so legendary that they can fetch lifechanging sums at auction.</p>
