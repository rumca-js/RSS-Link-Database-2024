		A vendor-funded survey of UK adults finds many of them are cavalier about ID verification online. One-third, in fact know their ID-sharing practices are dangerous and continue regardless.

Biometric identity verification provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idnow">IDnow</a> says its report found that scans and photos of ID cards and passports are being shared by 33 percent of residents in social media, via email and through other insecure online services.

Fraudsters are adept at plucking the communications, which, or course, typically carry biometric identifiers. (The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/uk-fraud-awareness-report-2024/">survey</a> of 2,264 people was conducted

		<a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> is marketing Sora, its new text-to-video model, while withholding it from the public while it gets some red-team attention, or harms evaluation.

But it almost seems that an AI product evaluation can’t be completed before there is another major advance in AI capability and quality. And that is not a comfortable thought for people (and AI algorithms?) racing to create deepfake detectors.

		The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) decided to suspend the<a href="https://www.nadra.gov.pk/nadra-launches-registration-campaign-for-transgender-persons/"> "X" category</a> Computerized National Identity Cards (CNICs) after receiving a letter from a<a href="http://www.federalshariatcourt.gov.pk/en/home/"> Federal Shariat Court</a> in 2023, which has resulted in a worrying wave of exclusion for the transgender population in Pakistan. This decision came about after the country's elections earlier in February. This action severely hampers the participation of transgender people in the political process.

Since NADRA’s founding in 2000, Pakistan's identity documents and citizen registration have changed dramatically, thanks to the organization

		Unease with business use of biometrics data appears to be settling in for U.S. consumers.

Marketing statistics <a href="https://www.getapp.com/resources/biometric-technology-challenges/">published</a> by GetApp, a business software marketplace, indicate that whatever shine that touch-free biometrics got during the pandemic is fading.

The company compared concerns that people reported with biometrics as a concept in this report and one published in 2022, and the market appears to be edgier.

Worries rose marketed in five listed areas: data misuse, breaches, ID theft, privacy and accuracy.

Thirty-eight percent of people responding to a survey worried about biometrics’ accuracy in 2022 compared to 63 percent this year.

The smallest gap was about loss of privacy.

In cybersecurity, where the battle between defenders and attackers is relentless, the emergence of deepfake technology has ushered in a new era of deception and sophistication. The recent $25 million deepfake heist targeting a finance professional at a multinational corporation in Hong Kong serves as a chilling reminder of the escalating threat that artificial intelligence-generated deception poses to organizations worldwide.
