Last Epoch was originally released as an early access title in 2019. Spending almost half a decade in development, the game is finally out of early access, and the amount of work the studio has put into the title is quite evident. The unique things about Last Epoch revolve around how it offers character customization through the use of individual skill trees for each skill, and the excellent dungeons.

Last Epoch players will find plenty of unique ways to play any given class and sub-class, owing in large part to its bespoke skill trees for individual abilities.

With older classics like Dead or Alive and Ninja Gaiden and more recent success stories like Nioh and Wo Long, Team Ninja is a developer that has consistently moved from strength to strength in nearly every new thing it has attempted, and with its next game, the illustrious studio is set to take another giant leap forward. 

Action RPG Rise of the Ronin is going to be Team Ninja’s first open world game ever, and there’s plenty about it that has caught our eye. Whether it’s its historical setting and its grounded aesthetic you’re talking about, it’s authentic depiction of 19th century Japan in an immersive world, or its promise of tight and unique combat and traversal mechanics, Rise of the Ronin seems to have more than just a few things going for it. 

Here, we talk about why, based on all of that and more, we’re quietly confident that Team Ninja’s upcoming PS5 exclusive is destined for success.

Whether it’s bang for your buck, or the joy of spending countless hours in a vast, immersive world, long single player games are still immensely popular, despite their approval appearing like it might be waning in favor of more refined, focused experiences in the not-too-distant past. 

To be included on this rundown, we’re looking at games that’ll provide several hours of content, whether that be via gargantuan story, a smorgasbord of side activities, replayability, extra content, or a combination of all. Hopefully the games here prove that whilst bigger doesn’t always mean better, game developers are at least looking to provide meaningful content in their games rather than artificially inflating playtimes with pointless bloat and busywork.
