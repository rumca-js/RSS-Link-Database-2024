We’ve got your Star Wars: The Bad Batch review fresh from watching half of The Bad Batch season 3. Review what we had to say in either video or text here for a spoiler-free analysis for what is The Bad Batch finale season. This Star Wars review is only concerning episodes 1-8, and won’t cover the ultimate fate of The Bad Batch yet for Star Wars: The Bad Batch. In the Bad Batch trailer, you may have spotted a few ideas that may come true.

In Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3, another era comes to a close in the Star Wars Galaxy, and yet several new story threads are moving into place for the Bad Batch, season 3 being their final outing presumably. What’s ahead for Omega? And could Star Wars: The Bad Batch have a The Clone Wars conclusion of sorts? In the Bad Batch S3 promors and The Bad Batch trailer, 2 or more options already seem likely for the clones’ story ending for the members of The Bad Batch. Tech dies for a reason, lets hope, after all the struggles that must be endu

## Why The Bad Batch Season 3 Is Not The End For Omega or The Clones

The Batch aka Clone Force 99 returns in Star Wars: The Bad Batch for their final season! Check out The Bad Batch trailer, which shows the last adventures that we’ll see in Star Wars: The Bad Batch Season 3.

Other Star Wars shows don’t feature the Bad Batch characters, so is it safe to assume they’re all doomed? In the Bad Batch season 3, Omega has a journey of self she must do before Star Wars: The Bad Batch has its series finale. Meanwhile, the remnants of The Clone Wars will face their fate…whatever it might be. Remember, while The Bad Batch S3 is the last of this series, it’s not impossible for the clones to live on! Though little is given away in any media including The Bad Batch trailer, 2 fates are ultimately likely for the Bad Batch.

Was the scene where Tech dies seemingly, a forever thing? Is there more for the clones post Order 66? Kim Horcher interviewed the cast and crew and has clues for what may be the fates for Hunter, Tech, Wrecker, Omega, and maybe even Vent

Don't miss our Dune 2 review! 

Dune: Part 2, reviewed by Tom Jorgensen

Dune: Part Two expands the legend of Paul Atreides in spectacular fashion, and the war for Arrakis is an arresting, mystical ride at nearly every turn.

Though the deep world-building sometimes comes at the cost of fleshing out newer characters, the totality of Dune: Part Two’s transportive power is undeniable.
