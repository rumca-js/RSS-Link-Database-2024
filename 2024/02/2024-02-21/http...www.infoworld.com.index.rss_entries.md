The language, an active project started by <a href="https://andrewkelley.me/" rel="nofollow">Andrew Kelley</a> in 2015, knocked last year’s top earner Clojure ($96,381) down to No. 5 in the category.

<p>JavaScript arrays are an incredibly flexible way to model collections using techniques from <a rel="nofollow">functional programming</a>. This article introduces you to using tools like <code>forEach()</code>, <code>map()</code>, and <code>reduce()</code> for functional-style arrays.</p><h2 class="toc">Traditional JavaScript arrays</h2>
<p>JavaScript’s arrays can hold heterogeneous types, change size on the fly, and readily insert or remove elements. Traditional methods like slice, splice, and push/pop do this by operating on the array itself, modifying the collection in a “destructive” way:</p><pre class="prettyprint"><code>
// Create an array with heterogeneous types:
let myArray = [10, "hello", true, { name: "Alice" }];

// Add to an array and change size on the fly:
myArray.push(42);

// Extract elements without modifying the original array:
let extracted = myArray.slice(1, 3);
</code></pre>

<p>Python is convenient and flexible, yet notably slower than other languages for raw computational speed. The Python ecosystem has compensated with tools that make crunching numbers at scale in Python both fast and convenient.</p><p><a href="https://numpy.org/" rel="nofollow">NumPy</a> is one of the most common Python tools developers and data scientists use for assistance with computing at scale. It provides libraries and techniques for working with arrays and matrices, all backed by code written in high-speed languages like C, C++, and Fortran. And, all of NumPy's operations take place <em>outside</em> the Python runtime, so they aren't constrained by Python's limitations.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712923/what-is-numpy-faster-array-and-matrix-math-in-python.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
