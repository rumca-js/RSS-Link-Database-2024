With the news that microsoft is testing out putting Xbox Game Studios titles on Playstation and Nintendo, and since we know that nothingâ€™s off the table, I figured it would be fun to speculate what happens next.

Master Chief Collection On Switch?

Forza on the PS2?

Some of these are more likely than others, and today I want to go through, and discuss which games I can see getting a multi console release, and which game might take a while to get fully out of the Xbox and PC ecosystems.
