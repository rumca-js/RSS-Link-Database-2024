Xbox has announced a PlayStation release date for Sea of Thieves, its popular pirate live service game from British studio Rare. 
</p><p>
PlayStation 5 players will be able to wishlist the game beginning tomorrow, 22nd February, ahead of its launch on Sony's console on 30th April.

A <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/02/21/new-platforms-new-players-xbox-games-switch-playstation/">blog post</a> from Microsoft tonight also confirms PlayStation dates for Pentiment (tomorrow, 22nd February) and Grounded (16th April) - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-exclusive-pentiment-out-on-switch-tomorrow-grounded-coming-in-april">same as the dates confirmed for Switch</a> in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-partner-showca

A PlayStation 5 release date for the currently-Xbox console exclusive Hi-Fi Rush has found its way onto the internet. </p><p>
The Hi-Fi Rush PS5 launch date was today revealed to be 18th March, courtesy of a new trailer for the rhythm action game posted to Bethesda's Latin American YouTube channel. 
</p><p>
That video appears to have gone live a little earlier than planned, as it was soon taken offline by Bethesda - but not before the internet noticed. You can watch it via the embed below, now re-uploaded to social media:

Paradox Interactive has announced a two-month delay for Prison Architect 2, with the management sim sequel now set to release on 7th May as developer Double Eleven opts for "extra time to identify more bugs and further optimise the game".
</p><p>
Prison Architect 2 - the sequel to the hugely popular 2015 original from developer Introversion Software (who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-interactive-picks-up-the-rights-to-prison-architect">sold the rights to Paradox</a> in 2019) - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-gets-a-3d-sequel-in-march">announced back in January</a>, promising a take on the prison management formula reimagined in full 3D.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> expansion Shadow of the Erdtree finally has a release date: 21st June.

FromSoft boss Hidetaka Miyazaki told Eurogamer this is the biggest expansion the company has ever worked on.

The announcement comes with a new trailer you can watch below.

FromSoft boss Hidetaka Miyazaki has discussed the possibility of a Bloodborne remake, and the benefits of waiting for new hardware on which to revisit the beloved PlayStation 4 classic.
</p><p>
"It is a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans," Miyazaki told Eurogamer when questioned about the possibility of a Bloodborne remake, in an interview timed alongside today's proper unveiling of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a>. "It does make me very happy to see that there are still so many people passionate about it."
</p><p>
But would a remake benefit from newer hardware to make the release worthwhile? FromSoftware's Demon's Souls, for example, was remade as a PS5 launch title after originally launching on PS3 

## Elden Ring creator Hidetaka Miyazaki on originating the Soulslike genre

Hidetaka Miyazaki didn't envision originating an entire genre. Yet such is the popularity of the Dark Souls games - right up to the more recent Elden Ring - that they've become collectively known in the gaming community as Soulslikes. That's shorthand for games with calculating combat, high levels of challenge and repeated death, though this is of course reductive of the awe and grim majesty Miyazaki's games evoke.
</p><p>
Soulslikes are everywhere now. From indie games utilising specific mechanics, to larger projects specifically <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fret-not-puppet-fans-lies-of-p-has-fixed-its-dodge">trying to out-do FromSoftware</a> at its own game. That's testament to the influence of Miyazaki's work, though he remains humble when discussing his oeuvre with me ahead of announcing the <a href="https

This presentation was focused around third-party games so, as expected, there was no news on any homegrown Nintendo titles or the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-shares-drop-following-switch-2-delay-reports">Switch 2's expected arrival in early 2025</a>.

Today's just-finished Nintendo Direct included the surprise announcement of Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble, a new installment in Sega's spherical simian series. 
</p><p>
Launching exclusively for Nintendo Switch on 25th June, this new entry in the series features an online mode where up to 16 players can rush forth simultaneously across obstacles and towards each level's goal. It looks rather like Fall Guys!
</p><p>
Another big change with Banana Rumble is the addition of a Spin Dash move, which lets you charge forward and skip over short gaps. There's a new co-op Adventure Mode, too, and the ability to customise your chimp with over 300 options.

And just like that, my excitement for Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC has gone from bubbling anticipation to a fever pitch scream; alongside a first gameplay trailer for FromSoftware's eagerly awaited expansion, publisher Namco Bandai has now shared a release date, confirming it'll be launching for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on 21st June.

But first that <a href="https://youtu.be/8GDtwdMBhhI">trailer</a>, offering a full three-minute look at Shadow of the Erdtree, and the sprawling expanses of almost inevitable death and gleefully masochistic misery within. There are fields of wheat tainted with spectral tomb stones, gloomy swamps, and striking ruins high on hills - and what gameplay reveal trailer would be complete without a tease of the imposing enemies that'll no doubt be the cause of that aforem

Digital Foundry's John Linneman and Tom Morgan had the chance to play through the game on both platforms recently, summarising the differences between the two versions and the quality of the remake overall. </p><p>The deliberate resemblance between the two versions is evident even from the start screen, with Mario and Donkey Kong staring at each other from opposite corners of the screen on both Game Boy Advance and Switch.

Monster Hunter Stories, Capcom's first - and surprisingly successful - stab at adapting the series' classic monster battling action into a family friendly turn-based RPG, is getting a Switch remaster sometime this "summer". Seperately, Capcom has confirmed it's coming to PS4 and PC too.
</p><p>
Switch owners have, of course, already had a chance to sample the Monster Hunter Stories series when its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-stories-2-review-charming-blend-of-hunting-and-rpg-mechanics">accalaimed second outing</a> launched on Nintendo's platform back in 2021.

Nintendo will add five classic Rare games to Nintendo Switch today, including SNES hit Killer Instinct and N64 great Blast Corps.

In Japan, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers will also get Mother 3 - the third entry in the legendary Earthbound series which has never made it to the West.

All of these games were announced in this afternoon's Nintendo Direct broadcast - though Mother 3 was only mentioned in the show's Japanese version. Sorry, rest of the world.

Following last week's long-rumoured announcement Microsoft is bringing four of its previously Xbox-exclusive first-party games to Switch and PlayStation 5, we've finally got official confirmation of the first two games making that multiplatform leap: Obsidian's historical narrative adventure Pentiment comes to Switch tomorrow, 22nd February, while inch-high garden adventure Grounded arrives 16th April on Nintendo's platform.
</p><p>
Starting with Pentiment, it cast players as Andreas Maler, a master artist who finds himself embroiled in murders, scandals, and intrigue over a period of five years in 16th century Bavaria. It's fantastic stuff - Eurogamer's Christian Donlan called it a "brilliant narrative adventure that is filled with intelligence and heart" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pentiment-review-a-sixt

Such an evocative word! But if it's swashbuckling tales of derring-do you're after, of sea monsters and high seas adventuring, of buried treasures on distant shores and smuggling escapades by the light of the moon, there are other, better ways to fulfil that classic pirate fantasy, because Skull and Bones' take is, regrettably, a bit of a bore.</p><p>It begins, though, as all good adventures often do, in the midst of battle, wood splintering and canons booming as your ship is pursued across the 17th century Indian Ocean by a British armada intent on delivering you to Davy Jones - a wonderfully cinematic opener slightly undone by the fact straying beyond an arbitrary boundary immediately presents you with a stroppy message to turn around. Fortune, though, is on your side, and you escape - after bobbing

Xbox boss Phil Spencer has addressed lingering questions around the company stance on physical media following last year's leaks of an "adorably all-digital" Xbox Series X refresh, saying Microsoft continues to be "supportive" of the medium, and insisting "getting rid of physical, that's not a strategic thing for us."

An all-digital (and distinctly cylindrical) new Xbox Series X design <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-xbox-series-xs-consoles-detailed-in-enormous-microsoft-leak">first surfaced</a> as part of a mammoth leak of official Microsoft documentation during last year's court battle with the FTC over its Activision Blizzard acquisition plans.
