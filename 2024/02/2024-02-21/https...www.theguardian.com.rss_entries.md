<p>This deeply moving documentary follows seven-year-old conjoined twins Marieme and Ndeye and their father, who has devoted his life to their care. It is a much-needed story of hope</p><p></p><p></p><p>‘My daughters are very different,” begins their dad, Ibrahima. “Marieme is very quiet, very reserved. Ndeye is very independent. She wants to be in charge of everything.” He smiles, watches his girls slurp ice-creams along the waterfront at Cardiff Bay, and crumbles the thin end of a cone to feed the pigeons while, around the back of their wheelchair, the girls’ hands meet – as they often do. “To have conjoined twins as a parent is to have something you didn’t expect,” says Ibrahima softly to camera. “I would not pretend that it is easy. It is not. But it’s a huge privilege. You feel lucky to witness this constant battle for life.” What a gentle and profoundly inclusive opening.</p><p>Marieme and Ndeye were born conjoined in Dakar, Senegal, just over seven years ago.

<p>Billionaire says he wants to bring glamour back to the club but warns fans success will not happen overnight</p><p>On the second floor of Ineos’s office in west London, there are lingering reminders of Manchester United’s glory days. You see it in Eric Cantona’s No&nbsp;7 shirt, collar upturned, hanging in the main meeting room. In the pristine match programmes from those famous European trophy nights. And, most of all, in the eyes of Jim Ratcliffe, as he promises to restore a swagger and soul to the club he has supported for 65 years.</p><p>“The Manchester United style of play is attacking football, exciting football, bringing the youth through,” he says, speaking publicly for the first time since acquiring a 27% stake in the club. “You want players that are committed. You want players that play 90 minutes or whatever the number is. At the end of the day we are in the entertainment business. You don’t want to watch bland or characterless football.”</p> <a href="https://ww

<p><strong>Sherman theatre, Cardiff<br /></strong>There’s no shortage of smart ideas in Bethan Marlow’s drama of adolescent awakening in rural Wales, but they whiz by before they really develop</p><p>There isn’t much that feels particularly feral or monstrous about this new musical, which is a bit of a strange beast. While often bold and brimming with smart theatrical ideas, it’s a little uncertain of what it wants to be – just like the hormonal adolescents at its centre.</p><p>Teenager Jax (“she/they/whatever”) lives with her doting and supportive nan in a small Welsh village, passing the days with friends in the park and failing to get a job at the local chippy. That is until one day Ffion appears at the bus stop, armed with queer theory and poetry and terminology. Sparks fly, kisses are exchanged and climaxes reached as Jax navigates the turbulence of rural adolescence.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.shermantheatre.co.uk/event/feral-monster/">Sherman theatre, Cardiff</a>, u

<p>The logic that such referrals would breach data rules is flawed and shortsighted, writes <strong>Tom Levitt </strong>of the Fair Credit Charity</p><p>Twenty years ago, an American supermarket, discovering that its own low-paid employees needed to use a food bank, stopped supplying that food bank with food. Old traditions die hard. Here, the Department for Work and Pensions is to cease referring benefit claimants to food banks because it “breaches data privacy law” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/16/jobcentres-told-to-stop-referring-benefit-claimants-to-food-banks">Jobcentres told to stop referring benefit claimants to food banks, 16 February</a>).</p><p>Some food banks will no longer supply some families with food.

<p>The most disturbing thing about the prolific parenting vlogger was that she was peddling cruelty worldwide in plain sight</p><p>When I first started working in the mid-90s, there was a big furore when a US evangelical church produced a leaflet about child-rearing that included detail on the right size of cane to use to punish a six-month-old baby. The story was enough of a scandal that it travelled across the Atlantic – in the old-fashioned way, from a US newspaper to a British one – but it didn’t merit comment, we decided in the end, because it was just a sad story about a bad person. Child abuse exists, and sometimes hides itself under religion: there are wider conversations about whether or not religions could do more at an institutional level to stamp it out, but those, if they’re in good faith, shouldn’t be started by professed atheists, to whom such institutions would be unreceptive. It was also felt at the time that, just because a person says a thing, even goes so

Like Jürgen Klopp, Tuchel has a Big Cup winner’s medal in his back pocket but will be faced with a tough decision on what to do with his life. For someone with an array of trophies to point to on his Wikipedia page, it would seem he could walk into most jobs but failing to win the Bundesliga with Bayern is a colossal shame. They have lost three matches in a row; title rivals Bayer Leverkusen produced an impressive shoeing to grow the gap at the top, then Lazio put Bayern’s Big Cup hopes in doubt and the dreadful week was concluded with a miserable loss at Bochum.</p><p>I read on the big website today that there is a publicly-funded statue of Harry Kane

<p>Eight years after spectacularly crashing and burning out of the West End, the Olivier-winner is now playing an actress trapped in the same nightmare. Can she face down her demons?</p><p>It is late morning and a major star is kicking off. “Turn the lights on, for fuck’s sake!” she rages at a stagehand. Her fists are clenched, her tanned, tattooed arms are sticking out of a royal blue sleeveless dress, and her locks have been dyed a burnt brunette. Once her demand has been met, the star pivots to face the wide, high-ceilinged room and switches to a gentler register. “Humilia-<em>ting!</em>” she trills, making the last syllable ring like a bell. As laughter fills the air, she slips out of character, her body visibly relaxing. This woman is no longer Myrtle Gordon, the sozzled Broadway legend cracking up on the eve of her latest show, but Sheridan Smith, the double Olivier-winning star of the Legally Blonde musical, whose own recent troubles have left her feeling she has somet

Starmer&nbsp;is good company, engagingly funny and&nbsp;listens in a way that too many politicians too often fail to do.</p><p>There is, of course, a long tradition of advisers (or ex-advisers like me) wailing on about how they wish more voters could see this or that candidate as we do. But the gap between the reality and perception of Starmer is bigger than with most, and it cannot simply be down to the way he sometimes closes in on himself when a camera is pointed at him, or how the online snobs – largely from the left – mock

<p>An array of stars portray warm-hearted Londoners in comedy pivoting around a young boy who is a sunny ancestor to Kes</p><p>Carol Reed’s 1955 film is a rich slice of gentle, sentimental comedy, adapted by Wolf Mankowitz from his own novel.

<p>Mikel Arteta was among those who felt defeat as a player at this stage for five seasons from 2011-17: now the Champions League last eight is in sight again</p><p>Arsenal know, in trading London’s grey skies for the pastel blue of northern Portugal, that they face a challenge coloured in markedly different shades. It has been a long way back to the Champions League last 16 for a club that sat out of European competition two seasons ago so, on the one hand, a meeting with Porto calls for humility. Arsenal have not passed this point since 2010 and breaking that barren run would present another staging post in Mikel Arteta’s ride back towards the top.</p><p>From another perspective, it is an occasion that screams of opportunity. Estádio do Dragão is never a venue to take lightly and Arsenal have discovered that before, most recently losing 2-1 before Nicklas Bendtner’s hat-trick in the second leg helped them to that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/mar/09/ars

<p>A new biography of the Labour leader offers fly-on-the-wall access and intriguing clues as to his motivation</p><p>Keir Starmer can be a hard man to read. Even now, focus groups complain that they’re not quite sure what he stands for – though he has come off the fence on enough divisive issues now, from Gaza to imposing VAT on private school fees, to give them a pretty clear idea. Still, some quality about him seems oddly elusive. The backstory we will all hear endlessly in the run-up to the election – that his father was a rather emotionally distant toolmaker with whom he had a difficult relationship, his mother a nurse who suffered terribly with a painful form of arthritis, and that they raised four children on a tight budget in a pebble-dashed semi – explains him to some extent. But he tells it still with a slight stiffness that leaves many wondering if there isn’t something more. A genuinely revealing account of the rather private man currently on course to lead the co
