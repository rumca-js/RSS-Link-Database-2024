Newly-translated tabletop RPG La Desband&aacute; 1937 - named after the atrocity - aims to honour those killed by offering a personal perspective on the real-life events told through a storytelling game.</p><p>Designer Pablo L&oacute;pez&rsquo;s game offers a distinctly different depiction of warfare in comparison to many typical RPGs and tabletop titles, focusing on the experiences of the everyday people caught up in one of the bloodiest episodes of the Spanish Civil War rather than those fighting on its frontline.</p><p>La Desband&aacute; 1937 takes place as M&aacute;laga falls to the fascist army after seven months of resistance, resulting in hundreds of t

But the mutated fauna at the core of <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/roleplaying-game/best-games/upcoming-rpgs">new tabletop RPG</a> Bilster Critters are all too happy to fill the power vacuum, bringing cartoon mayhem and hard-PG violence to the blasted remains of society.</p><p>A joint creation between Stillfleet Studio and Odd Gob Games, Blister Critters&rsquo; visual design looks like something you&rsquo;d find on a sunbaked VHS tape with no label pulled from the quarter box at a yard sale - and I say that with nothing but love. It&rsquo;s the background art to every episode of Courage, the Cowardly Dog paired with Ren &amp; Stimpy&rsquo;s disgusting anthrop

Adding a total of 204 new cards to the Disney-themed <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/trading-card-game/best-games/best-trading-collectible-expandable-card-games">trading card game</a>, Into the Inklands looks to further cement sapphire ink cards as the thinking-person&rsquo;s Lorcana ink type. Sapphire is an ink type in Lorcana that rewards careful setup with big payoffs, with its more expensive ink costs offering more impressive rewards.</p><p>Into the Inklands&rsquo; sapphire cards continue this trend by introducing a collection of new cards that take more advantage of the item cards in the game, as well as providing excellent opportunities for card draw, gaining more ink and cards that just h

Instead, it pans the camera over to small settlements clinging to the sides of hills or rustic collections of homes and shops in a river valley. To someone&rsquo;s home, far away from the blockbuster backdrops.</p><p>HOME is a new tabletop RPG currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter as part of ZineQuest/Zine Month 2024. Designed by Canadian design studio Deep Dark Games, the collaborative mapmaking title leans into the limitations of scale when you&rsquo;re a zine by stripping away all of the bombast, Michael Bay-esque explosions an
