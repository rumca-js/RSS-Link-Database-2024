<p>Mikel Arteta has only known frustration at Arsenal in the Champions League last 16. When he was a player at the club, he tasted defeat at this stage of the competition in five consecutive seasons – part of a wider run of seven last 16 exits from 2011 to 2017. That was then. But here, after a stressful night in Porto against a team with rather more recent experience of these kind of occasions, when the margins were so excruciatingly thin, Arteta got the same sinking feeling.</p><p>Nothing has been decided yet. It was another first-leg battle, defined by defensive tightness, the closing of spaces and perhaps even more by the feeling that neither team wanted to make a mistake; to concede.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/21/porto-arsenal-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Denis Villeneuve’s monumental adaptation expands its extraordinary world of shimmering strangeness. It’s impossible to imagine anyone doing it better</p><p>The second part of Denis Villeneuve’s monumental Dune adaptation lands with a sternum-juddering crash; it’s another shroom of a film, an epic sci-fi hallucination whose images speak of fascism and imperialism, of guerrilla resistance and romance. Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel – working with co-writer Jon Spaihts – draws on David Lean, George Lucas and Ridley Scott’s Gladiator in the (perhaps inevitable) mega-stadium combat scene with the tiny billions of CGI crowds in the bleachers. But he really has made it all his own: secular political cruelty meets Indigenous people’s struggle in those vast mysterious planetscapes. The sound design throbs and drones in this film’s bloodstream, lending a queasy frisson to its extraordinary visual spectacle and the recurrent horror-fetish BDSM chic which appear

This isn’t what our ancestors would want,” said Keo, 40, who recently resigned from the hotel after 16 years to work at a composting company. “I want to be a better steward for my people and <em>Āina</em>. I want to show my kids that there’s an alternative to the corpor

<p>The Spurs boast a generational rookie talent in Victor Wembanyama, a nice young supporting cast and perhaps the greatest coach to ever do it. So why are they <em>this</em> terrible?</p><p>Let’s get this out of the way at the beginning: Everyone loves Gregg Popovich. He’s a five-time NBA champion, the league’s all-time winningest coach and he led the US men’s national team to a gold medal at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.

<p>Dave Eggers, Celeste Ng, Atwood and others come together for a collaborative novel set during the New York lockdown that explores our need for connection</p><p>‘In the dark times / Will there also be singing?” muses Brecht in the Svendborg Poems. “Yes, there will also be singing / About the dark times.” The impulse for lamentation in a crisis is instinctive and, perhaps, socially useful. But how we voice a response to catastrophe can be contentious, not least with the recent Covid pandemic. And while it may be too early to judge the overall effect of the crisis on the written word, we seem to have come out of it with more of a feeling of discord than harmony, and a sense that the plague and its quarantine accelerated an already existing divisiveness and cultural dissonance.</p><p>So in many ways the publication of Fourteen Days could not have been more timely. Commissioned by the US Authors Guild Foundation, with proceeds going to support its charitable work, this is a col

<p>The feline octogenarian brings brooding star power and presence to Fuerteventura-set thriller</p><p>As fans of highbrow cult TV (Deadwood), schlock but addictive TV (Lovejoy), and connoisseurs of great character portrayal will attest, Ian McShane is a superb actor, one of his generation’s finest. Now 81 but a silver fox who moves with feline fluidity, and in possession of a fortune-generating rumble of a voice, he’s seldom out of work for long. But it’s rare to see him cast in a leading role; he’s usually the heavy, the antagonist, the sly puppeteer who’s been pulling the strings all along.</p><p>American Star is therefore a bit of a treat because it gives McShane fans the maximum amount of McShane time, casting him as yet another heavy but one with something of a soul. (He takes a producer credit here, so maybe that’s what it took to put him in the centre of the story for a change.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/21/american-star-review-ian-mcshane

<p>Our slow travel expert discovers the legacy of popes and revolutionaries on a trip south from Kraków to the resort town in the Tatra Mountains</p><p>Nine trains leave Kraków each weekday to climb up to Poland’s premier mountain retreat, Zakopane. In 1936, the fastest trains to Zakopane took under 2½ hours. Almost a century later, after infrastructure renewal work lasting several years, just one of those nine trainsmatches the 1936 time. Such is the state of railways in some parts of rural Poland.</p><p>Anyone in a hurry to reach Zakopane from Kraków will take the bus, which runs nonstop and takes two hours. But the train is a gentler, greener option. With time on my hands, I opt for one of the slower trains, which promises 48 intermediate stops. Yes, 48. There’s a dash of Slavic magic in the litany of stations along the route: Sieniawa, Skawina, Stronie, Stryszów, Szaflary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/feb/21/rail-route-of-the-month-slavic-magic-on-

<p>Young people are increasingly heading to bed early and getting almost 10 hours of sleep. But how do they nod off – and are they missing out on anything?</p><p>Over a lifetime, you find yourself doing many different things at 9pm: watching TV; reading a book; sitting in a pub; leaving a restaurant to go to a cinema, or the other way round. When you have young children, nine o’clock generally marks the start of the precious time you call your own – a tiny window into which you must cram all your fun. As I’ve aged, I’ve come to associate the 21st hour of the day with coming home rather than going out. But there is one thing I’ve never contemplated doing at 9pm: going to bed.</p><p>And yet, according to the Wall Street Journal, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/early-sleep-bedtime-6ecd1d67">9pm is the hot new bedtime</a> – not for middle-aged tired people, but for twentysomethings.

Foremost among them needs to be one called What Happens When Only Women Are in Danger. This, admittedly, would cover a large proportion of the genre, but then I would like some action on the issue of the sociocultural, legal and police dismissal of – and contempt for – women’s vulnerabilities, experiences and harms, up to and including murder. Maybe the repeated use of such a descriptor would be no bad thing.</p><p>Into this category would fall Can I Tell You a Secret?, the latest true crime offering from the leader of the pack, Netflix – and the first it has made with Louis Theroux’s Mindhouse production company and in association with the
