[{"title": "REVIEW: What Feasts at Night by T. Kingfisher", "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "dead": false, "language": "en-AU", "description": "<p>What Feasts at Night\u00a0is the latest folk horror offering from the reigning Queen of creepy novellas, the one and only T. Kingfisher.\u00a0What Feasts at Night\u00a0is the second story in Kingfisher\u2019s\u00a0Sworn Soldier\u00a0world and reunites us with some of the main characters of her earlier\u00a0What Moves the Dead, retired Lieutenant Alex Easton, their long-suffering valet Angus, and mycologist Eugenia Potter. It is no secret that I am a massive fan of T. Kingfisher\u2019s writing; I have loved everything of hers that I have read. So, when I picked up\u00a0What Feasts at Night, I was willing to bet my house that I would enjoy it, and I did. T. Kingfisher packs a lot into her short fiction, and these flights of fancy are no less fulfilling than a regular-sized novel.\u00a0What Moves the Dead\u00a0and\u00a0What Feasts at Night\u00a0are more disturbing novellas than Kingfisher\u2019s darkly heart-warming tales, such as\u00a0Thornhedge\u00a0or\u00a0Nettle and Bone,\u00a0but still showcase her trademark style. The writing is witty, the characters superb,", "permanent": false, "user": null, "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "thumbnail": null, "tags": [], "page_rating_contents": 0, "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-what-feasts-at-night-by-t-kingfisher", "page_rating_votes": 0, "artist": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "age": null, "vote": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-21T04:25:10+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "album": "", "source_obj__id": 571}]
