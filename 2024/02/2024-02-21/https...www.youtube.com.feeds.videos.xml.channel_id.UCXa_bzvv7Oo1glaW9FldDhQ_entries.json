Spending almost half a decade in development, the game is finally out of early access, and the amount of work the studio has put into the title is quite evident. The unique things about Last Epoch revolve around how it offers character customization through the use of individual skill trees for each skill, and the excellent dungeons.\n\nLast Epoch players will find plenty of unique ways to play any given class and sub-class, owing in large part to its bespoke skill trees for individual abilities.", "permanent": false, "user": null, "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/bMJBLZHxkEk/hqdefault.jpg", "tags": [], "page_rating_contents": 0, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMJBLZHxkEk", "page_rating_votes": 0, "artist": "GamingBolt", "page_rating_visits": 0, "age": null, "vote": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-21T21:30:02+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "album": "", "source_obj__id": 208}, {"title": "THIS PS5 Exclusive Looks Set To Be One of 2024'S BIGGEST GAMES", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "dead": false, "language": null, "description": "With older classics like Dead or Alive and Ninja Gaiden and more recent success stories like Nioh and Wo Long, Team Ninja is a developer that has consistently moved from strength to strength in nearly every new thing it has attempted, and with its next game, the illustrious studio is set to take another giant leap forward. \n\nAction RPG Rise of the Ronin is going to be Team Ninja\u2019s first open world game ever, and there\u2019s plenty about it that has caught our eye. Whether it\u2019s its historical setting and its grounded aesthetic you\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s authentic depiction of 19th century Japan in an immersive world, or its promise of tight and unique combat and traversal mechanics, Rise of the Ronin seems to have more than just a few things going for it. \n\nHere, we talk about why, based on all of that and more, we\u2019re quietly confident that Team Ninja\u2019s upcoming PS5 exclusive is destined for success.", "permanent": false, "user": null, "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UiZQJa6P0LE/hqdefault.jpg", "tags": [], "page_rating_contents": 0, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiZQJa6P0LE", "page_rating_votes": 0, "artist": "GamingBolt", "page_rating_visits": 0, "age": null, "vote": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-21T17:00:29+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "album": "", "source_obj__id": 208}, {"title": "15 NEW Longest Single Players Games of 2024 You NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "dead": false, "language": null, "description": "Whether it\u2019s bang for your buck, or the joy of spending countless hours in a vast, immersive world, long single player games are still immensely popular, despite their approval appearing like it might be waning in favor of more refined, focused experiences in the not-too-distant past. \n\nTo be included on this rundown, we\u2019re looking at games that\u2019ll provide several hours of content, whether that be via gargantuan story, a smorgasbord of side activities, replayability, extra content, or a combination of all.
