## Meta is testing cross-posts from Facebook to Threads

<p>Despite quickly amassing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-threads-races-to-100-million-users-in-under-a-week-070740016.html">more than 100 million users</a>, Meta’s Threads hasn’t exactly broken through to the zeitgeist the way its main rival, X/Twitter, did. It’s arguably still awaiting its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-17-twitter-s-fake-news-problem-is-getting-worse.html">plane-on-the-Hudson moment</a>. Nevertheless, Meta is doing what it can to bring attention to and keep eyes on the text-based platform, including by displaying popular threads on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Its latest test is out of a previous playbook too. The company is toying with letting users cross post from Facebook to Threads with ease. That could eventually make it easier for heavy Facebook users and/or content creators to share their thoughts, videos and photos on Threads without much more effort. As it stands, some users can share text and link posts from Facebook to Thre

## FTC concludes Twitter didn’t violate data security rules, in spite of Musk's orders

<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concluded Elon Musk ordered Twitter (now X) employees to take actions that would have violated an FTC consent decree regarding consumers’ data privacy and security. The investigation arose from the late 2022 episode informally known as “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-twitter-files-011249897.html">The Twitter Files</a>,” where Musk ordered staff to let outside writers access internal documents from the company’s systems. However, the FTC says Twitter security veterans “took appropriate measures to protect consumers’ private information,” likely sparing Musk’s company from government repercussions by ignoring his directive.</p>
<p>FTC Chair Lina Khan discussed the conclusions in a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/letterresponsekhanjordan20240221.pdf">public letter</a> sent Tuesday to House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (<a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.washin

<p>One of the worst-kept secrets in gaming is now official. Former Xbox exclusive <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> is coming to PS5 on March 19. Many expected the announcement to come during <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-the-first-nintendo-direct-of-2024-here-at-9am-et-133026295.html">Wednesday's Nintendo Direct</a>, which focused on third-party games, but Bethesda confirmed the news a few hours later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It emerged during the Direct that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/former-xbox-exclusive-pentiment-is-coming-to-switch-on-february-22-143345195.html"><em>Pentiment </em>and <em>Grounded </em>were Switch-bound</a>. Both titles are also coming to PS4 and PS5 on February 22 and April 16, respectively. <em>Grounded </em>will have cross-play support between Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch and PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s a <em>Borderlands</em> movie coming out, and now we have our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU_NKNZljoQ">very first teaser trailer.</a> This footage gives us a glimpse of all of the major characters, most of which are sourced from the game, and the tone that director Eli Roth is going for.</p>
<p>There’s a definite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-07-guardians-of-the-galaxy-ii-to-be-shot-with-reds-8k-weapon.html"><em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>vibe</a> running throughout. Maybe it’s the heavy use of an iconic Electric Light Orchestra song, or maybe it’s the ragtag group of adventurers or the mix of action and humor. In any event, director Eli Roth seems to be channeling his best James Gunn. All things considered, that seems to be the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/borderlands-movie-is-set-to-be-released-next-august-210515223.html">right tone for a <em>Borderlands </em>movie.</a> Color us cautiously optimistic.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/elden-ring/"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> fans who have been itching for a reason to return to the Lands Between (y'know, other than it being one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-best-games-2022-150020578.html">best-received games in recent memory</a>) will soon have one. Publisher Bandai Namco and studio FromSoftware revealed in a gameplay trailer that the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion will arrive on PC, PlayStation and Xbox on June 21. The studio <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elden-ring-expansion-shadow-of-the-erdtree-112516898.html">announced the DLC</a> one year ago.</p>
<p>The three-minute trailer is suitably epic in scope. It features new locales and more devious bosses to take down. One looks like a giant burning Wicker Man, while another has a horn-headed, lion-esque visage and lightning powers. We also got a look at a gross, worm-like enemy that can almost swallow the player character.</p>

<p>At this point in the year, new wireless Bluetooth earbuds are arriving at a constant pace. This means even more options are worth considering, with most of them offering features like active noise cancelation (ANC), great sound and solid battery life in increasingly comfortable packages. As the new models pile up, sorting through the noise can be a chore, but we’re constantly testing and reviewing to provide the best buying advice. This guide breaks down our current top picks, and lays out some things you should compare before choosing which pair of wireless earbuds is right for you.</p>
<h2>What to look for in wireless earbuds</h2>
<p>When it comes to shopping for earbuds, the first thing to consider is design or wear style. Do you prefer a semi-open fit like AirPods or do you want something that completely closes off your ears? If you’re shopping for earbuds with active noise cancellation, you'll want the latter, but a case can be made for the former if you want to wear

<p>Nintendo's about to kick off its first event of the year with the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/02-21-2024/">Direct Partner Showcase</a> focused on upcoming third-party games for Switch. We could see the first news about Xbox titles like <em>Pentiment</em> coming to other platforms and maybe, hopefully more about the much-delayed <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel, <em>Silksong</em>. The 25-minute presentation kicks off at 9AM ET today (February 21) and you can watch it below.</p>
<p>As mentioned, today's Direct could be more significant than a typical showcase. Last week, Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-confirms-four-of-its-games-are-coming-to-more-popular-consoles-201419203.html">announced</a> that it would begin bringing some of its exclusive titles to &quot;other consoles,&quot; likely meaning the Switch and Sony's PlayStation 5.</p>

The company added that other sports, including Baseball and American Football will debut for their upcoming seasons.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons you might not be able to watch your team of choice play live.

It contains a debugging tool, as well as a guide with best practices for AI development based on Google's experience.</p>
<p>The company has made Gemma available in two different sizes — Gemma 2B and Gemma 7B — which both come with pre-trained and instruction-tuned variants and are both lightweight enough to run directly on a developer's laptop or desktop computer.
