For the past 40 years, China's national TV station has been presenting a program on New Yearâ€™s Eve called "Spring Festival Gala" or "Spring Gala" for short. It used to be a must-see program for Chinese families, but now more and more Chinese people are choosing to skip it. 
Also, unexpectedly, the 2024 Spring Festival Gala omitted a segment where overseas Chinese greet their fellow Chinese. It's speculated to be related to a dispute between a British pianist and Chinese Little Pinks. People who are fervently patriotic or love the Communist Party are called Little Pinks. And apparently, the pianist won this time. In this episode, we take a look at how Chinese attitudes towards the Spring Festival Gala have changed.
