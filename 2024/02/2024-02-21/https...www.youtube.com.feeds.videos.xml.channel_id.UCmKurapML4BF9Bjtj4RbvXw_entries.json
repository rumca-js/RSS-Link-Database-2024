This original was born live in concert, using a unique method to capture the essence of the moment: the time of day, 8:42 PM, guided the selection of the song's first three notes. Starting from C, Jon ascended 8 notes to choose the first, then 4 notes for the second, and finally 2 notes to find the third, crafting a melody that reflects the time itself. '8:42 at Red Rock Canyon' is not just a song; it's a moment in time, immortalized through melody. Dive into this one-of-a-kind musical journey and be inspired by the power of improvisation and creativity.
