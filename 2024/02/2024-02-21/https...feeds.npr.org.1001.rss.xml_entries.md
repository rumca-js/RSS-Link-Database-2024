Keyser, West Virginia, was once known for coal. But the jobs have been disappearing since the 1970s. First because of automation, then cheap natural gas. And now, the urgency to address climate change is one more pressure on this energy source that contributes to global warming.<br /><br />Now the town, like so much of the country is attempting to transition to renewable energy. The country's first major climate policy, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, gave that transition a boost. It passed with the key vote of West Virginia's own Senator Democrat Joe Manchin.<br /><br />Keyser represents a national shift in American energy production. And in a town that was defined by coal for generations, change can be difficult.<br /><br />For sponsor-free episodes of <em>Consider This</em>, sign up for <em>Consider This+</em> via Apple Podcasts or at <a href="http://plus.npr.org/">plus.npr.org</a>.  <br /><br />Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org"><em>considerthis@npr.o

In the U.S., flavored cigarettes have been banned since 2009, with one glaring exception: menthols. That exception was supposed to go away in 2023, but the Biden administration quietly delayed the ban on menthols. Why? Well, an estimated 85 percent of Black smokers smoke menthols — and some (potentially suspect) polls have indicated that a ban on menthols would chill Biden's support among Black people. Of course, it's more complicated than that. The story of menthol cigarettes is tied up in policing, advertising, influencer-culture, and the weaponization of race and gender studies. Oh, and a real-life Black superhero named Mandrake the Magician.
