It's not a subjective statement and cannot be ambiguous depending on the individual. It is or it is not. And I am sure everyone reading this already knows that it is. </p><p>So even if someone wants to end their life, even if someone is terminally ill, even if someone is not born yet, their life is inherently valuable and it is baffling that so many people in society do not agree with this statement. </p><p>There is a reason why people say progressives are in a death cult. It's because they are constantly finding more ways to end human life. Usually, that manifests through their insane fight for abortion "rights". But one o

If gender is a social contract, then there is no need to change the body to align with the mind. But none of that matters to progressives and those who condone this ideology. They don’t like little things like “facts” getting in the way of their illogical stances on things. But when your entire worldview is based on lies and delusion, on top of the need to be constantly “affirmed” by the masses, you end up with this story. </p><p>A Labour Member of Parliament has demanded that dead people should be afforded the right to change their gender. And no, that is not a Babylon Bee article. She said that. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

You have to be incredibly deranged to think like that. And often, those people are. Because abortion promotes the lie that women must choose between the life of the child or her freedom. But even if that ultimatum was true, which it’s not, abortion is still the wrong answer. </p><p>So I guess we should not be surprised that Rep. Amanda Toll gave a floor speech while holding her newborn child, who is not even a couple weeks old, to advocate for a bill that would have re-legalized abortion through 24 weeks of pregnancy in New Hampshire. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

Because while Mexicans who are "escaping" their own country and/or being "displaced" by "climate change" sneak into Texas, we all share the same body of land.

Ukraine gets triple that. Notice how Murphy lists Ukraine BEFORE our own border. Remember, his thread is to sell this package
