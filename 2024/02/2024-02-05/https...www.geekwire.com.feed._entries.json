The company will collaborate on different initiatives with Semafor, the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism\u00a0at CUNY, the Online News Association, the GroundTruth Project, and Nota.

A smart earring prototype called the &#8220;Thermal Earring&#8221; was introduced recently as a wireless wearable capable of monitoring the temperature of a user&#8217;s earlobe. In a small study of six people, the smart accessory outperformed a smartwatch at sensing skin temperature during periods of rest. Researchers said it also showed promise for monitoring signs of stress, eating, exercise and ovulation.
