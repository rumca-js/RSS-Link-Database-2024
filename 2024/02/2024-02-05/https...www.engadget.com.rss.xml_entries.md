<p>Google reportedly plans to develop a YouTube app for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-a-new-milestone-for-mixed-reality-060943291.html">Apple Vision Pro</a>. <em>The Verge</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/5/24062425/youtube-vision-pro-app-360-vr-video">says</a> a YouTube spokesperson confirmed the company’s plans to make a native Vision Pro app, while it optimizes YouTube for Safari as a stopgap. The U-turn comes after developer Christian Selig (creator of the popular Apollo app that Reddit killed in 2023) launched an unofficial YouTube app for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-redux-immersive-video-disney-app-floating-keyboard-and-a-little-screaming-180006222.html">Apple’s $3,500 headset</a>.</p>

<p>The popular MMO game <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xiv-comes-to-xbox-next-spring-192903645.html"><ins>finally heading to Xbox Series X/S consoles,</ins></a> but there’s a major caveat. The full release will require an Xbox Game Pass Core or Ultimate subscription, <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/f4c4542f86c781dac7b5c69b28f51710c7d9fd95"><ins>according to publisher Square Enix.</ins></a> This will be in addition to the monthly fee to actually play the game.</p>
<p>Let’s break down the cost. A 30-day subscription to the game will set you back $15, while 90 days costs $42 and 180 days comes out to $78. Xbox Game Pass Core costs $10 per month or $60 for a year. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate costs $17 per month. So Xbox players will have to shell out a minimum of $18 each month and a maximum of $32 per month to travel the magical world of Eorzea. The download itself is free, for whatever that's worth.</p>

<p>Rivian will reveal the R2 on March 7. The company <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/Rivian/status/1754505245072506915">confirmed</a> on Monday in a post on X (Twitter) that customers should “get ready to meet R2 on March 7th.” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe previously said the next-generation platform would be smaller and cheaper than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1s-suv-ev-review-video-160029394.html">the R1 lineup</a>.</p>
<p>The automaker hasn’t yet said where the event will take place, but it will all but certainly be in Laguna Beach, CA. Last month, its city council publicly <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://stunewslaguna.com/fair-game-012324/">posted</a> an approved request in its minutes for a “Rivian R2 Launch,” part of a “worldwide product launch event at the Rivian Theater” on the same date. If that wasn’t enough of a clue, Rivian’s X teaser included audio of waves crashing, beachgoers playing and seagulls squawking.</p>

<p>Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, is laying off 10 percent of its workforce, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ixviewer/ix.html?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1564408/000119312524023571/d768969d8k.htm"><ins>according to an SEC filing</ins></a><ins>&nbsp;</ins>and confirmed by a company spokesperson. The company reported a total number of 5,367 employees at the end of 2023’s third quarter, so the layoffs should impact around 540 people.</p>
<p>Snap discussed the decision in the SEC filing, saying the layoffs would “best position our business to execute our highest priorities” and ensure it has “the capacity to invest incrementally” over time. The company told us the layoffs were necessary to “reduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration.” None of those sentences really mean anything, so let's just go with &quot;corporate restructuring.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/"><ins>Microsoft's</ins></a> gaming division appears to be considering a significant shift in its strategy when it comes to major exclusives.

<p>Yandex, often described as Russia’s Google, has sold its domestic businesses at a knock-down price. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-05/yandex-parent-cuts-ties-to-russia-in-5-2-billion-unit-sale?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> the search and services giant, now headquartered in the Netherlands, has handed off its Russian operations for 475 billion rubles ($5.2 billion) in cash and shares. The new owners include the management group, as well as Russia’s biggest domestic energy company, Lukoil, and Russian businessman and a former executive at Gazprom, Alexander Ryazanov, among others. Now that Yandex has cut ties with Russia, it will be able to grow and partner more freely given the sanctions affecting businesses with Russian ties following the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-us-senate-wants-answers-over-starlinks-ukrainian-satellite-internet-denial-091047225.html"> invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest podcast in the world makes many people furious, but it’s still the biggest podcast in the world. Now, the man behind<em> The Joe Rogan Experience</em> has signed another deal with Spotify, worth an estimated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-rogan-reportedly-nabs-another-250-million-from-spotify-to-share-his-big-brained-ideas-192007040.html">$250 million</a>. The deal allows the streamer to distribute Rogan’s podcasts on additional platforms, including a video version for YouTube, but it also includes a revenue-sharing agreement based on ad sales, in case Rogan burns through those hundreds of millions too quickly.</p>
<p>Rogan has been a regular source of controversy since signing up, in particular with uninformed COVID opinions, which prompted doctors and scientists to demand Spotify update its misinformation policy. Spotify claimed it wasn’t responsible for Rogan, that it was a platform, not a publisher. Now Spotify will be publishing Rogan’s projects els

<p>Samsung chairman Jay Y. Lee's legal troubles may be in the rearview mirror as a Korean court acquitted him of stock manipulation and accounting fraud charges over a 2015 merger, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/87bff410-8470-43d7-bf1f-57426168e1f1"><em>The Financial Times</em></a> has reported. The ruling allows Lee to continue leading Samsung, which saw a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-annual-profits-continued-to-decline-in-2023-090500640.html">sharp decline in revenue</a> last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeking a five year jail term, prosecutors accused Lee of manipulating the share price of two Samsung subsidiaries to smooth the way for a merger that allowed him to consolidate his power. However, the Seoul Central District Court ruled that the prosecutors failed to prove that. &quot;It is hard to say that Lee Jae-yong [aka Jay Y. Lee] . . . spearheaded the merger, and that the merger was done just for the sake of Lee’s succession,&quot; the judge stated in the ru

<p>The Oversight Board is urging Meta to update its manipulated media policy, calling the current rules “incoherent.” The admonishment comes in a closely watched decision about a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-oversight-board-will-take-on-metas-manipulated-media-policy-ahead-of-2024-elections-120046787.html"><ins>misleadingly edited</ins></a> video of President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The board ultimately sided with Meta regarding its decision to not remove the clip at the center of the case. The video featured footage from October 2022, when the president accompanied his granddaughter who was voting in person for the first time. News footage <a href="https://apnews.com/video/videos-106014773bb34d96ac0998d24a77930b"><ins>shows</ins></a> that after voting, he placed an “I voted” sticker on her shirt.

The latest instance is out of Hong Kong, where a finance worker for an undisclosed multinational company was tricked into remitting $200 million Hong Kong dollars ($25.6 million).&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Hong Kong police, scammers contacted the employee posing as the company's United Kingdom-based chief financial officer. He was initially suspicious, as the email called for secret transactions, but that's where the deepfakes came in. The worker attended a video call with the &quot;CFO&quot; and other recognizable members of the company. In reality, each &quot;person&quot; he interacted with was a deepfake — likely created using public video clips of the actual individuals.&nbsp;</p>

As <em>iFixit</em> discovered in its <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/90137/vision-pro-teardown-why-those-fake-eyes-look-so-weird">teardown</a>, it turns out that Apple leveraged stereoscopic 3D effect as an attempt to make your virtual eyes look more life-like, as opposed to a conventional &quot;flat&quot; output on the curved OLED panel. This is achieved by stacking a widening optical layer and a lenticular lens layer over the OLED screen, which is why exposing the panel will show &quot;some very oddly pinched eyes.&quot; The optical nature of the added layers also explain the EyeSight disp
