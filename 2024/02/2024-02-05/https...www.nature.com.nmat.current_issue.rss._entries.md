<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 05 February 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01799-y">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01799-y</a></p>Developing active and stable atomically dispersed catalysts is challenging because of weak non-specific interactions between catalytically active metal atoms and supports. A general method for synthesizing these catalysts via photochemical defect tuning for controlling oxygen-vacancy dynamics is proposed.
