Vitamin B12 deficiency in people can cause a slew of health problems and even become fatal. Until now, the same deficiencies were thought to impact certain types of algae, as well. A new study has examined the algae Phaeocystis antarctica's (P. antarctica) exposure to a matrix of iron and vitamin B12 conditions. Results show that this algae has the ability to survive without B12, something that computer analysis of genome sequences had incorrectly indicated.

At least 112 people have been killed by wildfires in central Chile, leading its president to declare two days of national mourning. The devastation comes soon after Colombia declared a disaster over wildfires. Scientists say climate change makes the heat waves and drought now hitting South America more likely—and both contribute to wildfires by drying out the plants that feed the blazes.

The proverb "necessity is the mother of invention" has been used to describe the source from which our cultural evolution springs. After all, need in times of scarcity has forced humans to continually invent new technologies that have driven the remarkable cumulative culture of our species. But an invention only becomes cultural if it is learned and spread by many individuals. In other words, the invention must be socially transmitted.

Kiwi fruits with their tangy green flesh are routinely purchased and devoured throughout the year by people across the nation. This is no surprise. Kiwi fruit is high in vitamin C, dietary fiber, and potassium. The subtropical fruit is also a favorite of many southern U.S. producers since the delicious fruit is traditionally grown in warmer climates. California produces the vast majority of kiwi fruits that are sold in our local grocery stores, but due to recent research advancements from U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists, this may no longer be the case.

When carbon molecules from plants enter the soil, they hit a definitive fork in the road. Either the carbon gets trapped in the soil for days or even years, where it is effectively sequestered from immediately entering the atmosphere. Or it feeds microbes, which then respire carbon dioxide (CO2) into the ever-warming environment.

Microbial particles including fungi, bacteria, allergens, etc., are common natural components of air. In particular, fungi represent a large portion of the airborne microbes since they are among the most abundant, widely dispersed, and pervasive organisms in the world. Spores of different fungal species dispersed in the atmosphere are considered to be related to air pollution, thus affecting human health. Bioaerosols containing airborne microorganisms and their waste products can cause respiratory disorders and other adverse health effects, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis and toxic responses.

In order to develop effective solutions, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between NRs and neighboring communities is essential and requires focused research on the influencing factors. Unfortunately, limited scientific attention to this issue has made it difficult to establish a link between these two entities, reducing the effectiveness of proposed solutions.

Trappist-1 is a fascinating exoplanetary system. Seven worlds orbiting a red dwarf star just 40 light-years away. All of the worlds are similar to Earth in mass and size, and three or four of them are potentially habitable. Imagine exploring a system of life-rich worlds within easy traveling distance of each other. It's a wonderful dream, but as a new study shows it isn't likely that life exists in the system. It's more likely the planets are barren and stripped of their atmospheres.

Astronomers have found a new Super-Earth orbiting an M-dwarf (red dwarf) star about 137 light-years away. The planet is named TOI-715b, and it's about 1.55 Earth's radius and is inside the star's habitable zone. There's also another planetary candidate in the system. It's Earth-sized, and if it's confirmed, it will be the smallest habitable zone planet TESS has discovered so far.

The Circumpolar Current works as a regulator of the planet's climate. Its origins were thought to have caused the formation of the permanent ice in Antarctica about 34 million years ago. Now, a study led by the University of Barcelona, the Instituto Andaluz de Ciencias de la Tierra (CSIC) and the Imperial College London (United Kingdom) has cast doubt on this theory, and has changed the understanding of how the ice sheet in Antarctic developed in the past, and what this could mean in the future as the planet's climate changes.

Back in the 1980s, researchers tested a job-training program called JOBSTART in 13 U.S. cities. In 12 locations, the program had a minimal benefit. But in San Jose, California, results were good: After a few years, workers earned about $6,500 more annually than peers not participating in it.

Child sexual abuse is common in Australia. The best evidence of this comes from the 2023 Australian Child Maltreatment Study (ACMS), which surveyed 8,500 Australians aged 16 and over. The ACMS found 28.5% of the national population has experienced sexual abuse before age 18 by any person (adult or adolescent). Women were twice as likely as men to have experienced sexual abuse (37.3%-18.8%). Among 16-to-24-year-olds, prevalence was slightly lower (25.7%), but again with a massive gender disparity (35.2%-14.5%).

Programmable photonic integrated circuits (PPICs) process light waves for computation, sensing, and signaling in ways that can be programmed to suit diverse requirements. Researchers at Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), in South Korea, with collaborators at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), have achieved a major advance in incorporating microelectromechanical systems into PPICs.

Global marine biodiversity is continually being threatened by oceanographic changes linked to both global warming and anthropogenic activities that degrade the ambient environment for marine organisms. Australia's oceanographic biodiversity is globally admired, with new initiatives being undertaken to aid conservation of marine ecosystems for decades to come, both at the local and global scale.

A team at NDORMS has developed a new approach to significantly improve the accuracy of RNA sequencing. They have pinpointed the primary source of inaccurate quantification in both short and long-read RNA sequencing, and have introduced the concept of "majority vote" error correction leading to a substantial improvement in RNA molecular counting.

A research team has caught a glimpse of a rare case of retrovirus integration. Retroviruses are viruses that multiply by incorporating their genes into the genome of a host cell. If the infected cell is a germ cell, the retrovirus can then be passed on to the next generation as an "endogenous" retrovirus (ERV) and spread as part of the host genome in that host species.

Flowers rely on a newly identified protein to develop properly with all of their organs, according to the research team who made the discovery. The team, led by Penn State biologists, identified the protein in the model plant species Arabidopsis and said its mechanism is likely shared across plant species.

When a total solar eclipse comes to the Dallas-Fort Worth area on April 8, and the moon starts to cover the sun in the sky, it may feel safe to sneak a peek without eclipse glasses. But experts say that staring at the sun for as little as five seconds can damage your eyes. Look longer, and that damage could become permanent.

The University of Florida's International Shark Attack File (ISAF), a scientific database of global shark attacks, confirmed 69 unprovoked bites in 2023. Although this is higher than the most recent five-year average of 63 attacks, the data remain consistent with long-term trends.
