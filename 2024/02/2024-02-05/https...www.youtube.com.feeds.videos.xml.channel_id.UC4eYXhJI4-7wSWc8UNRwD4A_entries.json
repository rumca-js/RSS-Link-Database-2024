Between performing her lush indie-rock songs, Katie Von Schleicher mentions that she made a Dwayne Johnson zine for her latest record: \"I'd like him to be my best friend, if you know him...\" she says. There's a wry charm to Von Schleicher's exquisite songwriting, often underscoring its sincerity but never cheapening its quality.\n\nAlong with her mighty eight-piece band, Von Schleicher opens the set with \"Montagnard People,\" which is also the opening track on her 2023 album A Little Touch of Schleicher in the Night (yes, that's a nod to Harry Nilsson's A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night). \"Honestly, my tight five needs work / To get past hurts, I'm alive,\" she sings over swinging strings and saxophones, \"Watching movies at night / only Dwayne Johnson helps me take that ride.\"\n\nShe and the band pack the biggest punch on", "page_rating_contents": 0, "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/TGU0-1PBW54/hqdefault.jpg", "artist": "NPR Music", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGU0-1PBW54", "source_obj__id": 186, "user": null, "bookmarked": false, "page_rating_votes": 0}]
