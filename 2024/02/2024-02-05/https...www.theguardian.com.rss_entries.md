<p>It had been billed as Erling Haaland’s grand comeback to the Manchester City starting XI. Perhaps there could be a shootout with Ivan Toney, the Brentford striker, who is also re-establishing himself after rather longer on the sidelines in the wake of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/16/a-lonely-existence-ivan-toney-walks-well-worn-path-as-he-returns-from-ban">his betting ban</a>.</p><p>For a while, there was the possibility that Neal Maupay could upstage them both when he gave Brentford a shock lead midway through a first half made memorable by the defiance of Mark Flekken in the home goal. But, by the end, this was all about another attacker whose talent can seem utterly irresistible on nights like these.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/05/brentford-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Ethan Roots emerges from whirlwind to offer England a firm foundation

<p>Flanker’s leadership qualities have shone through under Steve Borthwick after a turbulent path to his first cap</p><p>Life has been full of surprises for England’s new back-row Ethan Roots of late. First there was a call-up by Steve Borthwick just a few months after arriving at Exeter, then came a first start <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/03/italy-england-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report">against Italy last Saturday</a> and a man‑of‑the‑match award to go with&nbsp;it. Nothing tops the surprise he got afterwards, however, upon learning that his mother, Cara, had flown out from New Zealand to watch the Auckland-born flanker make his debut.</p><p>“My dad is back in Auckland but&nbsp;my mum flew out and surprised me,” says Roots. “I saw her for the first time in quite a while. That was pretty special as well. She arrived [the night before the game]. I don’t know how she planned it all. Her and my partner landed at the same time. They kept it under wra

## Curb Your Enthusiasm final season review – Larry David is the very best in the business

<p>David’s comedy may have mellowed over time, but it’s like going to see a veteran rock band who’ve still got it. At this point, the genius flows effortlessly</p><p>Has Curb Your Enthusiasm softened with age? In some ways, not at all. There is a scene in the opening episode of the new, 12th and supposedly final season in which Larry David is talking to a boring party guest and simply repeats her words in a silly voice at maximum volume. That woman is not seen again.</p><p>As the sitcom misadventures of the Seinfeld co-creator’s alter ego have progressed, however, Curb has smoothed some of its edge. The addition a few years ago of the phenomenal JB Smoove as Leon, Larry’s priapic freeloader of a lodger, has given the comedy a more collective vibe, since Leon has his own brand of independent thought bluntly expressed. In the old days, home life was just Larry’s then wife, Cheryl, reacting to his peculiarities. Awkward embarrassment doesn’t hang in the air quite as malevolently

<p><strong>Editorial:</strong> The compelling India-England series highlights the appeal of long-form cricket. Pity so few people can see it</p><p>“The English are not a very spiritual people,” said George Bernard Shaw, “so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.” Shaw had Test cricket, rather than modern short-form versions of the game, in mind when he said this. Sport as a religious rite. “Cricket is a process, not a sport; seepage rather than drama; a summer’s dawdle akin to a picnic or garden party,” wrote the English novelist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/06/travel/making-sense-of-cricket.html">Paul West</a>, attempting to explain cricket to Americans. He was not being entirely fair: Test cricket can contain high drama, its intensity often magnified by the torpor which precedes it.

It does not offend me at all. I don’t get this idea that you can only play him if you have “lived experience”. If this was so important, it would mean only actors with scoliosis could take the part, because not all disabilities are the same, and people with different disabilities have different lived experiences. To suggest that any disabled actor can play him because all disabilities are experienced the same is sure

<p>Great Welsh rugby fly-half who won 25 caps for his country and gained an almost mythical status</p><p>In an international career that spanned just six years, Barry John, who has died aged 79, won 25 caps for his country and appeared in five Lions Tests. But the fly-half made enough of a mark during his brief time as a player to achieve something approaching mythical status in Wales.</p><p>He was at the zenith of his powers on the Lions tour in 1971 to New Zealand, where his ability to ghost past would-be tacklers as if they did not exist was a major factor in the Lions winning the Test series 2-1. Not only did John possess the running skills of a classic fly-half: he was a dead-eyed place-kicker, could kick from hand with either foot, and was a rock-solid defender. Those attributes helped him to 188 points on that tour, a record for a Lions tourist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/05/barry-john-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When lockdowns ended I was left holding the kitten and the kitty litter – but now we’re like an old married couple</p><p>After years of indoctrination from my native-animal loving parents, I arrived at adulthood wary of domestic pets. We didn’t have any when I was growing up. Instead, Mum would jokingly tell us to go outside and play with the skinks that sun-baked on the hot bricks, or with the echidna that waddled through the garden. The native animals were not so keen on this, so I began collecting dead spiders and storing them in an old jewellery box, their limbs slowly disintegrating over time until they were nothing more than dust.</p><p>When I left home, we bought goldfish for our sharehouse, naming them after musicians we loved. Madonna was a quick-darting thing and Cyndi had bright-orange scales. They were low-maintenance pets, requiring nothing more than a pinch of food each morning and the occasional top-up of water. Even I could manage that.</p><p><strong><a hre

<p>Arsenal suffer a shock defeat at West Ham and there is no new-manager boost for Brighton after the sacking of Melissa Phillips</p><p>Arsenal’s title pursuit hit a huge stumbling block on Sunday when they suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to struggling West Ham. After a dominant first-half performance which saw them lead 1-0, Jonas Eidevall’s side completely dropped the ball, with disastrous consequences. Arsenal have now lost three WSL games this season and the stats do not back a late title charge: previous champions have never lost more than two.

The flavour of the lightly spiced carrots against the toffeed dates, sharp feta and lemon works beautifully; I took it to a friend’s house for a pot-luck lunch and it went down very well. Use your choice of tinned butter beans, black beans, haricot, cannellini or indeed chickpeas – it’s a great dish to use up whatever you have around.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/feb/05/quick-easy-winter-recipe-spiced-roast-carrots-feta-dates-bulgur-beans">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Can we really maintain our levels of empathy in the face of an increasingly brutal news cycle?</p><p>If you believe some commentators, we’re in the midst of a compassion crisis, with a particularly brutal daily news cycle taking its&nbsp;toll on our reserves of sympathy. The more&nbsp;suffering we see, the less we care, as we&nbsp;mentally switch off from others’ pain. The&nbsp;result may even be that we struggle to feel as much&nbsp;concern for people close at hand when they come&nbsp;to us for support; we end up feeling numb to any expression of emotion.</p><p>“The whole world is at risk for ‘compassion fatigue,’”&nbsp;Time magazine <a href="https://time.com/6332107/compassion-fatigue-risk/">declared</a> recently. And while occasionally disengaging might seem like a sensible form of self-protection, the prospect of losing any sense&nbsp;of concern for others over the longer term would be a disaster.

<p>Potato and wilted cavolo nero or spinach, all bound together by a bubbling, cheesy bechamel and coated in toasted breadcrumbs</p><p><strong><br /></strong>The first time I read the instruction “strip the cavolo nero”, I took it to mean that I should cut it into strips. So I gathered a few leaves into a bundle, then cut across the lot, forming thick ribbons before continuing to cook whatever it was I was making, which might have been soup. I prepared cavolo nero<em> </em>like this for years. Until, that is, I watched a cookery demonstration at a country festival in Umbria where the chef demonstrating held a stem of cavolo in one hand, then, with the other, clasped the leaf and pulled, separating the tough midrib from the bubbly green.</p><p>Now, for anyone familiar with<em> </em>cavolo nero,<em> </em>I am no doubt describing a logical and completely obvious preparation. For me, though, on a cold Sunday near Perugia, he was a magician and I was an idiot.</p> <a href="https:/

But Keir O’Donnell, a character actor making his writing-directing debut, has juiced up the formula with a palette of poppy primary colours and bright stabs of pink, and an ironic, self-mocking tone. That should help this slip down easy with new-generation viewers who may never have seen such classics as The Postman Always Rings Twice or Double Indemnity, let alone later remakes or homages like Body Heat or Blue Velvet.</p><p>It also helps that O’Donnell has cast Gen-Z-star-on-the-rise Joe Keery (Steve from Stranger Things) as protagonist Baron, a guileless poor boy from the American south w

<p>Borger’s account of how pleas in the Manchester Guardian by Viennese parents trying to rescue their children – one of them his father – from the Holocaust is gripping and powerful</p><p>When he was growing up, recalls Julian Borger, it felt as if his family “had painted layer after layer of tasteful off-white over the top of something garish, more visceral and unsettling”. His difficult and dissatisfied psychologist father Robert had never managed to overcome “the refugee’s curse” of being “from two places and none at the same time”. His grandmother Erna, when invited over, “would typically arrive late and… insist on making Viennese food from scratch, unpacking her plastic shopping bags on the already set kitchen table”.</p><p>The rest of the family knew that Erna and the 11-year-old Robert, Viennese Jews fleeing Nazi persecution, had arrived in England in October 1938. She had been granted a visa to work as a maid, while he was adopted by Nancy and Reg Bingley in Wales. B

<p>Arsenal’s creative trio showed their worth while Pascal Gross and Pedro Neto profited from defensive frailties</p><p>The critics were lining up to skewer “same old Arsenal” as Kai Havertz – No 9 for the day – was denied by Alisson after being sent through on goal. The Gunners had misfired in this same fixture in the FA Cup, undone by late Liverpool counterattacks. Havertz never looked confident but he was bailed out by Bukayo Saka, alert in turning home the rebound. Gabriel Martinelli did something similar to pounce on a rare misstep by the Liverpool defence later on. And thus a theme of last season was evoked; the productivity of Arsenal attackers who are not out-and-out strikers. Last season, Saka, Martinelli and Martin Ødegaard scored 44 goals between them. This season, the trio had just 15 going into this game. Arsenal are challengers for sure, but those three must provide the bulk of the goals for that to be sustained. <strong>Dominic Booth</strong></p><p><em>Match re

<p>With some researchers labelling the sport ‘a form of child abuse’ and parents questioning safety, can rugby get the balance right?</p><p>This story begins with a boy lying dazed and confused on a rugby pitch in Sussex last month. There are concussion symptoms that linger, days off school, and a stark revelation from a rugby-loving parent who provides first aid to the team. “It is not until you have cradled the head of someone else’s son, who is then unable to stand unassisted, that it really hits home how dangerous this game can be.”</p><p>Those dangers have now led to some researchers to call for rugby in schools and clubs to be banned for under-18s as it is <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/rugby-played-schools-form-child-abuse-study-b1136563.html">“a form of child abuse”</a>.

It was the first time the country had dedicated a public holiday to a woman, and festivals opened as schools were closed. Trinity College Dublin even installed four portrait busts of women in its Old Library: scientist Rosalind Franklin, dramatist Augusta Gregory, mathematician Ada Lovelace and feminist rights activist Mary Wollstonecraft. This marked the first time that women had ever been honoured in the barrel-ceilinged colonnade, which, since 1743, had exclusively housed 40 portrait busts of men.</p><p>I only heard about this saint, and her celebrated feast day, when I read Emm

Perth, the capital city, reached 41.9C (107.4F) on Wednesday, 42.7C on Thursday and 40.4C on Friday.

However, over the coming days, the heat is expected to return, with temperatures in excess of 40C expected to persist from Thursday to Saturday, before easing again on Sunday. Furthermore, it is not just the maximum temperatures that can cause discomfort, but also the minimum, which, over the course of the second heatwave, will probably be about 25C, around the maximum seen over the previous weekend.</

<p>This documentary about Rhys Bowler’s love life is overly concerned with disabled people paying for sex. It’s a highly questionable focus – even if there are moving moments</p><p>This documentary opens with Rhys Bowler’s tattoo artist asking the question every disabled person dreads: “How do you have sex?” Bowler – who has Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a life-limiting muscle-wasting condition that means he uses assisted ventilation and an electric wheelchair – takes the question in better spirit than most of us, gamely explaining that “everything works” but he is “lazy and just lays there”.</p><p>It is clearly a scripted reality device to get the key information across to the viewer quickly, but it speaks to the dilemma at the heart of this often moving documentary: the sex lives of disabled people is a topic full of prejudice and taboos that need busting. That said, ultimately, it is no one else’s business; the idea that it might be is surely half the problem.</p> <a
