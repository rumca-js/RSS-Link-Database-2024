In today's Daily Fix:
The rumor mill is churning with reports that Microsoft may let some of their Xbox exclusives on the PlayStation 5, specifically Starfield and the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. In other Xbox news, you'll need a Game Pass subscription to play this very popular MMO, ON TOP OF the game's monthly fees. Ouch. And finally, a Last of Us Part 3 is a little closer to reality as Neil Druckmann confirms he has ideas for a third game in the series.

The Inquisitor reviewed by Phil Hornshaw on PC, also available on PlayStation and Xbox.

The Inquisitor takes place in a fascinating, dark world, and its story often puts you in strange and interesting situations. Searching for a vampire and trying to solve murders in a medieval town is a great idea, and it's compelling to search a scene for clues, to try to puzzle out the best choices in conversations and interrogations, and to attempt to stitch the whole thing together. But it doesn't pay off its ambition, whether that’s because of action scenes that are never really challenging or choices that are either too opaque to see where they're taking you, or take you to the same destination regardless of what you pick. The Inquisitor is always holding your hand too tightly, and as a result, it's a detective game that does most of the detecting for you.
