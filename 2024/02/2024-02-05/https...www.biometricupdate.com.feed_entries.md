		<h2>How to separate the contenders from the pretenders in online identity verification vendors</h2>

Identity verification is the process of verifying that a person is who they claim to be. Unfortunately, on the internet, it’s hard to know if someone’s digital identity matches their real-world identity. Your customer could be a fraudster, a money launderer, an underage minor — or a legitimate customer just trying to transact or open an account.

Because of cybercriminals and routine data breaches, trust is in increasingly short supply. In response, the market for identity proofing has exploded, and new solution providers have rushed in to help fill the void. In this increasingly cluttered marketplace, it’s difficult to separate the pretenders from the

		As <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/australias-digital-id-may-launch-in-july-heres-what-to-expect">Australia</a> continues its transition toward digital ID, the country’s liquor lobby is raising concerns about how much it will cost to implement digital ID age verification for alcohol purchases, and whether small online businesses will be able to compete.

		A release from Ontario’s Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC) says it has published new guidelines for the lawful use of biometric facial recognition and mugshot databases by police. Formally entitled “Facial Recognition and Mugshot Databases: Guidance for Police in Ontario,” <a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-01-19-facial-recognition-and-mugshot-databases-guidance-for-police-in-ontario-e.pdf">the document</a> comes in the wake of controversies surrounding the collection of biometric data by police forces across Canada.

		Bahraini authorities say there was a massive uptake of digital ID and civil registration services using digital platforms in 2023, with 743,000 identity transactions completed online.

The Information and eGovernment Authority (iGA) says of this number of ID transactions, over 700,000 of them were completed using a dedicated government portal, smart devices and other online methods, The Daily Tribune <a href="https://www.newsofbahrain.com/bahrain/96639.html">reports</a>.

Some of the services sought included issuance, renewal and replacement of some ID documents, civil records data update, address information update, viewing and printing of ID card details, as well as ID card declarations.

		After failed attempts in 2015 and 2020, the Tunisian government has resumed the idea of introducing biometrics-based identification documents such as national IDs, residence cards and passports.

A bill in this respect has been tabled in Parliament for scrutiny, but rights advocates and civil society organizations have raised concerns about the risk of data breaches, saying the existing data protection legislation in the country is not enough, The National <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/tunisia/2024/02/02/tunisias-push-for-biometric-ids-raises-concerns-over-data-privacy/">reports</a>.

		The European Union Artificial Intelligence Act entered its final stages last Friday as EU countries agreed on its technical details. The provisional agreement on the landmark legislation is now waiting for European Parliament committees’ approval. But while significant opposition is not expected, some legal experts are already warning about gaps in regulating remote biometric identification that could harm human rights.

“The AI Act only contains an in-principle prohibition on the use of such systems in publicly accessible places for law enforcement purposes, subject to complex conditions and exceptions,” writes <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/author/douwekorff">Douwe Korff</a>, Professor of International Law at London Metropol

		A podcast by century-old auto industry watcher WardsAuto shows how a billion or more dollars a year in revenue could be realized in the short term through new safety-related biometrics functions in vehicles.

David Kiley, a senior editor with WardsAuto, <a href="https://media.podserve.fm/media/episodes/user_8226/7356/WardsAutoPodcastEp28_-_John_Nowinski_BOSCH-NHTSA.mp3">spoke</a> with an executive from the OEM Bosch North America. John Nowinski says there is a good market in adding better sensors and algorithms to cars without mandating them.

That’s an important distinction. Kiley quotes industry statistics indicating that added or improved biometrics could generate $800 million to $1.6 billion a year, assuming 16 million new unit sales. But someth

		In a jarring demonstration of how AI-generated biometric deepfakes have hypercharged fraud tactics, a virtual meeting with video deepfakes of senior management tricked an employee at an unidentified multinational firm into transferring US$25 million into five Hong Kong bank accounts.

The South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3250851/everyone-looked-real-multinational-firms-hong-kong-office-loses-hk200-million-after-scammers-stage">reports</a> that the finance employee at the firm’s Hong Kong office suspected a meeting request from his company’s chief financial officer was a phishing email because it mentioned “secret transactions”.

		Three school systems, two in the U.S. and the other in Brazil are installing or updating biometric security system for students.

The U.S. state of Virginia’s Education Department has <a href="https://www.pwcs.edu/news/2024/02/grant_funds_security_equipment_at_five_schools">announced</a> recipients for $12 million in state grants for security upgrades that will include access-control vendor <a href="https://www.verkada.com/">Verkada</a> cameras with facial recognition algorithms. It isn’t clear how many biometric surveillance cameras will be purchased but the money will update systems at 483 schools considered by state officials most in need of assistance.

		The happiest day at Apple isn’t its release of a great annual report. It’s when executives see how the market will squeal with delight over a new product design.

And there’s been a lot of squealing this week as Apple releases its biometrics-heavy Vision Pro around the world. To be honest, the squealing has been just a little muted among actual buyers because at a base price of <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-vision/apple-vision-pro?afid=p238%7CsNAYbcLD2-dc_mtid_%5Btracker_id%5D_pcrid_689653239481_pgrid_150826791276_pexid_123850818171_&amp;cid=wwa-us-kwgo-VisionPro-slid-SHu3FY6s--productid--Brand-Avalanche-Avail-">$3,500</a>, it’s a nosebleed purchase for almost all of humanity.

Titled “Cross-Database Liveness Detection: Insights from Comparative Biometric Analysis,” the paper was presented in November 2023 in Lviv, Ukraine, by authors from Kharkiv University, Marche Polytechnic University and the University of Macerata in Italy.

Liveness detection in cross-database scenarios, the paper says, is “a test paradigm notorious for its complexity and real-world relevance.”
