<p>Apple is beginning to act on its <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3712060/hey-siri-where-will-you-be-after-the-genai-bubble-pops.html">generative AI (genAI) plans</a>. Machine vision intelligence at scale generates huge quantities of data. Not all of that data should exist, so how does one ensure the information that is being used and conceivably stored is appropriate, of good quality, and legitimate?</p><p>Not only this, but how can a company use public sourced video data to train machine intelligence models without breaching privacy law? Apple has an idea for this. It’s allegedly preparing to acquire brighter AI, according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/03/apple-brighter-ai/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">9to5Mac</a></em>.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712708/apple-has-eye-on-building-bigger-genai-data-sets.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></articl

<p><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3080839/repair-windows-10-and-11-step-by-step-guide.html">When things go wrong with Windows</a>, as they sometimes will, nothing ensures a faster or easier return to normal than restoring a recent image backup.</p><p>To that end, I back up my production PCs at 9 a.m. every day. That means that I’ll never lose more than a day’s work if something should go badly enough wrong to force that day’s image backup to be restored.</p><p>In the sections that follow, I explain what all this means, how it works, and why you shouldn’t use built-in backup in either Windows 10 or 11. Finally, I’ll walk you through how to use my favorite free image backup tool while recommending a couple of other acceptable alternatives.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3655693/how-to-make-image-backup-windows-10-windows-11.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
