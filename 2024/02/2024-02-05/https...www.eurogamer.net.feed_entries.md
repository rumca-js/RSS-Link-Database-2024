If it's demos you want, today's your lucky day; Valve's thrice-yearly Steam Next Fest event is back for another outing, this time featuring "hundreds" of demos across its seven-day duration.
</p><p>
Valve's latest Steam Next Fest is already underway and runs until Monday, 12th February. That means you've got approximately 160 hours to piledrive your way through everything on offer - which, given the magnitude of the task, is probably a literal impossibility at this point. But then we live in a world where someone <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-dark-souls-3-video-is-bananas-literally">finished Dark Souls 3 with a banana</a>, so what do I know.

As usual, Valve has tried to make the whole Sisyphean challenge a little less daunting by sorting all those playable demos into easily perusable categories o

Following a day of reports pointing to a seismic shift in Microsoft's approach to its first-party titles, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has confirmed the company will be sharing its "vision for the future of Xbox" in a "business event" next week.
</p><p>
All this began earlier this year, when reports surfaced that Microsoft could be preparing to release Tango Gameworks' acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush on PlayStation and Switch - a rumour that was rapidly followed by claims Rare's multiplayer pirate adventure Sea of Thieves is also readying for release on competing consoles. However, reports began snowballing this weekend, with Starfield, Indiana Jones, and even Gears of War all emerging as potential candidates fora PlayStation release.

As the rumours of Xbox first-party titles going multiplatform have steadily escalated, Mi

Amid a fresh swirl of reports suggesting Microsoft is at least mulling a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-mulls-major-xbox-exclusives-starfield-indiana-jones-for-playstation-5-reports">dramatic shift in strategy</a> for its first-party Xbox titles, its been claimed Gears of War - a series that's long been tightly intertwined with Xbox's identity - is also being considered for a PlayStation release.
</p><p>
That's according to Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb, who made the claim in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeeCiI4QmDs">latest edition</a> of his Mess Mornings podcast (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-is-reportedly-considering-bringing-gears-of-war-to-playstation/">thanks VGC</a>).

## Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League review - an idea destined to fail

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is filled with little moments of brilliance: humour, style, expression, that signature rhythmic, flow-state approach to combat. There's no question - as there rarely is with any video game - that its team was remarkably dedicated to making it as good as it could be. It's just that for each upshot there's a matching, crashing downturn, and in looking for a cause it's difficult to see beyond the ambitions that this game has been asked to juggle.</p><p>All at once, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League must be a live service game that pays for its extraordinary, almost nine-year run-up time after 2015's Batman: Arkham Knight, plus the support of those live serv

A remake of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune was "considered" to be in the pipeline at PlayStation, a new report has claimed.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjit3pAYV7s&amp;t=11841s">XboxEra</a>'s Nick Baker and Jon Clarke said they both had received "evidence" that Sony has ideas to remake the first Uncharted game from the "ground up". 
</p><p>
"It is with saying that the additional detail I got was that this was, this was quite old - like I am talking a number of years," Clarke warned. "But it wouldn't surprise me, right... as a way to bring the series back into the limelight again and get people hyped."

Major Xbox console exclusives such as Bethesda's Starfield and the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle are being considered for launch on Sony's PlayStation 5, as part of a huge shift in strategy by Microsoft. 
</p><p>
Previous reports suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-release-acclaimed-first-party-game-on-another-platform-report-suggests">Xbox would bring a handful of smaller titles to PlayStation beginning this year, including Hi-Fi Rush</a> - something Eurogamer understood to be true and also which has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-t-shirt-datamine-offers-more-evidence-of-switch-and-playstation-release">seemingly been confirmed by its in-game files</a>.
