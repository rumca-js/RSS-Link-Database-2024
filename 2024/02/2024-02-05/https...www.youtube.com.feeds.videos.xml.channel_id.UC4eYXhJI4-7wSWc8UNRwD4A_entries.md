I didn't fact check this, but I'm pretty sure this is the first Tiny Desk concert that mentions Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Between performing her lush indie-rock songs, Katie Von Schleicher mentions that she made a Dwayne Johnson zine for her latest record: "I'd like him to be my best friend, if you know him..." she says. There's a wry charm to Von Schleicher's exquisite songwriting, often underscoring its sincerity but never cheapening its quality.

Along with her mighty eight-piece band, Von Schleicher opens the set with "Montagnard People," which is also the opening track on her 2023 album A Little Touch of Schleicher in the Night (yes, that's a nod to Harry Nilsson's A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night). "Honestly, my tight five needs work / To get past hurts, I'm alive," she sings over swinging strings and saxophones, "Watching movies at night / only Dwayne Johnson helps me take that ride."

She and the band pack the biggest punch on
