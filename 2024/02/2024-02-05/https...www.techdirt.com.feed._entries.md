Earlier this year, we discussed a frustrating story regarding one company in the UK, Cornices Centre, threatening a cyclist over a YouTube video showing what purports to be a near miss by a truck with the company&#8217;s name and logo on it. Those threats centered on a very confused understanding of trademark law, such that [&#8230;]

Things remain troubling in Los Angeles.

There are a number of people, both those who agree with me and those who disagree with me, who seem to think I have some sort of personal dislike of Elon Musk. That’s not true. I find it amazing that he gets away with some of the stuff he gets away with, and I am [&#8230;]

Facial recognition may be helping law enforcement catch bad guys, but inherent flaws in these systems ensure it&#8217;s only a matter of time before the AI coughs up yet another unforced error. That sort of error rate might be acceptable when the AI is doing nothing more than pitching in to refine Google search results [&#8230;]

Amidst all of the attention paid to last week’s Senate hearing on child safety online, it remains stunning just how little time was actually spent on how to help children online.
