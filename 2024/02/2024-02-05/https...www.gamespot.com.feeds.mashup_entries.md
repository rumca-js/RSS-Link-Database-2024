<p>Writer-director James Cameron already had an ambitious plan to make five Avatar films, but now he's upping the ante and says he has ideas for Avatar 6 and Avatar 7, too. However, Cameron told <a href="https://collider.com/james-cameron-avatar-6-7-ideas/">Collider</a> that if Avatar 6 and 7 ever happen, he probably won't direct them.</p><p>"We're fully written through movie five, and I've got ideas for six and seven, although I'll probably be handing the baton on at that point," he said. "I mean, mortality catches up. But I mean, we're enjoying what we're doing. We're loving it. We get to work with great people."</p><p>If this sounds familiar, it's because Cameron said in 2022 that he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-4-is-a-motherfker-james-cameron-says-but-he-might-not-direct-it-if-it-even-gets-made/1100-6505086/">might not direct Avatar 4 or 5, either</a>.

<p>Konami has <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/eu/en/topics/17742/">announced</a> Yu-Gi-Oh Early Days Collection for Nintendo Switch and Steam. It is a digital-only title commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Yu-Gi-Oh franchise. A release date for the collection hasn't been announced yet.</p><p>Early Days Collection contains some of the earliest Yu-Gi-Oh games ever released, but the only title that Konami has confirmed so far is Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists. It was first released for the Game Boy Color in 2000, but it never left Japan until now with the upcoming collection.</p><p>Konami also revealed two other Yu-Gi-Oh projects. The first one is a VR game on mobile and PC called Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links, where players will be able to see the franchise's iconic monsters in 3D. The other one is a project to add AI to Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel. This allows externally created AI to be installed in the game, and the AI opponent learns more as it duels. However

Whether it be Jason Vorhees, Michael Myers, Leatherface, great white sharks, or graboids, there are giant terrors everywhere. However, giant monsters aren't the only thing to fear in horror movies.</p><p>Some movies focus on smaller--but still scary--beings. One thing many of these tiny horror monsters have in common is that they look a bit silly. Why are so many of these creatures either dolls or monsters that look slimy or wet?

<p dir="ltr">Being able to play a long RPG like Persona 3 Reload on a handheld device is, for many of us, an absolutely wonderful thing. But if you're trying to play Persona 3 Reload on Steam Deck with the default settings, you've likely encountered some severe performance issues that can slow the game to a crawl in certain scenes. Luckily, there's an easy way to dramatically improve the game's frame rate.</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay close attention to the areas in which the frame rate tanks, you might have figured out what the problem is: reflective surfaces. Although Reload's PC graphics settings menu is disappointingly basic, it does offer the ability to turn off Reflections. To do this, head into the System menu, select Config, then Graphics Settings, and set Reflections to Off (make sure to save your changes, too). I'd recommend setting your frame rate limit to 60 while you're at it.</p><p dir="ltr">The best demonstration of this difference comes in the Iwatodai Strip Mal

But he seems to be a bit perplexed by John's appearance in a new promo for the family friendly flick If.</p><p dir="ltr">That's because WandaVision actor Randall Park is portraying John in a nod to a classic Jim Halpert prank from The Office. In Season 9 of the popular comedy series, a joke called "Asian Jim" sees Park's guest character tricking co-worker Dwight that he is in fact Jim Halpert. For this If promotion, Park is acting as Krasinski to deceive Reynolds, which he shared <a href="https://twitter.com/VancityReynolds/status/1754506863515672883">on X (formerly known as Twitter)</a>.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">You think

Conduit can be seen teaming up with Bangalore and Newcastle, and players also catch a glimpse of Wraith finishing off Caustic before having a quick chat with Pathfinder and Mirage--an homage to the game's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=innmNewjkuk">very first launch trailer</a>, which featured the trio fighting their way to victory while (lovingly) trash-talking each other.</p><p dir="ltr">The new trailer is surprisingly short for a launch trailer and, oddly, was not preceded by an episode of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apexs-newest-legend-conduit-has-heavy-ties-to-tita
