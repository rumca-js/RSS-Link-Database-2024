<p>The early days of Windows 11 and its hardware requirements were simply a mess. According to a new potential discovery, the upcoming Windows 11 24H2 might be a little simpler &mdash; older PCs simply won&rsquo;t boot.</p>



<p>And by old PCs, we mean <em>old</em> PCs. A Twitter user <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/TheBobPony/status/1756771051634135277&amp;xcust=2-1-2233813-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">claims</a> that he has discovered a hard stop on PCs dating back to the last decade, based on a CPU instruction that&rsquo;s now required.</p>

<p>When looking for a top-notch VPN, the two most important things to look for are privacy and speed. While privacy is crucial to a good VPN, speed should not be overlooked. Faster speeds mean quicker file downloads and website load times, a better streaming experience, and just a better all-around experience.</p>



<p>To find the fastest VPN, the two most important factors are download and upload speeds. Download speeds are most likely the primary concern because when using the internet, it is imperative to get data from remote servers as quickly as possible. However, upload speeds can be equally as important for some. Gamers, for example, need low server ping in order to register their actions as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>When evaluating VPN connection speeds, we look at both download and upload speeds, focusing on the percentage of the base speed t

<p>It&rsquo;s probably been a while since you&rsquo;ve dealt with your computer&rsquo;s motherboard. You don&rsquo;t have to, as long as you simply sit at your PC or notebook and carry out everyday tasks. </p>



<p>However, if you want to replace a component such as the graphics card or SSD with an upgrade, it is highly recommended that you research the existing internal connections and their cabling on the circuit board. This preparatory work will save you trouble later on: You decide from the outset in favor of the right component that fits mechanically and at the same time can actually achieve its maximum performance.</p>



<p>In the case of SSDs and graphics cards, you will immediately come across the SATA and PCI Express interfaces. Although SATA is considered outdated technology, it is still important for updating hard drives, especially in many old

<p>Plenty of folks use Microsoft Windows&rsquo; built-in antivirus protection, but sometimes you need more than what it offers. Security suites from independent companies like Bitdefender, Norton, and AVG can make it easier to stay on top of online security, by providing expanded and additional features that shield you more thoroughly.</p>



<p>The simplest way to get an alternative antivirus app is to buy a license directly from the software vendor, but it&rsquo;s not the only method. If you&rsquo;re willing to forgo the ease of a direct subscription, you can save a lot of money&mdash;as much as 50 to 75 percent off the regular list price.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s how to do it.</p>
