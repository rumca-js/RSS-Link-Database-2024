<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 12 February 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01803-5">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01803-5</a></p>Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is an efficient mechanism for quantum sensors and has been discovered in a few systems, but all have technological limitations. Here the authors report room temperature ODMR in single defects in GaN, promising for integrated quantum sensing applications.
