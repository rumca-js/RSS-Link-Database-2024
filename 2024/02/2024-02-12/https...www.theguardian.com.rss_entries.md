<p>The PM’s hour-long Q&amp;A on the People’s Forum once again showed that he’s just not very good at this sort of thing</p><p>I suppose it was almost inevitable. Nearly every Conservative MP has their own show on GB News, so it was only a matter of time before it was Rishi Sunak’s turn. The prime minister is going to have a free diary after the next election. Perhaps he could do a weekly phone-in show from California. Though the £100,000 he might get for it probably won’t be nearly enough to make ends meet.

## Conor Gallagher haunts Crystal Palace by salvaging late victory for Chelsea

<p>This result must have felt like a punch in the guts for Roy Hodgson. In his 200th match in charge, Crystal Palace succumbed to a 13th successive defeat against Chelsea having taken the lead through Jefferson Lerma’s first goal for the club, after two strikes from Conor Gallagher.</p><p>It was the cruellest blow for a manager who has already suffered so much this season as his team have struggled with injuries and a poor run of form that now stretches to two wins in their last 14 matches. But for Mauricio Pochettino’s side, who wrapped up the points in stoppage time with a third from Enzo Fernández, this was an unbelievable turnaround after a first half that had seen Chelsea plumb new depths. Yet it was Gallagher – who scored eight times while on loan at Palace and now has four in six appearances against them – who sparked the revival that left Hodgson’s position in jeopardy once more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/12/crystal-palace-chelsea-prem

Women and children were among those killed, according to Dr Marwan al-Hams, the director of the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital, and dozens were wounded. The two freed hostages were taken to Sheba hospital in central Israel and were confirmed by the hospital's doctors to be in “good condition”. The hostages were named by Israel Defense Forces as Fernando Simon Marman, 60, and Louis Har, 70, who were kidnapped from the Nir Yitzhak kibbutz in the 7 October Hamas atta

## The big idea: why we need to kick big money out of UK politics

<p>Our system of wealthy donors chips away at democracy, but what could replace it?</p><p>If you live in a marginal constituency and felt bombarded by leaflets, billboards and online ads at the last general election, brace yourself. Last year, Michael Gove dramatically increased the limits on campaign spending. A&nbsp;tsunami of bumf is heading your way.</p><p>Ministers argued that the changes – which saw the cap on party spending increase by 80%, and the one on&nbsp;candidate spending by almost a third – reflected inflation since the limits were last set, in 2000. But the shift will only amplify the centrality of big money to politics in the UK, much of it raised from a small number of mega-rich donors. With the election looming, it’s past time we stopped to ask whether there is a less murky way of doing things.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/feb/12/the-big-idea-why-we-need-to-kick-big-money-out-of-politics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At least 67 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes on the southern city of Rafah, according to Gaza health officials, as the Israeli military said it had freed two hostages during a raid by special forces on the city. The raid was celebrated in Israel, which has been seeking the release of more than 100 captives held by Hamas and other militant groups. Heavy airstrikes pounded Rafah, the city on the southern edge of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> Strip where about 1.4 million Palestinians have fled to escape fighting elsewhere in the Israel-Hamas war.

<p>Zyn, a kind of modern-day snuff, has developed a bro-y fandom on social media. It’s also opened up a predictable divide</p><p>Don Juan, the 1655 five-act comedy by Molière, begins with a rhapsody on the benefits of snuff: the pulverized tobacco product popularized in the courts and salons of 17th-century Europe. “It’s the passion of the virtuous man,” Molière’s rakish hero waxes. “Not only does it purge the human brain, but it also instructs the soul in virtue and one learns from it how to be a virtuous man.”</p><p>Don Juan’s ode to smokeless tobacco was consistent with similar ecstasies of the era. The distinguished English scholar and encyclopedist Robert Burton claimed tobacco went “far beyond all other panaceas, potable gold, and philosopher’s stones, a sovereign remedy to all diseases”. Mark Twain, the eminent American wit, once proclaimed: “If smoking is not allowed in heaven, I shall not go.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/12/meet-the-zyn

After the fall of the Roman Empire, the once great consular road declined: some parts were left to go wild, others incorporated into other roads. However, sections of the ancient road, such as the stretch leaving Rome, remained an important route for people and things going in and out of the city.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/feb/12/spaghetti-red-wine-onions-drunken-pasta-recipe-rachel-roddy">Conti

<p>Hammers count the cost, Wilder ditches the maths while Elliott and Sarr are providing the numbers that matter</p><p>The academies of Manchester United and Chelsea have a decent reputation for bringing through highly talented and technical players. Anthony Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi both got a taste of Premier League football with their first clubs but for various reasons were allowed to leave in the summer to join Nottingham Forest. Aged 21 and 23, respectively, the duo have time on their side. Against Newcastle Elanga’s pace was a constant danger, helping him kick dust into Dan Burn’s face as he sprinted beyond the full-back, who had no answer to the Swede’s pace. Hudson-Odoi’s threat comes from cutting in from the left, which brought him his goal on Saturday. Nuno Espírito Santo was eager to bring in a winger in January, acquiring Gio Reyna, another 21-year-old, from Borussia Dortmund because he thinks counterattacking football could be key to Forest’s success.<strong

<p>The US writer’s fictionalised portrait of the young Eric Blair’s time with the imperial police in Burma is a keenly felt and vividly researched account of colonial bigotry and power</p><p>George Orwell’s first novel, <em>Burmese Days</em>, published in 1934, drew substantially on the five years he served in the Indian imperial police force at various stations along the Irrawaddy a decade earlier. You suspect, however, that his alter ego in that novel, John Flory, was a good deal more seasoned than the young writer, still called Eric Blair, had been when he arrived in Mandalay in 1922. Flory was cast as a teak merchant in his mid-30s; Blair was unvarnished and 19 and just out of Eton.

So far, so social-realist, but when Halima and Amara plan a weekend away, Amara gets kidnapped by accident by a goon working for a drug kingpin who, claiming “all brown girls look the same to me”, mistakes her for Halima.</p><p>The director, Suman Hanif, has said that Tell Me About It is aiming to hold a mirror up to represent the experiences of the British South Asian community; presumably this applies to the

<p>Derided by the architectural establishment, Marcel Raymaekers used salvaged materials from ships, planes and slaughterhouses – to create riotous buildings that made people rethink their lives</p><p>Shimmering skylights bulge from the pitched roof of a house in rural Belgium, like an army of slugs slithering up the terracotta tiles. It turns out that these bulbous glass cupolas once served as the cockpits of Lockheed fighter jets, but they’re now bringing light into this astonishing, pyramid-shaped home, illuminating an interior made of tarred timber reclaimed from old boats and a sculptural hearth made from salvaged bricks.</p><p>In a suburb nearby, a huge ornate stone bay window, this time salvaged from a Brussels townhouse, dangles from the facade of an angular modern house like an oversized trophy. Porthole windows flank an arched stone entrance, leading to an interior where aged pine beams fan out across the ceiling, above a black fireplace made of steel from a ship. P

We’re discussing his most recent movie, Killers of the Flower Moon, which has been nominated for 10 Oscars, including a record 10th best director nomination for Scorsese. But he has been promoting the film since last April, he says. “For the most part, the reaction to the film is beyond encouraging. It’s very, very appreciated. However, I think I want to get back to making something as soon as possible. Like now. Right now. Today.”</p><p>Then he makes to get up from his chair and walk off. “Yes, right now.

<p>The R&amp;B entertainer gave his all to a career-spanning performance, complete with shirtless crooning, high-energy dancing and star guests</p><p>If anyone has the right to sit on a throne in the middle of Las Vegas, it’s Usher. The King of R&amp;B, whose residency graced the city for 18 months, has earned his crown as an ambassador of near-peerless showmanship, luscious escapism and a good time. He’s an old-school performer, the kind to give and give, to one-up himself on a ceaseless quest to <em>entertain</em>. And so the 45-year-old resident star of Vegas (with all due respect to Adele) opened his Super Bowl half-time show – an achievement explicitly aimed as both a celebration of his 30-year career and a continuation of it – bedecked in regal white suit, flanked with circus performers, and meticulously, mellifluously hitting his marks.</p><p>The 15-minute show – an extra two on the normal runtime, to account for his vast catalog – was a frenetic and daring, if at time
