<p id="b4IJbE">AI, once an ambiguous science fiction trope, has become an ambiguous business buzzword, as every technology product races to implement what Silicon Valley thinks is the greatest innovation since the internet. But lost in the conversation are stories about the people building it and using it. If large language models and automated systems will, indeed, upend labor and capital, what does it actually look like in practice? In this package, we’ll explore the ways AI functions <em>today</em>: how people are using it, where it fails and where it succeeds, and what it actually means when we say “artificial intelligence.” </p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mALo4B">I was recently sitting in a hot tub with a friend — a glaciologist who studies how quickly the southern ice is sliding into the sea — when she mentioned that she had recently planned her honeymoon using ChatGPT. Our fellow bathers burst into laughter. “You’d done it, too?” This, apparently, is the present state of get-togethers among friends in their early 30s: six people and three AI-assisted honeymoons between them.</p>

  <p id="DsgRh9">Microsoft appears to be readying its own DLSS-like AI upscaling feature for PC games. X user <a href="https://twitter.com/PhantomOfEarth/status/1756334413040718140">PhantomOcean3</a> discovered the feature inside the latest test versions of Windows 11 over the weekend, with Microsoft describing its automatic super resolution as a way to “use AI to make supported games play more smoothly with enhanced details.”</p>
<p id="qIRV2H">That sounds a lot like Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology, which uses AI to upscale games and improve frame rates and image quality. AMD and Intel also offer the

  <p id="edRRQS">Air quality in the US is projected to backslide in the coming decades, landing back where it was in the mid-2000s as a result of climate change, according to a new report. The report comes with an online tool for users to zoom in on individual properties to see what kind of air quality residents might experience there in the future. It paints a picture of a changing landscape for regulators, who are going to have to adapt to evolving threats.</p>

  <p id="v9PT4E">It’s going to take something special to get people as hyped for Marvel’s movies as they used to be, and the first trailer for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955157/deadpool-3-delayed-captain-america-brave-new-world-blade-thunderbolts-actors-strike"><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em></a><em> </em>— the studio’s first R-rated cape flick — makes it seem like it has just the thing.</p>
<p id="3IpxsD">In the new trailer, it’s unclear how much time has passed for Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) and his partner Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) since the end of <em>Deadpool  2</em>, or even if they’re exactly the same versions of those characters who appeared in that film. But when armored troops from <em>Loki</em>’s Time Variance Auth
