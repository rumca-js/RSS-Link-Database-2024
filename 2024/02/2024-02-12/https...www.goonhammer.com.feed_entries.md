Last year at Adepticon Raf sat down at the Artis Opus booth for a quick demo of their Series D drybrushes.

Following that demo Raf bought a brush and reached out [&#8230;]

I like big brush and I cannot lie. Specifically, Artis Opus Series S brushes. But what&#8217;s to love about these brushes, and why have they become must-haves in the hobby toolkit for some of us here at the Goonhammer Corporate Offices? Read on, dear reader, read on. But before we begin, I&#8217;d like to thank [&#8230;]

Brushes are the most important tool in a painter&#8217;s arsenal, and there are a lot of them out there. In particular there are a lot of shapes and styles. The Artis Opus Series S, reviewed by us here, represents a more traditional brush. If you&#8217;ve ever picked up a brush and painted a mini it&#8217;s [&#8230;]

This week&#8217;s Hammer of Math takes a quick look at the differences in efficacy between two Drukhari units that both contain an excessive number of sharp edges. Drukhari (or Dark Eldar back in 1998 when I played them) have always had a soft, overly spiky place in my heart. Thematically they&#8217;re fantastic; a race of [&#8230;]

Like many of the returning Warhammer Fantasy players getting into Game&#8217;s Workshops newest iteration of square-based fantasy battles I have a few edition&#8217;s worth of rules in my head. Whether you&#8217;re coming from an older edition of Warhammer Fantasy or brand new to this universe this acts as a helpful reminder to keep your games [&#8230;]

Honestly? Basing miniatures sucks. Mini production is hella sophisticated: they are modelled in complex 3D software, produced by a plastic injection molding industry that spans the planet or by a seemingly sci-fi-esque 3D printer that creates them from goo.
