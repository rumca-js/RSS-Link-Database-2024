There’s a lot of fantastic science communication on YouTube, but there’s also a lot of junk, and when doing the work right is more expensive, it can sometimes be hard to compete with the junk. That’s why crowdfunding is so important to what we do. 

SciShow videos reached more than 60 million viewers last year, yet those videos wouldn’t be possible without the support of our 4600 patrons. That's more than 10,000 viewers for every 1 supporter. That’s a rare kind of person!
