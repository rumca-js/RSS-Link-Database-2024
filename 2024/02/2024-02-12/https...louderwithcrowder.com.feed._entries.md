Trump, whose literal campaign was based on building a wall and stopping illegal immigration, is the reason Denver has to cut millions of dollars from city services to fund the alien invasion, at least according to the woke Mayor of Denver. But Trump does not take all the blame here. Denver‚Äôs joke of a mayor also has put some of the blame on Republicans. </p><p>In other news, Mayor Mike Johnston is the perfect embodiment of what one would call a "scapegoater."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

It also happens that those are the same individuals who would take offense and cry about a joke that the rest of the population wouldn‚Äôt even think twice about. </p><p>The Super Bowl has an ad where someone ate peanut butter and ended up getting an allergic reaction in the skit. But some group called the ‚ÄúFood Allergy Research & Education‚Äù has taken offense to that ad for no logical reason except the fact that they need attention. But the dumbest part about all of this is that Uber decided to listen to their asinine cries and edited the ad. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtub

He did not cry after that. But as far as we know, the only time he cried was when he was arrested for the crime. But someone should have told this psycho that in America we have the following saying: If you can‚Äôt do the time, don‚Äôt do the crime. </p><p>The teen was arrested the day after he shot a woman but was previously wanted for an armed robbery. </p><p>It is unclear as to why the migrant had a firearm considering it‚Äôs illegal to have one at that age and Democrats keep telling us that infringing on the Second Amendment will prevent illegal shootings, even though shooting someone is already illegal. So it appears that he has obtained the weapon unlawfully. This again is weird because I thought gun deaths would jump to zero if the De

And because these people are so incredibly fragile that their entire self-worth crumbles when society refuses to condone these lies, they pretend that the State of Florida is trying to ‚Äúerase their existence.‚Äù </p><p>But clearly, we are not dealing with mentally competent people because they are so dumb that they think a ‚Äústaged die-in‚Äù will be even remotely beneficial to their woke cause. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

## New from Planned Parenthood: If you haven't aborted them, you should ask your one-year-old what their preferred gender is

But none of that matters when we are talking about gender identity, at least according to Planned Parenthood.</p><p>The organization that is all about choosing to abort one's "choice" now recommends that parents should begin asking their kids about their gender between the ages of 1 and 3.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

The DOJ special council called him a senile old coot. Biden, in response, appeared before cameras and acted like a senile old coot. At this point, there was only one thing left for the White House to do. Drop a video on x that shows Biden as an old coot. Though, at least not senile.

Especially on the high school and college level, girls' sports and the unfairness of allowing girls who went through puberty as boys to compete in them has become a divisive issue in America. The rub is Dove didn't mention that at all, and made it a body image issue. </p><p>Not even a body image issue of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/girl-locker-room-chico-unified" target="_blank">girls having to change in front of boys in the girl's locker room</a>.

Though unlike what was promised by your favorite influencers, Travis Kelce didn't propose to anyone and no one endorsed Joe Biden. Weird, right? Among the celebrities in attendance, there was another guest of honor. Nine-year-old Chiefs fan Holden Armenta. The kid Deadspin attempted to smear as a raaaaaaacist.</p><p>To recap, young Holden Armenta went to a football game.
