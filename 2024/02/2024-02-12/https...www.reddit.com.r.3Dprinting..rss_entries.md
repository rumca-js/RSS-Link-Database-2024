Thanks to everyone that has helped improve this design!</p> <p>Here are the v2 update notes: - Magnets are no longer required for assembly (now only screws are required) - I also uploaded a variant titled (v2 - Front Plate Magnets) that still uses magnets on the Front Plate if you would like to be able to easily swap out the Front Plate without disassembling the entire speaker housing. - Decreased the amount of support material needed for the Main Housing - Improved tolerances on the Front
