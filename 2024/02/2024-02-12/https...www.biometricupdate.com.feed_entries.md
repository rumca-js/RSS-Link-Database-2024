		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/nec">NEC</a> has claimed the highest biometric accuracy score in four of eight categories in the latest assessment from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology’s 1:N Identification track, as of the January 22, 2024 <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/1N/frvt_1N_report.pdf">report</a>.

NEC scored the top accuracy assessment for matching mugshots against a database of 12 million, at 99.88 percent. The company’s biometric algorithm also topped the Kiosk, Border at ten or more years and Mugshot at 12 or more years categories.

		Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have exploded in quality and popularity. These technologies can create a variety of content including articles, posts and images with a simple prompt from a user.

Unfortunately, this evolution has also made it alarmingly simple for bad actors to scam their victims and spread disinformation. Bots armed with generative AI can open social media accounts, create posts with disinformation, and even have online conversations with victims who think they’re talking to a human, not a computer.

As a result, businesses are under greater pressure than ever to stop fraudsters and bots. In this guide, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/jumio">Jumio</a> explores the current trends in fraud and disi
