That\u2019s why crowdfunding is so important to what we do. \n\nSciShow videos reached more than 60 million viewers last year, yet those videos wouldn\u2019t be possible without the support of our 4600 patrons. That's more than 10,000 viewers for every 1 supporter. That\u2019s a rare kind of person! \n\nThe average SciShow patron gives about $5 a month, or $60 per year. So, if you\u2019d rather just give a year's worth all at once, I signed 3600 postcards and you can buy one for $60. I\u2019ll be bringing them to the post office to send out sometime in the next month or so. \n\nSo if you would like one, please get one at the link above. It will help us keep doing this work that we both love and know t", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/4xxWhNTlLiE/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "title": "Hank Green Eats Great or Gross Cookies While Signing Postcards | SciShow Livestream", "date_published": "2024-02-12T18:46:17+00:00", "language": null, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "tags": []}]
