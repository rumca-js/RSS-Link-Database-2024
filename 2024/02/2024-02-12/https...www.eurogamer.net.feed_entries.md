The Thaumaturge will now launch slightly later than planned, on 4th March, despite work on the game being complete. 
</p><p>
Writing on social media today, publisher 11 Bit Studios said it had actively chosen to delay the game due to "February's busy launch period". This month's releases include Ubisoft's Skull and Bones (on the 16th) and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (on the 29th). 
</p><p>
"The game is complete, but we want to give it space so it can be enjoyed the way we believe it deserves," the publisher wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/thaumaturgegame/status/1757058261616914703">post</a> on X. "See you in 1905 Warsaw and thank you for your patience!"

You may not know his name, but Richard Wells is one of the most-heard voices in video games - and now he's blowing up on TikTok.
</p><p>
Wells' TikTok account, which he created last Friday, now has over 17m views - mostly on his first video, where he reveals himself as the voice of video gaming's PEGI logos.
</p><p>
Yes, Wells voiced the "PEGI 12" and "PEGI 18" logos that play before video game trailers - and now, he's told fans he was only paid &euro;200 (&pound;170) years ago to do it.

## DF Weekly: what should expect from Xbox's business update this week?

In this week's DF Direct Weekly, we spend some quality time with Helldivers 2, get to grips with the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth demo and say a lot of positive things about the upcoming Penny's Big Breakaway - but discussion is dominated by the big Microsoft story. Just what's going on with its multi-platform plans? Why didn't the Xbox team provide immediate clarity and shut down rumours that have clearly spiralled out of control? If a 'business update' is coming this week, does that mean that some or all of the rumours are true? 
</p><p>
The rumours in question are suggesting that a number of Xbox-exclusive titles are on their way to other platforms. On the face of it, that's nothing new. A number of Xbox properties have transitioned across to rival platforms - including PlayStation. Acquired IPs such as Minecra

## Skald: Against the Black Priory stirs the emotional memories of retro RPGs

I ask because I just enabled a CRT filter in Skald: Against the Black Priory and I squealed with joy to see it. Distortedly curved edges: <em>phwoar - </em>who knew? What's strange is that I can distinctly remember when I binned CRTs off in favour of flat screens, wondering in wide-eyed awe at the visible corners of my screen. I didn't think then that I'd ever go back. And yet now: <em>squeal!</em> So old it's cool again.</p><p>It's not the only element of old that Skald: Against the Black Priory plays on. Really, the whole thing is dressed to evoke exactly that feeling, specifically for the C64 crowd. If you played an RPG there, or thereabouts, you'll know this. You'll know the turn-based combat, you'll know the text-dri

## Doctor Who boss dubs long-rumoured Fortnite collaboration "a complete myth"

Doctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies has responded to the long-running rumours of a full-on Fortnite collaboration, saying they are a "myth". 
</p><p>
Responding to a Doctor Who fan via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Mz9JFNdW5/">Instagram</a>, Davies said of the long-expected Fortnite tie-in: "There isn't one! It's a complete myth, I'm afraid."
</p><p>
The news has come as a surprise to many Fortnite fans expecting David Tennant and current TARDIS incumbent Ncuti Gatwa to both stroll into Fortnite's metaverse sometime in the near future.

The demo for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-we-know-about-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> has been out a week and, beyond <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-fans-are-getting-creative-with-its-in-game-piano">sharing piano covers</a>, now players are arguing about yellow paint.
</p><p>
It's a familiar trope in many video games: essentially, developers indicate the correct path by adding bright yellow paint to scalable ledges and ladders.
</p><p>
It's also a debate that has raged for years. When the Resident Evil 4 remake demo was released, players complained about yellow paint being used on breakable objects. Now the discourse has erupted again.

"In order to do so," the studio added, "right now it is crucial that our team gets some sleep and we will be back at this again in a few hours".</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogame

It needs to sing. It needs to be explosive, or at least thoroughly radioactive. More than anything, it needs to upend any breezy certainties that elements one and two have lulled you into. It needs to be an agent of rapid recontextualisation.</p><p>Thank you for attending my TED Talk. And look at the giant screen behind me and you'll see Ultros, a Metroidvania that mints pure gold from the rule of three. What are we in for here? Action, exploration, and gardening. Wait. Gardening?
