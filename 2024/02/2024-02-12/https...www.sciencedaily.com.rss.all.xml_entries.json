The findings describe a previously unknown part of the geological carbon cycle in transform faults that represent one of the three principal plate boundaries on Earth. The confluence of tectonically exhumed mantle rocks and CO2-rich alkaline basalt formed through limited extents of melting characteristic of the St. Paul's transform faults may be a pervasive feature at oceanic transform faults in general. Because transform faults have not been accounted for in previous estimates of global geological CO2 fluxes, the mass transfer of magmatic CO2 to the altered oceanic mantle and seawater may be larger than previously thought.", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "title": "Researchers studying ocean transform faults, describe a previously unknown part of the geological carbon cycle", "date_published": "2024-02-12T15:35:19+00:00", "language": "en-us", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "tags": []}]
