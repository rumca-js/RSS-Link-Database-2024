<p>Coding in the ’90s usually meant selecting an editor, checking code into CVS or SVN code repositories, and then compiling code into executables. Integrated development environments (IDEs) like Eclipse and Visual Studio improved productivity by including coding, development, documentation, building, testing, deploying, and other steps in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2683784/what-is-cloud-computing.html">Cloud computing</a> and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3681097/what-is-devsecops-securing-devops-pipelines.html">DevSecOps</a> automation tools brought in the next wave of developer capabilities, making it easier for more organizations to develop, deploy, and maintain applications.  </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712826/10-ways-generative-ai-will-transform-software-development.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

In other words, “Code generated during 2023 … resembles [that of] an itinerant contributor,” as if you hired a short-term contractor more concerned with cranking out verbose code than ensuring its maintainability. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712685/is-ai-making-our-code-stupid.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
