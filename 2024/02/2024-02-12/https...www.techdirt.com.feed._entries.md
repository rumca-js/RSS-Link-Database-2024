Stop-start. Push-pull. Yank-tug. That&#8217;s the way things have been going in the UK. One would expect better performance from lawmakers with a hard-on for porn. No. Not that way. (Although, maybe that way.) The UK government has spent several years trying to talk service providers, recalcitrant legislators, and the general public into trading away a [&#8230;]

In the fall of 2022 an apparent investor in a cryptocurrency called “Bitcoin Latinum” sued the guy behind the currency, Donald Basile. You can see the whole case here. There has been a bunch of back and forth on the docket, but it appears the remaining parties at some point went to binding arbitration. Soon [&#8230;]

Last fall, we detailed the many, many, many, many problems of Elon Musk’s absolutely bullshit ridiculous lawsuit against Media Matters. Again, if you don’t recall, Media Matters found some examples of neo-Nazi content on ExTwitter appearing next to ads from big name brands.

Every few weeks for the last fifteen years there’s been a massive scandal involving some company, telecom, data broker, or app maker&#160;over-collecting&#160;your detailed&#160;personal location data, failing to secure it, then selling access to that information to&#160;any nitwit with a nickel.
