Pumpkin toadlets are in trouble. Progressively severe droughts are disrupting the microbiomes of the thumbnail-sized orange frogs, potentially leaving them vulnerable to a deadly fungal disease, according to a new study by an international research team. The finding suggests that abnormal rainfall patterns, which are expected to worsen due to climate change and deforestation, may upset mutually beneficial relationships between wildlife and microorganisms, leading to biodiversity decline.

Using data from the retired Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA)—a joint project of NASA and the German Space Agency at DLR—Southwest Research Institute scientists have discovered, for the first time, water molecules on the surface of an asteroid. Scientists looked at four silicate-rich asteroids using the FORCAST instrument to isolate the mid-infrared spectral signatures indicative of molecular water on two of them.

Sea urchins exposed to diluted seawater for long periods show signs of physical deterioration, according to scientists from the British Antarctic Survey, the University of Cambridge, and the Scottish Association for Marine Science. Their study also found that even slight changes in salinity—or saltiness—trigger changes in urchin behavior as they try to cope with their new conditions.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible, neurodegenerative disorder in deer that causes inability to eat, stumbling, drooling, and lack of fear of humans, and in all cases is ultimately fatal. "You can have deer that are infected live for two or more years, and it can take a very long time before they show clinical signs of it," says Michelle Gibison, diagnostic laboratory testing manager at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine's Wildlife Futures Program. That means they can infect other deer in that time.

Vehicles in ditches and medians. Nights without power and heat. Injuries suffered. Lives lost. For those in the Midwest, where the frying pan of summer gives way to the snow globe of winter, the scenes of a blizzard are familiar for their frequency. Of the nearly 13,000 U.S. blizzards documented between 1996 and 2020, more than 10,000 struck the northern Plains and Upper Midwest.

66 million years ago, the last dinosaurs vanished from Earth. We're still trying to understand why. New fossils of abelisaurs—distant relatives of the tyrannosaurs—from north Africa suggest that African dinosaurs remained diverse up to the very end. And that suggests their demise came suddenly, with the impact of a giant asteroid.

In diamonds (and other semiconducting materials), defects are a quantum sensor's best friend. That's because defects, essentially a jostled arrangement of atoms, sometimes contain electrons with an angular momentum, or spin, that can store and process information. This "spin degree of freedom" can be harnessed for a range of purposes, such as sensing magnetic fields or making a quantum network.

The Venosta Valley is located in South Tyrol, which is primarily associated with mountains and nature. In this region in the North of Italy, more than 7,000 apple growers produce 10% of all European apples. Conventional apple cultivation relies primarily on synthetic pesticides, which are applied by fan-assisted sprayers: insecticides to combat pests such as the codling moth and fungicides against fungal diseases that cause scabs on the fruit. This results in a high level of drift into the environment, especially in windy conditions.
