<p>Houston-based space company Intuitive Machines is gearing up for an actual moonshot at the end of this month, when it‚Äôll try to land a spacecraft named Odysseus on the lunar surface ‚Äî ideally without it breaking in the process. The mission follows Astrobotic‚Äôs unsuccessful attempt in January; that company‚Äôs lander, Peregrine, never made it to the moon due to a propellant leak that cut its journey short. Peregrine‚Äôs failure means <a href="https://www.intuitivemachines.com/im-1">Intuitive Machines‚Äô IM-1</a> mission could be the first ever commercial moon landing if it makes it there intact.</p>
<p>Intuitive Machines is hoping to make its landing attempt on February 22, targeting the Malapert A crater near the moon‚Äôs south pole for touchdown. This arrival date is dependent on Odysseus, one of the company‚Äôs Nova-C class landers, leaving Earth atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket sometime between February 14 and February 16. The launch window opens at 12:57AM ET on Wed

<p>The Food and Drug Administration has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-gets-fda-approval-for-a-sleep-apnea-feature-on-galaxy-watch-172856948.html">given the green light</a> to a sleep apnea detection feature on Galaxy Watch devices in the US. It has already picked up approval in South Korea, but Samsung says this is the first approval of its kind in the US.</p>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects around 25 percent of men and a tenth of women in the US, according to the National Sleep Foundation. And it can get serious. Left untreated, it can increase the risks of heart attacks and strokes.</p>
<p>With the feature, people over 22 who have not been diagnosed with the condition can check for signs of sleep apnea using their smartwatch and phone. It looks for signs of moderate-to-severe OSA over a two-night monitoring period. To use the feature, users must track their sleep for more than four hours twice over ten days.</p>
