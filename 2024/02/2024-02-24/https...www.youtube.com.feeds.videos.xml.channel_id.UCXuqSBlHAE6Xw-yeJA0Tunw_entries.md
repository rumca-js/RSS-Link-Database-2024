We were SHOCKED to spot high end gaming peripherals at the auto parts store, but things aren’t always what they seem. Mice, Keyboards, Headsets and Speakers. ALL RGB! These look like Razer but truthfully, you’d be k-razer to buy them from the Hardware and Auto store like we did. Except for one budget device that costs less than $10 that is actually pretty okay.
