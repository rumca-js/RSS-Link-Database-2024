<p>Unbound and unhinged, ex-president vilifies immigrants before devolving into bizarre riffs, including calling himself a ‘total genius’</p><p>Donald Trump styled himself as a “proud political dissident” and promised “judgment day” for political opponents in an address that offered a chilling vision of a democracy in imminent peril.</p><p>In classic carnival barker form, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination accused Joe Biden of weaponising the government against him with “Stalinist show trials”. He pledged to crack down on border security and deliver the biggest deportation in US history if he wins the 5 November election.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/24/donald-trump-cpac-speech">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 20-year-old has burst on to the scene at Liverpool this season and has Chelsea in his sights again in Carabao Cup final</p><p>Conor Bradley is four Premier League games into his Liverpool career but Sunday’s Carabao Cup final opponents Chelsea already know that the right-back is a gamechanger. In their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/31/liverpool-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">league encounter last month</a>, the Northern Ireland international created two goals and scored another in a thumping victory to announce his arrival on the scene.</p><p>Ben Chilwell, his opposite number on the night, lasted 45 torrid minutes as he learned very quickly that despite Bradley’s lack of experience, he is a fearless talent.

<p>This was one of those games whereby Pep Guardiola’s body language told almost all of the story. Manchester City may have cut Liverpool’s advantage at the top to a point but the manner of victory was more pair of scissors than sledgehammer. The sight of Guardiola crouching on the edge of his technical area, nervously peering either side of the assistant referee, Darren Cann, to assess the picture as Bournemouth pushed to breaking point in search of an equaliser provided a snapshot of quite how uncomfortable a ride this turned out to be.</p><p>Phil Foden scored the only goal of the game with Erling Haaland uncharacteristically blunt in attack but by the end Guardiola felt the need to introduce Kevin De Bruyne with six minutes of normal time to play. Even after that the Bournemouth substitutes Dango Ouattara and Enes Ünal went close to replying, the latter heading wide. Bournemouth have not won in seven matches but should take heart from taking the champions all the way.</p>

## Alex Iwobi’s late reply stuns Manchester United as Fulham conquer Old Trafford

<p>On this showing the “perch” Sir Jim Ratcliffe wishes Manchester United to knock Manchester City off is atop a kilometre-high skyscraper and the new 27.7% owner’s side is peering up from ground level as, from 88 minutes here, chaos ensued. It was bookended by Alex Iwobi’s 97th-minute winner and the Harry Maguire equaliser that cancelled out Calvin Bassey’s opener.</p><p>Iwobi’s strike came from the latest Fulham break to punch through Erik ten Hag’s men. Adama Traoré, on as substitute, skipped infield from the right and tapped to the No 22. With no United defenders anywhere near, he teased André Onana with a dawdle, then beat the home goalkeeper to his right to send Fulham into raptures, the travelling fans taunting their counterparts with hearty choruses of “Who are you?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/24/manchester-united-fulham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Crystal Palace sink 10-man Burnley to give Oliver Glasner winning start

<p>Crystal Palace stood in the darkness, staring at the horizon. Would there ever be a glimmer of light? Would black ever ease to grey? When dawn did at last arrive, it blazed suddenly into a glorious morning. There may have been a slightly unreal sense about it but it was hugely welcome after the persistent drizzle of the past few months.</p><p>The truth, though, is that Palace will face few sides who collapse quite as abjectly as Burnley did and that, for a long time, the sunshine was unconvincing. Without Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise, this simply isn’t a creative squad, but they had more than enough to overcome a limp Burnley who are now eight points from safety and surely doomed. Palace, eight points clear of the relegation zone and with two of the sides below them facing potential points deductions, should be safe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/24/crystal-palace-burnley-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Growing up in Hull, <a href="https://blanchepictures.com/">Esther Johnson</a> loved the city’s distinctive cream telephone boxes. The artist and film-maker has now tracked down and photographed the remaining K8 kiosks, designed by architect Bruce Martin in the mid-1960s. “It’s a slick, functional design – modern and quite space-age, for the time,” she says. Nine of these kiosks, in the local Honeysuckle Cream tone, were given Grade II-listed status in February 2023. “The series isn’t just about nostalgia – it’s about noticing what’s in your environment and preserving these things for future generations,” says Johnson. “Hull sometimes gets a bad rap, but there’s a lot of charm to the city.”</p><ul><li><em><a href="https://the-modernist.org/collections/books/products/the-beacons-of-hull">The Beacons of Hull</a></em><a href="https://the-modernist.org/collections/books/products/the-beacons-of-hull"> is published by The Modernist</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.c

Encompassing everything from nimble jazz scatting to luscious orchestrations and breathy phrases that soar over bata drums and Santería folk rhythms, Arocena’s four albums have explored the joyous range of Afro Cuban music. Her latest record is a departure. Where Arocena has previously made music rooted in acoustic improvisation, <em>Alkemi </em>veers into Latin pop with 10 tracks of earworming hooks, synth melody and snapping electronic percussion.</p><p>Opener Que Se Lo Lleve el Mar sets the tone, establishing stacked harmonies of Arocena’s husky voice over minimal synth stabs before erupting into an infectious double-time shuffle.

A designer who likes to put his mark on things</p><p>In his 1994 movie <em>London</em>, a classic of poetical-geographical film-making, its director-writer Patrick Keiller speculates that the BT tower, that rises on the site that once contained a flat inhabited by Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud, is a secret monument to the French poets’ love. This is one of many instances of this structure’s ability to generate myths – legend also had it that, as military secret, it couldn’t be shown on Ordnance Survey maps. With its slender vertical fuselage and long-stalled revolving restaurant, it speaks of the hopeful futurism of the 1960s, of the white heat of technology, of Minis and miniskirts and the Beatles.</p><p>Its sale, for £275m, by BT to a hotel group, if it gives the tower a secure future, is welcome.

<p>Maksim Kuzminov flew a Russian miltary helicopter to Ukraine. Armed with a new identity, he moved to a Spanish resort.

My sister Emily was home for the holidays, having completed her first term at her new educational institution – where she had been sent against her will by social services after years of severe school phobia. Somehow, miraculously, she was happy. There were still a few clouds in the sky – some of the other kids were disruptive, and she missed her old life and family – but it was going to be OK.</p><p>I was 12, only a year from being a teenager, and the holidays stretched out before us.

<p>With millennia of history hidden beneath our feet, connecting with the ancient past offers endless fascination, and many ways to get involved<br /></p><p>When I was a teenager, I watched a TV documentary about a frozen human body that had been discovered at the summit of Mount Ampato in Peru. Dubbed “Juanita” or the Incan ice mummy, this girl had been a human sacrifice, killed in about 1450 at the age of 14 or so – the same age I was. Her body had mummified, preserved in the permafrost, which meant her clothes, her hair, even her stomach, containing her last meal, were all still intact.</p><p>Using a battery of scientific techniques, as well as historical and anthropological knowledge, the anthropologist-archaeologist-mountaineers who discovered Juanita were able to unpick the story of her final months, weeks and hours. I was astounded to learn that discovering and explaining such mysteries could be an actual job. Anthropology and archaeology, and the challenge of making t

The first packaging we got rid of was the cellophane wrapping from cucumbers simply by buying them from a different producer. We then set about reducing our compost and recycling further by working closely with suppliers and by cooking from root-to-fruit, using whole seasonal ingredients; I’ve even been known to dig through the compost in search of ingredients that would otherwise go to waste.
