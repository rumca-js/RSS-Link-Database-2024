When I play an N-player game I want everyone to both:

</span>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li>Try to win
</li>
<li>Win about 1/N of the time

</li>
</ul>



<p>

With many games and groups of participants these are in conflict: if I
play bridge against my kids I'm going to win all the time, but I'm not
very good at the game so if I play against people who are serious
about it I'm going to lose ~all the time.

<p>

One way some games handle this is by including a lot of luck.  The
more random the outcomes are, the more you'll approach 1/N regardless
of player skill.  Kid games where you make no choices, like

or War, take this to the extreme.

Instead, I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicapping">handicapping</a> is
a much better approach.  For example in Go the weaker player can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicapping_in_Go">start with
several stones already on
