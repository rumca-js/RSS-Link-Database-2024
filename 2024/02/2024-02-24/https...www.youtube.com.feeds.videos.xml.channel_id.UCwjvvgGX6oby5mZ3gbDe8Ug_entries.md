According to Chinese media Caixin.com, on February 12, 2024, Angela Chao, Chairman and CEO of Foremost Group, a large U.S. shipping company, passed away at the age of 50 in a car accident. For China's shipbuilding industry, “Foremost" is a famous name. It’s one of the first Western shipping companies to buy ocean-going vessels from China, and China's largest customer for ship exports to the U.S. In January 2024, half a month before Angela’s death, the Foremost Group had placed an order worth $168 million with a subsidiary of the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). 
Angela’s family is known in overseas Chinese circles as "The First Chinese American Family." Her father James Chao is the 96-year-old founder of the Foremost Group and has been dubbed “Chinese Ship King.”
