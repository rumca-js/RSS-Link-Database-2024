But the progressive bandwagon has decided to add morbidly obese people on the victim train through the guise of ‚Äúbody positivity.‚Äù And because of all that, we now have the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque offering a course on ‚Äúfat studies‚Äù where students are learning that ‚Äúanti-fatness‚Äù is a form of oppression. </p><p>At this point, can we please get a list of groups that aren‚Äôt oppressed? Because I that would be much easier at this point. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do when they come for you? </p><p>It‚Äôs one thing to get arrested as a cop. But that does not compare to getting arrested while in uniform. But none of that compares to getting arrested in uniform and getting taken away in your police cruiser. And that story is exactly what we have for you. </p><p>A female officer was on duty when she stole a pair of shoes worth $140 from Dick's Sporting Goods. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
