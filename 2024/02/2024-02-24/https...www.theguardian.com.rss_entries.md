<ul><li>Wigan 16-12 Penrith</li><li>Jake Wardle’s second-half try beats Australians</li></ul><p>Are the tectonic plates in club rugby league shifting? Is Super League finally catching up with the NRL? The truthful answer is: who knows? And right now, try asking anyone associated with Wigan Warriors if they even care. All that matters to this town where rugby league means more than almost everything else is that once again, they are the kings of the club game.</p><p>The talk all week had been how this group of players who have now won every trophy there is to win since Matt Peet took charge little over two years ago had their own chance to follow in the footsteps of legends who have won this title on four occasions in the past for Wigan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/24/wigan-penrith-world-club-challenge-rugby-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Killing’s Sofie Gråbøl leads a cast of officers and inmates in an impossibly taut and compelling series. It’s all-action right from the start – utterly gripping</p><p>Prisoner throws you right into the melee from the very start and barely pauses to surface for air. There is no slow buildup to the action here, only a practice prison riot and a sense that all is not as it appears to be. It treats its viewers as intelligent and capable, throwing character after character on to the screen, while drip-feeding the plot in small and tantalising portions. The reward is a mature, gripping drama about the complexities of the modern-day prison system in Denmark. No, come back! If Borgen taught us anything, it’s that the Danes are impeccable at turning bureaucracy into thrilling drama. It really is gripping, I promise.</p><p>The Killing’s Sofie Gråbøl is the big name here, but she’s part of an ensemble cast, as we see a crumbling prison through the eyes of four officers who take v

Instead, the House of Commons descended into procedural chaos and angry recriminations last Wednesday after the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, broke with parliamentary convention to allow MPs to vote on a Labour, as well as the government’s, amendment to the SNP’s opposition day motion on a ceasefire. Rather than focusing on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza that is escalating with each day that passes, the Commons drew itself into a pointless blame game that has led to days of speculation over Hoyle’s future.</p><p>Every party involved – the SNP, Labour and the Conservatives – claimed the moral high ground in Wednesday’s debate, while accusing the others of undermining a critical discussion in their own interests.

<p>Many older people in large homes would like to release them to growing families, but the financial hit can be huge</p><p>What’s standing in the way of downsizing for Gail, 58, from Manchester – who is self-employed and lives with her partner in a five-bed house she would like to swap for a smaller home? “Simply the cost of stamp duty. We live in an expensive area, so downsizing will cost us a lot in stamp duty, far more than we would save by having lower bills.”</p><p>In England and Northern Ireland, stamp duty land tax is charged on properties costing more than £250,000, unless you are a first-time buyer. In Wales, its equivalent applies to homes costing more than £225,000, and in Scotland it starts at £145,000. For a property costing £450,000 in England, it means a bill of £10,000 if you are not buying your first home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/feb/24/it-makes-moving-pointless-why-stamp-duty-is-the-biggest-downside-to-downsizing">Continue readin

<p>Learn the skills to unearth our ancient history – from excavations for children in York to guided walks along the Thames and residential courses in Wales</p><p>As the north-west frontier of the Roman empire, Northumberland is scattered with Roman sites, including numerous forts that housed the soldiers who guarded these unruly borderlands. Many are still being excavated, including Vindolanda and Magna forts just south of Hadrian’s Wall. The first modern excavation kicked off at Magna last spring, and the dig season at both runs from April to September – visitors can watch the archaeologists at work Monday to Friday (they take volunteers too, although 2024 is fully booked). One of Vindolanda’s most important treasures is the Vindolanda writing tablets (thin hand-written wooden notes of life there 2,000 years ago), which will be on display as part of the new <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/legion-life-roman-army?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8YyuBhBSEiwA5

The race is on!</p><p>I stand on a grassy slope, gazing at the impending mountain. Mist billows at its ridges, charging into the sky. I begin the climb upward towards the Bannau Brycheiniog mountain range.</p><p>As the grass gives way to sandstone slabs, the air shifts and a coolness arrives. I check my supplies again. My compass, inherited from my grandad, a map, and extra coat are all in my bag. I need to be prepared for unpredictable weather. When I reach the crossway to the first peak, Corn Du, wisps of mist are spiralling alongside the track, beckoning me forwards.

<p>The activist and writer talks about fighting racial segregation, dealing with mobsters – and why her sense of outrage is undiminished</p><p>Nikki Giovanni was born on the&nbsp;wrong side of the tracks, in&nbsp;Knoxville, Tennessee, on Mulvaney Street, during the era of segregation. Now 80, she remembers her childhood in a red-lined neighbourhood, demarcating a cordon sanitaire separating it from prosperous white suburbs. “My grandfather was a Latin teacher. He’d sit on the porch [after school] and people would come by saying ‘Evening ’fessor’. Reverend Abrams lived on the other side of our street and Mrs Abrams raised chickens. We built a church and there was a real community but now … ”</p><p>Now, the neighbourhood has been taken over by gentrifying middle-class white people, a development that Giovanni, barely masking her fury, struggles to find a word to describe, before settling on “unfair”. More words will come in her forthcoming memoir, A Street Called Mulvaney<em>.<
