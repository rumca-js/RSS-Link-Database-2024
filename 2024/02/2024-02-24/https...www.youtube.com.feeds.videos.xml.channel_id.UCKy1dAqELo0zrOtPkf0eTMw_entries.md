## Movie Trailers That Blatantly Lied to Us

Movie trailers are designed to sell us on a product, but they‚Äôre not always 100% honest. Sometimes they misrepresent the tone or plot. Sometimes they feature dialogue or entire scenes that aren‚Äôt actually in the final product. Madame Web is the latest example of that latter trend. The movie became an Internet meme on the back of one line from star Dakota Johnson, and it turns out that full line isn‚Äôt even in the final cut.

We thought it might be fun to look back at the movie trailers most guilty of misleading viewers, from classics like Alien 3 and Ferris Bueller's Day Off to modern superhero epics like Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: No Way Home. Whether it‚Äôs featuring characters not in the final product or conveniently disguising the fact that a movie is a musical, these are the trailers that blatantly lied to us. For shame!

Last Epoch reviewed by Gabriel Moss on PC.

Last Epoch is an impressive, time-bending action RPG that combines rich customization with modern action. In the mechanical sense, it serves as an important stepping stone between Diablo and Path of Exile ‚Äì but even without making direct comparisons, it competently stands on its own merits thanks to a flurry of unique, intertwining systems and a strong endgame that make it difficult to resist pouring an entire weekend into its endless loops. Just don‚Äôt let its poorly told story or the handful of bugs that have yet to be squashed discourage you from seeing this adventure through to the end of time.
