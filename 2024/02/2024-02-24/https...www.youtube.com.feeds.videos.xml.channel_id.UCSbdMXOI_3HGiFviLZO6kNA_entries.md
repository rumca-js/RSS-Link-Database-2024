Hello and welcome to TUESD- I mean.. Saturday Newsday! Quest 3 and Pro just got some pretty awesome hand tracking upgrades that I have been eagerly anticipating, brain computer interfaces take another step towards becoming a "consumer product", PSVR 2 is receiving official PC support, new VR headsets! A LOT has happened! I hope you enjoy!
