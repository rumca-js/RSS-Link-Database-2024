SPICE guidance kits, being sent to Israel by the U.S., attach to 1,000 or 2,000 pound “dumb” bombs, turning them into precision guided munitions. The goal of guidance kits like SPICE and JDAMs is to enhance accuracy while minimizing non-combatant casualties. As Israel continues to target Hamas, concerns of civilian casualties in Gaza remain a critical issue. 

WSJ explains how SPICE kits work and the benefit of the IDF using this weapon attachment in Gaza.
