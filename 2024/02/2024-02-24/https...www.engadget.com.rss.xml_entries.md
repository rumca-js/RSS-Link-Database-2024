<p>It turns out Intuitive Machines’ Odysseus spacecraft didn’t land upright after all. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEwR8fscFY"><ins>press conference</ins></a> with NASA Friday evening, the company revealed the lander is laying on its side after coming in a little faster than expected, likely catching its foot on the surface at the moment of landing. Fortunately, Odysseus is positioned in such a way that its solar panels are still getting enough light from the sun to keep it charged, and the team has been able to communicate with it. Pictures from the surface should be coming soon.</p>
<p>While the initial assessment was that Odysseus had landed properly, further analysis indicated otherwise. Intuitive Machines CEO and co-founder Steve Altemus said “stale telemetry” was to blame for the earlier reading. All payloads except the one static art installation, though — Jeff Koons’ Moon Phases sculptures — are on the upturned side. The lander and its NASA science

<p>No one is suggesting that Microsoft should stop making video game hardware. What we've been considering, here in the dark and twisted Engadget Slack channels, is whether Microsoft should keep making generationally distinct consoles in the traditional hardware cycle. Basically, does Xbox need a box? Microsoft has been busy building the foundation of a platform-agnostic, cloud-first future for video games, and it consistently falls behind both Sony and Nintendo in the console race. So why are executives trying to get us excited about a superpowered 10th-gen Xbox?</p>
<p>Maybe Microsoft is hesitant to reveal a drastic ecosystem change after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-06-06-how-game-licensing-works-on-the-xbox-one.html">the chaos</a> around the Xbox One and its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-06-06-xbox-one-requires-online-connection-every-24-hours-at-least.html">always-on DRM</a> features in 2013.

<p>X is slowly rolling out audio and video calling to users that don't pay for its premium subscription service that's formerly known as Twitter Blue. Enrique Barragan, an engineer for the company, has shared the news on the platform. The company initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/x-is-rolling-out-audio-and-video-calling-feature-nobody-asked-for-205836943.html">launched the feature for iOS users</a> last year, giving paying subscribers the option to call other people through the app, and was a step towards making X the &quot;everything&quot; application Elon Musk wants it to be. Earlier this year, the capability made its way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/19/24043950/x-premium-audio-video-calling-feature-android-rollout-announcement">Android devices</a>, but the ability to make calls remained limited to Premium subscribers only.</p>
<p>By the end of January, Musk said that X will make audio-video calling available to everyone as soon as the company is co

Prabhakar Raghavan, the company's Senior Vice President for Knowledge &amp; Information, explained that Google's efforts to ensure that the chatbot would generate images showing a wide range of people &quot;failed to account for cases that should clearly not show a range.&quot; Further, its AI model grew to become &quot;way more cautious&quot; over time and refused to answer
