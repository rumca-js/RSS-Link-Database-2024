But the progressive bandwagon has decided to add morbidly obese people on the victim train through the guise of \u201a\u00c4\u00fabody positivity.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 And because of all that, we now have the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque offering a course on \u201a\u00c4\u00fafat studies\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 where students are learning that \u201a\u00c4\u00faanti-fatness\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 is a form of oppression. </p><p>At this point, can we please get a list of groups that aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t oppressed? Because I that would be much easier at this point. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u201a\u00c4\u00ee  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/campusreform/status/1758942273755046141\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.campusreform.or", "title": "Your \u201a\u00c4\u00faanti-fatness\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 is form of oppression, says new college course that helps fatties \"put together a plus-sized outfit\"", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fat-studies-course", "permanent": false, "source_obj__id": 41, "page_rating_votes": 0, "album": "", "date_published": "2024-02-24T13:45:20+00:00", "user": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": null, "source": "https://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=51550471&width=980", "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0}, {"age": null, "comments": [], "dead": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": false, "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=51554521&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=90%2C0%2C111%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>Bad cops, bad cops.
