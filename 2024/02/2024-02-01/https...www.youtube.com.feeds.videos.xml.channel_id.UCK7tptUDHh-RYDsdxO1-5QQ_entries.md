The U.S. is shipping Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bombs to Ukraine, according to a U.S. defense official. The GLSDB is a precision-guided bomb that attaches to a M26 rocket and is considerably cheaper than other long-range missile systems like ATACMS. 

While the GLSDBs won’t be Kyiv’s most powerful or longest-range weapon, WSJ explains how they could add significant flexibility and capacity for military operations.

Since WWII, the U.S. has provided more foreign aid to Israel than any other country, giving about $3.8 billion a year in economic and military aid. Given disagreement over the ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza, the future of this arrangement is now uncertain. Could vocal calls for pausing aid, mainly from the left wing of the Democratic Party like Sen Bernie Sanders, lead to a rejection of Biden’s security assistance package?

WSJ explores why Israel still receives so much aid from the U.S. and examines the current fight over conditional aid.
