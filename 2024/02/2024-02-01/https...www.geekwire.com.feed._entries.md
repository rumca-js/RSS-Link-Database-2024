But now the impacts of a hybrid workforce and ongoing tech industry layoffs are taking some shine off the boomtown — and what comes next is unclear. Office vacancies are on the rise. Parts of Amazon&#8217;s big construction plans are on pause. Meta and Microsoft put space on the sublease market. But supporters say Bellevue is still an appealing alternative to Seattle.

This Sunday, Feb. 4 marks 10 years of Satya at the helm of the second company in the world to reach a $3 trillion market cap. This is no small feat given that Microsoft wasn’t even part of FAANG, the name Jim Cramer coined in 2013 for the tech stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) driving the market and consumer mindshare.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsofts-resurgence-reflecting-on-satya-nadellas-leadership-a-decade-after-he-became-ceo/">Read More</a>
