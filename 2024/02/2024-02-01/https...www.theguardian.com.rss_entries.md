<p>It may not have been the ideal debut for Kalvin Phillips, but in the end it was a point well-earned for West Ham. Having gone behind to Dominic Solanke’s early opener, a goal which came thanks to a glaring error from their new arrival, James Ward-Prowse’s second-half penalty was enough to secure a hard-won draw.</p><p>As they emerged from the flurry of bubbles before kick-off, both sides set out to end a two-match winless run in the league. The visitors found themselves in a trickier spot after back-to-back defeats, while the hosts looked to shake off consecutive draws, though Bournemouth had at least barrelled through two rounds of the FA Cup in the interim. Andoni Iraola’s side have been among the league’s streakiest this season, starting so sluggishly, bursting into form and then hitting a brick wall against Tottenham and Liverpool. It looked as if they might have got a taste for victory again here, but West Ham had other ideas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/

Then, he attacks his accusers, or anyone involved in bringing him to account, usually of committing the identical offense of which he stands accused.</p><p>But it is not enough for him to lash out. Then, he declares himself to be the victim. Whatever it is, he is falsely accused.

<p>SB 1780 would make it defamation to accuse someone of homophobia, transphobia, racism or sexism and punishable by fine</p><p>By day two of Florida’s legislative session, which started last month, lawmakers had introduced nearly 20 anti-gay or anti-trans bills. One such bill, <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/1780">SB 1780,</a> would make accusing someone of being homophobic, transphobic, racist or sexist, even if the accusation is true, equivalent to defamation, and punishable by a fine of at least $35,000. If passed, the bill would severely limit and punish constitutionally protected free speech in the state.</p><p>Though SB 1780 is not likely to survive past higher courts, its introduction is indicative of a wider conservative strategy to stifle criticism of racist, sexist and homophobic behavior. The bill, critics argue, is being introduced to test the waters and see how far, legally, lawmakers can go until they are able to silence detractors.</p> <a h

<p>Former tennis player and respected tournament referee at the Wimbledon Championships for more than 20 years</p><p>There are few more prestigious roles in the world of tennis than Wimbledon referee. Alan Mills, who has died aged 88, held the position with quiet distinction for 23 years, from 1983 to 2005.</p><p>If this suggests a career sailing on smooth seas, the impression would be false. Being the final arbiter during a fortnight of fierce sporting competition in the full glare of a global spotlight would, rightly, suggest a job of greater turbulence. Throw in personalities bursting with the talent and temperament of John McEnroe, Ilie Năstase, Boris Becker and others of equal untamed ambition, and it becomes clear special qualities of one’s own are required to keep the Championships from imploding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/01/alan-mills-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cork Dork author Bianca Bosker has turned her gaze toward art with her new book, trying to immerse herself in a world that wanted nothing to do with her</p><p>There are few more self-congratulatory terms in the world of journalism than the “deep dive”, but Bianca Bosker has earned the right to get those two words tattooed on any body part of her choosing. She doesn’t sit with and sift through her material so much as plunge headlong into it, gatecrashing cloistered ecosystems that want nothing to do with her, and emerging as a foremost expert. In her 2017 debut Cork Dork, Bosker was brave enough to infiltrate the realm of wine snobs and attempt to pass the notoriously difficult sommelier test (spoiler alert: she succeeded). The latest object of the New Yorker’s fascination – and frustration – is the realm of contemporary art, a micro-society populated by uber-cool gallerists, uber-rich collectors, and the countless starving artists and sad-sack wannabes firing up their Sees

<p><strong>(Alpha)<br /></strong>The Gothenburg Symphony are outstanding in this all Sibelius disc, but chief conductor Santtu-Matias Rouvali’s fresh approach  doesn’t always bring rewards</p><p>The previous releases in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/oct/19/philharmonia-principal-conductor-santtu-matias-rouvali-interview">Santtu-Matias Rouvali’s Sibelius series</a> for Alpha have had a mixed reception; this latest instalment demonstrates why. Very much on the plus side is the outstanding playing of the Gothenburg orchestra, which is bold, incisive and rich toned, with strikingly fine brass. On the negative are many aspects of Rouvali’s interpretations, which often seem to try just a bit too hard to be fresh and original.</p><p>Such a moment-by-moment approach is going to be far more effective in the pictorial narratives of a tone poem than in one of Sibelius’s carefully wrought symphonic structures, and it’s hardly surprising that it’s the thrilling performan

It was unlikely your baby girl would need to fight for the right to be called Isla in school without the qualifying initial of her last name. Now, the name has become my generation’s answer to “Jessica”. All babies born from the late noughties called Isla are now destined for a lifetime of saying “Isla with an S” when they order iced lattes

<p>Customs officers and scientists are working together to combat the highly lucrative illicit trade in wildlife meat that is helping to push some species to extinction</p><p>At Brussels airport, customs staff are digging into suitcases and cooler boxes full of charred meats and fish. There are boxes of flies with shrivelled dead caterpillars and juicy live ones. It is 6am, and they are checking all hold luggage from four morning flights – three from Africa and one from China – in an attempt to stem the flow of illegal meat from wildlife making its way into Europe via this major transit hub. There is a lingering smell of dried seafood.</p><p>Staff here are used to finding all kinds of creatures in baggage, from a 1.5-metre basking shark folded inside a box to a whole smoked monkey. But most meat comes dried, smoked, charred and chopped, so it is hard to identify it. In some cases, that’s probably the point. A hunk of meat being confiscated could be from a cane rat, catfish, m

But that’s how the Last Dinner Party’s debut begins: woodwind, brass and strings turned up to 11, further decorated with crashing cymbals and shimmering harp. It’s so grandiose, even the director of a 1950s Hollywood blockbuster would have suggested his soundtrack composer dial it down a bit. It’s also bold to the point of seeming faintly provocative, but then if you were in the Last Dinner Party, you’d probably be feeling confident, too. They begin 2024 in receipt of both this year’s BBC Sound of… award and the Brits’ Rising Star gong. Their preceding 12 months have been an inexorable rise.

<p><strong>Peacock theatre, London<br /></strong>This company’s skills cleverly animate the characters in a dreamlike production that does not blunt the novel’s tragedy</p><p>Can you tell a Thomas Hardy story through circus? Ockham’s Razor think so. They’re a company whose work is often full of joy, wonder and delight – not words you would use to describe Tess of the d’Urbervilles. Yet somehow they bring moments of light and laughter to this sorrowful tale, in a highly original interpretation.</p><p>There are two Tesses here, one who narrates (Macadie Amoroso) and one who dances (Lila Naruse). The text handles the facts – although the sound quality, and Tess’s West Country accent, are not always crystal clear – leaving the physical performers to deal in feelings. The mood is one of hazy, hushed, rustic days, with Holly Khan’s score finding the tone: subdued, mournful, resigned to life’s hardships, but with beauty and playfulness too.

Days of Heaven reintroduced to movie audiences his passionate sense of landscape, his unhurried tempo and mastery of calm, although this is in fact an eventful and dramatic film. It also established his compositional technique which foregrounds the shifts and eddies of mood; it is partly a function of shooting a great deal, shaping the movie in the edit and cutting a lot out. In years and decades to come, many of his actors would be disconcerted to discover at their movie premiere that th
