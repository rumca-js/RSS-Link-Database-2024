<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 01 February 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-023-01791-y">doi:10.1038/s41563-023-01791-y</a></p>Intense light pulses can induce symmetry breaking, as for the generation of ferroelectricity in SrTiO3. Using ultrafast X-ray diffuse scattering at a free-electron laser, nonlinear phonon interactions that occur on such mid-IR excitation are observed, with a theory for the dynamics presented.
