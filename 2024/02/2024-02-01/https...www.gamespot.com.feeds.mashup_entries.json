Evening Star, a new studio formed by the developers of Sonic Mania, is looking to recapture that era with Penny's Big Breakaway, a throwback platformer to the N64, PlayStation, and Dreamcast. And based on my experience so far, it's recaptured that period in gaming history with aplomb.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is most apparent in the visual style, which harkens back to a style of early 3D simplicity without looking quite as rudimentary as those older games.
