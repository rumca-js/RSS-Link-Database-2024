<p>Freedmen’s Town was once a destination for Black people after the civil war but after decades of decline and gentrification, a new exhibition aims to take it back</p><p>Houston’s Fourth Ward is home to a historic district known as Freedmen’s Town, a major destination for formerly enslaved individuals following the end of the civil war in 1865. Throughout the decades the town would grow into a major center of Black culture in the United States, although by the 1970s it had begun to fall into decline. Forces of gentrification were threatening the historic homes, churches and Black-owned businesses that had made the community vital.</p><p>Since then, the residents of Freedmen’s Town have fought back to preserve their history and their culture. This work extends into the arts world, and visitors to the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston now have an opportunity to learn about the beauty of one of Houston’s hidden gems, while supporting the continuing autonomy of this community.

<p>A psychologist offers practical advice for dealing with life’s ups and downs </p><p>It is refreshing to read a psychology book intended for mainstream audiences that isn’t trying to push you towards a particular goal; to achieve more, to work harder. Thanks to the rapid societal and technological changes of the past century, self-actualisation is now possible for more of us than ever before. As welcome as this might seem, self-actualising is hard work, and possibilities can quickly become standards that we fail to live up to.

In the middle of January, team president Jim Rutherford <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/canucks-major-surgery-1.6715616">held a press conference</a> to address the team’s terrible season, which began with eight straight losses and didn’t improve much from then on. “I’m pretty disappointed in the job I’ve done,” Rutherford said at the time. The team’s fans felt the same way, especially regarding how the team was treating then-coach, Bruce Boudreau, who was rumoured to be on the chopping block, with Rick Tocchet apparently already waiting in the wings to take over. At the presser, Rutherford could merely only offer that “Bruce is our coach, and that’s the way it is today.” The Canucks <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/vancouver-canuc
