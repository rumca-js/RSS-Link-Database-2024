Last week, developer Tango Gameworks distributed a relatively minor Hi-Fi Rush update to celebrate the first anniversary of the acclaimed rhythm-brawler's release; however, dataminers poking around the update's innards are now claiming to have found further evidence - in the form of unique t-shirt designs - that a PlayStation and Switch launch is on the way.
</p><p>
Reports that the previously PC and Xbox exclusive Hi-Fi Rush could be making its way to PlayStation and Switch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-release-acclaimed-first-party-game-on-another-platform-report-suggests">first began circulating in January</a>, after a number of reliable leakers started expanding on claims by insider Nate the Hate that Microsoft was set to "one of [its] more acclaimed first party releases to a competitor system" this year.

Inkle, the studio behind the acclaimed likes of Heaven's Vault and last year's A Highland Song, has just surprise-released The Forever Labyrinth, a <a href="https://goo.gle/foreverlabyrinth">free browser-based narrative adventure</a> spanning the entire history of art from across the world.
</p><p>
The Forever Labyrinth, which has been made in partnership with the Google Arts &amp; Culture initiative, transports players to an ever-shifting maze of rooms - resembling everything from serene gardens to clifftops, forests, and cellars - as they search for their friend Professor Sheldrake, lost amid its mysteriously interlinking passageways.
</p><p>
These passageways take the form of paintings and art - "drawn from the collections of great museums who are keen to share their treasures in new and exciting ways

Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Abubakar Salim - who voiced Bayek in Assassin's Creed Origins and starred in HBO's Raised by Wolves - now has a demo on Steam ahead of its PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch release this April.
</p><p>
Tales of Kenzera, a Metroidvania-style side-scrolling action-adventure, was unveiled by Salim during an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-zau-is-a-side-scrolling-platformer-and-a-tribute-to-a-lost-father#comments">emotional appearance at last year's The Game Awards</a> in which he paid tribute to his late father. "For a long time," he explained, "I've struggled to find a way of communicating my journey with grief. To now be able to do that through Zau's story of loss, growth and healing in Tales of Kenzera: Zau feels so right."

Imane "Pokimane" Anys announced earlier this week she was leaving Twitch and has taken to her podcast to explain why.
</p><p>
In short, her exclusivity deal with the Amazon-owned streaming platform came to an end and Pokimane decided not to renew the contract. "The end of an era," she posted on X, formerly Twitter. "Twitch has been my home for a decade...but it's time to say thank you for all the memories and love during my League, Fortnite, and Among Us days."
</p><p>
It means Twitch - a platform <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-leak-reveals-streamer-earnings-and-lack-of-diversity">derided for its lack of diversity</a> - has just lost one of its most popular and high profile female streamers and, on her <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45SyHl8ZOWDDB4DaO9ZW9U?si=379ae4c247f742d2&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=2cac0

If you have been wanting to play Alan Wake 2, but were put off by the game's semi-regular, flashing jump scares, I have good news. 
</p><p>
As part of its recent update, <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">Remedy</a> has added a feature that will allow you to tone down those horror flashes (apparently a much-requested addition). Players can now opt for either a Low or Normal visual and audio intensity of horror flash, to curate the game better to their liking. 
</p><p>
Along with this option to dial back on the scaries, the studio has also introduced a Chapter Select function. This will allow players to load up any mission they fancy as long as they have previously unlocked it. Yes, this means you can go back and replay <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2s-herald-of-darkness-ak

At last night's State of Play, Vertigo Games and Deep Silver lifted the lid on Metro Awakening, an upcoming origin story for the Metro series.
</p><p>
The game is described as a story-driven adventure, built exclusively for VR. It promises plenty of stealth and a good dash of combat, with the developer stating this will be the "most immersive" Metro experience to date. 
</p><p>
You will play as Serdar in Metro Awakening. Serdar is "a doctor and a rationalist" in search of medication for his wife. This search will take players to the tunnels beneath Moscow, but it won't be an easy trip. You see, the tunnels are full of mutants.  "As your courage and sanity are pushed to the limit you must learn to walk the line between life and death, the spirit and the material world, and awaken the being you will become..." the official b

The team behind Life is Strange are no strangers to parallel timelines. Don't Nod's original narrative adventure ended with a binary choice - you could save the life of your closest companion, or doom them to protect the town you both grew up in. It was a decision that rippled through the stories of subsequent sequels, and remains an emotional peak the franchise has since struggled to surpass. Now, after years of silence, the team behind that ending are finally back with a new game - Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - ready to talk about why their time working on Life is Strange ended.

Much has changed for Don't Nod over the past decade, with the original Life is Strange team now an ocean away and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-developer-opens-north-american-studio">under a
