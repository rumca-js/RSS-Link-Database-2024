<p>Earlier this week, the team behind the Arc browser for Mac (and recently Windows) <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/arc-browser-comes-to-the-iphone-as-a-stripped-down-ai-powered-search-tool-150227704.html">released a brand-new iPhone app called Arc Search</a>. As you might expect, it's infused with AI to power an experience where the app "browses for you"—pulling together a variety of sources of info across the internet to make a custom webpage to answer whatever questions you throw at it. That's just one part of what The Browser Company is calling Act 2 of Arc, and the company gave details on three other major new features its bringing to the browser over the coming weeks and months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The connective tissue of all these updates is that Arc is trying to blur the lines between a browser, search engine and website — the company wants to combine them all to make the internet a bit more useful to end users. In a promo video released today,

<p>Comcast is discontinuing its its “Xfinity 10G Network” branding to describe its internet service after a National Advertising Review Board (NARB) panel found that the term could mislead consumers into thinking that Comcast’s cellular and broadband services would offer much faster speeds than current-generation networks. Comcast rivals T-Mobile and Verizon <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/comcast-10g">had challenged</a> the branding with the National Advertising Division (NAD), an ad industry watchdog, which had recommended that Comcast get rid of it in October 2023. Comcast’s confusing branding is at the heart of this challenge: “5G” refers to mobile internet, while “10G” refers to 10-gigabit broadband speeds typically delivered to homes through physical infrastructure.</p>

<p>Google is adding generative AI to Maps. The feature's in early access and only available for certain areas and for select Local Guides members, but it looks to be an interesting use of the technology. Basically, the tool allows you to speak to the app using natural language to discover new places in your hometown or when traveling throughout this great country of ours.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. Ask the app what you’re looking for, like a restaurant to meet the needs of your friend group with various dietary restrictions. The company’s large-language models will analyze information about more than 250 million places along with insights provided by community members as part of its Local Guides program. It should be able to spit out the perfect spot.</p>

<p>After <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-music-threatens-to-pull-songs-from-tiktok-over-payment-terms-101528365.html"><ins>threatening</ins></a> to do so earlier this week, Universal Music Group (UMG) has started pulling the catalogs of performers it represents including Taylor Swift, Drake, Billie Eilish, The Weeknd and others. There are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24057839/umg-pulls-tiktok-music-ai-contract-dispute">no longer tracks</a> listed in profiles of some of the world's most notable artists.</p>
<p>Moreover, UMG music featured in TikTok videos will be muted going forward, forcing creators to replace the tracks with options from other music labels. That won’t be easy for many of them, considering the huge number of lip-sync videos that litter the social network.</p>

<p>The CEOs of Meta, Snap, Discord, X and TikTok testified at a high-stakes Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child exploitation online. During the hearing, Mark Zuckerberg, Evan Spiegel, Jason Citron, Linda Yaccarino and Shou Chew spent nearly four hours being <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-tells-social-media-ceos-they-have-blood-on-their-hands-for-failing-to-protect-children-170411884.html">grilled by lawmakers about their records on child safety</a>.</p>
<p>Judiciary Committee Chair, Senator Dick Durbin, noted Discord’s Citron “only accepted services of his subpoena” after US Marshals went to the company’s headquarters. Compared to previous hearings with tech CEOs, it was a heavier setting. The room was filled with parents of children who had been victims of online exploitation.</p>
<p>“Discord has been used to groom, abduct and abuse children,” Durbin said. “Meta’s Instagram helped connect and promote a network of pedophiles. Snapchat’s disappearing messages

<p>The rise of AI-generated voices mimicking celebrities and politicians could make it even harder for the Federal Communications Commission (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-blocks-robocall-middleman-one-eye-from-future-campaigns-211509369.html">FCC</a>) to fight robocalls and prevent people from getting spammed and scammed. That's why FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel wants the commission to officially recognize calls that use AI-generated voices as &quot;artificial,&quot; which would make the use of voice cloning technologies in robocalls illegal. Under the FCC's Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), solicitations to residences that use an artificial voice or a recording are against the law. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/31/fcc-moves-to-outlaw-ai-generated-robocalls/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> notes, the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairwoman-make-ai-voice-generated-robocalls-illegal">FCC's proposal</a> will make it easier to go after and
