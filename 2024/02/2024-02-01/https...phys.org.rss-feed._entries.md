UGC 3912 is classified as a spiral galaxy, but you wouldn't know it from this detailed NASA Hubble Space Telescope image. UGC 3912's distorted shape is typically indicative of a gravitational encounter with another galaxy. When galaxies interact—either brush up against each other's gravitational fields or even collide—their stars, dust, and gas can be pulled into new paths. UGC 3912 might have once been an organized-looking spiral, but it looks like it's been smudged out of shape by a giant thumb.

Cells in the human body are constantly dividing. With each division, the genetic information contained in the chromosomes is duplicated, and each daughter cell receives a complete copy of the genetic material. It is a sophisticated process, a clockwork mechanism that involves refined and fast changes within the cell. To make this possible, the cell relies on microtubules, tiny structures that are indeed tube-shaped. Understanding how they start forming is a long-standing question.

Both Republicans and Democrats regarded people with opposing political views as less moral than people in their own party, even when their political opposites acted fairly or kindly toward them, according to experiments my colleagues and I recently conducted. Even participants who self-identified as only moderately conservative or liberal made the same harsh moral judgments about those on the other side of the political divide.

Christopher Parzyck had done everything right. Parzyck, a postdoctoral researcher, had brought his nickelate samples—a newly discovered family of superconductors—to a synchrotron beamline for X-ray scattering experiments. He was measuring his samples, which he'd synthesized with a new method, in the hope of detecting the suspected presence of "charge ordering"—a phenomenon in which electrons self-organize into periodic patterns. The phenomenon has been linked to high-temperature superconductivity.

A recent study accepted to The Planetary Science Journal  and currently posted to the arXiv preprint server investigates how the organic hazes that existed on Earth between the planet's initial formation and 500 million years afterwards, also known as Hadean geologic eon, could have contained the necessary building blocks for life, including nucleobases and amino acids. This study holds the potential to not only help scientists better understand the conditions on an early Earth, but also if these same conditions on Saturn's largest moon, Titan, could produce the building blocks of life, as well.
