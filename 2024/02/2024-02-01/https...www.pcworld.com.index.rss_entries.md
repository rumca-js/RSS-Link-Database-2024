<p>Any files you have stored in OneDrive or other cloud services are probably organized by file and name so you know where they are. But in the workplace, all bets are off. A new OneDrive for the web UI feature helps solve that problem.</p>



<p>OneDrive&rsquo;s new feature allows you to organize files by <em>people</em>, not just file name. You can also organize them by meeting, too&mdash;even upcoming meetings that haven&rsquo;t happened yet. Microsoft added this new UI refresh in 2023, but <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/new-year-new-look-for-onedrive-for-personal-use/ba-p/4039162&amp;xcust=2-1-1805856-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">said</a> this week that consumers will see it as well by the end of February 2024.

<p>External USB/Thunderbolt drives are a super-convenient way to quickly back up your important files, as well as store any data that you don&rsquo;t need on your computer&rsquo;s internal storage. They&rsquo;re also an extremely handy way to transport data between locations and devices.</p>



<p>While any of these would be a great reason to pick up an external drive, the advantages of having reliable backup is the number-one reason your setup isn&rsquo;t complete without one. Why? Chances are you have important data on your PC that you can&rsquo;t afford to lose. To protect that data you&rsquo;ll want to do two things: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">store it off-site on the cloud</a> if possible and back it up to an external d

<p>Virtual private networks (VPNs) are one of the most effective ways to stay safe online. They allow you to stay anonymous and get past region blocks on certain websites such as Netflix or other streaming services. However, you usually have to pay for a subscription in order to use a VPN and you don&rsquo;t always want to add an extra monthly expense to an already tight budget. That&rsquo;s where free VPNs come in. They can provide you with a similar level of security for virtually&mdash;pun intended&mdash;nothing. But not all free VPNs are built the same.</p>



<p>With many free VPNs you&rsquo;ll encounter unexpected restrictions such as speed constraints, a bandwidth cap, or a limit to the countries you can access. These limitations can add up making the experience of using a free VPN feel pointless. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important that you choose

<p>One of the coolest features of Valve&rsquo;s Steam Deck is how it&rsquo;s built to make its compact internal hardware accessible to the user, something that PC gamers can appreciate. For example, if you want to save a bit of cash with the cheapest model and upgrade the storage on your own, you absolutely can, using a standard 30-millimeter M.2 SSD like the Corsair MP600 Core Mini. And as luck would have it, that exact drive is <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CKXZBFNY?th=1&amp;ascsubtag=2-1-2224744-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">on sale for $80 in its 1TB capacity</a> right this minute. </p>



<p>To be clear, this PCIe 4th-gen SSD isn&rsquo;t <em>just </em>for the Steam Deck. The M.2 format is also used in most laptops these days, and at the smallest regular size, this MP600 Mini should fit into just about

<p>The internet service industry is no stranger to somewhat nebulous claims of speed and reliability. But even in that context, Comcast&rsquo;s self-styled &ldquo;Xfinity 10G network&rdquo; for its home internet business raised some eyebrows. After months of arguing with the cable industry&rsquo;s self-regulatory agency the NCTA and the National Advertising Review Board, the company has agreed to drop the potentially misleading moniker. </p>



<p>While technically referring to theoretical speeds of 10 gigabits per second on the fiber optic broadband line, it seems likely that the<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662111/comcast-10g-doesnt-mean-what-you-think.html"> &ldquo;10G&rdquo; in Xfinity 10G was carefully crafted to imply that it&rsquo;s twice as fast as 5G</a>, the current standard mobile wireless technology.

<p>Google&rsquo;s AI services are receiving boosts across the board, with AI image generation arriving in Google Bard, powered by a new Imagen 2 technology that Google promises is more lifelike (and weirdness-free) than ever. And just days after the internet voted its Gemini Pro chatbot technology as nearly the world&rsquo;s best, it&rsquo;s arriving pretty much everywhere Bard is offered.</p>



<p>Google is also releasing a dedicated AI art tool, known as ImageFX, to go along with its existing MusicFX and TextFX tools, inside its AI Test Kitchen beta program.</p>



<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a multifaceted improvement for Bard, both from a quality standpoint and the number of services Google is integrating AI into. Although <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2170884/ai-battle-continues-google-launches-gemini-to-beat-openai-and-microsofts-gpt-4.html">Go

<p>The AM4 socket refuses to go quietly into the night.

The easy standout was the Ryzen 7 5700X3D, a new, budget-friendly entry in the company&rsquo;s popular line with extra v-cache specifically for gamers. The new chip is on sale today for $249.99.

<p>Free operating systems based on the Linux operating system kernel invented and published by Linus Torvalds are now a serious alternative to Windows, not least due to the wide range of open source software on offer.</p>



<p>We reveal the six most ingenious free applications under Linux, which need not fear comparison with commercial and therefore mostly expensive software under Windows.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="gimp">GIMP</h2>



<p>GIMP (&ldquo;GNU Image Manipulation Program&rdquo;) is a professional pixel-based graphics program that provides functions for image editing and digital painting of raster graphics. The program is free software and can be used completely free of charge. Most major Linux distributions already include GIMP in their basic installation, but subsequent installation is also comparatively simple and quick.</p>

<p>Running a local AI large language model (LLM) or chatbot on your PC allows you to ask whatever questions you want in utter privacy. But these LLMs are often difficult to set up and configure. There&rsquo;s a solution: an application called GPT4All.</p>



<p>For now, GPT4All represents the best combination of ease of use and flexibility. It&rsquo;s not nearly as accommodating as some of the more complex frameworks and applications, but you can have it up and running in mere minutes with just a few clicks. It also offers the ability to run on either your CPU or GPU, meaning you don&rsquo;t necessarily need the latest and greatest hardware to run it.</p>



<p>A local large language model allows you to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to an AI chatbot. You can use it as a sort of enhanced search (&ldquo;explain black holes to me like a 5-year-old&rdquo;) or to help you

<p>&ldquo;The best charger is the one that shipped with your laptop&rdquo; is old advice that needs updating because there are often superior options available either as your principal laptop charger, as a spare, or as a flexible travel charger.</p>



<p>You know that the charger that came with your laptop will work, but it won&rsquo;t do much else and there are third-party USB-C chargers available that do much more.</p>
