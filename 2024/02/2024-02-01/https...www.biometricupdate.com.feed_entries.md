		The Alaska Department of Public Safety has posted a request for proposals for a biometric fingerprint processing system. Those submitting proposals must have prior experience implementing a fingerprinting software system for a government agency similar or larger in size than Alaska's current system which sees 70,000 transactions each year.

The department currently uses a set of legacy apps as the backend for its fingerprint transaction tracking. The system is made of apps developed over the course of 30 years by multiple programmers and has been updated in response to various changes in law and technology.

The RFP calls for a unified system that will integrate with apps used by Computer Projects of Illinois, a department partner supporting the system's moder

		This year could be a big one for state-level biometric privacy legislation in the U.S. Illinois’ landmark <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/bipa-keeping-courtrooms-and-lobbyists-busy">BIPA</a> could be defanged and other significant legislative moves are already on the books.

Here’s a summary of three states’ current efforts.

First, Illinois <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/bipa-anniversary-marked-with-proposals-for-improvement-close-examination">continues</a> to play with the idea of making its Biometric Information Privacy Act more acceptable to businesses that collect identifiers.

		Starting in May 2025, German authorities will accept only biometric photographs for official documents, including IDs, passports and immigration documents.

The timeline of the introduction of biometric photos was first <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/germany-introducing-biometric-photo-standard-requirement-for-id-documents">announced</a> in October 2023. The move comes after a successful 2023 pilot to enhance document security, <a href="https://www.eureporter.co/world/germany/2024/01/25/germany-to-accept-only-biometric-photographs-for-official-documents-starting-from-may-2025/">according</a> to EU Reporter.

The German Ministry of Interior says that biometric photos will speed up the identification of document holders.

		Nothing of substance resulted from yesterday’s U.S. Senate scolding of five social media CEOs. Intangible but important was the obvious fact that the industry’s political muscle continues to wither.

Judiciary Committee members, conservatives and liberals alike, say they are ready (this time) to regulate social media with age verification or biometric age estimation to prevent children from being bullied, harassed and sexually exploited. Affected children (and no small number of vulnerable adults) have harmed themselves to the point of suicide.

The January 31 <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/big-tech-and-the-online-child-sexual-exploitation-crisis">hearing</a> pulled in the leaders of Meta, X,

		New research from <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en">Gartner</a> predicts that 30 percent of entities will no longer consider biometric verification alone to be reliable by 2026,as a direct result of the rise of deepfakes. While these are most commonly used in presentation attacks, injection attacks rose by 200 percent in 2023..

Moreover, as many as 95 percent of synthetic identities are not detected during onboarding, costing financial institutions billions while potentially funding money laundering or terrorism, according to <a href="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/articles/trends-in-synthetic-identity-fraud">Thomson Reuters</a>.

In light of these growing risks, identity verification providers have announced new partnerships with fi
