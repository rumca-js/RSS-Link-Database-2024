<p>I’ve been working with artificial intelligence systems since the 1980s. Back then, AI was considered a revolution in leveraging computer systems to achieve unheard-of capabilities.</p><p>Things are much the same today with generative AI (genAI). But to avoid the mistakes made during the first generations of AI systems, businesses must understand what AI is valid for and what it is not.</p><h2>It’s 1988, all over again</h2>
<p>Attempting to compare 1980s vintage AI, including Lisp and M1, to today’s machine learning and genAI capabilities is a bit unfair. Back then, AI systems cost many millions of dollars and had much less AI functionality.</p><p>However, many mistakes made AI go away, while other, more direct solutions were leveraged for businesses. The most apparent mistake was the misapplication of AI for use cases where AI provided little value.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712687/3-killer-apps-for-cloud-based-generative-ai

<p>Every cloud-consuming company is concerned about runaway cloud costs. To address those concerns, the big three cloud service providers have introduced <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-calculate-the-cost-of-google-cloud-platform-services/" rel="nofollow">cloud pricing calculators</a>. We’ve also seen the rise of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3699108/6-finops-best-practices-to-reduce-cloud-costs.html">finops</a>.</p><p>That’s a good start.</p><p>But cloud calculators and finops are infrastructure-focused, not application-focused. To avoid unnecessary cloud costs, you need to optimize the code that runs on top of the infrastructure. Cloud providers don’t address that part of the equation—that’s up to you.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712807/laying-the-groundwork-for-cost-conscious-coding.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
