Los Angeles-based folk-punk musician Sunny War — born Sydney Lyndella Ward — is known for her virtuosic guitar playing accompanied by deeply honest lyrics reflecting 21st-century concerns. 

Before her show at the Turf Club in St. Paul, Sunny War stopped by The Current studio to share some songs and to chat with host Ayisha Jaffer. Here, Sunny War shares what she likes in common between the genres of gospel and hardcore music.
