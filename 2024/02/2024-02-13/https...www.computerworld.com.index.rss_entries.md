<p>Nvidia on Tuesday announced a generative AI (genAI) chatbot that can run on Windows PCs, giving enterprises the potential to leverage AI on employees' local environments to bolster productivity rather than requiring them to access genAI tools on platforms hosted by providers such as OpenAI.</p><p>The graphics chipmaker released <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chat-with-rtx-generative-ai/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Chat with RTX</a>, a demo app now available for free download; it lets users personalize a chatbot with their own content, basically customizing the data sources of the bot's <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3697649/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs). This keeps users’ private data on their PC while helping them quickly search for answers to questions based on that data, according to Nvidia.</p><p class="jumpTag">

<p>Ensuring platform security is hard, but when a company the stature of Apple begins to ramp up protection of its ecosystem, every IT decision maker should pay attention. Unfortunately, this is precisely what's happening: Apple is now updating fundamental protection at a faster clip than it's ever done before.</p><h2><strong>Apple’s security teams are alert</strong></h2>
<p>That important revelation comes from Howard Oakley at the excellent <em><a href="https://eclecticlight.co" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Eclectic Light Company</a></em> blog. He notes that in the six weeks ending Feb. 9 Apple, has updated a Mac security feature called XProtect five times — introducing 11 new rules to the service.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712865/apple-is-ramping-up-its-fight-against-malware.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Otter.ai, the real-time notetaking service, is seeking to shake up the enterprise transcription market with its new Meeting GenAI feature, which can capture, access, and immediately provide information from meetings across an organization.</p><p>Meeting GenAI will be able to recall notes from another video conference, phone call, or in-person meeting from weeks earlier, for someone who wasn’t able to attend or who doesn’t remember what happened. This capability will work for a person sitting at her desk or for a group of people in a teleconference or in-person meeting.</p><p>So, for example, an enterprise’s product marketing team is on a video conference and wants to know the latest specs for a new feature discussed during an engineering team meeting two days earlier. The director of product marketing can ask Otter.ai to describe the new feature, as discussed in the previous meeting, or to summarize the engineering team’s discussion.</p><p

<p>I'll be honest: I was really hoping for an "aha!" moment over these past few days.</p><p>Ever since Google <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3703729/whats-going-on-with-google-assistant.html#:~:text=The%20full%20update,chatbot%2Dstyle%20system.">made it clear</a> that it was working to bring its next-gen generative AI chatbot into Android as a replacement for Google Assistant, I've been skeptical. And ever since I installed the new <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.bard" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">standalone Gemini Android app</a> and allowed it to <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/bard-gemini-advanced-app/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">take over my phone's assistant function</a>, that initial skepticism has only grown into a grumbling sense of us being ushered in the wrong direction.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712864/google-gemini-an

<p>According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the ever-increasing speed and efficiency of processors mean that OpenAI’s Sam Altman won’t need $7 trillion for his AI chip initiative.</p><p>“You can’t assume that you will buy more computers. You have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster and therefore the total amount that you need is not as much,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pm2xEViNIo" rel="nofollow">Huang said on stage</a> at the World Governments’ Summit in Dubai.</p><p>“If you just assume computers aren’t going to get any faster,” Huang continued, “you might come to the conclusion that we need 14 planets, three galaxies and four more suns to fuel all this, but computer architecture continues to advance.”</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712693/ai-chips-don-t-need-trillion-dollar-investments-nvidia-ceo.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
