<p>On these type of evenings Manchester City are like The Terminator. A relentless foe that refuses to be cowed no matter what comes at them. It was Copenhagen’s courage in answering the sparkling Kevin De Bruyne’s opener with Magnus Mattsson’s leveller, the Belgian then creating Bernardo Silva’s second.</p><p>All of these goals were plundered before the interval. Before and after De Bruyne was the prime City personification of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character in the Hollywood blockbuster whose epithet “I’ll be back” could be applied to the irresistible 32-year-old.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/13/copenhagen-manchester-city-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Saltburn to Aftersun and Succession, it seems their combination of nostalgia and mortification is catnip for today’s directors</p><p>Rumour has it the bigwigs of karaoke were crammed into a secret meeting room last week, drowning their sorrows in alcopops and belting out misery ballads. Why? Because two of entertainment’s buzziest names threatened to pull the plug on the entire industry. “Karaoke should be banned in my opinion. I’ve never had an enjoyable experience,” said Paul Mescal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6idKu9pAVCo">in an interview</a> to promote new film All of Us Strangers. His co-star Andrew Scott agreed: “I’m not a fan of karaoke, I’m not. There’s a kind of anxiety, which is like, ‘Is this ever gonna end?’” . Scott’s complaint – that karaoke seemingly never ends – rings true, at least when it comes to film and TV. Over the last couple of years, our big screens have been filled with characters staring at slightly smaller screens, clutching che

<p>An eminent journalist’s remarkable Auschwitz memoir balances the epic crime of the Holocaust with the minutiae of daily dehumanisation</p><p>In <em>King Lear</em>,<em> </em>confronted with the figure of his cruelly blinded father, Edgar wonders whether matters are as bad as they imaginably could be. He concludes, however, that “the worst is not/So long as we can say “This is the worst.”’ The very fact that he has language, and the capacity for judgment, is itself proof that he has more to lose. Edgar’s words, in this most archaic of Shakespeare’s plays, feel horribly prophetic of the slaughter bench of modern history, as if the events of the 20th century were designed to test them. <em>Is this the worst of which human beings are capable? Is this? Is this?</em></p><p>József Debreczeni’s memoir of the Nazi death camps, translated into English from Hungarian for the first time, frequently echoes Edgar’s claim. After being moved from “the capital of the Great Land of Auschwitz
