The  first teaser trailer for Deadpool 3 has arrived, and now we know the actual title of this long-awaited sequel - Deadpool & Wolverine. That’s right, the two biggest money-makers in Fox’s X-Men universe are finally joining forces for their own superhero buddy team-up movie. Though you wouldn’t necessarily know that from watching the trailer, as we see very little of Hugh Jackman’s Logan.

So what did we learn from this first Deadpool 3 trailer? What is the movie actually about? Why is Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool being kidnapped by the TVA? How does Wolverine fit in? Is that Doctor Doom we see in the trailer? Let’s break down what we do and don’t know right now, and take a closer look at a few key cameos sprinkled throughout the trailer.

## Atomic Heart: Trapped in Limbo Review

Atomic Heart: Trapped in Limbo reviewed by Luke Reilly on Xbox Series X. Also available on Xbox One, PlayStation, and PC.

"Atomic Heart: Trapped in Limbo may be wild and wacky to look at, but playing it is a huge disappointment. Beginning as a candy-coated version of Counter-Strike’s surfing and ending as an exhausting Temple Run clone, this DLC add-on stretches its limited ideas into an equally limited set of levels that seem to get less fun the longer they go on. Much as I appreciate the idea of expanding on both of the main campaign’s endings, if this is the result then it should’ve been left on the drawing board."
