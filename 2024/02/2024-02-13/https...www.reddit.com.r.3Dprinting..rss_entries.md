<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I've been annoyed with my print quality on (modded) Ender 5 for a long time - it was not exactly large z-banding caused by screw problems, etc. More like delicate and irregular layer imperfections that looked like shit on white filament.</p> <p>Here is what improved quality - <strong>lowering travel speed</strong>. This is speed of the head when it's not extruding but going somewhere else to start on another part of the print within same layer.</p> <p>I believe in Cura by default it's something around 150 m/s. Once every few layers (especially on larger prints) head travel speed is so big it causes violent vibrations of the printer. Maybe it offsets slightly the bed or microscopically stretches the belt, no idea (I use additional bed supports).</p> <p>I reduced travel speed to my regular speed (80 m/s) and lowered travel acceleration to 500 (from 700 I use) and now wall quality is much better.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;

## Just printed a Dabotap Pagoda and it turned out pretty cool! It's not perfect, but seeing a piece of Korean heritage right in front of me is awesome. I also want to print meaningful architectural landmarks from other countries around the world. Printing something with a 3D printer is really fun :)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So here is the thing. I want to have something with me that i can gift other people that demonstrates the potencial of 3d printing, i have both a fdm and resin printers, and i can decently paint stuf. I usually travel with my backpack so space is not that much of a problem. At the same time it cant be something that takes me like 1 hour to post process. I want something that is gender neutral, not gona be giving super detaild race car to a girl.
