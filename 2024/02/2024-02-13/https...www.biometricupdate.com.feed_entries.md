		Washington State senators have unanimously approved a bill that would allow biometrics to be used for age verification. Its use would be optional for bar owners and imbibers.

The legislation must now be taken up by the state’s lower house and, if approved there, signed by the governor. Liquor regulators say bar owners should get more guidance on use of the systems.

The Senate’s version (<a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary/?billNumber=6179&amp;year=2024&amp;initiative=False">SB 6179</a>) would make it legal to verify a patron’s age using hardware and software that reads fingerprints, palms, irises, faces, voices or other biometrics, the text of the bill specifies. It is not currently illegal to use biometrics for age checks in the state, but the bill co

A government release says Martyn’s Law, aka the Counter Terrorism Protection Bill, will stiffen safety provisions at venues hosting large public events, in honor of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/21/martyn-hett-victims-family-recall-manchester-arena-attack-5-years-on">Martyn Hett</a>, a 29-year-old UK man killed in the bombing of a concert by the pop singer Arianna Grande.

		An assessment conducted by the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) of the United Nations Development Programme (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/undp">UNDP</a>) has highlighted the UN agency’s massive contributions to the buildup of digital public infrastructure (DPI) in low-income countries (LDCs) over the past decade.

The <a href="https://erc.undp.org/evaluation/documents/download/23004">126-page analysis</a>, released last November and presented during the UN’s opening session of 2024, gauges support offered by the UNDP for the digitalization of public services in eight program streams across several thematic areas in many countries of the Global South.

		The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is planning additional fraud risk management measures after the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) warned recently that Aadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS) fraud via cloned fingerprints has taken a dangerous upward tick.

In an exchange with Parliament’s standing committee on communications and information technology recently, the ministry said fraudsters were using “dummy fingers or rubber fingers” to illegally withdraw money from AePS accounts, <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aeps-frauds-using-dummy-fingers-on-rise-mha-tells-parliamentary-panel-101707569008404.html">according</a> to Hindustan Times.

		Estonia, one of the world’s pioneers in digital governance and digital IDs, is expecting its national digital identity mobile application to be available in the summer.

The news comes after delays to the app rollout were <a href="https://news.err.ee/1609141054/digital-identity-app-mriik-delayed-legal-amendments-necessary">announced</a> in October due to legislative and technical hurdles.

		Luxembourg has created a digital wallet in the interim until the EU releases its own version. At the same time, Bhutan is seeing a modest uptake of its wallet over the past four months. Ukraine is adding new capabilities to its digital wallet as it considers digital ID solutions for the military.

Luxembourg Digitalisation Minister Stéphanie Obertin has announced efforts to create a digital wallet – which would include digital ID – for citizens, according to <a href="https://today.rtl.lu/news/luxembourg/a/2167007.html">RTL Today</a>.

		It's been broadly discussed that Australia's pending Digital ID Bill will have implications for how finance, business, and travel are carried out. What has been less discussed is what implications it will have on racially marginalized groups, namely the Aboriginal population.

Federal law only started applying to <a href="https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/1967-referendum">Aboriginal Australians in 1967</a> once they began being counted in Australia's population.

When one is representing Meta in U.S. court, too painful can often be more a matter taste than real financial discomfort. Meta’s fiscal 2023 net income was $39 billion.

Plaintiffs and government regulators in biometric data privacy cases are becoming more vocal about that dynamic, saying even fines and damages that most people have a hard time comprehending are not enough to corral problematic behaviors.

Lina Khan, chair of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, would like to stop Meta from monetizing children’s personal data, for instance. But she knowns there’s too much money in it, so she’s been wondering <a href="https://therecord.media/ftc-ch
