Launching on February 14th, Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered packages the original three games and their expansions together while offering revamped visuals, a new control scheme and various updates.

Aspyr looks to retain the original feel of the originals, including an option to switch to the classic visual style at any point. Players can also look forward to Photo Mode, health bars on bosses and over 200 new Trophies exclusively on PlayStation.

Arrowhead Game Studios' Helldivers 2 is an out-and-out enjoyable experience, where dying is as essential as carpet-bombing alien insects. However, past the uber-patriotic tutorial, it could do a better job of explaining some things.

Several other details are worth pointing out for new and long-term players. Here are 15 things that Helldivers 2 doesn't tell you and how to best optimize your experience.
