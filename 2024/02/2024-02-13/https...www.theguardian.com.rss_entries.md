<p>Readers share their memories of discovering the shop’s products and ethos in the 70s, 80s and 90s</p><p>Walking into The Body Shop was like “entering a sweet shop”. It “literally made your mouth water”, says Stasia Smith-Turpin, who would head to the Lancaster store after school with friends when she was 16 in the 90s. She recalls how a wave of fragrance would hit her as she entered the shop, and she would test and smell the soaps, creams and potions while planning how to spend her pocket money.</p><p>Smith-Turpin, 48, would spray herself with dewberry perfume – the scent of summer berries – before riding the bus home. One day, to her mother’s horror, she applied too much (“my arms were literally greasy!”) and “apparently she could smell me from the bus stop at the bottom of the hill”, she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/13/a-scented-awakening-how-the-body-shop-influenced-generations">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Champions Wigan look even stronger, Leeds have recruited well but London’s season is likely to be a long, tough one</p><p>Having narrowly avoiding relegation last season, Castleford have used the off-season – and the relative safety IMG’s gradings system provides them – to rebuild with one eye on the future. Perhaps the most promising coach outside Super League, Craig Lingard, has taken over and set about overhauling an ageing squad. Only two of their winter signings are over 25 and while there may be a bright future ahead, this could be a formative and tough season for a young squad.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/13/super-league-2024-team-by-team-guide-rugby-league">Continue reading...</a>

It would have been understandable if they had, because having children is the greatest thing in the world but trying to do anything else – working, keeping fit or maintaining a normal relationship with your partner – is the hardest thing in the world. As such, many parents find their relationship suffers during the early years. “When you’ve got small kids, you invest a lot into them,” says <a href="https://www.johemmings.co.uk/">Jo Hemmings</a>, a <a href="https://www.johemmings.co.uk/">psychologist</a>. “There’s work, childcare – you forget a little bit about yourselves.

<p>Young players have made their mark in India thanks to Ben Stokes’ captaincy and their mental strength</p><p>When England set off for India I thought Jack Leach would be their most important bowler; two games later – and he played in only the first Test – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/11/england-cricket-jack-leach-ruled-out-of-rest-of-india-test-tour-with-knee-injury">he has been ruled out of the series</a> and I’m not sure it will have much of an impact. That is down to the performances of England’s young spinners, Jasprit Bumrah’s reverse swing and the realisation that seam bowling may be more important than anyone would have expected.</p><p>With his experience, Leach was the one England spinner I thought could control his bowling in the heat of battle, when the pressure is on, and so seemed likely to be pivotal to their chances of taking 20 wickets. In home conditions, England use their fast-medium bowlers to give them some control but in India it i

<p>A young woman plots her escape from behind the Iron Curtain until a baby ruins her plans in this 2014 debut from Maya Vitkova</p><p>Maya Vitkova’s eloquent, ambitious, emotionally committed drama Viktoria premiered at Sundance 10 years ago and more than deserves its UK streaming release now. This excellent film would be a striking accomplishment from anyone – and this was actually Vitkova’s debut. It feels fierce and urgent: tremendously designed, acted and shot. Viktoria is an intergenerational women’s story from Bulgaria both before and after the 1989 revolutions, a film that maybe in its absurdism, scepticism and slow-burn passion shows the influences of Romanian director Radu Jude, with whom Vitkova worked on short films. On TV, Vitkova produced an episode of Michael Palin’s BBC TV New Europe travel series, heading across the Balkans; Viktoria, interestingly, has an image of someone walking across the snow, only to be flicked over by a giant hand from the sky.</p><p>In

<p>Rugby union has become another sport that seems confused about how to satisfy existing fans while attracting new ones</p><p>After the US invasion of Panama in 1989, it took their army 10 days to persuade the dictator Manuel Noriega to come out of his hiding place in the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See. Their soldiers famously surrounded the building with loudspeakers and played, among other things, AC/DC’s You Shook Me All Night Long, Van Halen’s Panama, and Rick Astley’s Never Gonna Give You Up day and night, until Noriega lost the will to resist. Five minutes into the half-time interval at Twickenham last Saturday, the thought occurred that they could perhaps have got the job done a lot quicker if, like the RFU, it had hired stadium DJ Tony Perry instead.</p><p>Which is nothing against Perry, whose act must be just the thing if you’re four tequilas deep on Ocean Beach in Ibiza.
