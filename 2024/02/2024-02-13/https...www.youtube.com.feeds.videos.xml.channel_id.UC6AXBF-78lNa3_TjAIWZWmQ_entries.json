Firstly, let us express our sincere thanks for your continued support over the years. We couldn't have done it without you.\n\nTo continue producing new videos and opening up the world for you, we've made some changes to our business approach.\nStarting from the 1st of March, all new videos will be available to watch for free for a limited period of two weeks. After this period, they will be moved to our members' area. You can still watch a preview of the video for free, but for the full experience or access to our complete YouTube library, we invite you to join our YouTube member area for $1.99 per month. Here, videos are ad-free and full length.\n\nSimultaneously, we are launching an Android and Apple mobile VR app called TriptoVR. This easy-to-use app will feature all our best travel episodes from around the world. You can download", "permanent": false, "vote": 0, "bookmarked": false, "tags": []}]
