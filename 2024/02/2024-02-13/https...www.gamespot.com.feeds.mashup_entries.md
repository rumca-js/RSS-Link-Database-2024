During the early game of Skull and Bones, you'll start off with a great need for Iron, but that quickly turns into a demand for Bronze, which is made by using <strong>Copper</strong>.</p><p>Bronze Ingots are a requirement in dozens of crafting recipes that pop up as you begin to establish yourself as a bonafide pirate. As such, you'll need to know where to find Copper so you can harvest it. You'll also need to know what to do with it after you've added the ore to your inventory. Below, you can see exactly where to find Copper in Skull and Bones.</p><h2>Finding Copper in Skull and Bones</h2><p>There are a few different locations across the East Indies that allow you to mine Copper, but the best spot is just <strong>south of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how

<p>Movies being edited and changed from the first trailer to the final screening is nothing new. We've seen it played out countless times, especially in big franchise movies like Star Wars and Avengers and looks like Madame Web is now among that list. </p><p>When the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madame-webs-first-trailer-shows-dakota-johnson-as-paramedic-who-can-see-the-future/1100-6519190/">trailer</a> dropped back in November, there was a line about Cassie's (Dakota Johnson) mom and her connection to the mysterious not-Spider-Man that's out to killer and her friends. "He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died." The delivery and line became an instant meme--a personal favorite of mine was one using Ben Kenobi. </p><p>As the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-madame-web-heres-what-the-critics-think/1100-6521027/">reviews started coming out today</a> ahead of the movie's release this w

<p>January used to be a slow month on the gaming calendar, as after the traditional Q4 rush of AAA game releases, most developers and publishers opted to take a brief break at the start of a new year. Times have changed in the last few years, and these days, it's not unusual to see<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-biggest-game-releases-of-january-2024/2900-5004/"> several big games released</a> to help kick the year off with a bang. What is unusual is to see these games face stiff competition from legacy titles, as the most-downloaded games on the PlayStation Store for January feature old favorites at the top.</p><p>There are some caveats to these numbers, as the charts obviously don't include physical sales and are based solely on PlayStation platforms. In the US and Canada, Tekken 8 slugged its way to fourth place on PS5, while Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Madden NFL took the top three spots. In Europe, Bandai Namco's new fighting game

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">The Hulk smashes, he's angry, and apparently he can misspeak, too. At least, that's the narrative after confusion arose over whether Bruce Banner actor Mark Ruffalo agreed with a moderator that he'd appear as the giant green superhero in Captain America: Brave New World over the weekend.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/mark-ruffalo-captain-america-brave-new-world-hulk-1235908846/">Variety</a> reports that Ruffalo won't show up in the fourth Captain America film as the Hulk after talking with multiple sources. The actor supposedly thought he was saying yes to the fact that Brave New World is one of the MCU's next movies, not his inclusion. In context, that makes sense as Santa Barbara Film Festival 2024 moderator Anne Thompson just asks Ruffalo whether Captain America 4 is next--not whether he's part of the cast.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hulk-wont-be-in-captain-america-4-despite-what-mark-ruffalo-said-re

<p dir="ltr">Madame Web is in an awkward position because it's likely that, after 15 years of cultural dominance by the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, we have a pretty well-formed idea of what constitutes a "good" Marvel movie. In particular, it's gotta cost $200 million or more, and look like it thanks to non-stop CGI and star cameos.</p><p dir="ltr">But none of that describes Madame Web, a standalone film from Sony that isn't a part of the MCU, much like the Venom films, Morbius, and the upcoming Kraven movie. This is not your standard Marvel spectacle--it's got far more in common with horror films like Friday the 13th and Final Destination. That's a good thing, and as a result, Madame Web actually has something new and fresh to offer comic book movie audiences.</p><p dir="ltr">But it's only to a point--as these things so often do, Madame Web eventually ends up mired in an ugly, CGI-heavy climax that doesn't even make any sense for the story, pivoting from something i

<p dir="ltr">Within the first few hours of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden/">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a>, you have a very important--and difficult--decision to make. As Red, you must swear an oath to the now-deceased Antea on whether you will help her ascend peacefully into the afterlife, or resurrect her when her body has been retrieved from the meetinghouse. While the game does explain that resurrecting Antea requires sacrificing as many settlers as possible with a blame ritual, it isn't clear exactly what that means. Here's a spoiler-free explanation of which oath you should pick.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Banishers Ascend oath explained</h2><p dir="ltr">If you choose to help Antea ascend, this means that when you eventually make it back to her body in the meetinghouse, Red will allow her to move on peacefully.

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden/">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a> has a very similar level structure to the 2018 God of War reboot, in that while it is technically an open world game, it's more of a Metroidvania. This means exploration is mostly through interconnected levels with branching paths, but there's usually only one route forward. From almost the very beginning of the game, you'll encounter paths blocked by destructible rocks that you seemingly can't get rid of. Here's what you need to know about breaking these rocks in Banishers.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to break destructible walls in Banishers</h2><p dir="ltr">The short but sweet answer is that you need to use Antea's Outburst ability to clear the rocks.

These weeds crop up frequently, preventing you from exploring various paths in this RPG with a very similar level structure to 2018's God of War. Since it's a Metroidvania you can always backtrack and clear the creeping ivy later down the line, but much like the destructible rocks, you need to know exactly how to get rid of it if you want to explore all New Eden has to offer. Here's what you need to know about clearing creeping ivy in Banishers.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to remove creeping ivy</h2><p dir="ltr">To put it simply, you must unlock the Ensnare ability to get rid of creeping ivy in Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden.
