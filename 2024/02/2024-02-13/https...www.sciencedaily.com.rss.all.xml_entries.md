Desert ants find their way during an early learning phase with the help of the Earth's magnetic field. The associated learning process leaves clear traces in their nervous system.

## Anabolic steroid use can increase heart disease risk, study finds

People using anabolic steroids could be increasing their underlying risk of a heart condition called atrial fibrillation, according to a new study.

## Joro spiders well-poised to populate cities

The Joro spider was first spotted stateside around 2013 and has since been spotted across Georgia and the Southeast. New research has found more clues as to why the spider has been so successful in its spread. The study found the invasive orb-weaving spider is surprisingly tolerant of the vibrations and noise common in urban landscapes. In this new study, researchers examined how Joro spiders can live next to busy roads, which are notably stressful environments for many animals.

## A closer look at cannabis use and binge eating

New research examined how often people experiencing binge eating are also using cannabis recreationally, and whether patients who use cannabis experience more severe eating disorder symptoms or symptoms of struggling with mental health.

## Polar bears unlikely to adapt to longer summers

More time stranded on land means greater risk of starvation for polar bears, a new study indicates. During three summer weeks, 20 polar bears closely observed by scientists tried different strategies to maintain energy reserves, including resting, scavenging and foraging. Yet nearly all of them lost weight rapidly: on average around 1 kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, per day. Some have speculated that polar bears might adapt to the longer ice-free seasons due to climate warming by acting like their grizzly bear relatives and either rest or eat terrestrial food. The polar bears in this study tried versions of both strategies -- with little success.

## Satellites unveil the size and nature of the world's coral reefs

New research has shown there is more coral reef area across the globe than previously thought, with detailed satellite mapping helping to conserve these vital ecosystems.

Smelling a familiar scent can help depressed individuals recall specific autobiographical memories and potentially assist in their recovery.

## Road features that predict crash sites identified in new machine-learning model

Issues such as abrupt changes in speed limits and incomplete lane markings are among the most influential factors that can predict road crashes, finds new research. The study then used machine learning to predict which roads may be the most dangerous based on these features.

## Compounds released by bleaching reefs promote bacteria, potentially stressing coral further
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/02/240213125829.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/02/240213125829.htm)

New research revealed that when coral bleaching occurs, corals release unique organic compounds into the surrounding water that not only promote bacterial growth overall, but select for opportunistic bacteria that may further stress reefs.
