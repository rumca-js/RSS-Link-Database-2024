<p>Sarah Silverman’s lawsuit against OpenAI will advance with some of her legal team’s claims dismissed. The comedian <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sarah-silverman-sues-openai-and-meta-over-copyright-infringement-175322447.html">sued OpenAI and Meta</a> in July 2023, claiming they trained their AI models on her books and other work without consent. <em>Bloomberg</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/openai-gets-some-of-sarah-silvermans-suit-cut-in-mixed-ruling">reported</a> on Tuesday that the unfair competition portion of the lawsuit will proceed. Judge Martínez-Olguín gave the plaintiffs until March 13 to amend the suit.</p>
<p>US District Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín threw out portions of the complaint from Silverman’s legal team Monday, including negligence, unjust enrichment, DMCA violations and accusations of vicarious infringement. The case’s principal claim remains intact. It alleges OpenAI directly infringed on copyrighted

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mozilla/"><ins>Mozilla</ins></a> is the latest in a long line of tech companies to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-183005386.html">lay off employees this year</a>. The not-for-profit company is firing around 60 people, which equates to roughly five percent of its workforce. Most of those who are leaving Mozilla worked on the product development team. The news was first reported by <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-13/firefox-maker-mozilla-is-cutting-60-jobs-after-naming-new-ceo?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re scaling back investment in some product areas in order to focus on areas that we feel have the greatest chance of success,” a Mozilla spokesperson told Engadget in a statement. “To do so, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate approximately 60 roles from across the company.

## ChatGPT is getting a digital memory to recall your past conversations

<p>One of the big drawbacks of talking to an AI chatbot is that everything resets once the conversation is done. It won‚Äôt remember who you are or what you previously queried. This is by design, for privacy reasons, but it really hampers the tech from growing into a true digital assistant that knows you well enough to actually help with stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenAI is trying to fix this issue and is finally <a href="https://openai.com/blog/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt"><ins>adding a memory feature to ChatGPT.</ins></a> This will allow the bot to remember important personal details from prior conversations and apply that context to current queries.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Here‚Äôs how it works. You can actually tell ChatGPT to remember something specific, like that your child is allergic to peanuts or how you prefer to sign emails. It‚Äôll automatically store this data as requested and apply it to future conversations and tasks.</p>

<p>The ‚ÄúP‚Äù in HIPAA doesn‚Äôt stand for privacy. It‚Äôs one of the first things a lot of experts will say when asked to clear up any misconceptions about the health data law. Instead, it stands for portability ‚Äî it‚Äôs called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ‚Äîand describes how information can be transferred between providers. With misinterpretations of HIPAA starting with just its name, misunderstandings of what the law actually does greatly impact our ability to recognize how the kinds of data do and don't fall under its scope. That‚Äôs especially true as a growing number of consumer tech devices and services gather troves of information related to our health.</p>
<p>We often consider HIPAA a piece of consumer data privacy legislation because it did direct the Department of Health and Human Services to come up with certain security provisions, like breach notification regulations and a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9576/"><ins>

<p>The pitch worked, and automakers ‚Äî Volkswagen, GM, Volvo, Polestar, Mercedes, Honda, BMW, Lucid ‚Äî gradually sided with NACS.
