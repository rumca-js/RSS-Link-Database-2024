Prior restraint but it&#8217;s a law. Everyone saw this coming. &#8220;Marsy&#8217;s Laws&#8221; began popping up all over the nation, written to prevent the naming of crime victims, especially when the victims were minors.

As we&#8217;ve written about repeatedly, efforts to protect kids online and improve their mental health at the moment all seem to be focused on taking social media away from them, even though all the evidence suggests this would be harmful, not helpful.

Earlier this year, we wrote about about another “free speech absolutist” and Elon Musk buddy (and investor in ExTwitter), Bill Ackman threatening to file a SLAPP suit over reporting he didn’t like. He’s still promising such a lawsuit against Business Insider, and when it comes, it seems unlikely to succeed. He’s yet to show any [&#8230;]

Well, NSO Group really made a mess of this for everyone. Ever since the devastating leak showing its customers routinely targeted journalists, government critics, dissidents, and human rights activists (you know, rather than the violent criminals and terrorists they said they&#8217;d use the spyware to track), things have gone from bad to worse to career-ending [&#8230;]

Writer Séamas O&#8217;Reilly published his weekly column at the Irish Examiner on Saturday, talking about how spam, scams, and manipulation attempts are flooding the internet.

Here’s just [&#8230;]

And despite the&#160;added risks this creates in the post-Roe era, we’ve still done little to [&#8230;]
