<p>New Orleans carnival attendees have long protested against injustice – this year, Palestinian solidarity is part of the picture</p><p>Carnival in New Orleans, a time of indulgence before the Lenten season, is known for its bright, boldly decorated parades and floats, and celebratory atmosphere.

Amid the Israel-Gaza war, hundreds of carnival participants have used the marches to bring awareness to the conflict.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/13/mardi-gras-new-orleans-carnival-palestine">Continue reading...</a>
