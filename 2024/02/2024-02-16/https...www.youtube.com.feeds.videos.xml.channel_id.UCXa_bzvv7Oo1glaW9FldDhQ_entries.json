A proper lobby browser is one, but being able to save loadouts, test out different weapons and Stratagems, and more are just a few things on our wishlist.\n\nCheck out 15 things Helldivers 2 needs, from new biomes, objectives and weapon types to different missions, including large co-op Operations with more than four players.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXde8jpAVDw", "album": "", "page_rating_votes": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "page_rating": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-16T09:45:02+00:00", "permanent": false, "dead": false, "language": null, "source_obj__id": 208, "page_rating_visits": 0, "user": null, "age": null, "vote": 0, "title": "Helldivers 2 - 15 Things It DESPERATELY NEEDS"}]
