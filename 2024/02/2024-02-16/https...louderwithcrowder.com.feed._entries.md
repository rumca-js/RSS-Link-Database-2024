But they don‚Äôt. It appears a priority of the Canadian Government is to monitor parents who oppose medically altering the sex of their child. But that's not unexpected considering that Canadians don't have this thing <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/garrison-parental-rights" target="_blank">called </a>"parental rights."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

They like to pretend that these books are harmless. But these books are deranged, abhorrent, and sick, to say the very least. And it is not a good look to condone such evil content. That‚Äôs why the left usually lies and pretends that the books contain nothing inappropriate. But in a brazen admission of degeneracy, an assistant principal said that children should access books that contain pornography.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">UNBELIEVABLE.

## Good news: if you're a Seattle student who loves reading or writing, it makes you a ‚Äúwhite supremacist‚Äù according to one teacher

That is because it simply implies that black people cannot read or write and would therefore not enjoy it. But everyone <strong>reading </strong>this knows that it could not be further from the truth. But now we have a school in Seattle telling English students that they are racist if they enjoy a book from time to time. </p><p><br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
