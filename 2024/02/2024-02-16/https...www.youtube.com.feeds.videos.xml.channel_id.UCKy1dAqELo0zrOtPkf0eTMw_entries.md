In today's Daily Fix:

Respawn Entertainment's next Star Wars game might not be another Jedi Fallen Order game, but a first-person shooter starring a Mandalorian. Multiple sources have said that it won't be open-world like Ubisoft's upcoming Star Wars Outlaws, but a more linear affair and set during the time of the Empire, NOT during The Mandalorian TV series. In other news, Microsoft dropped a tiny nugget of info on their next hardware release during yesterday's Xbox business update podcast. They're claiming it will be the "largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation," which doesn't mean much considering every new hardware cycle is always touted as a big technical leap from the last. But this could also be that mid-gen refresh that was strongly hinted at during the Microsoft-FCC trial. And finally, Super Smash Bros. father Masahiro Sakurai can now rest easy, as his work on SSB Ultimate is finally complete, with the release of the Sora Amiibo. Cong

Plus we go over last week's poll, and have a brand new poll for you to vote on at IGN.com.

## In GTA 6, Florida Will Write The Jokes Itself

The Grand Theft Auto series has always built itself on humour, being a blunt satire of the USA, but with players returning to Vice City - Rockstars very own Miami, Florida hybrid - how do you satirise America in the 2020s? With the recent GTA 6 trailer, you just need to hold up a mirror.

From Florida Joker, to car roof twerking Floridians, and conservative pro-gun loving governors like Ron DeSantis, Rockstar Games' comedic commentary has a lot to work with when standing up to the ugliest corners of American society.

The GTA 6 release date is 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.

## Foamstars Video Review

Foamstars reviewed by Charlie Wacholz on PlayStation 5, also available on PlayStation 4.

"Foamstars is at odds with itself. Its unexpectedly engaging combat mechanics, fast-paced matches, and cool music draw me in, but trudging through its flat single-player content, concerningly aggressive monetization, and horrendously slow menus has numbered Foamstars’ days on my PS5 hard drive. I also feel like I’ve already seen everything it has to offer, and its announced update plan looks glacially slow for a sink-or-swim multiplayer landscape currently full of great options. Foamstars’ ranked modes and maps may be exciting and nuanced mid-match, but the confounding time-gated queues around them don’t offer much motivation to grind up the ladder, which leaves me with very little reason to surf these bubbly waves no matter how much fun it may be."

A lot was revealed in the latest Xbox podcast, where Phil Spencer, Sarah Bond and Matt Booty discussed the future of its platform and its plans on embracing third-parties in regards to publishing. While he didn’t name those four games, he did quell the rumors of if either Starfield or the upcoming Indiana Jones game are among those four with a no. Exclusivity is something that those who own one console or the other take stock in and somewhat pride in when heralding their respective console of choice. Well, you gotta look at it from a business perspective, and the latest Xbox Wire post lays out the reasoning in clear terms: “To ensure long-term success for both Xbox and the industry as a whole, we must continue to evolve. Today we announced that we will expand the communities we reach: we are currently in the process of bringing four Xbox games to other platforms.” So there you have it; it’s to make sure #Xbox continues to thrive in the gaming market, and pretty much grow its
