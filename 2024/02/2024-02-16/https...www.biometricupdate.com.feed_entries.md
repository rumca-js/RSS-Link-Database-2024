		Facial recognition is entering New Zealand’s grocery stores and the rapid expansion of the technology has been filling the country’s newspaper headlines.

On Wednesday, Deputy Police Commissioner Tania Kura called for an open discussion on facial recognition trials in commercial areas, including the bias and privacy issues they entail.

“I can see the benefits and the efficiency that can come and the reassurance it can provide some parts but how do we balance that with individual rights and freedoms,” Kura says, <a href="https://waateanews.com/2024/02/15/facial-recognition-raises-dilemma-for-police/">according</a> to Waatea News. “It’s an interesting dilemma for us and I think New Zealand probably needs t

		The program for this year’s big ID4Africa in-person gathering has been released, unveiling a new kind of technology demonstration and adding a fourth day to pack in even more debate and collaboration around the issuance of legal and digital identity.  Registration is now open.

The digital identity community will gather for the 2024 Annual General Meeting in Cape Town, South Africa for four days in May. The first three days will be made up of a dozen plenary sessions, with the biometrics and digital ID technology exposition running simultaneously, as in past years. Day four will consist of four workshops and four forums, each chaired by an international organization.

New to the ID4Africa’s AGM this year is a “Hands-On AI” demonstration, which is hosted in the exposition hall.

		Ideas for detecting deepfakes are popping up among startups and attracting significant venture funding.

Just a year ago, most news about spotting AI fraud came mostly from university research labs. Now, everyone has numbers showing how common deepfake fraud attempts have become.

And despite how rare it is to meet someone who’s witnessed an attack, money is flowing to software firms to defang fraudulent video, images and audio, especially by detecting them.

<a href="https://www.getclarity.ai/">Clarity</a>, created in 2022 to disrupt the criminal world’s deepfaking efforts, has closed a $16 million seed round. That’s not huge, but there are many, many biometric entrepreneurs who’d love to close a round like that right now.

		Australia has taken another step towards regulating artificial intelligence, establishing a new AI Expert Group on Wednesday gathering scientists alongside legal, ethics and governance experts.

The main task of the group will be to advise the Department of Industry, Science and Resources on setting up guardrails for high-risk AI systems and ensuring AI systems are tested, transparent and accountable.

“It’s imperative sophisticated models underpinning high-risk AI systems are transparent and well tested,” Minister for Industry and Science Ed Husic said in a <a href="https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/husic/media-releases/new-artificial-intelligence-expert-group">statement</a>. “This Artificial Intelligence Expert Group brin

		A new examination of how the U.S. government pays for experimental and new police data systems shows how far consequential technology development can go with vaporous critical challenge.

Not that most Americans, who perceive crime to be a far greater local and national problem than police statistics bear out, are in the mood to debate increased government use of biometric identification and surveillance.

In an <a href="https://theconversation.com/doj-funding-pipeline-subsidizes-questionable-big-data-surveillance-technologies-222699">article</a> written by American University law professor Andrew Guthrie Ferguson for The Conversation, the federal government is described as using multiple inputs, including funding, to get new data weapons into the hands of police rapidly

		With almost no explanation, a high school in the U.S. state of Maine reportedly has backed out of a biometric identification contract.

		Gabon’s Minister of Interior and Security, Hermann Immongault, has announced that the project to begin the issuance of national digital ID cards in the country will be underway in the next few months.

The minister gave the update after meeting early this week with the central African nation’s transitional leader, Gen. Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, at the presidential palace. The president directed that all preparations be finalized as soon as possible and for steps to be taken to ensure that civil status registration documents are issued to Gabonese free of charge.
