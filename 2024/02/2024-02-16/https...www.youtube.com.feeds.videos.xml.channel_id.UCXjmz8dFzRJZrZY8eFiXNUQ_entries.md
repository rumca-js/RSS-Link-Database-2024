Ferris Bueller's Day Off is without a doubt one of the best comedies of all time.  From renowned director John Hughes, Ferries Bueller's Day Off is a movie that spans generations of fans.   Though it was a major surprise when it was announced the Ferris Bueller was getting a TV Pilot adapted from the movie.   To no one's surprise, the Ferris Bueller TV show was so bad it was cancelled almost immediately.
