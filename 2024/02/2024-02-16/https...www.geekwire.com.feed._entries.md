A former Expedia Group employee, Marcelo F. Vargas-Fernandez, 42, pleaded not guilty to four counts of voyeurism in connection with the case during his arraignment Thursday in King County Superior Court in Seattle. Seattle Police Department investigators have returned to campus to conduct additional searches, and no additional recording devices were found in&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/expedia-group-to-close-seattle-hq-temporarily-to-enhance-security-after-discovery-of-spy-cameras/">Read More</a>

Schwartz previously founded and led Pathable, a Seattle startup that built mobile apps for conferences and pivoted during the pandemic to focus on virtual events before getting acquired in 2020. Schwartz, who also worked at Microsoft for a decade, said Sēkr&#8217;s app is &#8220;near and dear to my heart&#8221; given his passion for camper vans and the impact they&#8217;ve had on his family &#8220;to truly travel freely.&#8221; &#8220;God, I love it,&#8221; he wrote&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/tech-moves-pathable-founder-joins-vanlife-app-seattle-telecom-vet-named-ceo-at-opang

Remember the human algorithm. Be vulnerable. And stay flexible. These were some of the tidbits of advice shared by Seattle-area tech leaders who have decades of experience at corporate giants and fledgling startups. The tips apply to people leading a company or a team or just anyone working on self-improvement in the workplace. We&#8217;ve compiled the key takeaways from the discussion, hosted by the Harvard Business School Club of Seattle last week.

A year ago, when IonQ revealed its plans to create a new kind of research and manufacturing facility in the Seattle area, the idea was to use roughly 65,000 square feet of space on two floors of a three-story building in Bothell that once housed offices for AT&#38;T Wireless. &#8220;We&#8217;re happy to announce today we&#8217;ve taken the third floor, so we have the entire building now,&#8221; IonQ CEO Peter Chapman said&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ionq-new-quantum-computer-factory/">Read More</a>

That was one of my big takeaways from today’s special episode of the Official Xbox Podcast, which was released as a response to several rumors from last week. According to anonymous leakers, Microsoft had explored the possibility of bringing several of its biggest first-party games, such as the forthcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, to rival platforms such as the PlayStation 5. That, in turn, fueled rumors that Microsoft planned to turn Xbox into a&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/console-wars-arent-over-yet-but-xbox-is-shifting-its-competitive-strategy/">Read More</a>
