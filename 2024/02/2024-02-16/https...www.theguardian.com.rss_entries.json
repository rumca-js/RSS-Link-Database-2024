While Ed Norton never seemed the right fit as Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk in 2008, it was the signing of Robert Downey Jr in the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man that inspired the newly Disney-owned outfit to embark on a decade-long run of smartly interconnected, far-out superhero epics that redefined the genre. Marvel made the careers of the previously little-known Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Chris Evans (Captain America), re-appropriated high-end TV talent in the shape of Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s Doctor Strange and turned heroes of indie cinema such as Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) into bona fide saviours of the Earth.
