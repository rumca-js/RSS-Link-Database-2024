A former Expedia Group employee, Marcelo F. Vargas-Fernandez, 42, pleaded not guilty to four counts of voyeurism in connection with the case during his arraignment Thursday in King County Superior Court in Seattle. Seattle Police Department investigators have returned to campus to conduct additional searches, and no additional recording devices were found in&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/expedia-group-to-close-seattle-hq-temporarily-to-enhance-security-after-discovery-of-spy-cameras/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/expedia-group-to-close-seattle-hq-temporarily-to-enhance-security-after-discovery-of-spy-cameras", "album": "", "page_rating_votes": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "page_rating": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-16T21:20:12+00:00", "permanent": false, "dead": false, "language": "en-US", "source_obj__id": 338, "page_rating_visits": 0, "user": null, "age": null, "vote": 0, "title": "Expedia Group to close Seattle HQ temporarily to enhance security after discovery of spy cameras"}, {"page_rating_contents": 0, "thumbnail": null, "tags": [], "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"1260\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Jordan-headshot-2020-1043x1260.jpg\" width=\"1043\" /><br />\u2014\u00a0Veteran Seattle-area software entrepreneur Jordan Schwartz joined S\u0113kr, a San Diego startup that aims to help &#8220;vanlife&#8221; travelers find campsites and community, as its chief product officer.

Remember the human algorithm. Be vulnerable. And stay flexible. These were some of the tidbits of advice shared by Seattle-area tech leaders who have decades of experience at corporate giants and fledgling startups. The tips apply to people leading a company or a team or just anyone working on self-improvement in the workplace. We&#8217;ve compiled the key takeaways from the discussion, hosted by the Harvard Business School Club of Seattle last week.

A year ago, when IonQ revealed its plans to create a new kind of research and manufacturing facility in the Seattle area, the idea was to use roughly 65,000 square feet of space on two floors of a three-story building in Bothell that once housed offices for AT&#38;T Wireless. &#8220;We&#8217;re happy to announce today we&#8217;ve taken the third floor, so we have the entire building now,&#8221; IonQ CEO Peter Chapman said&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ionq-new-quantum-computer-factory/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ionq-new-quantum-computer-factory", "album": "", "page_rating_votes": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "page_rating": 0, "date_published": "2024-02-16T05:19:34+00:00", "permanent": false, "dead": false, "language": "en-US", "source_obj__id": 338, "page_rating_visits": 0, "user": null, "age": null, "vote": 0, "title": "IonQ shows off its new quantum computer factory \u2014 and already has plans to expand"}, {"page_rating_contents": 0, "thumbnail": null, "tags": [], "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"528\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/E32019BriefingHERO-1-hero.jpg\" width=\"940\" /><br />The console wars aren\u2019t over, but they\u2019ve mutated into a new phase, where Microsoft is officially playing both sides as hard as it can. That was one of my big takeaways from today\u2019s special episode of the Official Xbox Podcast, which was released as a response to several rumors from last week. According to anonymous leakers, Microsoft had explored the possibility of bringing several of its biggest first-party games, such as the forthcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, to rival platforms such as the PlayStation 5.
