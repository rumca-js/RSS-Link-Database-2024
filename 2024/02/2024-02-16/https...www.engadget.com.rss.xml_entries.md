<p>A coalition of 20 tech companies <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.aielectionsaccord.com">signed</a> an agreement Friday to help prevent AI deepfakes in the critical 2024 elections taking place in more than 40 countries. OpenAI, Google, Meta, Amazon, Adobe and X are among the businesses joining the pact to prevent and combat AI-generated content that could influence voters. However, the agreement’s vague language and lack of binding enforcement call into question whether it goes far enough.</p>
<p>The list of companies signing the “Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections” includes those that create and distribute AI models, as well as social platforms where the deepfakes are most likely to pop up. The signees are Adobe, Amazon, Anthropic, Arm, ElevenLabs, Google, IBM, Inflection AI, LinkedIn, McAfee, Meta, Microsoft, Nota, OpenAI, Snap Inc., Stability AI, TikTok, Trend Micro, Truepic and X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>Epic Games <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2023-year-in-review"><ins>just announced that</ins></a> Apple has finally reinstated its iOS developer account in the European Union. This means that the developer plans to launch a digital storefront for iOS devices sometime this year. More importantly, this will allow users to easily download <em>Fortnite</em> on iPhones.</p>
<p>The company revealed that it would be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-confirms-fortnite-is-coming-back-to-ios-in-europe-this-year-040818909.html"><ins>bringing its games store and </ins><em><ins>Fortnite</ins></em><ins> to iOS</ins></a> back in January, but it wasn’t clear if Apple would grant it a developer account. This account makes it much easier for developers to distribute apps and content across Apple’s various platforms.</p>

<p>Engadget has always been a scrappy team, but there are only so many news stories, reviews, reports and buying guides our staff can write in a given week. As such, we’re looking to add some reliable contributing writers to our team who know their way around the tech space and can turn around some fast, clean copy to boot. We are looking for writers across a variety of disciplines: short-form news writing, product reviews and buying guides (what some will call “best lists,” but frankly, we prefer the term guides).</p>
<p>You don’t have to fit all three of those boxes to apply. If you’re looking to contribute to our news desk specifically, the hours we most need help are the very long stretch from 7AM ET to 7PM ET. As such, it would probably be helpful if you were based in North America, or even the UK or Europe. For reviews, features and buying guides, it really doesn’t matter where you’re based so long as you do great work.</p>

<p>Presidents' Day sales are usually more focused on appliances, mattresses and home goods than consumer tech, and that's the case again in 2024. That said, if you're looking for a new gadget, we've managed to pick out a few tech deals that are actually worth considering. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL05ldy1BcHBsZS1BaXJQb2RzLU1heC1CbHVlL2RwL0IwOFBaRDc2TlA_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLXYtNWwtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImEwNDk3NGExLWEyMzgtNGQ1Yi04NjEyLWZkZTBhMDQyOTMxMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcW9aNVehva1lDUA2IdgRJOEGjMM2ys2RORTL3Rc3pdg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNew-Apple-AirPods-Max-Blue%2Fdp%2FB08PZD76NP">Apple's AirPods Max</a> are $100 off, for instance, while <a class="rapid-with-clickid

<p>Waiting on hold is a great way to hear the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-SIManm_Qo"><ins>same weird instrumental song</ins></a> over and over again, but otherwise it’s an absolute waste of time. Google originally tackled the issue on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hold-for-me-duplex-pixel-5-4a-030330679.html"><ins>Pixel phones back in 2020 </ins></a>via the “Hold for Me” tool, which would wait in the queue and alert you when an actual person picked up.

<p>All of a sudden, VR is interesting again. The Meta Quest 3 delivers excellent standalone virtual reality for $500, while Apple has thrown down the gauntlet with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-review-beta-testing-the-future-201430272.html">Vision Pro</a>, a $3,500 stab at combining VR and augmented reality (AR). After a few years of stagnation, it’s worth considering an immersive headset — and if you’re already a VR aficionado, it’s certainly time to move on from the original Quest. But for the Apple fanatics, or people who can easily afford it, the Vision Pro is a glimpse at where the entire category might be headed. We’ve tested and reviewed all of the big players in the VR game; this buyer’s guide will help you decide which headset is right for you.</p>

<p>We still can’t stop thinking about the Apple Vision Pro. This week, Cherlynn and Devindra chat with CNET’s Scott Stein about our post-review impressions of Apple’s headset. We’ve got further thoughts about using it in public (maybe don’t), the isolation of being sealed off from the world, and the way falling asleep with the Vision Pro on can make you lose your sense of reality. We also discuss Mark Zuckerberg’s impression of the headset, and why he thinks the Quest 3 is ultimately a better product. (We agree, with caveats.) In other news, we explore how Arc’s ad-stripped AI mobile search app may be good for its users, but ultimately bad for web creators.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-adds-a-hulu-tab-as-the-streaming-services-start-integrating-153023092.html">Disney+</a> has <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/marvel-animation-x-men-97-trailer">released the first trailer</a> for its upcoming animated series <em>X-Men '97,</em> and it feels like a blast from the past for fans of the animated series that aired in the 90s. Its story picks up from where the old series left off, with the trailer showing how the team makes an effort to work together after the death of Professor X who was seriously injured by the end of the Saturday morning cartoon. That means viewers can expect the same roster of mutants from the original show, including Cyclops as team leader, Wolverine, Jean Grey, Beast, Storm, Rogue, Gambit, Jubilee and Bishop. By the end of trailer, we also get a glimpse of Magneto, who apparently inherited everything Professor X had left behind.&nbsp;</p>
