<ul><li>City level with hosts on top of WSL after Shaw scores winner</li><li>‘It’s a big step for us.

Perhaps this was why <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/16/manchester-city-sink-chelsea-to-join-hosts-on-top-of-the-wsl">Manchester City’s 1-0 defeat of Chelsea</a>, erasing the champions’ three-point lead in the Women’s Super League, felt like such a watershed. “It’s a big step for us,” Taylor said. “In the past we’ve been a bit soft defensively in these moments. I knew the margins were going to be tight. But confidence was high.”<br /><br />Khadija Shaw’s early goal proved the decisive strike, but Taylor reserved his richest praise for a defence that has still conceded only eight goals all season and held off Chelsea in a stirring second-half rearguard. “We’ve added a bit of steeliness to our d

<p>From a little pocket of travelling fans in the corner of Kingsmeadow came a cascade of roars and screams, the sound of a title race coming alive. For Manchester City, a statement result to match a statement performance. The queens of Kingsmeadow have been dethroned, Chelsea beaten at home in the Women’s Super League for the first time in more than three years, their lead cut down to nothing: zero points, zero goal difference.</p><p>Khadija Shaw got the only goal of the game, her first against Chelsea in the league in five attempts, but really this was a tale of resolve and defensive backbone in the face of almost unimaginable pressure: not just the increasingly desperate waves of Chelsea attack but the burden of history, the weight of what this would all mean.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/16/manchester-city-sink-chelsea-to-join-hosts-on-top-of-the-wsl">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Opera House, London</strong><br />Impressive new work from Joshua Junker and Mthuthuzeli November pushes dancers well beyond the classical repertoire</p><p>Ballet is a heritage art form that craves renewal. Companies often seek a galvanising jolt from artists in other dance styles, but the Royal Ballet’s festival gives classically trained makers a space to spread their wings, with length, large ensembles and strong design. The evening of new works results in confident main stage debuts for two experienced women based in New York and two younger men working in the UK.<br /><br />The only choreographer drawn from the Royal Ballet’s ranks is Joshua Junker. Never Known opens with a twitching, angular pack of dancers staring up at a high, hazy light (Zeynep Kepekli’s gloriously responsive lighting is key to all four ballets). Junker’s movement is often deliberate, close to the floor. He stretches his cast, quite literally: spines slink backwards, one dancer drapes

While Ed Norton never seemed the right fit as Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk in 2008, it was the signing of Robert Downey Jr in the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man that inspired the newly Disney-owned outfit to embark on a decade-long run of smartly interconnected, far-out superhero epics that redefined the genre. Marvel made the careers of the previously little-known Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Chris Evans (Captain America), re-appropriated high-end TV talent in the shape of Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange and turned heroes of indie cinema such as Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) into bona fide saviours of the Earth.

<p>For many years, this courageous man taunted the corrupt butcher of the Kremlin.

The curses and tears of families and friends whose loved ones have been taken, jailed, tortured, killed are accepted as a kind of sick, validating tribute to their power, cruelty and inhumanity.</p><p>What your average thuggish tyrant simply cannot stand is ridicule. And Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia and indicted, mass-murdering war criminal, is no exception to this unfunny rule. Putin takes himself very seriously indeed. He appears totally lacking in any sense of humour. Self-deprecation is as foreign to him as mercy is to a wolf.

The best description of myself is ‘a man who always walks’.”</p><p>After his writing about conditions for refugees in Australia’s offshore jails started to appear in the world’s newspapers, Boochani became the recognisable face of those detained.

<p>Hybrid working may have led to the rise of comfort wear, but office dressing is making a comeback</p><p>Pinstripes vanished from the face of the Earth in 2020, the kind of job that&nbsp;calls for a pinstripe being the kind of job that can now be done from a&nbsp;laptop at home. As a rule, people who&nbsp;work on construction sites or in pharmacies, on buses or in health surgeries don’t wear pinstripes. And people who wear pinstripes for work don’t wear them at the weekends.</p><p>So, in the work-from-home era, they&nbsp;completely disappeared. And it seemed for a while like pinstripes might never come back, that they’d go&nbsp;the way of morning suits or formal hats, relegated from real life and only seen on the edges, as fancy dress or on&nbsp;fancy days.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/feb/16/from-pinstripes-to-over-sized-blazers-the-nine-to-five-look-is-back">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US author on Georgette Heyer, Bora Chung – and reciting Diana Wynne Jones by heart</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><strong> <br /></strong>My sister and I were obsessed with Tomi Ungerer’s The Beast of Monsieur Racine, a picture book in which two children disguise themselves as a mysterious beast and are studied by a scientist. It’s a fun story, but on each page, comical and grotesque things are happening. A nail pokes up on a slide, a pickpocket steals something from a distracted woman, a falling axe splits open a man’s head. We studied the illustrations as if we were poring over a sacred text.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><strong> <br /></strong>Now sadly out of print, Joyce Ballou Gregorian’s The Broken Citadel was the first book of a trilogy. In it, a young girl steps into another world, where she joins a prince and a scholar who mean to kill a monster and rescue a princess. Each chapter is prefaced by a poem or a scholarly no

At Wolfsburg in May 2021, despite success, the Austrian departed because he felt it was difficult to take the club forward with the level of investment that summer and it was similar when he left Eintracht Frankfurt last summer.

<p>Don’t neglect your skin just because it’s cloudy and grey – your skin needs protection from UV rays whatever the season</p><p>Whenever I talk about sunscreen in winter, I’m invariably scolded by someone about our need for vitamin D. And I do understand it. In Britain, we’re almost all of us deficient in vitamin D during the colder months (many of us in summer, too). Low vitamin D has been linked to&nbsp;myriad health complaints, from mild to life-threatening. But while it sounds commonsensical, skipping sun protection to increase your vitamin D level is highly risky, and has had limited success and fallen flat under scrutiny so far.</p><p>There are far safer ways to obtain vitamin D (from supplements or, better still, a balanced diet) than by subjecting skin cells to UVA radiation, which makes up about 95% of the UV rays that reach our skin, and doesn’t even cause vitamin D synthesis. What UVA <em>does </em>do is destroy collagen; cause sun damage, uneven pigmentation and

But while singer-songwriter Jason Lytle <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSUJ-M4Fhk">cheerfully confessed OK Computer as an inspiration</a>, Grandaddy bore heavier influence from the Beach Boys and country.</p><p>That latter element has never been as explicit as on their sixth full-length: Lytle’s sole foil throughout is Max Hart, on mooning pedal steel, while song titles like You’re Going To Be Fine and I’m Going To Hell evoke the genre’s deft balance of heartbreak and deadpan drollness.

<p>The current crop might be the best Academy Awards list in years, but which was the best ever year for films? Guardian writers present their case for the winner of winners</p><p>In three weeks’ time, the credits will roll on the best cinema season in recent memory. Ten films are up for the best picture Oscar on 10 March and not a dud among them. That is unusual. Usually you will find an Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close in there somewhere. Or maybe more than one (Babel, The Blind Side), or even a trio (Crash, Les Miserables, Bohemian Rhapsody). Often, it’s hard to get jazzed by the awards race; sometimes it’s tricky to feel strongly about any of the big contenders.</p><p>This year is different.

<p>Everyone agrees the state pension system needs reforming – so why is changing it so hard?</p><p>The age at which people in the UK can access the state pension keeps rising. Economists say it is inevitable that young people entering the workforce now will need to keep working into their 70s to start tapping the social safety net.</p><p>Every time the pension age inches upwards, more people find themselves stranded if they are unable to work because of sickness or disability but too young to receive government help. With life expectancy in Britain no longer growing across the board, many people, especially in disadvantaged communities, may die long before they can start accessing the fund. And some of those who do reach pension age might find their government payments help them to survive the golden years, but leave little room to enjoy them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/feb/16/why-is-it-becoming-so-hard-to-retire-in-the-uk-podcast">Continue readi
