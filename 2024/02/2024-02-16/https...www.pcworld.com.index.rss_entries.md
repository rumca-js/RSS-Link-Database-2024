<p>The best USB-C hubs are designed to expand your laptop&rsquo;s capabilities, allowing you to connect printers, mice, and keyboards via a dongle that connects to your laptop&rsquo;s USB-C port.</p>



<p>Each of our USB-C hub recommendations contains a variety of ports (including USB-A ports, HDMI, and more) that allow you to connect legacy devices like USB memory keys, display connectors, and more to your laptop. Our recommendations dive into the benefits of each dongle, which we&rsquo;ve tested and reviewed.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve organized our USB-C recommendations this way: traditional USB-C hubs on top, followed by our picks for the best USB-C docking stations. The latter are a bit bulkier, but tend to offer more connections. We&rsquo;ll also introduce you to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://xn--sonnets%20echo%20

## Best Thunderbolt docks 2024: Extend your laptop’s capabilities

<p>A Thunderbolt dock is now nearly a must-have accessory, providing I/O access for legacy mice, keyboards, external drives, and more. It&rsquo;s a key ingredient for a productive office, whether at work or home. And now there&rsquo;s a new upcoming wrinkle: Thunderbolt 5.</p>



<p>Thunderbolt docks or docking stations help fill the gaps as laptop makers slim down, cut costs, and eliminate multiple ports in favor of a do-it-all Thunderbolt port instead. That may seem like they&rsquo;re pushing those costs on to you (which they are) but it also means you can pick and choose a dock with exactly the ports you need. </p>



<p>Why buy a Thunderbolt dock? Because of the bandwidth it provides. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html">best USB-C hubs and dongles</a> provide legacy ports (USB-A,

<p>Benchmarks, while inherently contentious and not always representative of real-world performance, are an important tool in any kind of quantitative evaluation. That&rsquo;s why nerds are obsessed with them. And not just nerds: companies use third-party benchmark results to make decisions on millions, sometimes billions of dollars in investment. So when someone finds evidence of a company putting its figurative thumb on the scale, it has the potential for big ramifications. Such is the case with some recent, and very specific, Intel Xeon CPU benchmarks.</p>

<p>Since 1983, PCWorld has been testing PCs, and while we made the jump from paper to digital years ago, our mission remains the same: We&rsquo;re here to help you make better choices about your PC hardware purchases. </p>



<p>Most importantly, this mission extends to our laptop coverage, which we handle with utmost care. If you&rsquo;re wondering how we evaluate laptops and Chromebooks, buckle up for an in-depth explanation of the testing process.</p>



<p>To determine performance, we use benchmarking software like PCMark, 3DMark, and Cinebench. These tests, which we&rsquo;ll cover in more depth below, are designed to give the CPU and GPU a sweat-inducing workout. We also evaluate more subjective matters like the laptop&rsquo;s build quality, its typing experience, audio quality, available ports and more. Real-world testing is central to the PCWorld met

<p>When buying a PC, you can spend a lot of time zeroing in on the right specs for your situation. But the attentiveness often ends there. After the decision&rsquo;s made, we slot the machine into a spot on our desks and then go about business as usual.</p>



<p>That fancy computer isn&rsquo;t the only part that matters, though. The rest of your desk setup can have a huge impact on your quality of life day to day and upgrading it doesn&rsquo;t have to cost a lot.

<p>Network security is not just for IT professionals. Even home users need to keep their networks secure to prevent unauthorized people from, for example, hogging their broadband, installing malware that turns connected devices into robots in botnets, and spying on what you and your family are doing.</p>



<p>In the past, the internal network was often considered safe and protection against threats from the internet was the most important thing, but today security experts recommend using encrypted connections as much as possible even within the local network.</p>



<p>It may seem complicated, but with basic knowledge and the right settings in your router, you&rsquo;ll go a long way.</p>
