<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 16 February 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01819-x">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01819-x</a></p>Active and stable catalysts to accelerate the transition from fossil fuel to renewable feedstocks, reduce energy consumption and minimize environmental footprints are needed. Electrocatalysts based on copper nanocrystals encapsulated in hybrid alumina shells stable against structural reconstruction during CO2 electroreduction are reported.
