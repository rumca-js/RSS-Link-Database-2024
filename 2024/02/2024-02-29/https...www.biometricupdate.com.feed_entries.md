		Illinois’ secretary of state, Alexi Giannoulias, is backing legislation to create mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs). It’s not an insignificant development. The Secretary of State’s office is powerful in the state.

Giannoulias has endorsed House Bill 4592. The legislation would allow people to display digital driver’s licenses and identification on a phone alongside their physical counterparts. If passed, digital documents with biometrics could be legal this time next year.

Physical copies would still be preferred. A police officer could accept a digital ID but people <a href="https://legiscan.com/IL/bill/HB4592/2023">would have to show</a> a physical document if asked for it.

Lawmakers are calling for digital documents that only sh

		Kenya’s Public Service Cabinet Secretary Moses Kuria says the government plans to chase away “ghosts” from its public service through a biometric count of all public servants.

In comments to the press this week, Kuria said the decision comes after the government realized that its civil service is “full of ghosts,” The Star <a href="https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2024-02-27-cs-kuria-all-public-servants-to-undergo-biometric-registration/">reports</a>.

It also likely will chastise Congress for its unwillingness to produce bipartisan, comprehensive privacy legislation.
