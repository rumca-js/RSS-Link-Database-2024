They discuss her landmark first book, \u201cIrreversible Damage,\u201d as well as her latest publication, available now: \u201cBad Therapy: Why The Kids Aren\u2019t Growing Up\". From this, they break down the state of the therapeutic industry, the overgrown tendency of professionals to \u201ctreat the well, rather than the sick,\u201d the existence and need for necessary trauma, and the now-generational impact of harmful therapy, and by extension, harmful parenting.\n\nAbigail Shrier received the Barbara Olson Award for Excellence and Independence in Journalism in 2021. Her best-selling book, Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters (2020), was named a \u201cBest Book\u201d by the Economist and the Times (of London). It has been translated into ten languages. Her upcoming publication, Bad Therapy: Why The Kids Aren\u2019t Growing Up is slated for release in early 2024.\n\nThis episode was recorded on December 14th, 2023\n\nDr. Peterso", "page_rating": 0, "bookmarked": false, "album": "", "user": null, "artist": "Jordan B Peterson", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4roLI_Gb12I", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/4roLI_Gb12I/hqdefault.jpg", "vote": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0}]
