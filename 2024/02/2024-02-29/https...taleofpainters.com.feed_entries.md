<p>Super quick post today, because I don't have much to say about the Royal Decapitator. It's a nice model with a choice of two heads. I choose the classic hooded head for my executioner. I painted him up to match the rest of my force (well done Captain obvious) with his pale skin, purple hands and brown legs. </p>
