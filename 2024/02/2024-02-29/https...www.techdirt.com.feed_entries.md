Much like the phrase &#8220;smart technology,&#8221; the word &#8220;security&#8221; just doesn&#8217;t mean what it used to. Case in point: last September, owners of Wyze &#8220;smart home security cameras&#8221; were informed at the company&#8217;s forums that the company had &#8220;crossed some wires in the backend,&#8221; resulting in a glitch that allowed 2,300 users to see the [&#8230;]

Politics is messy, and you get the feeling that a lot of internet companies want nothing to do with “politics” of any kind. Back in 2019 Twitter (when it was still Twitter) decided to ban all political ads, a near-impossible task guaranteed to make a mess of things (such as banning “get out the vote” [&#8230;]

I know people are bored to death after years of infighting over net neutrality. But the FCC&#8217;s attempts to impose something vaguely resembling oversight upon a bunch of shitty regional telecom monopolies that have bludgeoned U.S. broadband into uncompetitive rubble still matters, no matter how tired the press and public might be of the debate, [&#8230;]

The mess is getting a little messier. We had talked days ago about Sony&#8217;s decision to shutter its Funimation platform in favor of a more recent acquisition in Crunchyroll. Anyone with a Funimation account would be transitioned into a Crunchyroll account, which sounds all good until you realize that Funimation users had plenty of digital [&#8230;]

No matter how minor the infraction, it still deserves the court&#8217;s full attention. That&#8217;s the ultimate lesson of this New York court decision, brought to us by FourthAmendment.com.
