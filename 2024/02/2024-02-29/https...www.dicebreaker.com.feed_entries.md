Their names are Tuomas Pirinen and Mike Franchina, a game designer and concept artist duo who are both 20-year veterans of the gaming industry. Pirinen&rsquo;s resume especially proves relevant here - he was the main creative mind behind Mordheim, Games Workshop&rsquo;s own <a href="https://www.dicebre
