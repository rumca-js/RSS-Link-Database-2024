In other news, Saber Interactive has now separated itself from their embattled parent company, Embracer Group, to the tune of $500 million. Saber is reportedly still working on the troubled Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, though no updates have been given since word got out that development was essentially starting over on that title.
