Developed by Inflexion Games, Nightingale is an ambitious effort. It spans multiple Realms, which players can customize and modify on a whim while setting up an intriguing story about the titular city and those struggling to reach it.

Unfortunately, despite a solid aesthetic and interesting lore, Nightingale falters in several ways. Combat is responsive but simplistic and gets repetitive over time. The procedural generation impresses at first, but it's not long before the same points of interest appear despite different conditions. Then there are the abundant server issues and lack of an offline mode.

Nightingale is in early access and will continue to grow, and while there is some fun here, the core systems require several revamps and quality-of-life features to reach their potential.

Pacific Drive is an odd mash-up of genres, from driving and survival crafting to rogue-lite and supernatural adventure. However, what's most important is that it works, compelling you to delve deeper into the horrors of the Olympic Exclusion Zone.

As passersby through the Pacific Northwest, players are suddenly transported into the Zone and acquire a strange station wagon. It becomes their greatest asset as they plan routes, explore different regions and find a way out of the Zone. It's much easier said than done, especially with the Anomalies and Instability running amuck.

Still, even with the odd nagging issue or three, Pacific Drive delivers an addictive gameplay loop, whether you're out scavenging for materials to improve your vehicle or learning more about ARDA and its mishaps.
