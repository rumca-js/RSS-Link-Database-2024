<p>Java developers would gain an easier way to create records, and more streamlined code for declaring record classes, through derived record creation, a preview language feature being considered by the OpenJDK community.</p><p><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/468" rel="nofollow">Derived record creation</a> would allow developers to create new records from existing records, specifying only the components that are different. Goals of the proposal include providing a concise means to create new record values from existing ones and streamlining the declaration of record classes by eliminating the need to provide explicit wither methods, which are the immutable analogue of setter methods.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3713268/openjdk-proposal-would-streamline-java-records-creation.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>With the growth of sophisticated attacks against critical software and infrastructure systems, multi-factor authentication (MFA) has emerged as a critical layer of defense against unauthorized access. An increasing number of enterprise and developer-facing technology applications and platforms, from GitHub to Salesforce to Amazon Web Services, are making MFA mandatory for users.</p><p>That said, we are all used to passwords, and many people like the status quo. Not surprisingly, the introduction of MFA has added friction to the login process. This can negatively impact the user experience.</p><p>A newer technology that can provide even greater security benefits than MFA is now becoming more widely deployed. That technology is called passkeys. Based on widely accepted industry standards, passkeys offers the tantalizing promise of eliminating the need for passwords and the risks passwords create without adding user experience friction like M
