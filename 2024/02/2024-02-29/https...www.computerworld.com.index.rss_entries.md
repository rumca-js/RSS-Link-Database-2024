Each of the eight groups filed their complaints with their national data protection authorities, as there is no pan-European office to accept such complaints.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3713269/eight-european-consumer-watchdogs-file-complaints-over-meta-s-data-processing.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>By 2030, companies will spend $42 billion a year on generative artificial intelligence (genAI) projects such as chatbots, research, writing, and summarization tools. And while the technology has been heralded as a boon to productivity, nailing down a return on investment (ROI) in genAI could prove to be elusive.</p><p>“Capturing and measuring the exact productivity improvements has been a challenge for many of our clients,” said Rita Sallam, a distinguished vice president analyst at Gartner. “For [genAI], we are not saying that finding ROI may be difficult, but expressing ROI has been difficult because many benefits like productivity…have indirect or non-financial impacts that create financial outcomes in the future."</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3713340/the-roi-in-ai-and-how-to-find-it.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
