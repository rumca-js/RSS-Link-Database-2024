<p>Saber Interactive has reportedly found an exit strategy from the death grip of its parent company, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/embracer-group-thq-nordic-deep-silver-koch-media-games-publishing-180030105.html">Embracer Group AB</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-29/embracer-group-to-sell-saber-subsidiary-in-500-million-deal">reported</a> Thursday that “a group of private investors” will buy the studio in a deal worth roughly $500 million. Saber would then become a private company with about 3,500 employees.</p>
<p>Engadget emailed a spokesperson from Saber for confirmation about the alleged buyout. The studio declined to comment.</p>

<p>Activision studio Toys for Bob has announced that it's leaving the corporate rat race and is <a href="https://www.toysforbob.com/blog/2024/WereGoingIndie"><ins>spinning off as an independent developer.</ins></a> This comes just weeks after Activision Blizzard's parent company Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-gaming-layoffs-include-86-jobs-at-skylanders-studio-toys-for-bob-182241293.html"><ins>instituted sweeping layoffs</ins></a> at Toys for Bob that impacted 86 employees. That’s more than half of the entire staff.</p>
<p>The developer said the choice to go indie will allow it to return to “being a small and nimble studio”, harkening back to its early days of the 1980s and 1990s when it made hit titles like <em>Star Control.</em> To that end, the company says it's already developing a new game, though there won’t be any official announcements for a while.</p>

<p>Dell's XPS 16 takes the minimalist design of the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-13-plus-review-beauty-usability-120015270-120015030.html">XPS 13 Plus</a> and scales it up to a 16-inch system that's far more powerful and functional. But just like with that earlier machine, which was Dell's first attempt at implementing an "invisible" trackpad in its palm rest, there are some usability tradeoffs. It's hard not to be impressed by how sleek the XPS 16 looks — personally, I consider it one of the most attractive Windows laptops around — but power users who demand a wide variety of ports may find it lacking. (Even Apple can fit a full-sized SD card slot and HDMI port on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-13-plus-review-beauty-usability-120015270-120015030.html">MacBook Pros</a>, why can't Dell?)</p>

<p>First up, desktop Chrome users are getting new search suggestions that pull from what others have been using the browser to look for. The browser will still remember your recent queries and auto populate related search suggestions, but you’ll also see user-generated options to the right of those usual autofill suggestions, under a tab marked “People also search for.”</p>

The biggest addition is support for plugins, something that only worked with Copilot on the web previously. You could, for example, connect Copilot to OpenTable so you can make a reservation from within its chat window. If you're low on groceries, you could start an order using the Instacart plugin. Microsoft says that plugins from Kayak, Klarna and Shopify will also be arriving over the next month. The goal, of course, is to keep you locked into the Copilot window for as long as possible.</p>

<p>The number of smart home devices on the market today is intimidating to say the least. With so many companies in the game now, and different IoT standards and voice assistants to consider, it can get confusing to even know where to start building a smart home ecosystem from scratch. But we at Engadget can help: before you dive in, we recommend not trying to outfit your whole home in one go. Not only can this be quite expensive, but also we think it’s generally best to buy just one or two items first to see if you like them. You should also pick a preferred voice assistant and stick with it. Below are the best smart home gadgets you can get right now, plus some advice on how to choose the right voice assistant for your needs.</p>
