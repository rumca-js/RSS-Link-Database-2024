<p>How did Britain get to this point – and what can be done? The Scottish musician and writer’s provocative documentary comes at the question from a highly refreshing perspective</p><p>‘This is a bit of a flashback for me,” jokes the hip-hop artist, author and social commentator Darren McGarvey, as he gets into the back of a police car. This time, though, he has chosen to jump in of his own accord, rather than being obliged to. It’s a light moment for The State We’re In – the ambitious, broad and whip-smart documentary he presents, which raises two questions about the state of the UK today. First, how did we get here? And second, what can be done about it? Over three episodes, McGarvey breaks his investigation into three areas: the state of education, the state of our healthcare, and in this opener, the state of the justice system.</p><p>McGarvey grew up on a council estate in Scotland and has always been interested in questions of power and poverty. There are plenty of peopl

<p>Voters want Biden to drastically change course on Gaza and deliver a ceasefire. Only stopping Israel’s war will assuage voters</p><p>The Michigan Democratic primary was the first test of the electoral strength of the movement for a ceasefire in Gaza. It exhibited strength beyond what any observer expected, showing the size and enthusiasm of the peace movement and the danger to President Biden of continuing his current policy of full support for Israel. Organizers of the Listen to Michigan campaign to vote uncommitted in the Michigan primary set the bar at 10,000 votes – the margin of victory in Michigan’s 2016 general election. “Uncommitted” had blown past that number before even 10% of the vote had been counted. Biden needs to heed this flashing warning sign and drastically change course: call for a ceasefire, halt arms shipments to Israel and exert maximal diplomatic pressure now. The call for a ceasefire now can no longer be written off as a demand of only leftwing acti

It soon became clear to me that they didn’t really understand what football fans go through. Conversely, I also realised that most football fans haven’t got a clue what footballers go through. I reached a similar conclusion when I worked with farmers. I didn’t understand what they were all about, and vice versa.</p><p>The scales fell from my eyes a year ago when I spent some time filming with a hill farmer called Emlyn near Dolgellau. I’d done a lot of walking in this kind of country and thought I had some understanding of what went on, but it turned out there was almost no assumption I’d made about his life and work that was anywhere near the mark.

<p>Each year, tens of thousands of UK citizens are charged with non-payment of their TV licence fee – from the man who missed payments while in hospital, to a woman with a brain injury who forgot to pay</p><p>It was autumn 2020 when someone from TV Licensing knocked on Josiane’s door. She was on maternity leave with her daughter, who was born that January, and had recently moved into a flat of her own, having previously lived in shared accommodation. Her first thought was: “I don’t want to get Covid,” she remembers. “I was terrified of getting ill. I was a single parent, I didn’t have family around, what would happen to my baby?”</p><p>She had bought a TV two weeks earlier, but was unaware that she needed a licence for it. “It had always been in my rental agreement,” she says. I meet her in a cafe in Basildon, near her home, with her daughter, who has just turned four, and her boyfriend, Giuseppe. “Maybe people who were born here know these things,” she says, and Giuseppe chi

<p>Campaigners and MPs have dismissed the prime minister’s claim as hyperbolic, alarmist and illiberal </p><p>Good morning. When <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> (eventually) decided to take action against Lee Anderson after he claimed that the city of London, and Sadiq Khan, its mayor, were under the control of Islamists, people asked why he was not prepared to discpline, or even criticise, the former home secretary Suella Braverman, who had said something even stronger. “The truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the anti-Semites are in charge now,” she said <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/02/22/islamists-are-bullying-britain-into-submission/">in a Telegraph article</a>. It was assumed that Sunak did not want to pick a fight with her because she has too much support within the party.</p><p>Now it seems there is another explanation: Sunak did not criticise Braverman because he broadly agrees with her. That is the implication of a No 10 briefing last night

A&nbsp;century and a half later, there is an argument to be made that Bell’s device is one of the most transformative inventions in human history.</p><p>Yet the 29-year-old Bell we meet in Sarah Marsh’s engaging first novel is a&nbsp;man whose passion for invention was very much secondary to his other great project: teaching deaf people to speak. Graham’s mother and his wife, Mabel, were both deaf, and Bell was committed to integrating deaf people into hearing society through “oralism”, which meant not only teaching them to make speech by learning how to move their mouths by rote, but also forbidding them to us

And yet, despite painstaking research, I can’t find anything about whooping up. Not a podcast, vodcast or TikTok video. I’ve had to invent the term “whooping up” because it hasn’t even got a name yet. But we’ve all seen footballers do it – turning their back to the pitch and waving both arms upwards as if to say: “Roar, damn you!” And we do roar, don’t we, those of us who like to verbalise at matches?</p><p>It says something important about our relationship with people who kick a ball about for our entertainment. Because there is no other arena where we so obediently do what rich people tell us. When our bosses invite us to live their company’s values, we don’t bustle off and live them.

Originally from Bedfordshire, she had moved to the area for her job in the civil service and didn’t have family living nearby.

<p>Tory deputy chair Lee Anderson was suspended from the party after suggesting London’s mayor Sadiq Khan was being controlled by Islamists. But why can’t the party call his comments Islamophobic? Archie Bland reports</p><p>Lee Anderson is no stranger to controversy. While deputy chair of the Conservative party he earned the nickname “30p Lee” after chastising food bank users for not budgeting well enough and claiming that meals could be made for 30 pence each.

<p>Pacific leaders are increasingly concerned that Washington’s actions in the region conflict with their objectives</p><p>A delay by the US in providing crucial funding to Pacific Island nations is fuelling concern in the region – but questions about the competing visions held by the US and regional leaders are even more pressing.</p><p>The funding is part of longstanding agreements the US has with three nations in the north Pacific, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Marshall Islands and Palau. The agreements, known as the Compacts of Free Association (Cofa), provide a range of assistance to these nations, including visa-free entry to the US, grant assistance, trust fund contributions, and support for government services including the US postal service. In exchange, the US gets exclusive military access to large parts of the north Pacific.</p><p><em>Terence Wesley-Smith is Professor Emeritus in the Center for Pacific Islands Studies, University of Hawaii at Manoa

<p>Julianne Moore uses her gorgeous son as a sexy royal pawn – and it’s a wickedly lewd delight</p><p>The hardest part of this job is writing about drama. How do you get revved up for drama? “They said things in the right way. No jokes. Everyone was delivering their lines very earnestly. And then drama happened.” Every time a big drama project rolls around I worry: what can I say about the costume choices, the music, the direction? Because the acting in these things is always very pure, good, capital-A acting, and then never really gives me a critical in. It’s just: it’s <em>drama</em>.</p><p>Mary &amp; George (5 March, 9pm, Sky Atlantic) then, which is a drama. The costumes are nice, the music is genuinely fantastic, the direction is gorgeous. But actually, something texturally interesting about Mary &amp; George captured me from the off, and that’s it now. I get what you lot are always on about. Drama is good, finally, and I see why it always ends up winning awards.</p><p>M
