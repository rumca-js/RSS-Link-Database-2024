<p>Earlier this week the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2024/02/26/press-release-technical-report/">published a report</a> recommending the use of memory-safe programming languages to eliminate an entire class of vulnerabilities affecting software. The report quotes claims from large software producers like Google and Microsoft which estimate that <b>70% of vulnerabilities affecting software are due to memory-safety issues.</b><br /><br />Back in December of 2023, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3608324/us-and-international-partners-issue-recommendations-to-secure-software-products/">published a report</a> that included a list of memory-safe programming languages, <b>among them was the Python programming language</b>.</p><p>The Python Software Foundation‚Äôs <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/ONCD-2023-0002-0107
