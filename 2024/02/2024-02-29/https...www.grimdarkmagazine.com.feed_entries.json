Today, you get to join us in checking out some of Daniel Polansky&#8217;s February 27th, 2024 release from Angry Robot Books, Tomorrow&#8217;s Children. In our review, we talked about how the book has a steep learning curve for the voice in the first quarter, and definitely rewarded the reader who could focus and read for big chunks of time. It has Polansky&#8217;s trademark author stamp on it, which is just bloody brilliant, so if you loved The Builders, Those Above, and Straight Razor Cure, then you know you need this in your life. Full of Polansky\u2019s trademark snark and character bitterness and snappy dialogue, with excellent twists and turns and imagination in spades,\u00a0Tomorrow\u2019s Children is well worth the read.

McMinn delivers everything you could ever wish for from a dark and gritty multi-POV epic fantasy in her brilliant debut The Ruptured Sky. Runaway princess turned demon hunter Amikharlia has been hiding her mysterious magical powers for years, and all she wants in life is control over her own fate. Yet that wish quickly gets crushed when she somehow finds herself at the centre of a madman\u2019s prophecy concerning the revival of a dead goddess and the looming threat of the ruptured sky above them. Now it\u2019s up to Amika to decide if she\u2019s willing to give up her fight against destiny\u2019s chains in order to save all of civilization, even if that means potentially destroying the entire world in the process.
