We're kicking off Season 4 (and our 10th Anniversary of touring!) with an homage to harmonies: watch superstar PMJ vocalists Kyndle Wylde, Tawanda, and Tatum Langley revisit the classic style of one of the original girl groups - The Andrews Sisters - in our retro remake of The Spice Girls' 1996 hit, "Say You'll Be There."
