<br />Paul Allen is synonymous with philanthropic giving in the Pacific Northwest. Thirty-six years ago, the late Microsoft co-founder and his sister Jody Allen created their family foundation, which grants more than $55 million annually in charitable funding. Then in 2018, Paul died suddenly at the age of 65, triggering a reorganization of the effort. It has been five years now since the philanthropy created a board of directors and brought &#8220;more structure and formality&#8221; to the organization, said Lara Littlefield, the foundation&#8217;s executive director of partnerships and programs. The foundation&#8217;s oversight is still lean &#8212; namely Jody and a two-person&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/with-1-2b-in-assets-the-paul-allen-family-foundation-evolves-and-stays-true-to-its-pnw-roots/">Read More</a>

Electronic Arts (EA), based in Redwood City, Calif., is one of the largest independent game publishers in the modern industry, owing to the strength of franchises like Battlefield, Apex Legends, last year’s Dead Space remake, and its annually-released football simulator Madden. In addition to affiliates around the world, EA started new investments in the Seattle area in the last&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-studio-ridgeline-games-led-by-halo-co-creator-closes-as-part-of-ea-cuts/">Read More</a>

They were focused on ocean acidification, which is happening as seawater soaks up much of the excess carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels. The scientists were researching the effect of ocean conditions predicted for the end of the century. They devised a system for pulling carbon dioxide out of seawater from deep in the ocean and using it to create more acidic conditions at their experimental&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/oceanography-professors-transform-a-research-tool-into-a-startup-thats-sucking-co2-from-seawater/">Read More</a>

She went on to write a book about it, titled &#8220;Flying Free.&#8221; Today, she&#8217;s still flying free, as a professor and data scientist in the University of Washington &#8212; and as the co-founder of a Seattle startup that aims to commercialize her research.
