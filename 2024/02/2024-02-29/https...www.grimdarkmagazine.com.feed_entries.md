McMinn delivers everything you could ever wish for from a dark and gritty multi-POV epic fantasy in her brilliant debut The Ruptured Sky. Runaway princess turned demon hunter Amikharlia has been hiding her mysterious magical powers for years, and all she wants in life is control over her own fate. Yet that wish quickly gets crushed when she somehow finds herself at the centre of a madman’s prophecy concerning the revival of a dead goddess and the looming threat of the ruptured sky above them. Now it’s up to Amika to decide if she’s willing to give up her fight against destiny’s chains in order to save all of civilization, even if that means potentially destroying the entire world in the process. Now, while Amika was absolutely the kick-ass female lead of my dreams, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that she was only one of the four utterly compelling POV character
