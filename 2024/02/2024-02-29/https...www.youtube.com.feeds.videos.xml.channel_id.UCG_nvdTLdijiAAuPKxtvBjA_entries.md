The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes returns to the world of the Hunger Games, 60 years before Katniss Everdeen. And unfortunately, in a pretty meh way. It didn't make any kind  of impact and not a lot of people saw it. It wasn't the biggest box office flop failure, but it came and went like a fart in the wind. Why? Because Hollywood's sequel franchises are starting to lose steam. Let's try to find out why.
