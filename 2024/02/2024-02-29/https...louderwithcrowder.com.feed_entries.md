So much so that these people hunt out ways to take offense of their own accord. This is why it is not rare to see progressives crying and screaming at comedy shows. But that does not make it any less foolish and embarrassing. In fact, it's the logical equivalent of heading out to a bar and throwing a fit because there are drunk people there. That is what we are dealing with when it comes to those who take offense at a JOKE as well as those who wish to cancel comedians because they are ‚Äúoffensive.‚Äù </p><p>In other news, there are woke comedy clubs. </p><p>I could not think of anything more miserable than going to a comedy club in Seattle. Luckily, comedians Jim Florentine, Luis J. Gomez, Kurt Metzger, and Dave Smith were canceled by the Capitol Hill Comed

However, we will not rule out that she might be what a tyrant calls a ‚Äúuseful idiot.‚Äù </p><p>McQuade said that the "deep commitment to free speech" makes Americans vulnerable to disinformation. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
