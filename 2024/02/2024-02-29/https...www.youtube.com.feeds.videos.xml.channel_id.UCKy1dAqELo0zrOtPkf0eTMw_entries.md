In today's Daily Fix:
Rockstar Games is asking their employees to come back to the office five days a week. This is in response to several data breaches resulting in major leaks of the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6. Employees, however, are less than thrilled with the idea, and a game dev union is accusing Rockstar of going back on promises made regarding their work-from-home policy. In other news, Saber Interactive has now separated itself from their embattled parent company, Embracer Group, to the tune of $500 million. Saber is reportedly still working on the troubled Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, though no updates have been given since word got out that development was essentially starting over on that title. And finally, Tekken 8's microtransaction shop is live, and fans are not happy.

Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance Video reviewed by Jon Bolding on PC.

This RTS tries its best to bring a vicious, dirty, gritty war between humans and machines to life. It delivers flashes of that promise in motion, but lets itself down with obnoxious missions designed around inconsistent rules. Couple that with a confused campaign structure and anemic multiplayer skirmishes, and this otherwise appealing idea tips into the better-left-unplayed pile.
