They were also one of the first businesses to force employees into getting the vaccine during the Panny D even before the federal government jumped on that bandwagon. </p><p>Employers should not be allowed to force employees to receive medical injections against their will - especially when that medication has no long-term studies and does nothing to prevent anything or anyone from getting what it claims to do. But because of how deranged Hollywood is, they thought differently. And now they should have to pay the price. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u201a\u00c4\u00ee  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNews/st", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/abc-religious-vaccination", "dead": false, "source_obj__id": 41, "permanent": false, "age": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 0, "title": "ABC ordered to face trial over religious discrimination complaint on legendary soap opera", "source": "https://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "date_published": "2024-02-27T22:51:39+00:00", "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "tags": [], "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": null, "user": null, "language": "en-us"}, {"page_rating_visits": 0, "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=51578117&width=980", "album": "", "vote": 0, "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=51578117&amp;width=600&amp;height=600&amp;coordinates=1424%2C0%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>\u201a\u00c4\u00faSafety is a top priority,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to the Chicago Public School website. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have implemented a comprehensive system that includes trained staff, protocols, programs, and policies to keep students and staff safe before, during, and after school,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the website further explains.
