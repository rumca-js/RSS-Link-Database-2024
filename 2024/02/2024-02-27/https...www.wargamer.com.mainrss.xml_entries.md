								<p>FutureProof Modular Terrain, currently raising funds on Kickstarter, might be the best Warhammer 40k terrain system yet developed. It achieves something I&rsquo;ve never seen before: gaming terrain that can be taken apart and put back together as easily as Lego, yet is sturdy and stable enough to hold your models during a game. Lots of &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/warhammer-40k/terrain-futureproof-modular-terrain-review">Continued</a></p>

								<p><strong>Lego Dixie Kong’s Jungle Jam</strong> is the second smallest of the Donkey Kong sets released as part of the Lego Super Mario line, but this one in particular makes me happy. Dixie Kong made her debut in my favorite game ever (Donkey Kong Country 2) and unlike Diddy or Funky Kong, hasn’t had the chance to appear in the likes of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, so I’m glad she gets her very own Lego set.</p>
<p>Another Lego Donkey Kong set that I’d argue is one of the <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/lego-sets-for-adults" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">best Lego sets for adults</a> and kids, because

								<p>One of the factors that makes the Land Raider such an iconic and ridiculous Warhammer 40k tank &ndash; it&rsquo;s huge, flat, easy-to-shoot sidings &ndash; also makes it a fantastic canvas for freehand artistry.
