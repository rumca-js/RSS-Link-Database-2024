The nintendo switch 2 will probably not be launching in 2024, and the reasons for that might be actually…pretty good.

I think a solid launch for new hardware is imperative in this day and age, and seeing Nintendo trade in the holiday season sales for better/more games at launch is a trade off I’m happy to see.

But with that said, what games might actually make it to launch?

A new Metroid? Mario? Animal Crossing? Something else?

Today I’m gonna take some guesses.

also the new pokemon z or whatever
