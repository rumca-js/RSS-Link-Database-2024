The Seattle-based pet-sitting business completed its $2.3 billion deal with Blackstone on Tuesday, marking the latest chapter in a 13-year journey that began at a hackathon and took the company through a pandemic, a public offering, and a private equity acquisition. In an interview with GeekWire, Rover CEO Aaron Easterly — who has led the business since its inception —&#160;said he&#8217;s bullish about what&#8217;s ahead. &#8220;Our market position is as great as it&#8217;s ever been,&#8221; he said. Rover surpassed a billion-dollar run rate in the third quarter last year, as measured&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/rover-ceo-on-companys-next-chapter-as-pet-sitting-giant-completes-2-3b-deal-with-blackstone/">Read More</a>

That&#8217;s because the law bars Rivian from selling directly to consumers, and the company isn&#8217;t working with franchised dealerships. And, at least in the near future, that situation is unlikely to change. The latest effort to revise the law has again stalled in the state&#8217;s capital, sunk by opposition from auto dealerships. A coalition of EV companies and environmental groups were pushing for an update that would permit direct sales for all EV manufacturers &#8212; an allowance&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/rivian-lucid-and-other-evs-stuck-in-park-by-failed-effort-to-change-car-sales-laws-in-washington/">Read More</a>

The lawsuit, filed Feb. 23 in U.S. District Court in Seattle, alleges that Amazon failed to take action despite hundreds of messages from Goggins and his representatives asking the company to stop allowing third-party sellers to offer counterfeit copies of his best-selling, self-published books, &#8220;Can’t Hurt Me&#8221; and &#8220;Never Finished.&#8221; &#8220;Despite Amazon’s full knowledge of these bootleg book sales, Amazon continued to allow them on&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/author-and-former-navy-seal-david-goggins-sues-amazon-over-bootleg-books/">Read
