It’s safe to say that Sony made a breakthrough hit with the PS1, and the magnitude of the success was such that it solidified the Japanese tech giant as one of the biggest market shareholders in the video game console space.

The developer took multiple massive risks with Final Fantasy 7 Remake, from splitting into a trilogy to doing very much the opposite of sticking to the script, and while it remains to be seen just how good the full trilogy is going to be, based on its first instalment, we can, at the very least, safely say that it's gotten off to a stellar start, and that those aforementioned risks are, so far, paying off. 

The trilogy will soon be continuing with Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, so ahead of its launch, here, in this video, we're going to recap the entire story of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, as well as Intergrade's Episode INTERmission. Without further ado then, let's dive in.

More than a decade on from the launch of the original Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, Avantgarden and 505 Games have brought it back in the form of a remake. In being as faithful to the source material as it is, the remake successfully captures its biggest strengths – from its incredibly effective storytelling to vibrant, fairy tale-esque setting – but at the same time, its faithfulness also raises questions about whether or not it’s worth a purchase for those who’ve already played the original. 

That Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a really good game isn’t in doubt in the slightest, and there’s also no doubt that its remake does a great job of modernizing it for current hardware- but mileage will definitely vary on whether it’s worthy of a pickup.

Expeditions: A MudRunner Game is a follow-up to the Spintires series. However, instead of traversing through the mud and snow to deliver cargo, you're now part of a research team. With three unique maps based on real-world locations, players essentially blaze a trail through unknown parts, deliver equipment, gather materials and more. 

The more open approach works with the series' hyper-realistic physics, where one wrong turn into the mud or water can significantly hamper you. The result is an exploration-focused 4x4 title where you plan out routes, choose the right vehicle, modify its loadout with different tools and then set out for an adventure. Here's everything you should know about Expeditions: A MudRunner Game when it launches on March 5th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Xbox One, PS4, PC and Switch.
