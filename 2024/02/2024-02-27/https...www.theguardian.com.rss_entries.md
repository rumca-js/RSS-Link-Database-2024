According to the Food Foundation tracker, one in five households with children have gone without meals in recent weeks, with 11 million people overall experiencing food insecurity – although this marks a small improvement since last summer. The finding that the amount of vegetables bought has fallen to a 50-year low is particularly dismaying, given all that we know about their role in promoting good health. Along with homelessness and inadequate housing, this is the rawest of all lacks. People are going without the basic necessities of life.</p><p>The foundation says that t

<p>Controversial rebuild of derelict Gaelic games stadium is finally gathering momentum and Irish FA sees ‘huge opportunity’</p><p>Patrick Nelson speaks with such conviction about Northern Ireland staging games in the 2028 Euros that one would wonder what all the fuss is about. “We take the view that when you put a hurdle in front of us, we clear it and ask what is next,” says the chief executive of the Irish FA. “We have been relentless in terms of bringing this tournament here. Belfast deserves it, Northern Ireland deserves it. It will be fabulous as and when it happens.”</p><p>Nelson seemingly found himself in an invidious position as the UK and Republic of Ireland bid for these finals. At that time, as now, Northern Ireland did not have a stadium which met Uefa’s 30,000-capacity criteria. Key to Belfast’s role is the complete rebuild of Casement Park, a derelict Gaelic games ground in west Belfast.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/27/casement-par

The London stock market is in a funk, with too many companies hopping off to re-list in New York. Therefore the UK executive class must be given US-style pay packages to keep ‘em loyal.</p><p>That’s a slight exaggeration since, so far, it’s only a handful of companies – the likes of AstraZeneca, HSBC, LSEG (the owner of the London Stock Exchange) and the medical devices group Smith &amp; Nephew – that have revealed, or signalled, that they want to boost executive rewards to keep up with US rivals. And none of them have threatened to quit London. All the same, it’s remarkable that an intense debate about the woes of the London stock market has morphed into a refrain about executive pay in the UK.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/27/quiet-conspiracy-afoot-give-ftse-100-executives-pay-rise">Cont
