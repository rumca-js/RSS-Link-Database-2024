  <p id="Ai7uc6">If you’ve ever seen a Steam Deck playing a <em>Legend of Zelda</em> game, chances are you were seeing the Yuzu emulator at work. Now, Nintendo has sued the developers of Yuzu in US federal court, with the intent of squashing Yuzu for good.</p>
<p id="B4FS25">In the lawsuit, spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1762576284817768457">Stephen Totilo</a>, Nintendo alleges that Yuzu violates the anti-circumvention and anti-trafficking provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as well as accusing the creators of copyright infringement.

  <p id="FuNrtz">OpenAI has claimed in a <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24443836/nysd-case-612697.pdf">motion filed Monday</a> that <em>The New York Times</em> used “deceptive prompts” to get ChatGPT to regurgitate its content.

<p id="PVH1W1">OpenAI asserts that the <em>Times</em> exploited a bug that it’s currently working to fix and that the outlet fed articles directly to the chatbot to get it to spit out verbatim passages. “Normal people do not use OpenAI’s products this way,” th
