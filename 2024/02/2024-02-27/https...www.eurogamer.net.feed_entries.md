Deck Nine Games, the studio behind Life is Strange: True Colors and last year's The Expanse: A Telltale Series, has announced it's laying off approximately 20 percent of its total workforce, blaming "the game industry's worsening market conditions".
</p><p>
Deck Nine is perhaps best known as the current steward of Square Enix's supernatural narrative adventure series Life is Strange, having created 2017's Life is Strange: Before the Storm, 2021's Life is Strange: True Colours, and a remaster of series originator Don't Nod's acclaimed first instalment in 2022. More recently it co-developed a prequel to popular sci-fi TV show The Expanse alongside the revived Telltales Games.

Skull and Bones, the oft-delayed pirate game from Ubisoft that finally arrived earlier this month following almost a decade of development, has released its first season of post-launch content on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC - introducing, among other things, new world events, new contracts and bounties, plus a battle-pass-style progression track.
</p><p>
Raging Tides, as Skull and Bones' first live-service season is officially titled, predominantly focuses on new antagonist Philippe La Peste (AKA the Plague King) and his Fleet of Pestilence. By defeating La Peste's advance guard, the Plaguebringers, as they spawn throughout the world, players can raise the fleet's hostility level. Once past a certain threshold, they'll face a "mighty foe", which rewards a "rare item" when sunk.

Star Wars: Dark Forces is one such game, created in a genre completely different to nearly every other product developer LucasArts would release, but it nonetheless became one of the most interesting and inspired Doom-adjacent shooters of its day. Now, thanks to Nightdive Studios, Dark Forces has emerged from its DOS prison with a new remastered version for all modern platforms, complete with new high-res assets and a host of other improvements. </p><p>This makes it a good time to take a deep dive on what made Dark Forces an important release back in 1995 - and how it improved on the epoch-making Doom. From there, it's o

Fortnite's partnership with Lego continues today with the launch of two family-friendly mini-games: Lego Raft Survival and Lego Obby Fun. 
</p><p>
The first of these is a multiplayer mini-game themed around Lego's popular pirates theme, where you must stay afloat on a raft - and repair it on the fly - while it is under attack from cannon fire. 
</p><p>
The latter is an obstacle course mini-game similar to those found within Fortnite's user-made Creative mode already - think along the lines of its many parkour levels or popular Only Up maps.

A number of developers have said they are concerned about the future of Apple Arcade, with one person stating there is "the smell of death" around the mobile game subscription service.

A source told <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-axed-games-declining-payouts-disillusioned-studios-and-an-uncertain-future/">mobilegamer.biz</a> that Apple had "cancelled a shitload of projects and pissed off a lot of people" following a 'reboot' of the subscription in 2021. Other sources, meanwhile, said the company had been steadily cutting developer payouts and upfront fees over recent years.

"We're going to see that amount and decrease and decrease and decrease until it's pennies," one developer told the publication. "At that point putting a game on Arcade starts to become much less viable." Report

Four years after its initial release, Square Enix has patched Final Fantasy 7 Remake to amend one of Aerith's lines at the very end of the game.
</p><p>
The update comes ahead of the release of Rebirth later this week and additionally makes a change in Remake to Tifa's outfit seen in a certain flashback to ensure consistency across both games.
</p><p>
But why amend this specific line from Aerith? Fans are now debating, as spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-vii-remake-got-patched-today-and-for-some-ungodly-reason-changed-the-last-line-of-the-game.821493/">ResetEra</a>. <strong>The ending of Final Fantasy 7 Remake is discussed below.</strong>
