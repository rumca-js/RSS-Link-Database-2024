		India has monumental biometric surveillance plans for its equally monumental railway system.

The government has posted a tender to make Indian Railways one of the, if not the most surveilled property on Earth. National and state leaders <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=indian+railways">have gone at this</a> in a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/mumbai-railways-installing-1000s-of-facial-recognition-cameras">piecemeal</a> fashion to date.

When officials finish studding railcars with facial recognition systems, there will be cities that rival their coverage, but they all will be blanket networks. Indian Railways’ will be myriad cables and belts intently watching car interiors.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/regula">Regula</a> is helping the Polish taxi industry comply with a new law requiring mandatory identity verification. To achieve this, the company has been collaborating with <a href="https://www.free-now.com/pl-en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Freenow</a>, a mobility platform headquartered in Germany and backed by BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility.

Through its Polish distributor, Korporacja Wschódis, Regula deployed its Regula Document Reader SDK and the Regula Face SDK within just six months, helping Freenow register several thousands of taxi drivers. The procedure included checking drivers’ identity documents, selfie biometrics and criminal records, the companies say in a press release.

		Mobile digital ID platforms are being asked to do more in Europe, and technology providers are responding to the uptick in demand.

In Estonia, a contractor is needed to execute work on a new version of the government digital ID mobile app, mRiik, a trial version of which was launched in early 2023. Austrian officials have announced it’s now possible to carry out digital vehicle registration on the Austria digital ID app “eAusweise.” An update in Denmark has made it easier for the country’s digital ID application to be easily copied on other devices and for a digital ID to be activated without the need for another ID credential such as a passport. In Spain, Veridas has launched a digital ID wallet, Veridas Nexus, to faci

		The Irish Gardaí are preparing a small-scale trial of body cameras, backed by retrospective facial recognition, prior to full deployment. The trial has been budgeted at €2.1 million (US$2.2 million).

Police officers in four law enforcement divisions are scheduled to be fitted with the cameras for the trial period during the second quarter. They will only be switched on by an officer during certain interactions involving the public.

A local civil liberties group has voiced muted concern about the trial.

That largely will be when an officer thinks there is a need to collect evidence, such as during arrests and traffic stops, <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/gardai-body-worn-cameras-trial-6294006-Feb2024/">according to</a> reporting by local news outlet The Journal. T

		How can the UK ensure that its artificial intelligence technology reduces bias and how can the digital identity ecosystem become more inclusive? These are some of the questions that the UK government officially defined as its technological priorities in 2024.

On Monday, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (​​DSIT) released its first-ever document detailing areas of research interest (ARI), covering industries such as digital identity and artificial intelligence. The policy document was created to fill knowledge gaps within the agency, which was <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/uk-digital-identity-moves-department-financier-demands-economic-digital-id">tasked</a> last year with boosting the UK’s global position in cutting-edge te

		Payments giant Visa showcased its pay-by-palm biometric payment technology at an event marking the transformation of its Singapore Innovation Center last week. During the event, visitors were invited to use the palm reader and link their signature to their payment card for a transaction.

"The future of biometric payments is promising and is set to revolutionize the retail experience,” says Kunal Chatterjee, Head of Innovation at Visa Asia Pacific.

The technology is still relatively nascent and most likely won’t become mass market for a while, he adds. Various factors influence the acceptance of biometric payments, including regulation, technology and consumer acceptance which often depends on the market.

		The recent adoption by African leaders of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights Relating to the Specific Aspects of the Right to a Nationality and the Eradication of Statelessness in Africa has received approbation.

In a statement, the UN Refugees Agency (UNHCR) - a UN body mandated to prevent and reduce statelessness around the world - said the move puts African countries on the right rails in terms of addressing the situation of the continent’s stateless persons who have been cut out from enjoying several of their human rights.

The Protocol aims at dismantling all legal and other palpable barriers preventing stateless people and those at risk of statelessness from exercising their right to a nationality. Its implementation will make it poss
