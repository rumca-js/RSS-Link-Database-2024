The Seattle-based pet-sitting business completed its $2.3 billion deal with Blackstone on Tuesday, marking the latest chapter in a 13-year journey that began at a hackathon and took the company through a pandemic, a public offering, and a private equity acquisition. In an interview with GeekWire, Rover CEO Aaron Easterly \u2014 who has led the business since its inception \u2014&#160;said he&#8217;s bullish about what&#8217;s ahead. &#8220;Our market position is as great as it&#8217;s ever been,&#8221; he said.

Founded last year after being incubated at Madrona Venture Labs, the 5-person company announced a $4 million seed round led by Madrona Venture Group and Vine Ventures, with participation from Soma Capital. Former Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia also invested, along with SAP exec and former Microsoft VP JG Chirapurath, and Shireesh Thota, vice president of databases at Microsoft.

That&#8217;s because the law bars Rivian from selling directly to consumers, and the company isn&#8217;t working with franchised dealerships. And, at least in the near future, that situation is unlikely to change. The latest effort to revise the law has again stalled in the state&#8217;s capital, sunk by opposition from auto dealerships.
