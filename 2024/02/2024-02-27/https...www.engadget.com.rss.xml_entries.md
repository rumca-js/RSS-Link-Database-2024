<p>Google has been quietly striking deals with some publishers to use new generative AI tools to publish stories, according to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.adweek.com/media/google-paying-publishers-unreleased-gen-ai/"><ins>a report</ins></a> in <em>Adweek</em>. The deals, reportedly worth tens of thousands of dollars a year, are apparently part of the Google News Initiative (GNI), a six-year-old program that funds <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-launches-a-media-literacy-program-with-pbs-student-labs-to-combat-misinformation-160024870.html"><ins>media literacy projects</ins></a>, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/es-es/resources/trainings/google-fact-check-tools/"><ins>fact-checking tools</ins></a>, and other resources for newsrooms.

<p>Tumblr and WordPress are reportedly set to strike deals to sell user data to artificial intelligence companies OpenAI and Midjourney. <em>404 Media</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.404media.co/tumblr-and-wordpress-to-sell-users-data-to-train-ai-tools/">reports</a> that the platforms’ parent company, Automattic, is nearing completion of an agreement to provide data to help train the AI companies’ models.</p>
<p>It isn’t clear which data will be included, but the report suggests Automattic may have overreached initially. An alleged internal post from Tumblr product manager Cyle Gage suggests Automattic prepared to send private or partner-related data that wasn’t supposed to be included in the deal. The questionable content reportedly included private posts on public blog posts, deleted or suspended blogs, unanswered (therefore, not publicly posted) questions, private answers, posts marked explicit and content from premium partner blogs (like Apple’s former

<p>As part of the change, Apple will move “many employees working on the car” to the company’s artificial intelligence division where they will focus on generative AI projects, which Apple is expected to share more about later this year, according to a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/01/apple-earnings-top-estimates-higher-profit-margin">statement</a> by CEO Tim Cook on the company’s earnings call earlier this month.

<p>It’s a question as old as time, or at least the early 2010s: Which iPhone should you buy? For most, the answer is simple: Buy the highest-end Apple phone you can afford.

<p>Back in 2007, I bought a dirt-cheap, dumb scale and drew my own graphs in order to chart my weight’s downward progress after a rough year at university. I think that while 2007-me wouldn’t be pleased with my own fitness journey, he would love the fact that the process is entirely automated, affordable and pretty smart. Smart scales have become nearly ubiquitous in recent years and they’ve been a huge help to me in my own health-and-wellness routine. They make the process of keeping track of weight fluctuations and other health metrics much easier, and I tested a bunch of them for this guide. Below are my top picks, plus everything you need to know about picking the right smart scale for you.</p>
<h2>Safety</h2>
<p>There are valid reasons to weigh yourself, but your self-worth shouldn’t be defined by the number that shows up between your feet. If you’re looking to alter your body shape, that figure could go up as your waistline goes down, since muscle weighs more than fat.
