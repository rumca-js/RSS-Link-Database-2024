It&#8217;s also a very well-developed science fiction setting with the books including some of my favorite outside of Stark Trek and Star Wars. While not necessarily apparent in the video game, the setting is incredibly dark with humanity reduced to near-extinction and the only hope of humanity being the SPARTAN-IIs that are made from kidnapped children. Halo has a lot of appeal for the fact the first three games are all-time classics of the X-Box, and its fans are as devoted to the Expanded Universe as the other franchises above&#8217;s fans are devoted to theirs. Doctor Catherine Halsey, Cortana, Sergeant Johnson, and Admiral Keys are all well beloved characters. The sequels, Halo 4, 5, and Infinite are less regarded.
