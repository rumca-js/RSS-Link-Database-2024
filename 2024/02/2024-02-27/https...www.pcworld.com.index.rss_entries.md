<p>If you work with PDF files regularly then a PDF editor is an indispensable tool. Whether it&rsquo;s part of your job, you manage PDF files for your own personal use, or you just need to complete a one-off editing task, a top editor program is an essential piece of software. Full-featured editors such as <a href="https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:2-1-702374-1-0-0/destination:https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/pricing.html" rel="nofollow">Adobe&rsquo;s Acrobat Pro DC</a> might provide all of the bells and whistles, but a free PDF editor can still offer most of the important tools of a paid service for no additional charge. </p>



<p>Plus, many free PDF editors are browser based, which means that you don&rsquo;t need to worry about about platform- or device-compatibility issues.</p>

<p>When your K/D tally is at stake it&rsquo;s pretty tempting to buy a premium gaming mouse with all the latest bells and whistles. But that can be a costly move that can see you paying upwards of $150 USD&mdash;that&rsquo;s coin that could go towards a brand-new processor instead.</p>



<p>The truth is you won&rsquo;t lose much performance going for a cheaper option. In fact, you can get a top-performing mouse that&mdash;barring the sensor, which is usually more modest than in premium devices&mdash;is virtually identical in build quality and styling and with equally quick buttons.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s not to say all budget gaming mice are alike. Admittedly, at the lower end of the market there tends to be more variation in the build quality, weight, and button configuration than at the top end, so you&rsquo;ll still want to do your homework before you b

<p>Intel has followed up the launch of its 14th-gen mobile processors for consumers by announcing the corresponding vPro platform for business PCs, with one key difference: Only one mobile processor platform will be available, not two. </p>



<p>Intel announced nearly a dozen Core Ultra processors for business laptops, but said that it would not offer the 14th-gen Core chips for mobile PCs. That&rsquo;s a change from Intel&rsquo;s consumer laptop offerings, where Core Ultra chips can be found in more efficient mainstream laptops and the 14th-gen <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2193596/core-hx-unleashed-intels-second-14th-gen-laptop-family-aims-at-gamers.html">Core (or Core HX) has been used for performance laptops and gaming</a>. Conversely, only 14th-gen Core chips will be available for vPro&rsquo;s desktop lineup.</p>

<p>Watch the seas of the gadget market for long enough, and you start to get a feel for its tides. For the last few months there seems to be a specific floor for fancy OLED gaming monitors. And while it&rsquo;s certainly pricey, it&rsquo;s a lot less than some of these screens are at retail. MSI is the latest supplier to surf this particular wave, and today its MEG 342C ultrawide OLED monitor is <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C15JDWF4?&amp;ascsubtag=2-1-2249271-1-0-0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">down to just $799.99 on Amazon</a>. That&rsquo;s $100 off the $1000 list price, plus an additional $100 if you <s>clip</s> click the little coupon on the sale page. The coupon brings this marvelous monitor down to the lowest price we&rsquo;ve seen on Amazon.</p>

<p>Comparing VPNs isn&rsquo;t an easy task. There are numerous services on the market, their features tend to be rather homogenous, and their pricing structures can be confusing. Nonetheless, in today&rsquo;s world of heightened privacy concerns and personal data mining, it&rsquo;s crucial to choose the right VPN to keep yourself safe online. That&rsquo;s why we at PCWorld have developed a thorough and comprehensive method for reviewing VPN services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of the VPNs we test are evaluated by the same criteria. We look at:</p>



<ul>
<li>The number of servers and their locations</li>



<li>The speed of the VPN&rsquo;s connections</li>



<li>Privacy protections offered, and the transparency of the owners</li>



<li>Software experience and usability</li>



<li>Additional features that come with the service</li>

<p>All good things must come to an end, in the words of dads and starship captains everywhere. And Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce Now game streaming service is no exception. No, the system isn&rsquo;t shutting down &mdash; in fact it&rsquo;s been going from strength to strength lately, adding both in-demand new titles like <em>Nightingale </em>and older Activision-Blizzard titles like <em>Diablo IV </em>and <em>Overwatch. </em>What&rsquo;s ending is GeForce Now&rsquo;s run as one of the only services that doesn&rsquo;t saddle its least spendy users with intrusive advertising every chance it gets. </p>



<p>Starting soon, users on the free tier of GeForce Now will begin seeing video advertisements in the queue as they wait for an open slot on an Nvidia remote server. The ads will be capped at two minutes, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483

<p>Elon Musk recently did something that all of us have probably done at least once: He bought himself a new Windows computer, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">specifically a laptop</a>. When he wanted to start using it, he realized that he <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/699100/microsoft-extinguishes-windows-11-pro-account-loophole-in-latest-build.html">had to create a Microsoft account</a> to do so. Most people know this, but apparently it caught Musk by surprise &mdash; and raised his hackles.</p>



<p>Musk expressed his displeasure about Windows 11&rsquo;s Microsoft accounts on X (formerly Twitter), which he has purchased. Musk <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1761835728000954654&amp;xcust=2-2-2249152-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://
