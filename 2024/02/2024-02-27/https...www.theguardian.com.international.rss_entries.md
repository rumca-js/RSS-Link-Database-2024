Luton, meanwhile, appeared intent on seeing whether their defenders could hold him off in one-on-one last-man battles. That and their high line was a recipe for carnage.</p><p>A couple of minutes before the hour, Haaland scored his fifth to ease City clear of a Luton mini-revival that felt like a mirage.

<p>British painter whose work was admired for its physical depth and beauty, giving it lasting appeal</p><p>The British painter Mick Moon, who has died aged 86, had a sophisticated understanding of the functions of an artwork – its ability to represent a range of subjects and experiences while remaining a unique object in its own right. His output ranged from pieces of calico or canvas that had been moulded around studio props, walls or floorboards, to his early “strip paintings” – bands of modulated colour on plastic – and his later semi-figurative works, of which the meaning is ineffable.</p><p>In the radiant hues and tactile surface of Embers (1991-92), for example, a glowing, meticulously detailed example of bidriware – metalware originally associated with Bidar in southern India – floats over a green and yellow background, as if some fragment of a transcendent reality has been discovered and translated into acrylic and silkscreen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com

Marc Bohan, then the designer of Dior, correctly judged that the generation of women coming of age in the 1960s were of a different mindset from their mothers. He dispatched with individual fittings and the traditional three-month wait, and gave this new generation boutiques – named Miss Dior – where fashion could be bought off-the-peg.</p><p>The Dior show that opened this year’s Paris fashion week, staged in a white box the size of a provincial airport installed in the Tuileries Gardens, was a homage to the modernising instincts of Bohan, designer of Dior for 28 years, who died last year at the age of 97. The current creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, has instincts that tend to veer left-of-centre,

<p>Last week, I downloaded a game called Balatro for a few casual turns on Steam Deck. I haven’t been able to think of much else since</p><p>I am one of those people who feels like crying when the rules of a board game are explained to me, so card games are generally not my thing. In real life poker, I inevitably get bored after a few rounds, go all in, and crash out spectacularly, just so something will happen. But real life poker is not Balatro. Balatro might be the best card game you will ever come across. I specifically left my Steam Deck at home this morning so that I would not sit at my desk playing Balatro instead of doing all the other, less fun things I am supposed to do at work, such as staring disconsolately at my perpetually overflowing email inbox. I think it will be one of the breakout games of the year. Join me, and it will suck you in, too.</p><p>Here is how you play. You’re dealt a hand of nine normal playing cards, and then you play the best four or five-car

<p>This quirky story of a lonely farmer and his deceased mother celebrates the Nordic country’s breathtaking landscape</p><p>This film hits just about every sweet spot possible: it is Icelandic and shot on black and white stock; it is a quirky road movie set in an unlikely place (Iceland); and it has a cute dog and features characters who knit. What is not love? If there had been cats and Ian McShane in a supporting role, it might have got five stars.</p><p>However, writer-director Hilmar Oddsson doesn’t need to pander to specific tastes because it’s clear he knows exactly what he’s doing with this happy-sad comedy-drama, a film that hovers on the emotional cusp between tones with consummate skill. The story unfolds in long, languid, static takes, signalling both a kind of arthouse melancholy that at the same time reads as faintly comical, setting up a frame for funny business to take place within its confines, provided the timing is just right.</p> <a href="https://www.thegu

<p>For the third time in less than a year the forward is at the centre of controversy over behaviour involving his 'pelvic area’</p><p>Cristiano Ronaldo is supposed to be an ambassador for a modern and international Saudi Arabia and is not paid a reported annual salary of around £180m to produce articles that include words such as “crotch” or “genitals”.</p><p>Yet it is remarkable how easy it seems to be to annoy this five-time Ballon D’Or winner. All you have to do is chant “Messi, Messi”. Incredibly for a player who has played for the biggest clubs in the biggest games and won almost everything, it looks as if it gets under his skin. Ronaldo’s will to win, desire for the highest standards and work rate has been exemplary in Saudi Arabia so far and he is top scorer of the league and joint top in terms of assists. The competitive streak is deep but seems to be so wide that it is sensitive to suggestions that his main competitor exists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com

The unassuming everyman and smiley superman possessed by some power he can’t explain, the footballer from another era followed about by magic moments, he is Real Mallorca’s ultimate cult hero, an icon on the island. The forward who took the team he supported from the third division to the first and has now led them to within reach of their first Copa del Rey final in 20 years. He’s the one everyone wants to be here. Which is lucky, because emulating him is easy.</p><p>On the face of it, anyway. “We’ve just had carnival here and people went as me,” Prats says, laughing. “They get one of those stick-on moustaches or just paint them on. It’s funny, and very nice.” The Magnum PI look began as a bit of an experiment, but there’s no

It’s a red flag for Keir Starmer</p><p>Picture the scene: the main party of the centre left is back in power after more than a decade dominated by the right. In his mid-60s, a technocratic, naturally cautious leader suddenly finds himself leading a country that seems to have lost its way. The economy is faltering, growth is anaemic, and public investment is badly needed. Yet he holds tight to fiscal discipline, with key policies – including on the climate crisis – watered down to meet tight spending rules. More than two years into his term in office the government is adrift, with a widespread sense that it lacks any vision for the future. Filling this void, the radical right is resurgent and immigration is dominating national politics. The centre left is languishing in the polls and heading for defeat at the next election.</p><p>This is not a vision of the future for Keir Starmer an

<p>Strap yourself in for a wild adventure in feudal Japan. This lavish adaptation of the classic samurai novel is beautiful, intellectual fare that amply rewards your full attention. But be warned: it’s gruesome from the get-go</p><p>If you have ever wondered what starving sailors riddled with scurvy might look like after months at sea, Shōgun will not keep you in suspense. From the outset, this is gruesome stuff, set amid the emerging threat of civil war in Japan in 1600. It adapts James Clavell’s classic 1975 novel with ambition and evident respect for its source material, and given that the paperback is more than 1,000 pages long, it is extraordinary that they have managed to condense it into 10 episodes. The result is peacocking, mesmerising television.</p><p>Much like Masters of the Air, Shōgun has been years in the making. It was first announced in 2018 and like Masters of the Air, it has been well worth the wait. This is lavish, demanding drama, to be approached with c
