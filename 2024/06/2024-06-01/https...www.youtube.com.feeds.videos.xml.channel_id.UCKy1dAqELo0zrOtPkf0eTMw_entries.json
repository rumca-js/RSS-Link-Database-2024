Hanging out with a growing roster of Disney icons is a remarkably good time, and some of the recent additions, like Gaston, made my return to the valley an even more worthwhile venture. But a lot of the shortcomings from the Early Access days haven\u2019t necessarily improved much either, including its habit of leaving stories on a cliffhanger ending, a monstrous grind that just don\u2019t quit, and bugs that continue to plague an otherwise good time. Still, there\u2019s something undeniably riveting about chilling with the goofy oddballs and loveable toons from Disney\u2019s impressive catalog, and returning to this zen-like simulator washed my troubles away like few cozy games can.\n\n#IGN #", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il1BA6McuIA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/il1BA6McuIA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Disney Dreamlight Valley Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-01T15:00:26+00:00", "description": "In this Little Kitty, Big City full game walkthrough, we show you how to complete every quest on your to-do list, where to find every hat, and how to unlock all 7 secret achievements for 100% completion.\n\n00:00 Intro\n04:21 Rubber Duck 1 Location (Outside Artist\u2019s House)\n04:59 Find that Crow\n12:16 Rescue the ??? from the Pipe\n13:05 Fetch 3 Feathers for Tanuki\n18:08 Corn Hood and Hard Hat Locations\n21:45 Replace Beetle\u2019s Phone\n26:19 HIDDEN ACHIEVEMENT: Splish!\n29:02 Snack Time!
