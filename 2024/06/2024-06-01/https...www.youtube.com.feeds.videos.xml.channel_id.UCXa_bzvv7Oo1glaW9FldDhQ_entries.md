MultiVersus has officially launched, graduating from last year's open beta status. While the current product is full of nostalgia and lovingly renders its characters - from Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes to Steven Universe and Adventure Time - it leaves much to be desired in other areas.

Though its story is pretty barebones, Rifts is a competent PvE mode, providing different fights (some with mutators) and mini-games. Online play is also solid, and the gameplay is easy to get into while offering new mechanics. Dig deeper, though, and you'll find some barebones content, no Ranked play or online Free-For-All, a terrible progression system and other fundamental issues.

Even the gameplay suffers from camera changes, input delay and odd character highlighting. While it's not a lost cause and worth checking out due to its free-to-play status, MultiVersus needs some serious work to stand out.

It's been a long wait for the next title in the Monster Hunter series. While Monster Hunter Rise offered some unique new mechanics and Monster Hunter World has stood the test of time, Monster Hunter Wilds aspires to something even more.

Set in the Forbidden Lands, players explore massive locales with complex ecosystems. Small monsters tend to their business, reacting to each other (and the player), while large monsters attack those who enter their territories. With the option to seamlessly begin hunts while out in a region, disrupting packs and even taking advantage of hazardous weather conditions, the series' gameplay is even more dynamic than ever.

With the developer showcasing extensive gameplay and providing new information recently, here are ten new things you should know about Monster Hunter Wilds, launching in 2025 for Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC.

In spite of the fact that Astro Bot has only ever been the star of a PS VR-exclusive game and a game that was really just a free pack-in tech demo, it’s a little surprising that the IP is as popular as it is with the PlayStation fanbase- but then again, maybe that also speaks to just how unbelievably good those two games have been. 

Soon enough, however, Astro fans’ wishes are going to be fulfilled with a full- fledged console 3D platformer in the form of the recently announced Astro Bot. Set to launch exclusively for the PS5 this September, the platformer was recently revealed with a promising and packed trailer, and here, we’re going to go over all the biggest new details we’ve learned about it.

With the likes of the Star Wars Jedi games or the upcoming Star Wars Outlaws, we thankfully have no shortage of Star Wars games that deliver a high quality single player experience, though with the Battlefront series now having been MIA for a while, the Star Wars IP’s presence in the multiplayer space has been much less prominent. 

The upcoming Star Wars: Hunters is obviously a much smaller-scale game than the Battlefront series, but it is promising to deliver an interesting free-to-player mobile multiplayer experience nonetheless, especially with its lighter and more over the top take on the beloved IP. Ahead of its mobile and Switch launch not long from now, here, we are going to take a look at a few key details that you should know about the game.
