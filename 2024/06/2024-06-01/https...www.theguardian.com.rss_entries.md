But, naturally, with added slug monsters</p><p>“Oh my hopscotch!”, as Lindy Pepper-Bean might say. The on-screen lead for much of this episode, Callie Cooke, is surely one of the most dislikeable human characters Doctor Who has ever produced.

Regardless of the presence of the slug monsters, she is undoubtedly the villain of the piece.</p><p>It was strikingly stylised, and unusual to see an episode of Doctor Who mostly colour-graded to be pastel pinks and blues until the final subterranean act.

<p>After massive TV success in the US, the creator of Gavin &amp; Stacey is about to appear on the London stage. But why do British audiences find him so hard to love?</p><p>James Corden is back in the UK and characteristically busy. Last year, the 45-year-old left his job as Los Angeles-based chat show host of <em>The Late Late Show</em> on CBS. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/may/03/gavin-and-stacey-return-last-ever-episode-christmas-day-bbc">A Christmas special is planned</a> for <em>Gavin &amp; Stacey</em>, the acclaimed BBC sitcom he created with co-star Ruth Jones.

<p>French Open match ended in an embrace, reflecting a wider trend in what was once a tensely competitive locker room</p><p>As Aryna Sabalenka and Paula Badosa stood by the player entrance to Court Philippe-Chatrier in anticipation of their French Open third-round match, they waited in perfect silence. There were no jokes exchanged and no small talk. This was business. The pair entered the court and put on a show, battling hard until the end.</p><p>Away from their numerous on-court battles, which have included three matches in the last three months, Sabalenka and Badosa refer to each other as best friends. It was not until the Tie Break Tens exhibition event before Indian Wells in 2022, while both players were ranked inside the top 10, that they connected. While they are hardly the first friends to compete on the court, their relationship seems reflective of the shifting dynamics in the WTA locker room.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/01/aryna-sabalenka

<p>Hay and Edinburgh forgo pragmatism in turning their backs on the Baillie Gifford fund</p><p>How gratifying to chuck dirty money back in the face of a would-be benefactor. Such moments mark literature. Pip refusing funds from Magwitch, a convict. Will Ladislaw disdaining the charity of George Eliot’s corrupted Bulstrode. The statement is this: scruples do not belong only to the rich. There is a price at which I, too, cannot be bought.</p><p>And yet. In these great works of fiction, tensions are drawn out, questions raised. Ladislaw accepts support from another flawed man, Casaubon, of whom he disapproves. Hypocrisy? Or the observation that in a hard world pragmatism has its place – that beggars can be choosers only on occasion? And is Pip right to cast away the reformed and grateful Magwitch?

<p>After discovering an album of Victorian <em>cartes de visite </em>in an antiques market, Paul Frecker gave up his day job to become a dealer in vintage photographs. Now collected in a new book, these cards were “a photographic craze that seized the imagination of the British public at the beginning of the 1860s,” says the Scotland-based author. “Queen Victoria was one of the format’s biggest fans.” Initially a way of distributing family portraits to friends, the phenomenon soon extended to images of royals, celebrities and larger-than-life characters. “It really was a fervour: crowds often formed to ogle displays in stockists’ windows, to the extent that pavements were blocked and traffic was impeded.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2024/jun/01/portrait-cards-victorian-collecting-craze-cartes-de-visite-paul-frecker-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

How did it gain such a hold over culture?</p><p>After splitting up with Diane Keaton in the film Annie&nbsp;Hall, Woody Allen’s lugubrious Alvy hooks up with a hippy-dippy music journalist for a one-night stand that does neither of them any favours. “Sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience,” says Pam, over a post-coital cigarette. “I&nbsp;mean that as a compliment.” Given that Pam (a fabulously drifty Shelley Duvall) is a self-confessed Rosicrucian, with a chat-up style that leans heavily on the word “transplendent”, it’s clear that finding a philosophical vocabulary for life’s highs and lows is not her strongest suit.</p><p>Annie Hall was released in 1977 – 30 years after the first usage of the adjective “kafkaesque” was recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary.

<p>The extravagant crime drama was mishandled upon release, hacked apart by Warners Bros, but time has been kind to the fuller, bleaker version</p><p>There’s no mob whacking in movie history as gruesome as the job Warner Bros did on Sergio Leone’s final feature, Once Upon a Time in America, a sumptuous crime epic that Leone tried to cut down from 269 minutes to 229 for its premiere at the Cannes film festival in 1984, only to have 90 more minutes lopped off for its US release, taking it all the way down to 139 minutes. The changes, done without Leone’s supervision or approval, had the predictable effect of alienating critics, who’d lauded the film at Cannes, while tanking the film at the box office, and it has taken decades to restore its length and reputation. Longer cuts have circulated – a 251-minute version returned to Cannes in 2012 – but the 229-minute European cut has now become the standard, better late than never.</p><p>The excruciating irony of the situation is that time may

Within minutes, a&nbsp;passerby spotted the&nbsp;tiny child, alone, with no identifying documents, no note, not even a name. When the mother did not return to claim her that evening, the baby was handed over to the nuns at Rome’s adoption services. Three days later, the mother’s body was found floating in the Tiber.</p><p>Before she died, the woman had sent a letter to the press, containing a brief account of the terrible choice she had made. The letter, handwritten, gave the baby’s name and date of birth, and concluded: “Finding myself in a desperate situation, I have no other choice than to leave my daughter to the compassion

<p>With the Tories’ chances at near zero, Labour is concentrating on fighting an ideological ground war with itself</p><p>It’s just over a week since Rishi Sunak got soaked in the rain as he called the general election. Since then he has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/23/gaffe-at-brewery-marks-the-end-of-rishi-sunaks-first-day-of-campaigning">forgotten that Wales didn’t qualify</a> for the Euros, paid a visit to Belfast’s Titanic quarter and been photographed under an exit sign. Richard Holden, the Tory party chair AKA Baldrick impersonator, has insisted that the campaign has been going exactly as planned. God knows what might have happened if it hadn’t.

<p>This tutti frutti sorbet of anything you fancy will make your fruit bowl go further</p><p>We fill our fruit bowl on market day each week, and if any of it ripens too quickly, we simply cut it up and freeze it to give us a good pudding base on hand at all times. It’s best to lay the pieces of fruit flat on trays with space between them, so they don’t freeze into one solid block. Our daughter has a small bowl of frozen fruit for pudding most evenings, but when we’re feeling fancy, we blend it up into today’s soft-serve-like sorbet and top it with grated chocolate, coconut, seeds and/or nut butters. It’s best eaten immediately, or at least within a few hours of making, but it will keep in the freezer for up to six months. If it becomes hard and icy, cut it up, blend again until smooth, and freeze in an ice-cube tray for ease of use.</p><p>Discover this recipe and many more from your favourite cooks on <a href="https://app.adjust.com/1bgiux9n?creative=Endnotes&amp;fallback=https%3A%2F%

<p><strong>West Norwood, London: </strong>Beyond the obvious vibrancy of attention-seeking flowers, there’s plenty to see in this modest haven</p><p>“No garden, however small, should contain less than two acres of rough woodland.” The words, if you believe the legend, of Nathaniel, 1st Baron Rothschild. But while he had 300 acres of parkland at his disposal, the south London gardener’s resources are more modest. The only woodland in our fenced-in rectangle is the Japanese maple dominating the corner by the shed, its canopy sheltering the pond – or “puddle”, as the baron would have it.</p><p>Some of the maple’s leaves are already red-tinged, but its time will come later in the year, russet colours heralding autumn. For now, the eye is drawn to jaunty orange geums, the papery delicacy of Welsh poppies, slender columns of purple toadflax catching the sunlight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/01/country-diary-the-glorious-cycle-of-life-is-reaching-its
