BALLARAT, AUSTRALIA - SEPTEMBER 10: People walk along Vincent Street on September 10, 2021 in Daylesford, Australia. Lockdown restrictions have eased across regional Victoria except for the greater Shepparton area. The five reasons to leave the home no longer apply for residents in regional Victoria, except for Greater Shepparton. There is no limit on the distance regional Victorians can travel from home – other than restrictions on entry to metropolitan Melbourne. Most businesses and venues are able to reopen with capacity and density limits, while office workers will be able to return to their places of work with a capacity of up to 25 percent or up to 10 people, whichever is greater. Metropolitan Melbourne and the Greater Shepparton area remain under lockdown restrictions as authorities continue to work to contain the ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks in those areas.
