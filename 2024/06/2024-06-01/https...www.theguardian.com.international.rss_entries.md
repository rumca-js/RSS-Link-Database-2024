<p>(New Soil)<br />Billed as ‘a dystopian suite’, the drummer-composer’s debut solo album is an intense affair, with a stellar lineup that includes Nubya Garcia and Shirley Tetteh</p><p>In 2018, bandleader and composer Jake Long and his group Maisha debuted with <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/28/maisha-there-is-a-place-review-nubya-garcia-jake-long-shirley-tetteh">There Is a Place</a></em>, an outstanding album of “spiritual jazz” that captured the vibrancy of a new generation of UK talent, including saxophonist Nubya Garcia and guitarist Shirley Tetteh. Long’s debut solo album, <em>City Swamp</em>, is another landmark recording, albeit of a very different sort: a self-proclaimed “dystopian suite representing the cycles of decay and faceless regeneration of London”. It proves a suitably intense ride, built on Long’s mesmerising rhythmic world – drums, beats, guitar riffs, analogue tape loops, dub effects, the works.</p><p>Long cites the jazz-rock of <em>Bitche

<p>From Amsterdam to Athens, these beautiful unsung spaces exhibit a riot of colour, elegant design, history and tranquility </p><p>Any list of European gardens must begin with Italy, even though their immaculate form, symmetry and reliance on non-flowering evergreen structure might jar with the modern yearning for pollinator-friendly naturalism. The Italian garden reached a peak during the Renaissance and has barely changed since. Its fundamental principles remain elegance, charm and decadent relaxation. Giardino Giusti, in the northern city of Verona and once well known among the influential families of 16th-century Europe, exemplifies this timeless artistry. Drift along its green cypress alley past the commanding statues of Apollo and Adonis, get lost in the 18th-century labyrinth and breathe in the heady aroma of citrus blossom. <br /><em><a href="http://giardinogiusti.com">giardinogiusti.com</a></em>,<em> adult €15, child €9</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/ar

<p>Growing awareness about ADHD and autism is reshaping thinking in science, society and medicine. Scientists explain what’s behind the rise – and the best ways to improve neurodivergent lives </p><p></p><p>It was in the mid 90s that neurodiversity as a formal concept and a rights movement began to emerge. Aided by the internet, autistic people and those with other conditions were able to connect and began sharing their experiences: what they had in common, how their lives differed. A recurring theme was how many felt marginalised, pushed out of a society that embraced only typical ways of being in the world. The phrase “neurological diversity” cropped up in their discussions, which along with “neurodiversity” appeared in magazine articles later that decade.</p><p>Neurodiversity has clear parallels with biodiversity. It champions difference and the validity of individuals. It holds that a vaguely defined majority can be described as neurotypical, with brains that operate in a broadly
