The hold was called by the computer that monitors systems on Starliner&#8217;s launch vehicle, United Launch Alliance&#8217;s Atlas V rocket, during the final minutes of the countdown at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The ground launch sequencer triggered an end to today&#8217;s countdown with just three minutes and 50 seconds remaining. Mission managers started investigating what triggered the alarm, even as the launch pad team began the process&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/starliner-boeing-crewed-flight-test-scrub/">Read More</a>

In his letter of resignation, Nadella didn&#8217;t give a reason for his decision, but expressed confidence in Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan and the company&#8217;s senior leadership team. Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks CEO, made headlines and drew criticism in May for publishing a LinkedIn post after the company missed earnings expectations, calling for &#8220;contrition and renewed focus and discipline on the core.&#8221; Nadella joined the Starbucks board in 2017, just as one of his former Microsoft colleagues,&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-leaves-starbucks-board-read-his-resignation-letter/">Read More

Our guest is Aniket (Niki) Kittur, a professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where his research focuses on new methods of augmenting human intellect using crowds and computation. We also talk about a related project that Kittur and his colleagues developed called Skeema, a browser tab manager that helped users organize their work, projects, and ultimately their brains in the process.

The gumdrop-shaped capsule is due to rise into space atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, with liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida set for 12:25 p.m. ET (9:25 a.m. PT) today. The prospects for acceptable weather have been set at 90%. Launch coverage is streaming via NASA&#8217;s website and YouTube.
