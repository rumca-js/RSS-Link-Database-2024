In this age, the ascended spirits of the world share mankind\u2019s war. A war in which no one will remain unscathed. The cycle of nature, the rebirthing of souls, is broken. The conclusion of The Dark Oak Chronicles brings forth an epic finale, a war of ultimate death. All are in peril in Jacob Sannox\u2019s The Devising. Dark Oak\u2019s quest to protect the forest leads him to Halwende, the former home of the Dark Lord Awgren. He will use whatever force necessary to ensure humanity never recovers their strength but they no longer stand alone. The spirits of the forest, water, and air, the ascended are coming to end his reign. Dark Oak must unravel the Dark Lord\u2019s secrets and harness the knowledge hidden there. If he is to fight immortal beings, he must surpass the Dark Lord\u2019s power. Jacob Sannox saves the most astonishing battles for his final book in The Dark Oak Chronicles.

A horny as hell former Arasti spy with inexplicable good luck, a grumpy non-binary captain fed up with everyone\u2019s bullshit, and an ungodly hot monk with an unfortunate vow of celibacy are stuck together at sea while they try to escape the law and change the tide for the crew; no, it\u2019s not the beginning of a bad joke, but the insanely ridiculous set-up for Running Close to the Wind.
