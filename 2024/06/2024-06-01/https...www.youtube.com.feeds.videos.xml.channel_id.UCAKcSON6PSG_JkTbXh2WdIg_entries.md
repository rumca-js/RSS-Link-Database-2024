Frank Turner released his tenth studio album, 'Undefeated,' on May 3, 2024, but just a couple weeks earlier â€” on Record Store Day, specifically â€” Turner found himself in the Twin Cities where he worked a shift and played a show at the Electric Fetus in Minneapolis, where he played a number of songs from the then-forthcoming record. How apropos, then, that one of the songs on the new album is this one, "Girl From The Record Shop."
