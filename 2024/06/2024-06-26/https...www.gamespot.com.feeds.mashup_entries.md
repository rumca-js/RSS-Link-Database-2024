<p dir="ltr">Controller manufacturer Hori has announced a new Steam-focused wireless controller launching later this year. <a href="https://hori.jp/products/hpc/hpc-055/">Hori's wireless Steam controller</a> is officially licensed by Valve, and both companies worked together to ensure the gamepad and all its features are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4142827237888316811">fully compatible with Steam</a> on desktop and Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve discontinued its own official Steam controller back in 2019, so this new collaboration with Hori is notable. As of now, it's the only controller for Steam that's in active production, which is pretty wild considering how massive Steam is.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the discontinued Steam controller, which used touch-based trackpads instead of thumbsticks and a unique button layout, Hori's pad offers a more traditional design similar to most other wireless controllers.

<p>Rockstar co-founder and former head writer Dan Houser recently explained why Grand Theft Auto never made the jump to the silver screen. According to Houser, the studio simply never viewed it as a smart financial move.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with<a href="https://theankler.com/p/dan-houser-absurd-ventures-hollywood-videogames"> The Ankler</a> (via<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dan-houser-the-risk-of-a-grand-theft-auto-movie-never-made-sense"> GamesIndustry.biz</a>), Houser revealed that multiple conversations were held about potentially turning various Rockstar games into movies. After a few meetings with higher-ups, Houser asked executives, "Why would we do this?" This would often prompt executives to explain that it would be a chance for the studio to make a live-action movie. Houser went on to explain why doing this would be a bad idea:</p><p dir="ltr">"No, what you've described is you making a movie and us having no control and taking a huge risk that we're going

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-rising/">Dead Rising</a> is the reason I bought an Xbox 360, so it holds a special place in my heart. But as much as I look back on my time with the game fondly, I also find it virtually unplayable today. There are a few reasons for that; the prisoners in the courtyard are incredibly annoying, the mission timer is much too strict, and generally, I'm not into replaying older games after a certain stretch of time.</p><p dir="ltr">But more than anything, Dead Rising suffers as a game in 2024 because of one flaw: its NPC allies are dumb. Dead Rising--as a wacky zombie game that offers a different flavor than Capcom's other zombie series, Resident Evil--is a success, for the most part. But it's also the ultimate escort mission, and a great example of why players so often hate that sort of thing.</p><p dir="ltr">If you have never played it, Dead Rising borrows heavily from Dawn of the Dead, putting players in a mall full of zombies a

However, a patent of Keystone was uncovered and it shows what it could have looked like.</p><p>Found by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/the-xbox-that-never-was-our-first-detailed-look-at-the-keystone-cloud-streaming-console-design">Windows Central</a>, the patent was filed in 2022. It shows the Keystone's potential shape and internal functions. It looks to be about half the size of an Xbox Series S, being a square with a large circular vent, just like the Series S has. It's reminiscent of the first PlayStation console, which had its disk drive on the top.</p><p>The front has both the console's power button as well as a USB-A port, while the back has ports for HDMI, ethernet, power.

Clips can then be edited as needed (for instance, cutting out all the shots you missed prior to an impressive headshot) and then uploaded for the world to see.</p><p dir="ltr">Game Recording has two modes: Background Recording and On Demand Recording. In Background Recording mode, gameplay is continuously saved to the player's preferred drive (never exceeding the player's specified recording duration or storage limits).
