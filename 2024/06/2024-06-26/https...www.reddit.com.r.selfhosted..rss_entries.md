<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks!</p> <p>So here’s my somewhat niche situation. I’ve got an RV with a single IP camera in it. It’s really only intended to use as a way to check on my dog when we’re camping but away from the camper. But since I have it I use it as a traditional security camera when in storage.</p> <p>I have a Raspberry Pi 4 1GB running Home Assistant (not installed yet) that’s going to be running a couple of temp sensors and a few other small, basic things. The RV has a cellular internet connection via a Cudy LT18 modem/router combo.</p> <p>I know that there are NVR’s that run in docker inside of HA. But my concern is that if the RV was stolen, or it’s DC system turned off / damaged, I’d have no way of accessing the video recorded with the NVR. What I’d like to do is be able to send events over to a server at home. A cloud based solution is fine too, if there are affordable options.</p> <p>Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a
