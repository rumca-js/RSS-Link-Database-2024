Amazon&#8217;s stock is up nearly 30% this year and more than 50% in the past 12 months, marking a big bounceback from 2022 amid the tech downturn. Shares closed Wednesday at $193.61, up 3.9% for the day. Alphabet also passed the $2 trillion market in April. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple are valued at more than $3 trillion, buoyed in recent months by the AI frenzy and cost-cutting initiatives.

The estate, which has sold off a variety of holdings amassed by Allen over the years, confirmed that the 12-year-old museum, which closed in March 2020, is done for good and that some computing objects collected by Allen would be auctioned by Christie&#8217;s this summer. The Living Computers website and social media accounts were taken down Tuesday.

Founded in 2022, Loti uses advanced facial and voice recognition software to analyze real photos, video and audio from their customers. Its system then searches for potential deepfakes or other unauthorized content such as impersonation accounts, and can send takedown requests. WME, the talent agency giant based in Los Angeles,&#160;recently signed a deal&#160;with Loti and is using the platform for its clients.

What happens next remains to be seen. But the company&#8217;s recent response to scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe — generally acquiescing and in some cases outright agreeing with its critics — contrasts sharply with its strategy of the late 1990s, and with the defensive approach taken by some of its fellow tech giants today. This is not to weigh in on whether Microsoft&#8217;s actions and intentions are pure. Its rivals including Google and Salesforce would respond with a resounding &#8220;no&#8221; to that. But it&#8217;s clear&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/under-fire-in-the-u-s-and-europe-microsoft-tests-its-new-approach-to-government-scrutiny/">Read More</a>

SDF (Semantic Data Fabric) has spent the past two years building what it describes as a SQL compiler and database engine that analyzes SQL code and provides information about how data is being moved across various warehouses, flagging potential errors or bugs in the process. As companies use more and more data with thousands of SQL statements, the risk of dependency errors may rise —&#160;and that&#8217;s where SDF wants&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/data-warehousing-startup-sdf-led-by-microsoft-and-meta-vets-comes-out-of-stealth-mode/">Read More</a>
