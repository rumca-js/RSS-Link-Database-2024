A government release calls the trial launch of the digital first-aid credential “a milestone for digital identification in NSW.”

“The new Digital First Aid Certificate is an important milestone in our program, which the Minns Labor Government is supporting with a $21.4 million investment in the coming financial year,” says Minister for Customer Service and Digital Government Jihad Dib. “In an <a href="https://www.biometricupdat

		Major identity documents as well as consular services in Cameroon have seen a jump in issuance fees – a decision that has attracted a fusillade of negative reactions. The increase was announced recently by President Paul Biya in <a href="https://www.prc.cm/fr/actualites/actes/ordonnances/7208-ordonnance-n-2024-001-du-20-juin-2024-modifiant-et-completant-certaines-dispositions-de-la-loi-n-2023-019-du-19-decembre-2023-portant-loi-de-finances-de-la-republique-du-cameroun-pour-l-exercice-2024">an ordinance</a> which supplements some provisions of the country’s <a href="https://www.prc.cm/files/3e/4f/04/c831b4fdd38f536904dc4656193895c9.pdf">2024 finance law</a>.

Criticism relates in part to a provision titled “Civil Rights and Algorithms,” which addressed protections against algorithmic discrimination – and has disappeared from the latest draft. Lawyers and digital rights groups are not happy, saying the removal opens the door to civil rights abuses. Advertisers are likewise not happy, arguing that the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24776410-

		German lawmakers are calling for a ban on biometric surveillance and accusing the German police of handing over sensitive biometric data for commercial purposes as criticism piles over the secretive use of a real-time facial recognition system by German law enforcement.

The German Federal Parliament is currently discussing a draft law aiming to amend the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), presenting a window of opportunity to regulate biometric surveillance in public spaces.

Among those calling for the inclusion of the ban at a Bundestag hearing this week was Matthias Marx from the Chaos Computer Club (CCC), Europe's largest association of hackers and Simone Ruf from the non-governmental organization GFF (Gesellschaft für Freiheitsrechte, i.e. Society for Civil Ri
