Pilots are given many tools to help them in worst-case scenarios – from quick reference handbooks to crew resource management. But how they utilize these tools can make or break an emergency. Some of the deadliest accidents in aviation history are often caused by communication errors as was the case with United Airlines Flight 173 in 1979 where 10 people died. But how have these issues improved since?
