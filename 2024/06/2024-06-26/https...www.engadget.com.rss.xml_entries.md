<p>Microsoft leadership has been putting a lot of weight on <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-game-pass-subscriptions-have-begun-to-taper-off-225335361.html"><ins>Game Pass</ins></a>, and several of its business decisions of late appear to center on getting more people into that subscription service. One of those projects was called Keystone, a dedicated streaming device that would let Game Pass customers play Xbox titles without an Xbox console. After first <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-hardware-game-pass-e3-2021-130019814.html"><ins>announcing the concept in 2021</ins></a>, the project was eventually <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/23459189/phil-spencer-microsoft-activision-call-of-duty-xbox-playstation-candy-crush-apple-fortnite-vr"><ins>deemed too expensive</ins></a>.

<div id="bcb9c7db5f5b4149bfc06d8c86c944c4"></div>
<p>Capcom announced a new remaster of its 2006 zombie smasher <em>Dead Rising</em>. The new update, <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em>, is currently scheduled for a release this year on "the newest generation of platforms." We can assume that means at least the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X/S, though it may hit previous-gen consoles as well. Both Frank West and the Willamette Parkview Mall are looking great (although Frank seems to have a different voice in this version). This project looks like a big rebuild with completely redone assets, but we don't have any confirmation yet about the extent of the possible changes afoot. Check out the teaser above to see the differences.</p>
<p>This is the second time Capcom has overhauled the look of this fan-favorite title. It received an HD remaster in 2016 that marked the original's ten-year anniversary, with updates that brought <em>Dead Rising</em>, <em>Dead Rising 2</em>, and <em>Dea

<p>There’s about to be a new clicking game in town, and this one <a href="https://x.com/WritNelson/status/1805949138342949006">looks like an absolute nightmare</a> (in a good way.) <em>Clickolding</em>, which seems to derive its name from cuckolding, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3011440/CLICKOLDING/">is described on Steam as a</a> “dark incremental narrative game about thumbing a tally counter to satisfy the distressing masked man sitting in the corner of your hotel room.” Yikes.</p>
<div id="978f4d1d1ac34dfb92011a8357fdb292"></div>
<p>There’s a trailer and it only adds to the whole unsettling feeling surrounding this game. There is indeed a distressing masked man sitting in the corner of a hotel room demanding that you click a tally counter. There’s something… violent and almost sexual about the whole thing. What happens when you click enough? Do you get a bag of money? Does he explode? Do you explode? Does it turn into a new entry in the Saw franchise? I guess we’ll f

Most of the noteworthy discounts won’t be available until the sales event starts, but, per usual, the retailer is hosting a few deals of note ahead of time. If you’re looking to pick up a new device today, we’ve rounded up the best early Prime Day deals we’ve found below. As a refresher, Amazon essentially uses Prime Day to boost Prime subscriptions and shopping activity during a typically slow period, so you’ll need to be a Prime user to see many of the deals available before and (especially) during the sale. That said, a number of the better deals we’re seeing now are open to everybody. We’ll be updating 

## A Meta ‘error’ broke the political content filter on Threads and Instagram

<p>Earlier this year, Meta made the controversial decision to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-and-threads-will-no-longer-recommend-political-content-180521125.html"><ins>automatically limit</ins></a> political content from users’ recommendations in Threads and Instagram  by default.  The company said that it didn’t want to “proactively amplify” political posts and that users could opt-in via their Instagram settings if they did want to see such content.</p>
<p>But, it turns out, that Meta continued to limit political content even for users who had opted in to seeing it. An unspecified “error” apparently caused the “political content” toggle — already buried several layers deep into Instagram's settings menu — to revert back to the “limit” setting each time the app closed. Political content, according to Meta, “is likely to mention governments, elections, or social topics that affect a group of people and/or society at large.”</p>

<p>An ID verification company that works on behalf of TikTok, X and Uber, among others, has left a set of administrative credentials exposed for more than a year, <a href="https://www.404media.co/id-verification-service-for-tiktok-uber-x-exposed-driver-licenses-au10tix/"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>404 Media</ins></em></a>. The Israel-based AU10TIX verifies the identity of users by using pictures of their faces and drivers’ licenses, potentially opening up both to hackers.</p>
<p>“My personal reading of this situation is that an ID Verification service provider was entrusted with people's identities and it failed to implement simple measures to protect people's identities and sensitive ID documents,” Mossab Hussein, the chief security officer at cybersecurity firm spiderSilk who originally noticed the exposed credentials, said.</p>

<p>Who among us hasn’t lied awake at night during past Olympics, longing for personalized daily event summaries read in the dulcet tones of legendary sports broadcaster Al Michaels? Well, our moment has finally come. “Your Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock” will let you choose your favorite sports and highlight types for the 2024 Summer Olympics, and an AI-generated Michaels will read a 10-minute customized recap of the previous day’s events based on your preferences.</p>
<p>Michaels said he was understandably reluctant when NBC asked for his approval, but he ultimately came around to the AI-fueled vision. “When I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,” the Hall of Fame broadcaster said. “Then I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, ‘I’m in.’”</p>

<p>It's taken 12 years, but Microsoft has finally made an Arm-powered Surface tablet that I don't want to toss out of a window. The new Surface Pro, one of the company's first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/here-are-all-of-the-copilot-pcs-with-snapdragon-x-chips-that-were-released-today-104404765.html">Copilot+ AI PCs</a>, is astoundingly fast and power-efficient, thanks to Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X Elite chip. It can run native Arm apps well — but even better, it can also emulate older apps without much fuss. Basically, Microsoft has finally managed to do what Apple did with its M-series chips four years ago: Deliver killer laptops with power-sipping mobile chips.</p> 
<p>Ironically, though, the Surface Pro's much-hyped AI features are far less compelling than the one-two punch of speed and solid battery life. At launch, the Surface Pro and other Copilot+ PCs can use the Cocreator in Paint to generate AI images alongside text prompts and doodles. They can also translate over 40

<p>The US Supreme Court has ruled on controversial attempt by two states, Missouri and Louisiana, to limit Biden Administration officials and other government agencies from engaging with workers at social media companies about misinformation, election interference and other policies. Rather than set new guidelines on acceptable communication between these parties, the Court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the issue at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Someday, we may have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/menteebot-is-a-human-sized-ai-robot-that-you-command-with-natural-language-110052927.html">humanoid robots</a> so real, they have skin that looks and feels, heals and moves just like ours. A team of scientists from the University of Tokyo and Harvard University are looking into how to make that happen, and the process includes creating some pretty curious, partly terrifying and partly adorable experimental machines with skin. In their paper published in <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(24)00335-7#%20"><em>Cell Reports Physical Science</em></a> (via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/this-smiling-robot-face-made-of-living-skin-is-absolute-nightmare-fuel/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>), the researchers explained that current molding techniques used to create skin equivalents that can fit 3D structures like robotic fingers perfectly do not have a mechanism that can &quot;fix the sk

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/verizon/"><ins>Verizon</ins></a> has agreed to pay a $1.05 million penalty to settle a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/fcc/"><ins>Federal Communications Commission</ins></a> investigation into whether the company broke the agency's rules after a 911 outage. Over a period of one hour and 44 minutes in December 2022, the outage prevented hundreds of emergency calls from going through in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, the FCC said.</p>
<p>The agency added that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/outage/"><ins>outage</ins></a> was akin to one that occurred two months earlier. Although Verizon carried out mitigation efforts to help prevent similar outages to the one in October 2022, &quot;certain failures recurred,&quot; according to the FCC. As part of the settlement, Verizon has committed to implementing a compliance plan to make sure it abides by the FCC's 911 rules and to adhere to best pract

In an update posted on the Rabbitude website, the team said it gained access to the Rabbit codebase on May 16 and found &quot;several critical hardcoded API keys.&quot; Those keys allow anybody to read every single response the R1 AI device has ever given, including those containing the users' personal information. They could also be used to brick R1 devices, alter R1's responses and replace the device's voice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The API keys they found authenticate users' access to ElevenLabs' text-to-speech service, Azure's speech-to-text system, Yelp (for review lookups) and Google Maps (fo

<p>Nearly a year after the European Commission opened its investigation into Microsoft, the European Union’s executive body’s preliminary findings say the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-finds-microsoft-violated-antirust-laws-by-bundling-teams-121520916.html">violated antitrust laws</a> by tying Microsoft Teams to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 business suites. (Microsoft pulled Teams for users in the EU back in October.)</p>
<p>This all kicked off in 2020 when Slack — rival work chat software similar to Teams — filed an antitrust complaint against Microsoft, claiming it broke the EU’s competition rules in bundling Teams.</p>
<p>The European Commission said Microsoft “may have granted Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice whether or not to acquire access to Teams when they subscribe to their SaaS productivity applications.”</p>
<p>If you think you’ve heard similar EU-versus-tech very recently, you’d be right: Apple could face a similar fine f
