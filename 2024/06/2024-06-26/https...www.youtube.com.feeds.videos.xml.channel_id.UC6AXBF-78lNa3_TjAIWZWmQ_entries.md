Welcome to this tour through some of Boliviaâ€™s most beautiful natural wonders. This country is one of the few places on earth where you can experience dramatic shifts in ecosystems within relatively short distances. From the high peaks of the Andes to the lush, expansive Amazon rainforest, Bolivia's ecological diversity is stunning. During this trip we will visit Amboro National Park and Codo de los Andes, the Uyuni Salt Plane, the Sol de Manana geysers, and much more.
