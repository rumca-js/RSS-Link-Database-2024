<p>New <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2117561/microsoft-copilot-plus-pcs.html">Copilot+ PCs</a> are officially on the shelves and Microsoft’s marketing is all about explaining that these laptops include Windows 11 AI features you can <em>only</em> use on this sort of system.</p>

<p>In the US, artificial intelligence (AI) regulation is a hot mess.</p>



<p>There are about 650 proposed state bills in 47 states and more than 100 federal congressional proposals related to AI, according to<a href="https://www.multistate.ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> Multistate.ai</a>. New York alone is home to 98 bills and California has 55. Then there are the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1638347/biden-lays-down-the-law-on-ai.html">executive orders from President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</a> that have spun off many working groups and galvanized several government regulatory agencies.</p>

<p>To get things done using the power of the US government, President Theodore Roosevelt used to advise, “Speak softly and carry a big stick.” No need to rage and roar to accomplish what you want — instead, rely on the considerable power of the federal government to get things done.</p>



<p>How things have changed. These days when it comes to reining in Big Tech, the motto of Congress has essentially become “Speak loudly and carry a small stick.” Call a public hearing, rant and rave about the untrammeled power of major tech players — then do nothing.</p>
