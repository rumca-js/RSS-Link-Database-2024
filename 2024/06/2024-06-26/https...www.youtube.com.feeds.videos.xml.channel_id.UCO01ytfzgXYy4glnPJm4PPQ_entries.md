Today on the Matt Walsh Show, yesterday was "Drag Lobby Day" on Capitol Hill as several drag queens descended on our nation's capital to lobby for a host of awful legislation. The whole event was a flop, though, which may tell us something. Also, the Biden Administration promotes another cross-dressing man. The city of Los Angeles cracks down on people who are committing the crime of trying to make their communities safe and livable. And, the first annual "FatCon," a convention for fat people, just happened. I'll have the highlights, in case you were under the weight limit and couldn't attend.

TIMESTAMPS:

00:00 - 00:30 Opening
01:43 - 18:23 A Flock Of Drag Queens Descend On Capitol Hill 
19:15 - 26:47 White House’s New Cross-Dressing Spokesman Came Straight From Biden’s Wokest Agency
26:48 - 38:42 Los Angeles Prioritizes Homelessness Over Safety
38:43 - 45:11 'Fat Con' Is A Real Thing
46:15 - 55:31 Those Who Never 'Raw Dog' In Life, As Well As Those Who Use The Phrase, Are Canceled
