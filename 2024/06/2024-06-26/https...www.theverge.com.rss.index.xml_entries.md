  <p id="Bz78BG">BMW’s 2025 BMW M5, which is coming as a plug-in electric hybrid (PHEV) for the first time, will be a husky vehicle. With an electric motor to go along with its 4.4-liter V8 engine, the sedan will weigh in at a hefty 5,390 pounds when it <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/usa/article/detail/T0443395EN_US/the-all-new-2025-bmw-m5">launches during the fourth quarter of 2024</a>.</p>
<p id="ohhZRl">That makes the new M5 about 1,000 pounds heavier than the 2023 model that preceded it. It also weighs more than trucks like the 2022 Chevrolet Tahoe (5,356 pounds), the 2024 Lucid Air Sapphire (5,336 pounds), and the 2024 Range Rover Sport (5,090 pounds), <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/724647/2025-bmw-m5-weight-more-than-suv/"><em>Motor1 </em>noted today</a>.

  <p id="f2Wq6I"><em>Wordle</em> is a pretty clever name for the very good word game created by Josh Wardle. But when he was first working on it in 2013, Wardle had another name in mind that isn’t quite as catchy.</p>
<p id="eN8dM1">“This is true: I was going to call <em>Wordle,</em> <em>Mr. Bugs’ Wordy Nugz</em>,” Wardle revealed as part of a presentation about <em>Wordle</em> at Figma’s Config conference on Wednesday. He also showed a slide that spelled out the name in big yellow letters. “Had I called the game <em>Mr. Bugs</em>, I like to think it would not have been successfu
