<p>Turkey scraped through to face Austria in a quintessential battle of the dark horses but they will have to buck their ideas up when the knockouts arrive. They should have seen the evening out in comfort after Czech Republic’s Antonin Barak was sent off for two yellow cards midway through the first half, and seemed certain to do so when Hakan Calhanoglu finished superbly after half-time. But they seem incapable of achieving anything the easy way and listed horribly after Tomas Soucek gave their spirited opposition a lifeline. Cenk Tosun settled their nerves near the end and the battling Czechs bow out.</p><p>The Czech Republic had known at the outset that only a win would do. All the pre-match equations over how the third-place shakedown would shape the tournament were luxuries for others; Ivan Hasek’s players had a job to do and would have to perform most of it without Patrik Schick, their obvious attacking star, who had limped off soon after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fo

With a crowd three‑quarters Romanian it felt like a home fixture at times, and the atmosphere was remarkable with noise and pyrotechnics throughout, but these were two evenly matched teams and a draw was a fair result.

<p>At one end of the ground, one team stood, exhausted, in the penalty area in front of their fans and were warmly applauded. At the other, their opponents could barely approach the box before being driven back by the fury of their support. The oddity was, it was Ukraine who had gone out who were celebrated, and Belgium who had gone through who were booed and jeered to such an extent that Kevin De Bruyne told the players to go to the dressing room.</p><p>In the end, Ukraine just didn’t have the energy or the guile. They will feel unfortunate to have been eliminated from the Euros having picked up four points, the same as every other side in the group, more than Denmark who qualified in second and various third-placed teams. But in the final minutes, when it became apparent that they would need a goal after all, they had nothing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/26/ukraine-belgium-euro-2024-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

The elegance of a modern sunscreen formula, the texture on fingertips and the comfort on skin, the smell, the packaging, the price, the finish and its ability to play nicely with other skincare and makeup products – these are, in my view, often the difference between someone’s decision to protect themselves or not.

<p><strong>Barbican, London<br /></strong>From Cuba to Mexico, from Hong Kong to Iraq, the Belgian artist has made 40 mesmerising films of kids at play, including three with guns up to no good in a war zone</p><p>Cries and laughter, clapping and calls and screams of delight fill the gallery. There are children everywhere on the multiple screens that fill the lower floor. Kids in Cuba careen round the streets of Havana on precarious trolleys fashioned from bits of wood and discarded junk. They rattle and slew on cobbles and jink round corners, under the amused and indulgent eyes of adults as they come hurtling past. The game is both exhilarating and frightening to watch, the young pilots and passengers inches away from hideous injury.

<p>A journalist merges family history with his own experience in Beijing to provide a fascinating insight into Chinese life and politics</p><p>It’s hard to think of a country that has changed as fundamentally as China without altering its basic political system. When I first visited Beijing, three weeks before the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, the main avenues of the city were rivers of&nbsp;bicycles. The very few cars you saw were official ones, with senior party figures sitting stiffly in the back. In the street, you’d be surrounded by staring, smiling people who had never seen a European before. When I jotted things in my notebook, they would crane their necks to see the strange, barbaric signs I was making. If you asked the students in Tiananmen Square what they wanted, they invariably said “democracy”; yet scarcely any of them had the slightest idea what that meant.</p><p>Deng Xiaoping, who ultimately gave&nbsp;the order to open fire on the demonstrators, was responsible for the ex

With Joe Biden proposing a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/27/biden-tax-billionaires-assets/">25% tax</a> on those with assets over $100m (£80m), this is no shock.

Depressed by the loss of his wife and by getting fired due to dwindling audiences, Beale proclaims he will kill himself live on air and is then re-hired as a colossal popular and then populist success, his celebrity delirium turning him into a crazy prophet, telling millions of Americans to scream out of the window that they are as mad as hell and not going to take it any more.

But then an influx of talent changed the entire operation.

## Poolman review – Chris Pine makes splash of totally wrong kind in shambolic stoner comedy

<p>Pine writes, directs and stars – alongside Danny DeVito and Annette Bening – in this rambling comedy mystery about a shaggy, quirky pool attendant</p><p>Chris Pine is usually a likable screen presence but he’s let down here by a flimsy script and over-indulgent direction – which could have something to do with the co-screenwriter (Chris Pine) and the first-time director (er, Chris Pine). You can see what he was going for: a knockabout stoner neo-noir paying homage to old-school Los Angeles, but this is more like Chinatown without the savagery, or Inherent Vice without the brains, or The Big Lebowski without the drugs.</p><p>Pine’s character is very much a watered-down version of Jeff Bridges’ Dude (the strongest thing he consumes is an egg cream mocktail). He’s a shaggy, aimless slacker who lives in a trailer next to the apartment-complex pool he tends with zen-like focus. As his character name, Darren Barrenman, forewarns, he’s little more than a collection of quirks: he makes ori

<p>Scandinavian missionaries wreak destruction on the Sámi way of life in an atmospheric tale of love and colonial conflict</p><p>Hanna Pylväinen’s engrossing novel The End of Drum-Time brings to&nbsp;light the world of the Sámi – who with their reindeer herds inhabit the northern regions of the countries now called Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia – as they coexisted and clashed with Scandinavian missionaries and settlers during this turbulent time. Lars Levi Laestadius, who plays a&nbsp;central role in this story, was a historical figure, a Lutheran minister, himself part Sámi, who worked to convert these nomadic people from their traditional religion and way of life. Pylväinen, who was raised in the&nbsp;American midwest in a sect that evolved from Laestatius’s movement, drops the reader immediately and arrestingly into a bitter northern climate that she makes intimate and familiar through the richness of her descriptions and the honesty of her&nbsp;characterisations.</p><p>“Mad

If this sounds like&nbsp;a blow to the head with a touch of amnesia, it isn’t – but it might be just as painful. No, as Lucy Foulkes explains in her eye-opening guide to the psychology of adolescence, it’s the period of life during which people report the greatest number of important autobiographical memories. For most of us it starts around 10 and peaks at 20, taking in a plethora of firsts: first kiss, first love, first time drinking alcohol or taking drugs, first time away from home. Not to mention exams, bullying, breakups and bereavement. Thinking about it, maybe a concussion would be preferable. But then, as Foulkes shows, it’s these enduringly vivid years that define the adults we become.</p><p>Chloe’s reminiscence bump gets off to an accelerated start, thanks to her wild friend Natalie: “When I was 14, I broke my ankle, so was off school.

White-haired and frail, she takes a few minutes to come to the door of her small redbrick terrace house on an estate in Eastbourne’s Hampden Park suburb. She looks tired and explains that medication for a serious illness makes her sleepy. But a glint of something like mischief flickers in her eyes when she’s asked who has her support at the coming election.</p><p>It’s a close call. Reform or Liberal Democrat. Sheila likes what Nigel Farage has to say and has backed Ukip before (never the Tories).
