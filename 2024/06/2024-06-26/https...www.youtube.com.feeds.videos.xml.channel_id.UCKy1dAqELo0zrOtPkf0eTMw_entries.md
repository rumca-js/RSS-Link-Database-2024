Elden Ring has several overlapping systems by which you can upgrade your character, and Shadow Of The Erdtree adds one more: Scadutree Fragments. Collect these fragments scattered across the Realm Of Shadow, and you can spend them to upgrade your Scadutree Blessing at any Site Of Grace, permanently upgrading your attack damage and damage negation - but only within the Land Of Shadow.

Come with us as we detail the locations of all 50 Scadutree Fragments in Shadow Of The Erdtree, so you can reach the maximum Scadutree Blessing level of 20.

SPOILER WARNING, we will be showing parts of almost every area of the DLC in this video.
