								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know some <strong>Pokémon cards</strong> can be incredibly valuable items in today's collector's market. But that only made this Pokémon TCG fan <em>more</em> dismayed to find that the Mew Gold Star card they bought for $400 was damaged upon arrival - because the seller had apparently accidentally engraved their name right into into the card art.</span></p>

								<p><strong>Looking for the</strong> <strong>MTG Commander banlist?</strong> With such a vast format, knowing which cards you aren't allowed to use can be tricky.

								<p>When it comes to instantly recognisable villains, Bowser is the Darth Vader of gaming – even grandparents recognise him as Super Mario’s big bad. If Lego was going to make a hulking 12.5-in tall monument to any video game character, it might as well be King Koopa.
