Our guest, poet (and poetry professor) Joshua Bennett, talks about the early experiences that pushed him toward poetry and about the people who shaped and inspired his creative approach as a writer. Many of these people are fellow poets, others are his own grandparents, parents, and teachers, but Prof. Bennett has also found inspiration in less expected figures; over the course of the interview, he name-checks the singers Yolanda Adams and Marvin Gaye, the biologists Charles Henry Turner and Ernest Everett Just, the astronaut Mae Jemison, and various characters from the TV series Star Trek: the Next Generation. Other topics Prof. Bennett addresses include the relation between poetry and generative AI (his own work is among the vast body of text that has been fed as training data into large language models), ", "id": 770744, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFhj70G3aM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCEBb1b_L6zDS3xTUrIALZOw", "source_obj__id": 437, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/BfFhj70G3aM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Living Poetry with Poet Joshua Bennett", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-26T12:59:15+00:00", "description": "MIT 6.774 Physics of Microfabrication: Front End Processing, Fall 2004\nInstructor: Judy Hoyt\n\nView the complete course: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-774-physics-of-microfabrication-front-end-processing-fall-2004/\nYouTube Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61IMhYaHL_x-RzNUIDJD9XK\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\nMore courses at https://ocw.mit.edu\nSupport OCW at http://ow.ly/a1If50zVRlQ\n\nWe encourage constructive comments and discussion on OCW\u2019s YouTube and other social media channels.
