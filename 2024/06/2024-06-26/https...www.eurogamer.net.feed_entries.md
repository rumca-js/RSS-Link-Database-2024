Today sees the launch of EE's new Broadband Made for Gamers bundle and, to celebrate, the phone and internet provider has the above prizes available if you answer a very simple question below.
</p><p>
To help you answer, it may be worth knowing that EE recently enlisted a couple of speedrunners to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWfFZLpewnE">successfully beat several lap world records in Codemasters' Grid Legends</a>, using Broadband Made for Gamers's speedy 1.6Gbps connection.

Valve is expanding Steam's already teetering tower of built-in features with a new background gameplay recording and sharing system that's available in beta now.
</p><p>
As detailed on Valve's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording">Game Recording beta page</a>, Steam's new suite of console-like video features begin with two distinct recording modes. A Background Recording mode continuously saves gameplay to a preferred drive - users can set duration and storage limits - while an On Demand Recording mode enables users to start and stop recording as they choose.
</p><p>
A new timeline feature and player-added event markers are intended to make it easier to find key moments (achievements, screenshots, and in-game events in supported games can also auto-generate markers if desired) and recordings can be clipped us

Remember Microsoft's Xbox cloud gaming device, codenamed Keystone? The one that got announced in 2021, was cancelled in its original form a year later, then showed up on Phil Spencer's shelf after that, bamboozling everyone? Well if you've ever wondered what it could have looked like in more detail, a newly surfaced patent might have some answers.
</p><p>
The <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/D1009161">patent in question</a> was originally filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office in June 2022 - several months after Microsoft announced it would no longer be proceeding with Keystone in its existing form - and features designs for a proposed machine only referred to as an "electronic console device". There's nothing explicitly linking to the document to Keystone, but <a href="https://www.windo

## Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree - long-standing tech issues remain unaddressed

The original game's launch exhibited a string of performance issues on PC and consoles, so the hope is that this expansion offers a fresh opportunity to address these issues. </p><p>The big questions then: in the intervening years, has FromSoftware improved the game's performance on console? Do any of the game's modes - like the frame-rate, quality and ray tracing modes on PS5 or Series X - deliver anything close to a locked 60fps yet? And as for PC, what's the current state of Elden Ring's optimisation and has its long-standing stutter issues been solved? </p><p>There's no doubt that Shado

Capcom's slapstick zombie series Dead Rising is being reanimated, with a Deluxe Remaster version of the 2006 original launching for unspecified platforms at an unspecified release date.
</p><p>
Created created by Keiji Inafune of Mega Man fame, Dead Rising's first outing took the basic premise of George A. Romero's horror movie classic Dawn of the Dead - which is to say, zombies in a mall - and gave it a fresh spin with a ludicrous anything-goes approach to weaponary and undead hordes appearing in absolute multitudes.
</p><p>
Players - as photojournalist Frank West - were given three in-game days to investigate Colorado's sprawling, zombie-infested Willamette Parkview Mall, the idea being to solve a series of cases before a helicopter picked them up on the final day. There's more to it than that, but it's probably best remembe

## Dragon Age developer discusses why big games take so long, and why they're announced so early

Dragon Age creator and BioWare veteran Mark Darrah has discussed some of the reasons why big-budget games seemingly take so long to make - and why some projects are announced so long before they're ready to release.
</p><p>
Darrah, a veteran of BioWare back to the original Baldur's Gate, previously headed the Dragon Age franchise and returned to work on the upcoming entry Dragon Age: The Veilguard as a consultant. 
</p><p>
Speaking via his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NK0vKRf0_c">YouTube</a> channel, Darrah provides some interesting insight on the topic of big-budget game development. And, while he avoids namechecking any of BioWare's games directly, it's not difficult to read between the lines at certain points as to how this wisdom relates to the company he's spent most of

As Elden Ring players struggle with the high difficulty of Shadow of the Erdtree, the most popular mods since release focus on easing the challenge.
</p><p>
Over on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/popular/">NexusMods</a>, plenty of new mods have already been uploaded since the launch of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> last week, ready for PC players to enter the Land of Shadow.
</p><p>
Many of these mods provide a save file to ensure players are ready for the DLC. To access the new quest, two specific bosses in the base game must be defeated - unless you've got a mod to do that for you, like those from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5181">byDelamain</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5241">Yticay

Ubisoft platforming mascot Rayman was once featured in the files of Beyond Good &amp; Evil, as shown in the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evils-just-got-a-new-edition-and-the-games-always-been-different-every-time-ive-played-it-anyway">just-released 20th Anniversary Edition</a>.

This is a named location found after beating a specific boss, but it appears to serve no purpose. What could it be? <strong>Spoilers follow</strong>.

It was an odd experience - the game had changed a bit, in that I was drawn to different things in it, and I feel like I played through it in a slightly different way. But every time I've replayed Beyond Good &amp; Evil it's been a different game, I think. Let's explore that.</p><p>My early memories of Beyond Good &amp; Evil are all a

A patch for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has been released that revises the scaling of the Shadow Realm Blessings.
</p><p>
The DLC includes this new scaling system to boost the attack and defence of both your character and your spirit summons, by collecting Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes respectively.
</p><p>
Now the scaling has been revised so that the effects are greater for the first few levels, before becoming more gradual later.

Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration - the acclaimed Atari-themed interactive museum from developer Digital Eclipse - is adding 39 new games later this year in an expansion detailing further events in the company's eventful history.

Atari 50's Expanded Edition introduces two new timelines to the existing game, starting with The Wider World of Atari. This features 19 playable games, eight new video segments, plus "interviews, vintage ads, historical artefacts, and more" focusing on a broad range topics.

"Highlights from the new timeline," explains Atari, "include a deep dive into Stern Electronics' robot-blasting Berzerk; unusual and underappreciated innovations and hidden gems from the late 1980s; a spotlight on the artist Evelyn Seto, who helped create the iconic 'Fuji' Atari logo; Pong creator Al Alcorn explaining t
