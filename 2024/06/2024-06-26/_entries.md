## New calculation approach allows more accurate predictions of how atoms ionize when impacted by high-energy electrons

During electron-impact ionization (EII), high-energy electrons collide with atoms, knocking away one or more of their outer electrons. To calculate the probability that ionization will occur during these impacts, researchers use a quantity named the "ionization cross-section." EII is among the main processes affecting the balance of charges in hot plasma, but so far, its cross-section has proven incredibly difficult to study through theoretical calculations.

Through heavily doping sulfur into an apatite framework, we synthesize a new blend mainly comprising variant apatite and covellite (copper sulfide). Magnetic measurement exhibits that significant diamagnetism appears at around 260 K and drops dramatically below 30 K implying coexistence of two superconducting phases. The upper critical magnetic field is larger than 1000 Oe at 250 K. Electric measurement manifests that the current-voltage curves deviate from the normal linear lineshape suggesting the presence of zero-resistance effect, and the critical current is around 50 $μ$A at 140 K. These exotic magnetic and electric features strongly indicate these two components, variant apatite and covellite, individually trigger two superconducting phases at near-room and low temperatures.
