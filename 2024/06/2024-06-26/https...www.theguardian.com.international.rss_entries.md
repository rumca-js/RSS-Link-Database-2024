The result did, however, carry the team through to the last 16 as Group C winners where they will face Slovakia in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday.</p><p>Southgate lamented the atmosphere that is pressing down on the squad after three largely uninspired displays in Germany and is aware that he could be the problem. “Our world is different [to other teams] at the moment and I feel that is probably because of me,” he said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/foo
