<p>An OpenJDK proposal would preview value classes and objects in a forthcoming version of Java. The feature would provide Java class instances that have only <code>final</code> fields and lack object identity.</p><p>The <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/401" rel="nofollow">Java enhancement proposal</a>, which dates back to August 2020, was updated on June 21. The plan would allow developers to opt into a programming model for simple values in which objects are distinguished by their field values, much as the <code>int</code> value <code>3</code> is distinguished from the <code>int</code> value <code>4</code>. A second goal is to migrate popular classes that represent simple values in the JDK, such as <code>Integer</code>, to this programming model. This is intended support compatible migration of user-defined classes. A third goal is to maximize the freedom of the JVM to encode simple values in ways that improve memory footprint, locality, and garbag

But like any other piece of software, Python can be complex to set up and manage.</p><p>In this article, we’ll walk through how to set up Python the right way. You'll learn how to pick the appropriate version, how to keep multiple versions from stepping on one another, and how to avoid sharp edges and potential pitfalls along the way.</p><h2 class="toc">Choose the right Python version and distribution</h2>
<p>At any one point in time, a few different versions of Python are actively receiving updates or at least security fixes. You might think it makes sense to pick the most recent edition of the bunch.
