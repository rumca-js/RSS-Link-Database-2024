Abstract

Denmark, 2017 - 2022

Variation in semen quality among men applying to be sperm donors 

Summary answer

The motile sperm concentration and total motile sperm count (TMSC) in ejaculates,

both measures of sperm quality,

declined by as much as 22% from 2019 to 2022.

What is known already

Questions remain about whether human semen quality has declined in recent years. 

Resolution of this issue has important implications for human fertility
