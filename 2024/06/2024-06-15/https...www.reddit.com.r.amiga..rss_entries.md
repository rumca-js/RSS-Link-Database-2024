<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! Looking for a game a used to play on Amiga 600 when I was a child (maybe 25-30 years ago). It was a side-scroller with a robot on wheels which had a lift with small platform on top of it’s body. It was able to lift another platform to higher places. This is everything I can remember. I’m trying to find the game for last few months but no success. Thanks for every help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Riva86"> /u/Riva86 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dgqjk5/sidescrolling_platformer_with_robot_on_wheels/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dgqjk5/sidescrolling_platformer_with_robot_on_wheels/">[comments]</a></span>

I just became the proud owner of an amiga 1000, however it does have an issue. So when I attempt to load my kickstart it doesn’t load and makes an unusual noise. I did use the kickstart before and it worked fine, it want until I was checking other disks that this started happening. I’m not sure if the heads need cleaning or if the drive is out of alignment. Need some insight on possible issues and how to go about fixing them. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cc8218"> /u/Cc8218 </a> <br /> <span><a h
