<p>An immortal menace returns in the first part of the season finale – that raises some very interesting questions about child labour in the Whoniverse</p><p>Finally, we discover the identity of the mysterious woman who has been appearing with the Doctor and Ruby all through this season’s adventures, and it turns out that Susan Triad (Susan Twist) has been a pawn all along. It was also very amusing that a lot of things that had been the subject of frenzied online speculation – was S Triad an all-too obvious anagram of Tardis? – were dealt with in the first couple of minutes, with everybody standing around essentially saying to the viewer “Well … obviously!”</p><p>This was very much the act one set-up of a two-part story. Mel (Bonnie Langford) had far more to do than she did when she returned for the 60th anniversary, and having her undercover in the Triad technology company was a good way of illustrating how Unit utilises the Doctor’s former companions once their travels have ended.

A glimpse of how quickly it can be lost, of a familiar flaw. There were 10 minutes left when Unai Simón lost the ball trying to play out and, with Bruno Petkovic preparing to roll the ball into an open goal, Rodri brought him down.</p><p>Simón made an exceptional save from Petkovic’s penalty but Ivan Perisic reached the rebound and gave it back to him to score. Or so he thought, until the video assistant ­referee revealed that he had encroached. He had moved too fast. Ultimately, so had Spain.

<p>Doubts have been raised about Liverpool star’s defensive prowess but his ability could make difference at Euro 2024</p><p>This week, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/england-midfield-euro-2024-southgate">Wayne Rooney declared that he “wouldn’t have Trent Alexander-Arnold anywhere near the middle of the pitch”</a>. Which feels just a touch proscriptive, especially when you consider that – given the relatively modest distances involved – pretty much everywhere on a football pitch could be described as “near the middle of the pitch”. Presumably Alexander-Arnold’s role in a Rooney-coached team would be a highly bespoke corner-flag-to-corner-flag operation: shuttling up and down the right flank but bending his runs via the first few rows of the crowd, avoiding that all-important centre-circle blast radius.</p><p>Of course, this was not the only reason Rooney’s comments struck a weirdly discordant tone. “I love him as a footballer and what he does on the

<p>Pacy and direct striker won First Division and Cup Winners’ Cup with Arsenal but he was never given an England cap</p><p>A throw-in from Lee Dixon. Alan Smith controls it at the top corner of the box and plays the ball back out to Dixon as Kevin Campbell, coming from wide, runs past him, drawing the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Paul Le Guen with him. The movement creates space for Dixon, who has time to measure his cross. Campbell continues his run far enough for Le Guen to stop, but not quite far enough for Alain Roche to pick him up. Dixon finds Campbell and, twisting, he guides a low header past the sprawl of Bernard Lama at the near post.</p><p>The first leg of the 1994 Cup Winners’ Cup semi-final at the Parc des Princes had finished 1-1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiflqT4G_-c">Campbell’s goal</a>, after seven minutes, was the only one of the second leg.

<p><em>Lingchi</em>, or “death by a thousand cuts”, was a particularly brutal form of execution practised in Asia in ancient times: the condemned person was tied to a post and body parts were slowly sliced off one by one. The Indian-born photographer <a href="https://sujatasetia.com/about">Sujata Setia</a> uses this barbaric practice in her series <em>A Thousand Cuts</em> as a potent metaphor for a different kind of brutality – domestic abuse. In collaboration with the charity <a href="https://www.shewise.org/">Shewise</a>, Setia spent two years photographing survivors of abuse among the UK’s south Asian community. Using <em>saanjhi</em>, the Indian art of paper-cutting, she makes vivid red cuts in her portraits to express her subjects’ anguish: “I wanted to show how the scars are not only external but internal,” she says. Having grown up witnessing domestic violence, Setia initially resisted turning the camera on herself. “But there came a point where I realised I had to own my own s

After all the doubts about Switzerland, all the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/03/euro-2024-team-guides-part-2-hungary">positive noises about Hungary</a>, there had been something almost surreal about the ease with which Murat Yakin’s team dominated the first half. Hungary, having been oddly sluggish, were able to impose themselves enough after the break to at least cause Switzerland some anxiety. In truth, though, this was comfortable enough, a game in effect won by half-time and sealed by Breel Embolo’s late strike.</p><p>When Switzerland went out of the 2006 World Cup to Ukraine in this stadium on penalties after a 0-0 so dull, so entirely devoid of incident, that even now light waves continue to be sucked towards its centre, the sense was that Switzerland could have played for centuries without scoring.

The Dutch master Sir Peter Paul Rubens certainly knew how to paint people; Rubenesque is still used to describe a curvaceous, ample body. So when he noticed the inferior quality of the religious figures depicted on an otherwise accomplished landscape hanging on his wall, it turns out he simply picked up his paint palette.</p><p>A newly rediscovered Herri met de Bles painting, titled <em>The Holy Family with the Infant Saint John the Baptist in </em><em>an Extensive Landscape with Travellers</em>, set a puzzle for art historians because the style of the landscape background did not match the group of people.
