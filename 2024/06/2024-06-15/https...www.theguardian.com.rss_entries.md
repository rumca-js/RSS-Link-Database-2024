<ul><li>England, 122-5, beat Namibia, 84-3, by 41 runs (DLS)</li><li>Harry Brook top scores with 47 in one-sided victory</li></ul><p>In securing victory over Namibia in a rain-shortened thrash, England had done all they could do. It was then back to the team hotel, bolstered by a 41-run win, to discover whether Australia could offer them safe passage into the Super Eight phase of this men’s T20 World Cup by beating Scotland in St Lucia.</p><p>It had been a maddening afternoon in North Sound, rain showers having pushed the 1pm start back some three hours and leaving just enough time for what, with one further mid-innings burst, became a 10-over per side contest. But after all that waiting around, the ground staff having performed cricket’s version of the Cha&nbsp;Cha Slide, Jos Buttler’s team hauled themselves level with Scotland’s five points. More importantly, they had nudged them out of second place on net run-rate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/15/

<p>This thrilling documentary about how, 20 years ago, the young striker inspired England to spectacular things at the Euros sweeps you up and leaves you tingling</p><p>Fittingly, Rooney 2004: World at His Feet is only half an hour long, when you expect any documentary these days to drag on for 60 minutes at least. It sweeps you up, flashes a moment of fantastical sporting immortality at you, then dumps you back down to earth, leaving you tearful and rueful but still tingling. It’s over before it’s begun. It’s how it felt to be an England supporter watching Wayne Rooney play at the European Championships 20 years ago.</p><p>World at His Feet captures perhaps the most magical thing football can give its fans, almost all of whom are people who played the game as kids until they grew up and realised they were not, in fact, the best in the world. Watching your team win a match is good and watching them win a trophy is better, but nothing is quite like watching a player who is basically st

<p>Italy’s title defence is alive and well for now. Expectations around Luciano Spalletti’s new-look side have been low but this win over the tournament’s rank outsiders, achieved despite a monumental scare inside the opening minute, was ultimately conducted with a familiar air of authority. Alessandro Bastoni and Nicolò Barella stepped up when demanded with decisive interventions in a remarkable opening quarter and the remainder was a successful exercise in the kind of game management that once seemed a national pastime.</p><p>Such a narrow margin of defeat may yet prove useful to Albania’s hopes of scraping third place in the group of death. If that proves unattainable they will, at least, depart with something to remember them by. Nedim Bajrami’s emphatic finish was the fastest goal in European Championship history and lifted the roof from a stadium that has surely never hosted anything like the fervent Albanian influx that descended here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/f

<p>The Dane’s presence at these Euros is less about creative inspiration than an affirmation of the game’s greatest values</p><p>It was the third game of the Euros. There was a slow sense of familiarity returning. The night before, Italy had beaten Turkey 3-0 in Rome. Earlier in the afternoon, Wales and Switzerland had drawn 1-1 in Baku. In Copenhagen, Denmark would face Finland. Covid restrictions meant there would be only 13,700 at Parken. But a year after it should have been played, the fact Euro 2020 was going ahead at all was a symbol that, whatever the lingering effects of the virus, something approaching normal life could return.</p><p>Finland’s 3,000-strong contingent were giddy on the euphoria of playing in their first tournament; the Denmark fans were, like everybody, glad that football was possible again and that they were hosting a game at a major finals for the first time.

One asked if I wanted to see an “even bigger thing”. All of them agreed they were prepared to stab other dealers.

<p>The Peacock and People Just Do Nothing star on using food to connect to his Kurdish roots, his mental block with seafood and why he looks up to Anthony Bourdain</p><p><strong>I’ve always been into food</strong><strong> – and I sort of forget sometimes</strong><strong>.</strong> Because food was so prominent in my household: my dad’s Kurdish, my mum’s Czech, but my mum spent 15 years living in Baghdad before I was born, so she’s an expert on both sides. She’d always be cooking: a simpler dish would be a goulash with dumplings, or, from the Kurdish side, a lamb stew either with okra or potatoes or beans. I was spoiled.</p><p><strong>I used to be a little bit ashamed of being a foreigner</strong> and not feeling like everyone else. When my friends were coming over, I’d be like: “Don’t show them sauerkraut, they’ll think it’s weird.” Trying to get the pizzas out of the freezer so they couldn’t see – in my mind – the strange foreign food. And I smoked lots of weed, so I just wanted to e

<p>A new essay on the rise of superintelligent machines pivots from being a warning to humanity to a rallying cry for an industrial complex to bolster American military defence </p><p>Ten years ago, the Oxford philosopher <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/17/superintelligence-nick-brostrom-rough-ride-future-james-lovelock-review">Nick Bostrom published </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/17/superintelligence-nick-brostrom-rough-ride-future-james-lovelock-review">Superintelligence</a></em>, a book exploring how superintelligent machines could be created and what the implications of such technology might be. One was that such a machine, if it were created, would be difficult to control and might even take over the world in order to achieve its goals (which in Bostrom’s celebrated thought experiment was to make paperclips).</p><p>The book was a big seller, triggering lively debates but also attracting a good deal of disagreement.

<p>From the Lake District to London, you’ve got to book weeks ahead for a meal that has become a big celebratory event</p><p>For better or worse, I associate Sunday lunch with high drama. As a teenager, it often seemed to be the moment for an argument or even some kind of life-changing big reveal (I’ll save the details for the memoir). There was also, of course, the fact that my parents were divorced: at my dad’s, lunch was swiftly followed by the journey home to my mum, and The Handover. By 4pm, I never knew whether the rumbling of my stomach was down to overindulgence – our Sunday lunches were decadently vast, and my greed, even then, almost boundless – or a nervousness that was born of wanting to please all the adults (and knowing I might fail).</p><p>The Freudians out there will say that it’s thanks to this that I have tended to avoid Sunday lunch as an adult. But I don’t think the two things are connected. Unless I’m on holiday – in which case, cheers, and pass the rosé – I often

<p>Seeing his brother’s distressing deterioration has made the broadcaster even more certain that legal reform is needed</p><p>My brother was a sculptor. A vibrant, formidable force. Physically strong and intellectually clear-minded, with a wonderful capacity to express his love of art. The autumn before he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, my wife noticed he looked a bit frail. He had trouble swallowing his food. He had just completed a sculpture of Coleridge for a churchyard in Devon and was otherwise fit and well. But then he fell over, on to a child while in London. Nick had been mortified, so he visited the GP. In February 2023 I received the call: “Joth, I’ve got some bad news.”</p><p>The diagnosis came brutally. It horrified Nick to adjust to a life in which he would not be able to use his hands or voice. “I’m not going to allow myself to be a trussed-up chicken carcass,” he said. “I’m going to bring an end to it before that.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/li

<p>Wild Cat Island had always held a special place in the imagination of our son, so after his funeral we chose to try and send him on one last journey</p><p>Famously, Windermere is the setting of the children’s adventure story <em>Swallows and Amazons</em> by Arthur Ransome, and it’s also one of our son Torin’s favourite books. It appealed to his own love of adventure, mischief and all things piratical. Along with his little sister, Lowri, we embarked upon many canoe adventures together on the River Dart in the summer months, spotting wildlife and playing pirates with other boats. Torin – which means chief – was always ship’s captain, of course, because the children from the story often tussled for the position. Torin also loved practical jokes. His favourite was the whoopee cushion, normally hidden very indiscreetly on a seat where you would be ordered to sit down with great anticipation and stifled giggling.</p><p>Torin was born with a rare form of life-limiting, mitochondrial dise

<p>The comedy producer, 51, reflects on early ambitions to be a stockbroker, dodging racism by being a wheelchair user, and being noisy enough to get invited to the party</p><p><strong>I was born in Cairo</strong> and moved to Northern Ireland when I was two for my parents’ work – they’re both doctors.

When my family moved to England, my nickname at school was IRA.<br /><br /><strong>I was really interested</strong> in becoming a stockbroker. I’m a product of the 80s, with the stock market booms and red striped shirts. I thought: they’re just sitting down, shouting into a telephone. I could do that! That’s what I trained to do, but when I got there, I wasn’t very good at it.

It’s a pose every bit as era-defining as the microphone stance of fellow 1994 alumnus Liam Gallagher. Oasis’s <em>Definitely Maybe</em> and Portishead’s <em>Dummy</em> both came out that year, the latter introducing Gibbons’s otherworldly, jazz-inflected voice.</p><p>Tonight, Gibbons’s instrument, flawless against the march of time, hovers over a backdrop of groans, drones and keening melodies coming from seven players backlit by a succession of dark reds and blues.

Accordingly, in March 2008, he died at a legal Belgian facility. The Catholic church naturally condemned his action. Whereas the former prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, not always a man for the striking phrase, said that the onset of Alzheimer’s must have been “an inevitable and unbearable torture”, and went on: “I can live with the fact that he decided thus, because he left us as a great glowing star, right on time, just before he collapsed into a stellar black hole.” Claus’s actions struck me, and still do, as rational, exemplary, and in a quiet way, heroic.</p><p>The relig

<p>New ideas for summer coolers</p><p>“When I was in Miami a few years ago, they served <em>frosé</em> by the pool and it was divine,” says Andy Clarke, author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/house-of-gin-9781784889524">House of Gin</a>. That’s essentially a rosé slush puppie, but Clarke has since cranked it up a gear with the addition of sloe gin. He combines five parts rosé, three parts sloe gin and one part cranberry juice, then freezes the lot overnight in a clip-lock container. “Because of the amount of alcohol, it will only freeze to the point of being slushy,” Clarke says, so to serve you simply loosen it with a fork until you get “shards of beautiful, deep pink slush”. Divide between wine glasses and decorate with frozen mixed berries and a sprig of mint for “that sangria-esque holiday feeling, even if you’re at home”. A word to the wise, though: this sloe frosé is quite potent, so Clarke advises maybe topping it up with a bit more cranberry juice: “That will also loo

Now it often involves the restaurant contacting you too – sometimes several times over.</p><p>Online booking platforms used by hundreds of restaurants in the UK now send out reservation confirmations, reminders, requests for feedback, future deals and news. Some send certain customers a “personalised booking link” after their visit, to encourage them to come back. “I hope you had a great time on your last visit … and that you’ll come back to see us again soon,” reads one example, sent on behalf of Som Saa, a Thai restaurant in east London, via booking platform SevenRooms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jun/15/guests-like-to-be-known-restaurants-luring-diners-back-via-personal-reservations">Continue reading...</a>

 I arrived at the entrance interview, my hands swinging. Apparently, it was&nbsp;customary to offer a portfolio for scrutiny. Unfazed, I said I didn’t have one.

<p>The larger grain of kosher salt means it’s more suitable for even salting and brining – and  a teaspoon is half as salty as one of fine salt </p><p><strong>If a </strong><strong>recipe</strong><strong> specifies kosher salt, is somebody having a laugh, or is there a gastronomic reason to use it?<br /></strong><em><strong>Pablo, Lancaster</strong></em><br />
 Kosher salt is not actually “kosher” (as in, it’s not religiously treated). Historically, the name stems from the Jewish practice of removing surface blood when dry brining meat (such as with brisket), and that process is known as <em>kashering</em>. Because of this kind of salt’s larger grain size, it dissolves more slowly and evenly, which in turn ensures a more even brining. It also doesn’t contain any additives or preservatives, so has a very clean, er, salty taste.</p><p>In practical terms, then, the coarseness and consistency of kosher salt grains also mean they are easier to handle and hold in your fingertips. This gives
