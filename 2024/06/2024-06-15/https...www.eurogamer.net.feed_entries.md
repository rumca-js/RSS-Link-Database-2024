Eight years into Pok&eacute;mon Go's life, and the game's annual summer Go Fest events remain a firm fixture in the app's event calendar. More than a dozen of these meetups have now taken place around the world, with the most recent this weekend in Madrid, where tens of thousands of Pok&eacute;fans braved the heat to catch an enticing array of species ahead of other players. 
</p><p>
Go Fest's Global version, a Covid-era invention that remains a lucrative ongoing addition, offers similar rewards next month, but without that same experience of potentially travelling somewhere new, to be among crowds of fellow players. And in both Madrid's Juan Carlos I Park and within the city's narrow streets, there were Pok&eacute;fans everywhere. Not since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-on-pokemon-go-fest-proves-the-games-lingering-p

Assassin's Creed Shadows has finally been revealed. After a short CG trailer debuted a few weeks ago, Ubisoft has finally unveiled a lengthy gameplay demo for the upcoming title. As the first current-gen only effort in the long running series, it seems poised to take advantage of current-gen technologies, like ray tracing. At the same time, early impressions suggest a game that might provide a more iterative uplift over previous titles. So what kinds of technology gains are we finding under-the-hood?

Game by game, the studio has created beloved rituals, based around precise combat, intricate, looping maps, and storytelling that unfolds in weapon drops and item descriptions as much as cut-scenes and dialogue.</p><p>Imitators have followed, some of them brilliantly. And so as new ideas have slowly entered the mix from outside of FromSoftware itself, Soulslike games have steadily formed a fascinating genre in their own right.</p><p>On the eve of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-brings-further-depth-and-grandeur-to-fromsoftwares-masterpiece">Elden Ring DLC</a>, we thought it might be interesting to look at some of the ideas that outside studios have brought to FromSoftware's template.
