<p>MGM+ has ordered an eight-episode series based on Stephen King’s 2019 novel, <em>The Institute</em>, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/the-institute-ben-barnes-mary-louise-parker-mgm-plus-stephen-king-1235972273/"><em>Deadline</em></a> reported this week. The novel follows the plight of 12-year-old Luke Ellis and a group of other children with telepathic and telekinetic abilities who have been kidnapped and held captive at a facility deep in the Maine woods, where their powers are being exploited. Their story becomes intertwined with that of an ex-cop Tim Jamieson. I really enjoyed this one when it came out, and as a lifelong King reader who has become hardened against the disappointment of terrible adaptations, I’m choosing to remain hopeful.</p>
<p>So far, all we know about the cast is that it includes Ben Barnes (<em>Shadow and Bone</em>) as Jamieson and Mary-Louise Parker (<em>Weeds</em>) as the villainous Mrs. Sigsby, according to <em>Deadline</em

<p>Some Cybertruck buyers who were scheduled to receive their new trucks this week have been told they’ll have to wait a little while longer as the company addresses a safety issue with the windshield wiper motor. Tesla hasn’t publicly confirmed any such problems or issued an official recall, but numerous commenters on the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-deliveries-suspended-temporarily-due-to-windshield-wiper-motor-issue.18736/">Cybertruck Owners Club</a> forum and <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybertruck/comments/1dg1t5j/delivery_date_changed/">Reddit</a> said they were notified that deliveries have been halted and their pickup dates were pushed back a week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US military used fake social media accounts to spread propaganda that was designed to discredit China’s COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines during the height of the pandemic, according to a bombshell report from <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-covid-propaganda/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>. The anti-vax campaign ran from spring 2020 until mid-2021, and was intended to “counter what [the Pentagon] perceived as China’s growing influence in the Philippines,” the publication found in its investigation. The Philippines saw low vaccination rates through 2021 even months after China’s Sinovac vaccine arrived in the area, and recorded nearly 50,000 COVID deaths by November of that year.</p>
<p>In one example of the US’s anti-vax messaging cited by <em>Reuters</em>, an account in 2020 tweeted, “COVID came from China and the VACCINE also came from China, don’t trust China!” The campaign also pushed the narrative that China’s 

## Doctor Who: The Legend of Ruby Sunday review: What legend?

<p><strong><em>The following contains spoilers for “The Legend of Ruby Sunday.”</em></strong></p>
<p>In an episode full of misdirection, the biggest one has to be its title, given we’ve learned very little about what Ruby Sunday’s legend actually is. Instead, the first part of the series’ two part finale is essentially an hour to build a sense of dread that spills over in its final moments. I could cheat and say “The Legend of Ruby Sunday” is just “<a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Army_of_Ghosts_(TV_story)"><ins>Army of Ghosts</ins></a>” — the first half of the 2006 season’s finale — with a bigger budget. Except the big bad that reveals itself at the end is a villain from a far deeper cut than the usual corners of <em>Doctor Who’s</em> history.</p>
