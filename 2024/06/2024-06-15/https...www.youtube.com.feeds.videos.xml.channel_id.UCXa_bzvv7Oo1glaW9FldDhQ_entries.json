Now, however, the developer has remastered the game and brought it over to modern platforms (except Xbox), and though I wouldn\u2019t call it an unmissable masterpiece or anything approaching that, I do find it an easy game to recommend. \n\nMonster Hunter Stories certainly shows its age (and the fact that it was made for the 3DS) in some areas, but it\u2019s ultimately still a fun and charming RPG that fans of the genre will likely enjoy.", "id": 719481, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSb88LXUU0k", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/NSb88LXUU0k/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Monster Hunter: Stories 1 PS4 Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-15T15:30:02+00:00", "description": "Elden Ring is absolutely FromSoftware\u2019s most ambitious entry in their Soulsborne canon.

After completing the first mission, players must spend real Credits (acquired with real money) to access the second. Its length and the rewards leave much to be desired, even more when compared to the work of independent modders.\n\nSuffice it to say that fans aren't happy and have begun leaving negative reviews on Steam, plunging its recent rating into \"Mostly Negative.\" Is this a precedent for what you can expect from future content?
