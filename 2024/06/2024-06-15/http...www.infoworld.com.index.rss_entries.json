Unlike const items, inline consts can make use of in-scope generics and have their type inferred rather than explicitly written, making them particularly useful for inline code snippets. This improvement makes code more succinct and easier to read, the Rust Team said.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a hr", "id": 716505, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715660/rust-stabilizes-inline-const-expressions.html#tk.rss_all", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "http://www.infoworld.com/index.rss", "source_obj__id": 151, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2016/11/chain-100694122-small.jpg", "title": "Rust stabilizes inline const expressions", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
