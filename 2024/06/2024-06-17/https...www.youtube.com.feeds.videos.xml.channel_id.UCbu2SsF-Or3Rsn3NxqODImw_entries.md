Get ready to enter Mohgwyn Palace, reach into Miquella’s cocoon, and cross the veil into the Land of Shadow in the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. If you’re confused by most of what I just said, then this is the video for you! 

Unless you were taking copious notes and talking to every NPC in the main game, or you have VaatiVidya content constantly playing in the background, you might be a little lost as to what in the fingers is actually going on in the Lands Between. 

Here’s a story recap to get you caught up on the main plot beats and characters you should know before tackling Shadow of the Erdtree, as well as what questions you should be asking yourself when you get your hands on the DLC. Get ready for a ton of proper nouns, and spoilers for Elden Ring’s story.
