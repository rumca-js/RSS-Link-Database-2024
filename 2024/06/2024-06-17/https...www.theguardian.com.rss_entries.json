It\u2019s where Prada dictates what trouser shape everyone will one day be wearing and where Gucci drops the next it-bag. But as the shows got under way at the weekend an unexpected new trend was emerging: the great fashion Brexit.</p><p>Just four months after making his debut as creative director of Dunhill at London fashion week, Simon Holloway instead chose the Italian capital for the brand\u2019s spring/summer \u201925 show. On Sunday he aimed to recreate \u201cthe sense of a beautiful spring day in England\u201d by showing in a garden in Milan.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/17/the-great-fashion-brexit-why-uk-designers-are-decamping-to-milan\">Continue reading...</a>", "id": 724504, "language": "en-UK", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/17/the-great-fashion-brexit-why-uk-designers-are-decamping-to-milan", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "source_obj__id": 340, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfa707a19248b5c2d5cbe94679005754899121f/0_192_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25f6f647453a65a11d5c7c6334625374", "title": "The great fashion Brexit?

The confirmation said it was two bedrooms in a four-star beach hotel for a week in June. It was to be a validating vacation for him when he had finished his GCSEs. For any child, getting through exams is an achievement and foster children face a whole set of additional obstacles. Six weeks before our departure, and just as the GCSEs started, Jet2 told me that our accommodation was, in fact, one bedroom and one living room with a sofabed. We require two private bedrooms for obvious safeguarding reasons, but Jet2 has refused to find us alternatives. Initially, it stated that we would lose the whole cost of the holiday if we cancelled. Now it says it will refund us, or we can find different accommodation and pay the difference.

Don\u2019t mess with a Targaryen queen\u2019s children. In the case of this fiery Game of Thrones prequel, don\u2019t let your dragon gobble up Rhaenyra Targaryen\u2019s son. That was the cliff on which we were left hanging at the end of the first season \u2013 and it is sure to lead to all-out war between Rhaenyra (Emma D\u2019Arcy) and her rival Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke). Don\u2019t expect too much action in this slow-burn opener, though: there is plenty of plotting, alliance-making and world-building to set things up first. But an attention-grabbing payoff reminds us just how seriously George RR Martin\u2019s characters take the act of seeking revenge. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jun/17/tv-tonight-prepare", "id": 724506, "language": "en-UK", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jun/17/tv-tonight-prepare-for-a-fiery-war-as-house-of-the-dragon-returns", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "source_obj__id": 340, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8e4f8f24f2fb299699f4a7dc71c913cccb9c03d/413_349_5402_3241/master/5402.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=133d07a10364775050ff91ef7c102ec2", "title": "TV tonight: prepare for a fiery war as House of the Dragon returns", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
