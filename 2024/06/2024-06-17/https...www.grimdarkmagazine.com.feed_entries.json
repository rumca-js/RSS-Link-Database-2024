Brett is the first novel in his Nightfall Saga. There are a lot of fans of Peter V. Brett in the halls of Grimdark Magazine, and he has long been on my periphery as an author I would like but have yet to read. The Desert Prince is my first experience of Brett&#8217;s writing, and I regret not having picked him up sooner.

I had no prior knowledge of his earlier series in this world, The Demon Cycle, and as such, I do not believe it is essential to have read this to be able to enjoy The Desert Prince. Brett explains all the critical details of this world&#8217;s history, politics, and religion as part of the narrative of The Desert Prince. However, readers who have liked The Demon Cycle will undoubtedly be pleased with the chance to return to this epic world and learn the exploits of its next generation.
