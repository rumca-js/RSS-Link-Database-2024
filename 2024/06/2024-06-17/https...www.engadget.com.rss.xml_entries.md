<p>Apple Pay Later is kaput. The company <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/17/apple-kills-pay-later-feature-ahead-of-affirm-integration/">confirmed</a> to <em>TechCrunch</em> on Monday that it’s killing the service only two years after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-pay-later-announced-172757123.html">first announcing it at WWDC 2022</a> — and only seven months after it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-pay-later-is-available-to-everyone-in-the-us-174654047.html">became available to everyone in the US</a>.</p>
<p>The company said at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-intelligence-ai-ios-18-and-the-biggest-announcements-at-wwdc-2024-184422501.html">its developer conference last week</a> that loans through third-party service Affirm are coming to Apple Pay later this year, so the two would have been redundant. “Users in the U.S. will also be able to apply for loans directly through Affirm when they check out with Apple Pay,” the compan

<p>A live-action adaptation of <em>Totally Spies</em> is now in production at Amazon. According to a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/totally-spies-live-action-tv-series-amazon-will-ferrell-banijay-1236038247/"><em><ins>Variety</ins></em></a>, Will Ferrell is the executive producer of the live-action series based on the popular 2000s animated series from French media company Banijay Kids, formerly known as Marathon Media.</p>
<p>The live-action <em>Totally Spies</em> will follow Sam, Clover and Alex as they balance saving the world as international spies working for the agency WOOHP with tackling schoolwork and social lives as college freshmen.

<p>The US Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, says that social media should come with warning labels about its potential health impacts much like warnings on cigarettes and other tobacco products. In <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/opinion/social-media-health-warning.html">an op-ed</a> in <em>The New York Times</em>, Murthy says that social media is an “important contributor” to the teen mental health crisis.</p>
<p>“It is time to require a surgeon general’s warning label on social media platforms, stating that social media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents,” Murthy wrote. “A surgeon general’s warning label, which requires congressional action, would regularly remind parents and adolescents that social media has not been proved safe.”</p>

<p>The US government has sued Adobe and two senior company executives for allegedly deceiving consumers by hiding early termination fees and making them jump through hoops to cancel subscriptions to Adobe products.</p>
<p>The <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/adobe_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> filed by the Department of Justice on Monday accuses the Adobe of pushing consumers towards its “annual paid monthly” subscription plan without adequately disclosing that canceling the plan within the first year could result in an early termination fee. The complaint also alleges that Adobe’s early termination fee disclosures were buried in fine print or required consumers to hover over tiny icons to find them.</p>

<p>The premise of <em>A Quiet Place</em> always seemed like great fodder for a game: make too much of a racket and a blind, noise-sensitive alien will most probably kill you. Six years after the original movie hit theaters, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-quiet-place-video-game-saber-interactive-illogika-ep1t0me-2022-161214078.html"><ins>a video game spinoff</ins></a> is almost here. <em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> is coming to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S later this year.</p>
<p>Developer Stormind Games (<em>Remothered, Batora: Lost Haven</em>) has crafted a first-person horror adventure based on the movies. You'll play as a young woman who attempts to steer clear of those terrifying creatures while dealing with her inner fears and family turmoil. All you'll have to help you survive the aliens is whatever tools you can find, such as a flashlight or homemade noise detector. But as the movies and game trailer make clear, just a single noise can spell doom.</p>

That long-awaited feature should boost accessibility for the app and make it easier to listen to web pages when you're busy with something else.</p>
<p>The feature isn't supported by all web sites, but if so, you'll find &quot;Listen to this page&quot; in the three-dot menu at the top right on the Chrome app. The new function offers podcast-like controls, letting you play, pause, scrub, change playback speed and skip ahead or behind by 10 seconds. So far, it works in English, French, German, Arabic, Hindu and Spanish.</p>

<p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman, Apple’s mission to make its thinnest product ever won’t stop at the iPad Pro — the company also has plans for a skinnier Macbook Pro, Apple Watch and iPhone. Gurman says the slimmed-down iPhone — also rumored by <em>The Information </em>— <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-has-plans-for-a-thinner-iphone-macbook-pro-and-apple-watch-171137550.html">could come as early as 2025</a>, with the introduction of the iPhone 17 line.</p>

<p>Sussing out the best iPad for you can be a little more daunting than it needs to be. With the most recent refresh to its iPad lineup, Apple now sells three 11-inch tablets and two 13-inch slates, each with key differences in terms of features, specs and accessory support. (The aging iPad mini is still hanging around, too.) With the new AI (or “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-first-attempt-at-ai-is-apple-intelligence-181444846.html">Apple Intelligence</a>”) features set to arrive in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipados-18s-smart-script-uses-machine-learning-to-make-your-handwriting-less-horrible-175306533.html">next major iPadOS update</a>, some of these differences will become even more stark. If you’re looking to buy a new Apple tablet but aren’t sure which to get, let us help. We’ve tested just about every iPad ever made, including all of the models on sale today — below, we’ve broken down which ones should fit your priorities best.</p>
