I pass the 8TB drive as a virtual disk to the VM for both the host OS and all the data.

So not just something that I can stream to my phone, but being able to control players in different rooms from a central app. I have setup navidrome and like symfonium, but it's really just an app for streaming music to a display device. The way Sonos is setup really works for my house and the way we work. I really would like to keep that process the same. Sadly I haven't really been able to figure out how to do that.
