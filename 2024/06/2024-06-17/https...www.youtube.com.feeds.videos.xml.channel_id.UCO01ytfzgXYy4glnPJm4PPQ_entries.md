Elon Musk has been public enemy number one ever since he committed the sin of allowing people to speak freely on the internet. Now, the Left is using lawfare to get revenge on him. The latest attempt is a major "toxic work environment" lawsuit from former employees of SpaceX. The word "frivolous" does not even begin to describe what's happening.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Elon Musk has been public enemy number one ever since he committed the sin of allowing people to speak freely on the internet. Now, the Left is using lawfare to get revenge on him. The latest attempt is a major "toxic work environment" lawsuit from former employees of SpaceX. The word "frivolous" does not even begin to describe this thing. We'll discuss. Also, a political candidate in Texas is caught sending racist messages to himself. Chuck Schumer tries to prove that he's a normal red-blooded American, and it goes horribly wrong. And, LGBT activists in California tear down No U-Turn signs because the signs are homophobic.
