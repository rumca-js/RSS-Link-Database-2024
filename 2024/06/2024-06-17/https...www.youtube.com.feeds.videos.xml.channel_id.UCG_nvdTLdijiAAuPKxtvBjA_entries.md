In Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Jack Sparrow must find the trident of Poseidon to survive the revenge of Capitan Salazar. Unfortunately, this time Jack is always a useless drunk, so it doesn't make for an interesting watch. And the movie itself is also a very dumb, generic summer blockbuster. Which won't be good enough with future movies Disney is planning with writer of Pirates 5 as well as with Margot Robbie. So today, let's see how to avoid that.
