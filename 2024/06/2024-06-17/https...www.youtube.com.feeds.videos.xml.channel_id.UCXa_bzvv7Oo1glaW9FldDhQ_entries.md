Metal Gear Solid: Delta has been unanimously praised with recent showings, and for good reason. The faithfulness to the original MGS3 is very lovingly done here in Metal Gear Solid Delta. The gameplay trailer showcases multiple 1-for-1 scene shots, displaying just how brilliantly the Unreal Engine 5 graphics enhance the swampy jungles of the original. 

Snake’s facial expressions are phenomenally executed with this remake, with separate iris movement in the eyes and a total lack of uncanny valley. The inclusion of the overhead legacy control scheme in addition to the new over-the-shoulder ‘new style’ controls is awesome. Healing has undergone a complete redesign. Wounds will stay on Snake’s body in real-time even after healing him. It’ll be fun seeing other players’ battered versions of Snake and comparing them. Overall, Metal Gear Solid Delta looks like a stunning ode to the classic game while fixing the rough gameplay elements.

The Chinese Room has delivered a string of solid horror (or horror adjacent) titles in the past and though Still Wakes the Deep doesn’t necessarily touch some of their heights, it’s still another notch on the belt for the studio. 

Boasting an intriguing setting, Still Wakes the Deep builds a strong sense of place and atmosphere. Even though it doesn’t fulfil its setting’s potential from a horror perspective, it succeeds in telling a story that will keep you sufficiently engaged until the credits roll. It’s a pretty brief experience that is light on the gameplay side of things, but with a solid story, strong atmosphere, and excellent visuals, it’s still a game worth experiencing.
