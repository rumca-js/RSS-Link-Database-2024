		Digital identity has a critical role to play in combating money laundering, and the UK government’s Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF) urgently needs legal backing, according to trade association techUK. The group was responding to HM Treasury’s (HMT’s) consultation on enhancing the Kingdom’s anti-money laundering regulations.

On March 11, 2024, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/improving-the-effectiveness-of-the-money-laundering-regulations">HMT launched a consultation</a> to improve the effectiveness of the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017.

		British travelers to Europe may soon have to pass scrutiny from the European Union’s controversial artificial intelligence lie detector <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=iBorderCtrl">iBorderCtrl</a> or similar behavior analysis software.

The software analyzes facial movements and body gestures in order to flag suspicious behavior to immigration officers. The system could be incorporated at border checks at airports and ferry terminals as part of the EU’s upcoming border control schemes, the Entry-Exit System (EES) and European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13534215/Outrage-British-tourists-going-away-EU-countries-face-lie-detector-test-carried-a

		A network for sharing biometrics, demographics and other data about visitors, migrants and other travelers has ballooned in scope and amount of data shared, but mostly out of the watchful eye of the public, journalists, and even national regulatory authorities, according to an investigation reported by <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/migration-5-the-truth-about-the-shadowy-scheme-to-check-identities/JR4G4HTQVZDWDDYDFARDJLHYS4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RNZ</a>.

The “Migration 5” is an arrangement for sharing data of people crossing the border of any Five Eyes country: New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the United States, or the UK.

		The rules that determine how much and how a digital identity or piece of data is trusted are set by the authority of each digital ecosystem – often a national ecosystem operated by a government or a corporate ecosystem operated according to company policy. For trust to span ecosystems, however, protocols for translating and applying those rules must be established, and this is the project of the Trust Over IP Foundation. A panel on the final afternoon of KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/eic-2024">EIC 2024</a> shared ToIP’s progress and the potential it’s project could unlock.

		Bulgaria is hoping to make it easier for its citizens to travel to the European Union with a new identity card. As of Monday, Bulgarians will be able to obtain a new biometric ID that contains fingerprint and facial data.

The ID card allows its owners to travel to EU countries by using Automated Border Crossing (ABC) systems or eGates that authenticate electronic machine-readable travel documents (e-MRTD), the country’s Interior Ministry announced last week.

Bulgaria partially joined the Schengen area alongside Romania in March 2024. While the countries have lifted controls at air and sea borders, land crossings are still excluded as EU member states such as Austria say Romania and Bulgaria need to do more to prevent irregular migration.

The card’s chip was produced by a co

		The use of biometric facial recognition for large-scale surveillance and crime prevention has become widespread. According to the Panoptic Tracker by the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), there are 170 facial recognition systems in India, but only a few of them are operational.

Among the 170 systems, only 20 facial recognition systems are operational in locations such as Telangana, Delhi, and Maharashtra. The majority of the systems, more than 85 percent, are in various stages of tender bidding, implementation, procurement, and finalization.

According to the <a href="https://panoptic.in/">IFF report</a>, the central and state governments have collectively spent around 15.13 billion Indian rupees (approximately US$181 million) on these systems, with ₹7.7 billion ($
