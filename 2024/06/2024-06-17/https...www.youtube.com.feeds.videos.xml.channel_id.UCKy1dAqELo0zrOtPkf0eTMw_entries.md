Marvel’s Blade movie has lost yet another director, so what does this mean for production? Marvel Studios’ long-awaited Blade movie, seems to be cursed, as it just lost another director in Yann Demange. You probably remember director Bassam Tariq was set to direct but dropped out back in 2022. The MCU’s long gestating reboot of the Daywalker’s franchise, #Blade, has seen so many different writers touching the script, with about 5 other writers taking a pass at the vampiric story. Actor Mahershala Ali is still attached to it as the titular hero, but that secret sauce is still missing. And it seems previous Blade star Wesley Snipes has a clue on what Marvel Studios just can’t get right. Posting to Twitter, he said, “Blade, lordylordylordy. folks still lookin for the secret sauce, ridin snowmobiles in traffic, kinda rough. Daywalkers make it look easy, don’t they?”

Starfield's user reviews have taken a hit after fans spoke out against Bethesda's paid mods for the game. Starfield's "Trackers Alliance" was updated with a new quest, but Bethesda considers it a "mod" and charges $7 for it, which obviously has angered the community. Studio head Todd Howard said in an interview that they were willing to adjust as long as they're giving value to everyone, including players and mod creators. In other news, FromSoftware's Hidetaka Miyazaki doesn't think he's created his ideal fantasy RPG in Elden Ring, and would love for someone else to make that game so he can enjoy it just as a fan. And finally, a new Nintendo Direct has been announced for tomorrow, 7am PT. No, there won't be any Switch 2 news, but expect 40 minutes of trailers for new upcoming games.

## House of the Dragon Cast Explains the Season 2 Premiere's Brutal Twist

House of the Dragon Season 2 has finally arrived, and with it comes one of the most notorious moments in the history of Westeros.

HotD spoilers follow beyond this point!

In Season 2, Episode 1, "A Son for a Son," Matt Smith’s Daemon hatches the plot that leads to what has been described as the “Red Wedding” of House of the Dragon. After Rhaenyra's son Luke is killed in the Season 1 finale in a dragon chase with Alicent’s boy Aemond, Daemon seeks revenge. And this is what leads to the awful event known by fans of the George R.R. Martin book series as Blood and Cheese.
With Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy) in mourning, he hires a brutal member of the City Watch – that would be Blood – and a ratcatcher – that would be Cheese – to infiltrate the Red Keep. His orders, in the TV version anyway, are to kill Aemond (Ewan Mitchell). But when asked by Cheese what they should do if they can’t find Aemond, Daemon simply stares back at the killer… and the camera cuts to the next scene.
Indeed, what follow

Still Wakes the Deep reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC, also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

This horror game deserves credit for its fantastic art, dialogue, voiceover work, and setting. But it's frustrating to play with its nearly on-rails structure that actively scoffs at the idea of exploration. And as much as I wanted to be freaked out by it, I almost never was, trying as I might to set the mood as best as possible. It's the kind of game where I think watching someone else play through it and playing it yourself would be nearly identical experiences, and that doesn't make it easy for me to recommend.
