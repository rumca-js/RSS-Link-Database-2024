French Gates acknowledged the big step the Standford grads were taking &#8212; which included her daughter, Phoebe Gates, who earned her undergraduate degree. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot lately about transitions,&#8221; French Gates told the 20,000-person crowd. That includes her divorce three years ago from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and last month leaving her role at the Gates Foundation, which she helped launch 25 years ago, to pursue her own philanthropic efforts with a focus on family issues and women&#8217;s reproductive rights.

So it may seem strategic for startups to include AI as part of their pitches to investors. But founders and CEOs should tread carefully when talking about their company&#8217;s use of the trendy tech, according to two Seattle-area venture capitalists who spoke at the PAN-IIT Seattle 2024 Conference event in Bellevue, Wash., earlier this month. Over-branding in AI &#8220;shows you as an unserious company and unserious people,&#8221; said Vivek Ladsariya, who recently joined Pioneer Square Labs as a managing director. &#8220;Serious investors \u2014&#160;and more importantly serious customers \u2014 will&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/dont-say-ai-why-some-investors-say-startups-should-avoid-the-trendy-term/\">Read More</a>", "id": 727129, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/dont-say-ai-why-some-investors-say-startups-should-avoid-the-trendy-term", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Don\u2019t say AI: Why some investors say startups should avoid the trendy term", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-17T15:00:00+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"Worker inspects thermoplastic tubing\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/240617-composite-1260x840.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />&#8220;There&#8217;s a great future in thermoplastics.&#8221; If anyone ever does a remake of &#8220;The Graduate,&#8221; that&#8217;s how the famous advice given to Dustin Hoffman&#8217;s character about the promise of the plastics industry might be updated. And the movie&#8217;s locale just might be shifted to Spokane. At least that&#8217;s what a private-public consortium centered in Eastern Washington and North Idaho is banking on. The Advanced Aerospace Materials Manufacturing Center Tech Hub, or AAMMC, sees a great future in the development of thermoplastic composites for aircraft and spacecraft.
