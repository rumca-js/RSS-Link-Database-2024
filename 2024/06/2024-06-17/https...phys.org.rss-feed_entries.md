Moreover, the occurrence state of gas changes with the expansion of micro-fractures. In engineering practice, most coal-rock mass needs cyclic operation in the blasting excavation or mechanical drilling, and the dynamic load of coal-rock mass is cyclic impact load.

Fingerprint detection is one of the most important techniques in forensic investigation. When fingerprints are dusted with a carbon-based powder, the material will adhere to the moisture and grease left behind by the unique patterns of ridges and valleys on the perpetrator's fingertip. The resulting pattern can then be analyzed under a microscope, and compared with suspects' fingerprints.

Quantum computing is like Forrest Gump's box of chocolates: You never know what you're gonna get. Quantum phenomena—the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels—are not definite, one thing or another. They are opaque clouds of possibility, or more precisely, probabilities. When someone observes a quantum system, it loses its quantum-ness and "collapses" into a definite state.

Aristotle, who was a scientist as well as a philosopher, wrote the first detailed descriptions of what he called "cold light" more than 2,000 years ago. More recently, pioneering researchers like World War II Army veteran Emmett Chappelle and deep submergence vehicle pilot Edith Widder advanced the study of this phenomenon with novel technologies.
