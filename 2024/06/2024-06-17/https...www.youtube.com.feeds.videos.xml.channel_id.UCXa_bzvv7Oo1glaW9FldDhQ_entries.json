The faithfulness to the original MGS3 is very lovingly done here in Metal Gear Solid Delta. The gameplay trailer showcases multiple 1-for-1 scene shots, displaying just how brilliantly the Unreal Engine 5 graphics enhance the swampy jungles of the original. \n\nSnake\u2019s facial expressions are phenomenally executed with this remake, with separate iris movement in the eyes and a total lack of uncanny valley. The inclusion of the overhead legacy control scheme in addition to the new over-the-shoulder \u2018new style\u2019 controls is awesome. Healing has undergone a complete redesign. Wounds will stay on Snake\u2019s body in real-time even after healing him. It\u2019ll be fun seeing other players\u2019 battered versions of Snake and comparing them. Overall, Metal Gear Solid Delta looks like a stunning ode to the classic game while fixing the rough gameplay elements.", "id": 727439, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-5EOzsXjn8", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/E-5EOzsXjn8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Metal Gear Solid: Delta Snake Eater Is on Track to Be One of the Greatest Remakes of All Time", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-17T13:00:29+00:00", "description": "The Chinese Room has delivered a string of solid horror (or horror adjacent) titles in the past and though Still Wakes the Deep doesn\u2019t necessarily touch some of their heights, it\u2019s still another notch on the belt for the studio. \n\nBoasting an intriguing setting, Still Wakes the Deep builds a strong sense of place and atmosphere.
