<p>The science of epigenetics suggests we can pass on trauma – but trust and compassion too</p><p>Since the sequencing of the human genome in 2003, genetics has become one of the key frameworks for how we all think about ourselves. From fretting about our health to debating how schools can accommodate non-neurotypical pupils, we reach for the idea that genes deliver answers to intimate questions about people’s outcomes and identities.</p><p>Recent research backs this up, showing that complex traits such as temperament, longevity, resilience to mental ill-health and even ideological leanings are all, to some extent, “hardwired”. Environment matters too for these qualities, of course. Our education and life experiences interact with genetic factors to create a fantastically complex matrix of influence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/17/the-big-idea-can-you-inherit-memories-from-your-ancestors">Continue reading...</a>

For a while I was swiping so much I was barely thinking. Dating apps had hijacked my fingers, brain and evenings.

<p>Goalkeeper gained non-league experience while at Everton before returning home to build an international career</p><p>When Everton felt their teenage goalkeeper Jindrich Stanek needed a taste of men’s football to test himself, they searched around the north-west for a club willing to give him an opportunity. Seventh-tier Hyde United offered him the chance to gain experience and he soon learned the harsh realities of that level, making two mistakes to give away goals in the opening 45 minutes of his debut at Blyth Spartans and witnessing a teammate being sent off. Things could only get better.</p><p>Stanek made four further appearances for Hyde in 2015-16, winning the final three as he brought a touch of quality to Tameside in a depressing season for a club who went on to be relegated. His brief spell as a 19-year-old at Ewen Fields is a long way from being the Czech Republic’s No 1 at the Euros, where Stanek is poised to start against Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal on Tuesday night

<p>The founder of the Seahorse Trust explains how his life-long fascination with the enigmatic creatures helped us to understand and protect them </p><p>I saw a seahorse for the first time when I was 14. There is something very unfishlike about the way seahorses swim upright, and their constantly moving eyes – it made me feel completely in awe of them. Fifty-one years later, and that feeling has never gone away. Even now, if I’m on a dive and I see one, I find it amazing.</p><p>Seahorses are fish that don’t fit into any category; they seem like an amalgam of lots of different creatures. They have horse-like heads, kangaroo-like pouches and prehensile, monkey-like tails – which often seem to have a mind of their own – plus they can change colour like a chameleon. It’s quite remarkable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/17/i-am-so-obsessed-with-seahorses-i-had-26-tanks-full-of-them-in-my-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Film-maker Tomáš Kratochvíl follows the story of Czech-Mancunian trucker turned activist Štefan Pongo</p><p>Centring on an ordinary man with extraordinary determination, Tomáš Kratochvíl’s documentary shows how one simple video can ignite a revolutionary movement. After emigrating to the UK nearly 15 years ago, Czech Roma lorry driver Štefan Pongo built a new life for himself and his family in Manchester. At the same time, the persecution faced by his community never strayed far from Pongo’s mind. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1MH0RR/">After hearing a speech</a> in which Miloš Zeman, then the president of the Czech Republic, claimed that 90% of the Roma people were “socially unadaptable” and resistant to work, Pongo started a viral appeal online where he and countless other Roma compatriots posted selfies of themselves at their workplaces.</p><p>The appeal was straightforward, yet hugely impactful. Its aim was to battle harmful stereotypes thrust upon Roma people,
