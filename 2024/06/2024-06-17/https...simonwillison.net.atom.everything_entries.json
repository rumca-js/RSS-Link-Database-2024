But the most important reason for gofmt is that if an algorithm defines how Go source code is formatted, then programs, like goimports or gorename or go fix, can edit the source code more easily, without introducing spurious formatting changes when writing the code back. This helps you maintain code over time.</p></blockquote><p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://research.swtch.com/vgo-eng\">Russ Cox</a>", "id": 726213, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/russ-cox/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Quoting Russ Cox", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
