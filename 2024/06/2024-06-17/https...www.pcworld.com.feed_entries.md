<p>Adam loves PC gaming handhelds. The Steam Deck kicked off the trend when it dropped in 2022, but now we have more chunky gaming handhelds than we can hold. Is it too much of a good thing? He cornered <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@GamersNexus&amp;xcust=2-1-2369842-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Steve from GamersNexus</a> on the Computex show floor to hash it out.</p>



<p>Long story short: Yes, there are too many PC gaming handhelds right now&mdash;at least according to Steve, who notes that while there are plenty of innovations and unique features, it&rsquo;s all way too complicated for regular consumers who will generally default to the Steam Deck anyway. We apologize for crushing the dreams of Computex vendors.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice sued Adobe on Monday, alleging that Adobe&rsquo;s terms of service for apps like Creative Cloud and Photoshop included cancellation fees that were applied when consumers signed up for a one-year subscription.</p>



<p>&ldquo;For years, Adobe has harmed consumers by enrolling them in its default, most lucrative subscription plan without clearly disclosing important plan terms,&rdquo; the DOJ <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/adobe_complaint.pdf&amp;xcust=2-1-2369926-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">alleged</a> in its suit, filed in district court in Northern California. </p>

<p>One of the smaller, less bombastic stories to come out of Computex is that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2352755/nvidias-geforce-sff-guideline-brings-big-gpu-power-to-tiny-pcs.html">Nvidia has created a new set of SFF guidelines</a> for graphics cards that can fit within more compact builds. These small GPUs are a big deal for builders put off by the ballooning sizes of modern graphics cards.</p>



<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s standard keeps the cards under 50mm thick (2.5 slots in case terms), 304mm long, and 151mm tall&mdash;and Asus and Zephyr are now showing off the first cards that fit the new standard.</p>



<p>These SFF (&ldquo;Small Form Factor&rdquo;) cards still aren&rsquo;t as svelte as the old one- and two-slot powerhouses from back in the day, but they should open up considerably more options for builders who want to get a polygon-pushing gaming PC

<p>Intel has denied a recent news report that it has gotten to the bottom of instability issues with some 13th and 14th Gen desktop CPUs, and continues to search for the &ldquo;root cause.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Contrary to recent media reports, Intel has not confirmed the root cause and is continuing, with its partners, to investigate user reports regarding instability issues on unlocked Intel Core 13th and 14th generation (K/KF/KS) desktop processors,&rdquo; an Intel spokesman told PCWorld on Friday afternoon. &ldquo;The microcode patch referenced in press reports fixes an eTVB bug discovered by Intel while investigating the instability reports. While this issue is potentially contributing to instability, it is not the root cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>VPNs, when managed properly, are a great way to protect your privacy and keep your online activities hidden from prying eyes. But not all VPN services maintain the same security standards or take the exact same approach to user privacy.</p>



<p>How does your VPN handle your data? When the police or governments come knocking, what does your VPN do? The history of law enforcement subpoenas of VPN logs is murky to say the least. Major VPNs can get hundreds of data requests per year, but what they turn over is not so straightforward. I&rsquo;ll try to clear the water and help you understand how your data is being handled and how safe it truly is.</p>

<p>Your antivirus will protect you from many online threats, but no antivirus is perfect. Truth is, your PC can still be hacked even if you&rsquo;re using reputable security software with a solid track record.</p>



<p>When we talk about your computer possibly being &ldquo;hacked,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s exactly what we mean: a cybercriminal has gained access to your PC and compromised it in some way.</p>



<p>The hacker in question may be a criminal organization that&rsquo;s installing malware on millions of PCs (e.g., to spy on you and steal your credit card numbers), or the hacker may be an individual using a remote access Trojan (RAT) to personally spy on you through your webcam.</p>



<p>Here some common warning signs that your PC might&rsquo;ve been hacked, exposing your personal data and system resources.</p>
