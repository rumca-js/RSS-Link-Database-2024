When introduced in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Darth Maul was quickly the stand out character. With his evil demeanor, black and red makeup, and double sided lightsaber, audiences were obsessed with this new Sith Lord.  Though he was cut down too early at the end of Phantom Menace, it would be the Star Wars animated shows Clone Wars and Rebels that would give Darth Maul new life and transform him into one of the best villains in all of Star Wars.  Without the dedicated time to developing Darth Maul, he may well have been just a flash in the pan.
