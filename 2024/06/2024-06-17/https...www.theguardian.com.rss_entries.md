There should be severe consequences</p><p>We live in an age of overlapping crises, of too many red lines to count being crossed. A massacre here, an ecosystem breakdown there, shocking poverty close to home. Whenever news comes through of a boatload of desperate people drowning in the Mediterranean as they try to reach Europe from Africa, it barely registers – so it seems horribly likely that Dead Calm: Killing in the Med? will not be a landmark documentary.

<p>He remains a darling of the American right but the US Open champion has remade his image to match a retooled game</p><p>On the night before he won the US Open for a second time, Bryson DeChambeau told a gallery of reporters that he had started washing his balls in Epsom salt. No matter how carefully golf balls are manufactured, you see, there will always be errors and imperfections in the mass production of a 1.68in-diameter urethane-covered sphere with 328 dimples. Since the heavy side of an out-of-balance ball will float to the bottom in a solution of Epsom salt and water, DeChambeau has begun marking the top of each ball with a dot to ensure it’s always rolling over itself. “For most golf balls that we get, it’s not really that big of a deal,” DeChambeau explained. “I just try to be as precise as possible, and it’s one more step that I do to make sure my golf ball flies as straight as it possibly can fly, because I’m not that great at hitting it that straight.”</p><p>Not that lo

<p>When your kids are small, you can just present them with a card and some felt tips. But when they’re adolescents, everything gets much trickier</p><p>It was Father’s Day morning, and my friend and I were comparing notes on whose offspring were the least prepared: if you thought children were useless, may I introduce you to adolescents? “I couldn’t put a card and some felt-tips in front of them,” she said, “they’re teenagers; they’re not nine.” “So have they made cards?” “Nope.” I am expressly forbidden from writing about my daughter, so let’s just square her off with the statement that she is perfect in every way, and her Father’s Day efforts were second to none.</p><p>The rest of them, sheesh. My daughter’s best friend said the problem with dads is that they don’t want anything, then amended that to: they either want some speakers for £5,000 or they want a glass of water, there’s nothing in between. Then it hit her that she could get her dad some chocolates. “Does he like chocolat

Because while the high fashion – the catwalk appearances and designer togs – might be reserved for the young-gun players, there has already been a lot to note on the sidelines.</p><p>“Football managers are tactical masterminds,” says Daniel-Yaw Miller, sports correspondent at industry publication the Business of Fashion. “There’s not a single element of their preparation that is left to chance — for many of them, that includes their sartorial choices on the touchline.

<p>Our hapless arachnoid investigator bumbles through jazz age intrigue with some charm, but spinning out the slender plot gets a little tiring</p><p>There is some fun to be had in this family animation about a creepy-crawly detective – though I did wonder if it might turn out to be less entertaining for its target audience than for the grownups watching with them. It’s set in the jazz age, and the film-makers have invested plenty of loving detail into their universe, right down to the art deco end credits. Precocious seven-year-olds may spot the Agatha Christie references, and the film noir inspiration behind the purring femme fatale black widow spider who is accused of bumping off her 13th husband.</p><p>The movie’s hero is Inspector Sun (voiced by comedian Ronny Chieng), a spider with waxed moustaches and a gold-topped walking cane.

Smiling women in pastel-coloured vest tops chew the air, stretch their lips and tilt their tongues towards their perfectly formed noses.

## A Gangster’s Kiss review – lairy and sweary British crime-com goes to all the places you’d expect

<p>The escapades of this cast of colourful hard men could have been written by Jay from The Inbetweeners</p><p>It’s a time-honoured way to open a crime thriller: a body, some dodgy blokes digging a grave, and a voiceover from the protagonist teasing the journey to come, wherein we will find out how the lads got into this sticky situation. You can’t accuse A Gangster’s Kiss of not knowing the genre template, as it then transitions into another stock gambit (one more typically beloved of comedy) and we flash back to their childhoods and see mini-me versions of the characters acting in ways that foreshadow how they will turn out as grownups. Bonus points for the behaviour being oh-so-hilariously inappropriate to the age of the kid involved. If a small child saying “fanny magnet” is your jam, A Gangster’s Kiss loses no time in assuring you that you’ve come to the right place.</p><p>The plot, such as it is, concerns a young man (Charlie Clapham) who, at the behest of his entrepreneurial ma

<p>Blow to London’s fashion scene as British creatives find it makes commercial sense to move shows to Italian city </p><p>Milan men’s fashion week is where all the big Italian names converge. It’s where Prada dictates what trouser shape everyone will one day be wearing and where Gucci drops the next it-bag. But as the shows got under way at the weekend an unexpected new trend was emerging: the great fashion Brexit.</p><p>Just four months after making his debut as creative director of Dunhill at London fashion week, Simon Holloway instead chose the Italian capital for the brand’s spring/summer ’25 show. On Sunday he aimed to recreate “the sense of a beautiful spring day in England” by showing in a garden in Milan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/17/the-great-fashion-brexit-why-uk-designers-are-decamping-to-milan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It changed the accommodation for our booked trip to Crete, tailor-made for our foster son, just six weeks before departure</p><p><strong>In February, I booked a £1,868 package holiday in Crete for myself and my 16-year-old foster son through Jet2holidays. The confirmation said it was two bedrooms in a four-star beach hotel for a week in June. It was to be a validating vacation for him when he had finished his GCSEs. For any child, getting through exams is an achievement and foster children face a whole set of additional obstacles. Six weeks before our departure, and just as the GCSEs started, Jet2 told me that our accommodation was, in fact, one bedroom and one living room with a sofabed. We require two private bedrooms for obvious safeguarding reasons, but Jet2 has refused to find us alternatives. Initially, it stated that we would lose the whole cost of the holiday if we cancelled. Now it says it will refund us, or we can find different accommodation and pay the difference. Essen

<p>The Game of Thrones prequel is back – and everyone is hungry for revenge. Plus: a shocking tale of deaths in the Mediterranean. Here’s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, Sky Atlantic</strong><br />
 The first rule of Westeros? Don’t mess with a Targaryen queen’s children. In the case of this fiery Game of Thrones prequel, don’t let your dragon gobble up Rhaenyra Targaryen’s son. That was the cliff on which we were left hanging at the end of the first season – and it is sure to lead to all-out war between Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) and her rival Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke). Don’t expect too much action in this slow-burn opener, though: there is plenty of plotting, alliance-making and world-building to set things up first. But an attention-grabbing payoff reminds us just how seriously George RR Martin’s characters take the act of seeking revenge. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jun/17/tv-tonight-prepare
