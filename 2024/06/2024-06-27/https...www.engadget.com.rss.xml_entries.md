<p>Apple is finally loosening some restrictions on third-party repairs.

<p>There’s a war brewing in Hollywood and we’re not talking about how AI will inevitably kill us all by plagiarizing The Joker’s chaos plans from <em>The Dark Knight</em>. We’re talking about the popcorn bucket war.</p>
<p>The latest shot came from <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dune-2-better-than-deadpool-wolverine-popcorn-bucket-1851564691"><em>Dune </em>director Denis Villeneuve</a> in a red carpet interview in which he called the <em>Wolverine &amp; Deadpool</em> popcorn bucket “horrific” and called the <em>Dune </em>buckets “unmatchable.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Villeneuve did an impromptu interview with eTalkCTV where a reporter asked him about the feud that’s been brewing between him and <em>Deadpool </em>star Ryan Reynolds over their respective popcorn receptacles. The reporter showed Villeneuve a picture of the <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> bucket featuring the yellow Wolverine’s head and his gaping maw full of some of Orville Redenbacher’s finest. Vill

## Valve reveals the most-played games on Steam Deck

<p>Valve has added a new chart to its roster of publicly-available data: a list of the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/steamdecktopplayed"><ins>100 top-played titles on the Steam Deck</ins></a>. The information can be sorted by the past week, month, or year, and will be updated daily.</p>
<p>These charts can play a big part in game discovery on the platform, so it's worth noting that making the list isn't only about the sheer number of players. Lawrence Yang from Valve told <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187519/valve-steam-deck-top-100-games-chart"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> more about the process. "The metric we’re using to determine top-played is a combination of unique users and interest," Yang said. "<em>Hades 2</em> has only been out for a month, but so many Steam Deck players have it as one of their top played games for the entire year, that it was lifted in the rankings."</p>

<p>Sometimes as we navigate our way through the daily doom scroll that is our current news cycle, it’s nice to go back and remember how things used to be. Those times sucked too but a distraction is still a distraction. One of my favorite ways to look at the past was by going through old clips of <em>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</em> and <em>The Colbert Report </em>on <a href="https://www.cc.com/series/all-content">Comedy Central’s website</a>.</p>
<p>Paramount went on a content teardown this week and pulled old clips and episodes of its signature satire shows from the Comedy Central website, as well as content from cable channels like TV Land, CMT and the Paramount Network, according to the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/comedy-central-website-daily-show-clips-wiped-out-1235933345/">Hollywood Reporter</a>.

<p>It’s that time of year again. The Steam Summer Sale <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">is officially live</a>, offering deep discounts on thousands of games and even the Steam Deck. The sale goes until July 11, so you have a bit of time to browse and fill up that wishlist.</p>
<p>The venerable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-is-selling-the-512gb-lcd-steam-deck-for-less-than-400-185918912.html">Steam Deck is on sale</a>, with some caveats. The deals <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">only apply to the LCD model</a>, and not the newer OLED version. Also, the 256GB LCD is not on sale. That leaves the 64GB at $300 instead of $350 and the 512GB model at $382 instead of $450. Incidentally, that puts the 64GB model at the same price as the Nintendo Switch. I love the Switch, but it sure can’t run <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>

<p>The Center for Investigative Reporting, the nation’s oldest nonprofit newsroom that produces <em>Mother Jones</em> and <em>Reveal</em> sued OpenAI and Microsoft in federal court on Thursday for allegedly using its content to train AI models without consent or compensation. This is the latest in a long line of lawsuits filed by publishers and creators accusing generative AI companies of violating copyright.</p>
<p>“OpenAI and Microsoft started vacuuming up our stories to make their product more powerful, but they never asked for permission or offered compensation, unlike other organizations that license our material,” said Monika Bauerlein, CEO of the Center for Investigative Reporting, in a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.motherjones.com/press-releases/cir-sues-openai/">statement</a>. “This free rider behavior is not only unfair, it is a violation of copyright.

<p>The ISS has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/looking-back-at-25-years-of-the-iss-173155049.html">continuously operating since 1998</a> and, like all things, has been aging. The space station is due to end its orbital tenure in or around 2030. However, NASA doesn’t want the whole thing just careening into Earth’s atmosphere, throwing dangerous junk everywhere like season two of <em>Breaking Bad</em>. The agency wants a nice and controlled re-entry. That’s where SpaceX comes in.</p>

<p>YouTube has recently launched a bunch of new features for Premium subscribers, including a quick way to skip the more boring parts of a video. When users double tap on a video, it will now skip ahead to what YouTube has marked as the more interesting portions of it based on a combination of AI and viewership data. The capability is now live in the US for Android users, though it's rolling out to iOS users in the coming weeks, as well. On Android, Premium subscribers can now also watch Shorts while checking their emails, browsing social media or doing things on other apps in general with the new picture-in-picture capability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paying users will get access to the video hosting website's latest experimental features, as well. One of YouTube's newest test features is smart downloads for Shorts, which automatically saves the service's short-form videos on users' devices that they could then watch offline. In addition, Android users now have access to a conversational AI expe

<p>While there's a bunch of third-party apps and services you can use to record your Steam games, you now have a native option that's built right into the Steam client. Valve has launched its own <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording">game recorder</a> in beta, and yes, it also serves as a native recorder on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-is-selling-the-512gb-lcd-steam-deck-for-less-than-400-185918912.html">Steam Deck</a>. You can either set the feature to start recording in the background the moment you keep playing or set it to only start (and stop) recording when you press a hotkey. If you choose to record in the background, you can specify the maximum of amount of storage recordings can take. Steam will overwrite old recordings once you hit the limit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Replay capability will allow you to watch previous footage in the Steam Overlay, so you can see what you did wrong in case you lose a boss fight or take a wrong turn that gets you lost. You

<p>Twelve years on, Microsoft has finally made an Arm-powered Surface tablet that doesn’t send our reviewers into a rage. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-copilot-review-the-best-surface-tablet-ever-made-no-thanks-to-ai-160039966.html">2024 Surface Pro</a>, or the Surface Pro Copilot+, is the fastest and most efficient Microsoft tablet we’ve seen, especially when paired with its Flex keyboard. The new OLED screen is great, and its NPU allows for powerful AI features.</p>

<p>The Oversight Board has published its latest <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/2023-annual-report-shows-boards-impact-on-meta/"><ins>annual report</ins></a> looking at its influence on Meta and ability to shift the policies that govern Facebook and Instagram. The board says that in 2023 it received 398,597 appeals, the vast majority of which came from Facebook users. But it took on only a tiny fraction of those cases, issuing a total of 53 decisions.</p>
<p>The board suggests, however, that the cases it selects can have an outsize impact on Meta’s users. For example, it credits its work for influencing improvements to Meta’s strike system and the “account status” feature that helps users check if their posts have violated any of the company’s rules.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sussing out the board’s overall influence, though, is more complicated. The group says that between January of 2021 and May of 2024, it has sent a total of 266 recommendations to M
