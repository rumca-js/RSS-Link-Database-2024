</p><p>
So that's one stone-cold RPG classic, a casual action-RPG treat for co-op cat and dog lovers (honestly, the Cat Quest series is a delight), plus an open-world survival game about mauling everything you come across while playing as a massive shark.

Ubisoft is cooking up multiple Assassin's Creed game remakes, according to company CEO Yves Guillemot. And while he hasn't revealed which ones yet, the news follows reports last year that Ubisoft's much-loved Assassin's Creed Black Flag is getting the remake treatment.
</p><p>
Guillemot made the comments in an <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed">interview on Ubisoft website</a>, discussing the company's upcoming portfolio. And while it offered little in the way of surprises - Yves once again talked about generative AI NPCs, insisting they could be "more intelligent, more interactive" (and not just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-unveils-generative-ai-neo-npcs-and-the-spirit-of-peter-molyneuxs-milo-lives-on">dea

This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss the cancelled Xbox project Keystone: Microsoft's plans to launch a relatively cheap streaming console.
</p><p>Keystone popped up yesterday in an old patent which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-what-xboxs-ill-fated-cloud-gaming-console-might-have-looked-like-according-to-newly-surfaced-patent">detailed the prospective hardware in fresh detail</a>, though we have of course seen it in the wild before - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-phil-spencers-shelf-is-teasing-the-xbox-game-pass-streaming-box">on Xbox boss Phil Spencer's shelf</a>.

I went hands-on with some of the game's early levels for over an hour at a preview event in Frankfurt, and I'm genuinely impressed at how good it looks. In fact, Astro Bot is now the game I'm most looking forward to this year.</p><p>From the off, Astro Bot feels creative and fun, as you pilot a (DualSense-shaped) spacecraft around a galaxy map, with different systems and planets scattered around. Enter a system, of which only one was available in the preview, and each planet within represents a different level. Our preview included two main stages, a boss fight and

Nintendo court documents state that Donkey Kong once had a heap of other proposed names - including, unfortunately, "Kong Dong". 
</p><p>
The revelation is included in 1983 court documents from a lawsuit between Universal and Nintendo (ironically now best buddies in the theme park business with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-delay-hits-nintendo-theme-park">actual Donkey Kong lands you can visit</a>).
</p><p>
Said documents were originally scanned and placed online by gaming historian <a href="https://x.com/GamingHistorian/status/1222939644217757697">Norman Caruso</a> in 2020, and were recently resurfaced again by <a href="https://twitter.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/1803472401486758172">Supper Mario Broth</a>.

## Dragon Age: The Veilguard story progression is about enticing factions, not gathering resources

One of the most common bugbears about Dragon Age: Inquisition was the need to go find Shards - collectibles scattered across its various open-world zones you could then trade in for War Table influence. It's safe to say these aren't returning for BioWare's upcoming sequel.
</p><p>
Instead, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will focus its story progression around the world's various factions, and your success at coaxing each to your side. 
</p><p>
"The message of The Veilguard is you're not saving the world on your own &ndash; you need your companions, but you also need these factions, these other groups in the world," The Veilguard's creative director John Epler told <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/25/breaking-down-dragon-age-the-veilguards-classes-and-factions">Game Informer</a

Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shut down servers for its open-world racer The Crew</a> came as a blow to the game's community.

This fan-lead project, codenamed The Crew Revival (at least for now), currently has five members working on it. "We started pretty much as soon as Ubisoft announced the shutdown last December," team member whammy4 told Eurogamer.

Ghosts are details, which means that games have often struggled with them.
