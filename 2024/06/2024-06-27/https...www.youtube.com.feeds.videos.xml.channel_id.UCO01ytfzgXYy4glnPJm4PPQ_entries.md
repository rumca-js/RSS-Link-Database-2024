Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a judge in Atlanta was just arrested and removed from the bench after getting into a fight at a nightclub and assaulting a police officer. Again: this woman works as a judge, not a waitress at Waffle House. But, she is just a symptom of a much larger problem. We'll discuss. Also, I'll offer my preview of tonight's presidential debate. And, a guy on Twitter is roundly mocked and ridiculed after offering some unorthodox life advice to young men. As usual, the peanut gallery is wrong.

00:00 - 00:31 Opening
02:17 - 18:52 A System Run By Illiterate Imbeciles
