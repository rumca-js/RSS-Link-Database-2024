In fact, if you’re rich enough, says the US supreme court, you can now pay off state and local officials for government acts that fit your policy preferences or advance your interests. You can give them lavish gifts, send them on vacations, or simply cut them checks. You can do all of this so long as the cash, gifts or other “gratuities” are provided after the service, and not before it – and so long as a plausible deniability of the meaning and intent of these “gratuities” is maintained.</p><p>That was the ruling authored by Kavanaugh in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-108_8n5a.pdf">Snyder v United States</a>, a 6-3 opinion issued on Wednesday, in which the supreme court dealt the latest blow to fede

<p>The Descendants of Monticello shifts focus from Thomas Jefferson to Robert Hemmings, his enslaved teen valet</p><p>In his 1981 <a href="https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/inaugural-address-1981">inaugural address</a>, Ronald Reagan gazed out at the magnificent vista of Washington DC. “At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand,” the new US president said. “Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man, George Washington, father of our country. A man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly. He led America out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood. Off to one side, the stately memorial to Thomas Jefferson.”</p><p>Come the Fourth of July, amid pageantry and fireworks, Washington and Jefferson will be lauded again for delivering independence from the British crown. Less will be said about the role of the men, women and children they enslaved in the US creation myth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian

<p>This coming-of-age debut set in an impoverished Scottish coastal town is exuberantly memorable</p><p>The prose in Tom Newlands’ debut novel is glorious, managing the feat of being both muscular and airy at the same&nbsp;time. But it is first and foremost the&nbsp;landscape that he stakes out that grabs you by the throat. Only Here, Only Now<em> </em>is set amid the “rubbly ground”, “brambles and bins”, discarded syringes and “stamped on cans” of the fictional Muircross, a gritty, grotty post-industrial town on Scotland’s Firth of Forth. The year is 1994 and the mood in Muircross is hopeless: the pits have closed, and nothing has moved in to replace them. For 14-year-old Cora, though, the outlook is somewhat different. She has no love for the town she’s lived her life in – as far as she can see, it’s “a manky wee hellhole sat out by itself on a lump of coast the shape of a chicken nugget, surrounded by pylons and filled with moonhowlers and old folk and seagulls the size of ironing

<p>After bleak beginnings, our campaign united a formidable group of parliamentarians from across the political spectrum</p><p>In late 2012 I had a call from John Shipton, Julian Assange’s father. I had done some advocacy on the Assange case for the Australian Lawyers Alliance. John wanted to know if I would run Julian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/18/julian-assange-wikileaks-senate-victory">bid to be elected to the Senate in the 2013</a> federal election. From that time on I have worked with John, Julian’s brother, Gabriel Shipton, the lawyer Steve Kenny and others to help bring an end to the US pursuit of Assange for publishing material which clearly implicated that nation in war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our work morphed into an Australian Assange campaign.</p><p>The Australian political environment has changed enormously since I began campaigning for Assange 11 years ago. Then, the Labor government of Julia Gillard not only showed no sympathy for Assa
