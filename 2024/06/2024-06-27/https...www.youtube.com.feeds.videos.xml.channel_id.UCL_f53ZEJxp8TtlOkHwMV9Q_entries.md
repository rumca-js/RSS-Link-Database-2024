Dr. Jordan Peterson sits down with trauma surgeon and whistleblower, Dr. Eithan Haim. They discuss the Texas Children’s Hospital, their illegal continuation of gender affirming care, the pathology and lies attached to the treatments, and why Dr. Haim blew the whistle when so many in his field remain silent (or worse, lie).

Dr. Haim is a General and Trauma Surgeon in Greenville, Texas. He recently finished his general surgery training at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, where he was a resident from 2018 to 2023. During this time, he helped expose Texas Children’s Hospital, the largest children’s hospital in the world, for lying to the public about the existence of their pediatric sex change program.
