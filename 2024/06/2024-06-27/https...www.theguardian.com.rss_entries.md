Ferran Torres is sitting at the home ground of tiny SV Aasen 1928 laughing about how Lamine Yamal should be illegal, playing darts with Phil Foden and being David Villa when he is asked about the man about to stand before him and his Spain teammates. “If the last one had to go in off the post, the next one’s going to need three lots of curl on it to beat ‘Mama’,” he says. “You have to visualise it, believe it. You need a clear chance too; we were watching him last night and he’s amazing.”</p><p>Mama is Giorgi Mamardashvili, the 6ft 6in Georgia goalkeeper who has made more saves than anyone.

This is in line with domestic trends: in Europe’s top five leagues, the amount of free-kicks in the final third that are shot at goal has dropped from 24.6% in 2008-09 to 18.8% in 2022-23.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/27/euro-2024-group-stage-numbers-statistics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The oil major’s net zero plans have made it a sector leader but have yet to win over investors while fossil fuels are booming</p><p>Grand corporate strategies are launched in weighty declarations by chief executives who fancy themselves as visionaries. That was how Bernard Looney, the then chief executive of BP, did it back in February 2020 when he said the company would get serious about cutting greenhouse gas emissions and investing in renewables. “The direction is set. We are heading to net zero. There is no turning back,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/12/bp-sets-net-zero-carbon-target-for-2050">Looney told his City audience</a>.</p><p>By contrast, the watering down of ambition tends to happen in increments. Thus, when Looney last year scrapped BP’s aim to reduce hydrocarbon output by 40% by 2030, versus 2019’s level, in favour of a 25% cut, he claimed the change was a case of “leaning in” to the same strategy, just in the new circumstance of a world tha

He had already survived one assassination attempt in Turin before his multiple affairs finally caught up with him in Genoa, where he died at the age of 38 (or 42), possibly murdered by the brothers of a woman he had seduced.</p><p>In his lifetime, Stradella was much admired; he was credited with inventing the form of the concerto grosso, and Handel borrowed from his works in his Israel in Egypt.

In many ways, it’s a strange fear to raise about Labour, yet the Conservatives have been doing it for weeks now.

And even those two governments still faced hostile newspapers, sceptical civil servants, suspicious big business, millions of instinctively rightwing voters in the most prosperous regions and the pro-Tory bias of much of the establishment.</p><p>For the Conservatives to warn about the dangerous monopoly power of a Labour “supermajority”, having sought and enjoyed such power much more often themselves, is shameless even by their standards.

Byrne sued the FA for about £3m in December at a time when he was still representing Southgate, but the Guardian has learned the matter was resolved before the end of this season after several private arbitration hearings.</p><p>Byrne was suing for damages with a claim that the FA breached its contract with one of his companies, 1966 Entertainment, by terminating a deal to manage England players’ commercial appearances while on international duty that was due to run until 2030. The dispute has rumbled on since 2018, when the FA sought an early termination from the 12-year deal given to Byrne, who previously represented A-list stars including Pelé and David Beckham before becoming S

I played golf in the past and took it up again in 2021. By 2023, I was vice captain of the club.”

But more than that: by talking to people and visiting places involved with each decade of that century, Kent brings the&nbsp;past alive. From its beginnings in the small village in the Black Sea where his family came from, this is personal as well as public history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/27/the-endless-country-by-sami-kent-review-turkey">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The history of exploration has mostly been told through the eyes of white men but a new book aims to remember the people of colour and women who were also integral</p><p>At the top of the world the colour line thawed and melted away. In 1909 Robert Peary, a white naval officer, and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/the-legacy-of-arctic-explorer-matthew-henson">Matthew Henson</a>, an African American son of sharecroppers, survived ice storms, back-breaking marches and sheer exhaustion to plant the Stars and Stripes at the north pole.</p><p>But once the pair set foot back on American soil, the gravity of Jim Crow segregation reasserted itself. Leary was hailed as a hero by the press. Henson went mostly unsung – and was soon cast aside by Peary himself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/27/the-explorers-american-history-amanda-bellows">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 20-year-old is England’s future but he is not playing like someone who can help them in the present at Euro 2024</p><p>Your best players are still your best players. Your best team is not necessarily the one with all the best players on the pitch. Unfortunately England are in that place again. Much like Sven-Göran Eriksson failing to utilise Michael Carrick at the 2006 World Cup, or Roy Hodgson putting Wayne Rooney in his midfield at Euro 2016, Gareth Southgate has fallen into a familiar trap. His tactics are leaden, his starting XI is unbalanced and one of his biggest mistakes – being seduced into fitting too many similar types into a one-paced attack – has made England by far the hardest team to watch at Euro 2024.</p><p>The good news, though, is that there is time to fix England before their last-16 tie in Gelsenkirchen.

<p>Invoking philosophy, womanhood and religion, the Delhi- and London-based artist turns material objects into something truly human</p><p>When Bharti Kher talks about her sculptures, she gives them pronouns. For two decades, the British-born artist, who lives between Delhi and London, has been making the most startling works to investigate the female body and all of them have become characters in their own right. As she puts it, “my sculptures are alive – they run around the gallery at night when we’re all asleep.”</p><p>“I am an animist,” Kher tells me. Central to her work is the ancient belief in universal consciousness and in the potential of all material. This openness to the beyond infuses the survey show – part retrospective, part new commission – she has opened at Yorkshire Sculpture Park (YSP) near Wakefield. Taken as a whole, the exhibition describes a most restless mind.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/article/2024/jun/27/bharti-kher-alchemies-yorkshire-scu

<p>At its best, this is the finest show on TV. But the new season feels half finished, wastes its best actors and ends maddeningly. Only two episodes are knockouts</p><p>I am going to be hard on The Bear, because when the show is flying, it really is wonderful television. If the first season cooked up a solid base for the drama, returning troubled chef Carmen Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) to The Beef, the hectic Chicago sandwich shop owned by his recently deceased brother Mikey (Jon Bernthal), the second season refined it beautifully. Few shows earn the privilege of having episodes that become widely known by their titles, but season two’s Forks and Fishes did just that. They were special, inventive and shaped the sometimes operatic emotional register of the series into clever, compelling drama. Little wonder it has become such a pop culture phenomenon, churning out superstars quicker than plates on the pass.</p><p>As a result, it returns for a third season under another level of expe

<p>If we want the kind of fair, functioning state Britain saw post-1945, we need to take on the economic powers that wrecked it</p><p>We are about to return to normal politics. After 14 years of Tory corruption and misrule, a Labour government will put this country back on track. Justice and decency will resume, public services will be rebuilt, our global standing will be restored, we will revert to a familiar state. Or so the story goes.</p><p>What is the “normal” envisaged by pundits and politicians of the left and centre? It is the most anomalous politics in the history of the world. Consciously or otherwise, they hark back to a remarkable period, roughly 1945 to 1975, in which, in certain rich nations, wealth and power were distributed, almost everyone could aspire to decent housing, wages and conditions, public services were ambitious and well-funded and a robust economic safety net prevented destitution.

<p>The intent of greening up its tournament, while undoubtedly sincere in corners of the organisation, is being undermined</p><p>Didier Deschamps wasn’t amused. <em>Les Bleus</em> had had to fight hard <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/17/austria-france-euro-2024-match-report">to see off an excellent Austria side</a> in the evening game and needed to rest.

The 180-kilometre trip had taken some three hours, when a 30-40-minute flight from Düsseldorf to Paderborn would have allowed Deschamps’ players to be in their beds considerably earlier. Deschamps kept his thoughts to himself, however.

As a way of packing in flavour and colour, however, I wonder if herbs are the shot we’re not taking. Soft herbs – mint, parsley, basil – work well in light sponges, muffins and creams (and ice-creams), while hardy ones – rosemary, oregano, thyme – hold their own in more robust breads and bakes. Have a play and, if you’re new to the game, you’ll wonder why it took you so long to warm up.

<p>A newsreader cracks a dodgy joke and his life implodes in Steven Moffat’s new series. Plus: Paul Whitehouse on great TV sketch shows. Here’s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, ITV1</strong> <br />
 A juicy swipe at cancel culture, which writer Steven Moffat swears isn’t based on real recent cases. The drama follows white, middle-aged, trusted national news anchor Douglas (Hugh Bonneville) whose career is about to go up in flames, thanks to a viral social media post about a sexist joke he made at a wedding. Things get worse when his younger, savvier co-host Madeline (Karen Gillan) reshares the post. With his boss (Ben Miles) telling him to be “balanced, boring and bland” and his newspaper editor wife (Alex Kingston) knowing how these things play out (“Delete these messages – I work with people who hack your phone!”), can Douglas avoid being cancelled? <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jun/27/tv-tonight-hu
