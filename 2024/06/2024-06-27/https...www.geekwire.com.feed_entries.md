Maria Cantwell and other VIPs a peek at the company&#8217;s Project Kuiper satellite factory, where thousands of spacecraft are to be manufactured for a global broadband network. Today&#8217;s festivities included remarks by state and local officials as well as a ribbon-cutting ceremony &#8212; but access to sensitive areas of the 172,000-square-foot facility was limited due to concerns about confidentiality and export control requirements. The factory, which quietly began operations in April, serves as the manufacturing hub for Amazon&#8217;s satellite project. Work is also being done at Project Kuiper&#8217;s 219,000-square-foot headquarters in nearby Redmond.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/vips-amazon-project-kuiper-satellite-factory-kirkland/">Read More

The former owners of such machines as a Decsystem 2020 mainframe, an Altair microcomputer, and a first-generation Raspberry Pi, all contacted GeekWire to inquire about the intentions of executors of the late Microsoft co-founder&#8217;s estate. Allen&#8217;s estate announced this week that it was closing for good the 12-year-old museum that Allen built as a showcase for his personal collection of rare computing technology and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/they-gave-machines-to-living-computers-for-preservation-but-museums-closure-is-

The FTC&#8217;s suit, filed in April in U.S. District Court in Seattle, alleges that Doxo used deceptive ads and misleading web designs to make people believe they were paying billers directly, instead saddling them with unwanted fees and tricking them into signing up for its service. Doxo&#8217;s June 24 motion to dismiss the case disputes each of the FTC&#8217;s claims, and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/doxo-fires-back-at-ftc-lawsuit-asserting-that-it-centers-on-a-disagreement-about-font-size/">Read More</a>
