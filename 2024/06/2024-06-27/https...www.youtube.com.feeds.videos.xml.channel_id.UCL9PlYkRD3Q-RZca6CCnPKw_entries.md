A senior treasury official is making it rain – in embarrassing disclosures – about what “a mess” the Biden administration really is. Senior Advisor for the Department of Treasury, Jonathan Dixon, told our investigative journalist that the Biden Administration chose a Deputy Secretary of Treasury with 'bad ideas, bad instincts, and failed [economic] initiatives' because he is young and black.

- “He [Wally Adeyemo, Deputy Secretary of Treasury] really feels like they were just rummaging in a bag and they were like, ‘cool, you kind of fit what we need.’” - Jonathan Dixon, Senior Advisor, Department of Treasury

- “I guess she [Janet Yellen, Secretary of Treasury] was like, the optics are, I’m an old white lady. I’m going to choose a young black guy… it adds to this mandate the administration had to bring in as many diverse voices as possible.” -Jonathan Dixon, Senior Advisor, Department of Treasury
