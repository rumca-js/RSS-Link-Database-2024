Long before internet bandwidth allowed you to work online, there were services dedicated to providing that all-important third copy in the backup triad: the original data, a copy of the data, and a copy of the data in a remote location. The hallmark of these services are client apps that upload (and restore if necessary) data to from the remote server farm. </p>

<p>Recording your video game sessions isn&rsquo;t exactly a new idea. It&rsquo;s the entire basis of Twitch and its countless game streamers, both professional and aspirational. But game streaming requires a collection of special tools and techniques if you want to stand out.</p>



<p>Or, at least, it used to. Now, with its latest beta update, Steam will basically <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording&amp;xcust=2-1-2379232-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">do it all for you</a>. Steam has long been able to take screenshots and stream game sessions around a local network, but this new feature is laser-focused on recording and sharing your experiences.</p>

<p>Most gamers know all too well how much of a letdown it is to have just finished a riveting gaming session only to have to wear the physical wounds of that time well spent. Wrist pain, or in the worst-case, carpal tunnel syndrome, are two offenders that can put a dampener on any future fun.</p>



<p>In fact, one gamer I know has had the latter problem so badly of late, he&rsquo;s actually been forced to forgo sessions of his favorite <em>Diablo IV</em>, which ordinarily involves lots of clicking and swiping, for more subdued tinkles in the action-adventure game <em>Octodad</em>. Oh the indignity of it all!</p>



<p>But seriously, if you&rsquo;re getting a sore wrist after gaming, it&rsquo;s time to take a more existential view of your gaming mouse and see it for what it really is &mdash; completely unsuitable for you, no matter how shinny or blinged-out it is, o

<p>One benefit of a gaming PC over a gaming laptop? All those extra ports that let you connect all kinds of peripherals and devices. Even the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407493/best-gaming-laptops.html">best gaming laptops</a> fall short in this area, which is a shame because all those ports can be useful for gaming and streaming.</p>



<p>And if your gaming laptop doubles as a workstation? Those extra ports can boost productivity and make your life easier.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s where <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">a <strong>docking station</strong> comes into play</a>.
