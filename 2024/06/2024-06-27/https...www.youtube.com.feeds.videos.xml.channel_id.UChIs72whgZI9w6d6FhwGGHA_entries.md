We dive into fan bearing differences with Noctua's Jakob Dellinger to have an engineering discussion. For our simplified version of the fan bearings topic, we focus on common misconceptions (particularly in marketing for fluid-dynamic bearings, or FDB, and hydro-dynamic bearings). This also covers some basic differences of ball bearings, sleeve bearings vs. "fluid-dynamic bearings" -- or what we're using to refer to groove-based fluid dynamic bearings in particular.

We made this video about how ball bearings (and grooved bearings) are made! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUtEzjrF-To
