<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So it is my understanding that the docker service runs as root. I have verified that the permissions for the path to my letsencrypt certs is 744 all the way through, just to rule everything I can out.

## Sort of self hosted email?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry if this is the wrong sub. I had my domain setup years ago at mydomain.com. Then they screwed up my account, so I moved it to GoDaddy (I know...). I was using the catch all by creating unique email addresses at every site I went to. If I started getting spam from a particular site, I would just forwarded it to a non-domain email. Example, my <a href="mailto:yoursite@mydomainname.com">yoursite@mydomainname.com</a> would be the email for <a href="http://www.yoursite.com">www.yoursite.com</a>. And everything got forwarded to my gmail account.</p> <p>Recently they dropped catch all addresses. They said they were retiring something, but you had to dig deep to see they were dropping catch-alls.</p> <p>What options do I have from here? Can I setup google to handle my catchall emails some how? I've paid for the GoDaddy individual account for the month, but I'm not a big fan of paying extra for something that was already included in my original services.<

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Howdy,</p> <p>I'm looking for a time tracker with a mobile app that will automatically create events in Google Calendar based on the time and activity tracked. I am currently using Kimai and very happy with it, but this feature is missing. I can't find any self hosted options, so willing to entertain a non-self-hosted solution. </p> <p>I have seen many time trackers that &quot;integrate&quot; with Google only in one direction - they &quot;suck in&quot; your calendar events to view side by side your tracked activity; I am looking for something that will integrate the other way around - populate Google calendar based on the tracked activities. </p> <p>Any leads are most welcome. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/i82register"> /u/i82register </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dpgyx1/time_tracker_to_google_calendar/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://w

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all,</p> <p>I have Guacamole set up with postgresql via Docker. I was unable to find documentation specific to adding custom extensions to the guacamole-client container. I attempted to map the location of the custom branding.jar extension on my host to the location of the extensions directory in the image, but received permissions errors among others. I also attempted to use the EXTENSIONS env variable, but that did not work either. I've also tried manually copying the file to the directory using a custom Dockerfile</p> <p>Is this supported? Is there another way I should be doing this?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> <p>For reference, here is the relevant compose:</p> <p>guacamole: image: guacamole/guacamole:latest container_name: guacamole environment: # Guacd connection settings GUACD_HOSTNAME: guacd GUACD_PORT: 4822</p> <pre><code> # PostgreSQL settings POSTGRESQL_HOSTNAME: postgresql POSTGRESQL_PORT: 5432 POSTGRESQL_DATABASE: guacamole_db POS
