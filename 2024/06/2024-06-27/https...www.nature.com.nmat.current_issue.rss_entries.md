<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 27 June 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01933-w">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01933-w</a></p>The development of n-type organic semiconductors (OSCs) has been held back due to stability issues. Here the authors report that vitamin C improves both the performance and stability of n-type OSCs and devices.
