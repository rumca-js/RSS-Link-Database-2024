Today, we chat with Luke Hawker about his vast experience in Middle-earth and filmmaking over the past 25 years!  Not only has he been in front of the camera under prosthetics and in motion capture, but he also works in creating effects and props!  In our long chat, we talk about his time on The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, Rings of Power, plus other films like Godzilla x Kong and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes!  Luke also shares funny stories from the set, like goofing off with Jed Brophy and getting tossed around by Ismael Cruz Córdova.

Deep within the heart of Mount Doom, where the heat of the flame saturates the air, thick like the very magma it erupts from, lies the Dark Lord's forge: Sammath Naur. Here, within the Cracks of Doom, Sauron wove his dark magic to craft a weapon from the very fires of the earth itself—a weapon meant to dominate all of Middle-earth.

FEATURES:
Materiality: Polystone & Polyurethane;
7.5 inches tall;
Depicts Sauron as he forges The One Ring seen in The Fellowship of the Ring;
Sculpted by Luke Hawker, who helped create many of Middle-earth’s make-up effects and prosthetics for the film trilogy.
