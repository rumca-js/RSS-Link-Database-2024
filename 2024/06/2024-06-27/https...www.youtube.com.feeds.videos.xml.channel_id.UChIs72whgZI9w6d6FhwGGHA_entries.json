For our simplified version of the fan bearings topic, we focus on common misconceptions (particularly in marketing for fluid-dynamic bearings, or FDB, and hydro-dynamic bearings). This also covers some basic differences of ball bearings, sleeve bearings vs. \"fluid-dynamic bearings\" -- or what we're using to refer to groove-based fluid dynamic bearings in particular.\n\nWe made this video about how ball bearings (and grooved bearings) are made! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUtEzjrF-To\nWatch our video about beat frequency noises, also featuring Jakob! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ia_FZcthQ\nWatch our \"Forbidden Interview\" with Jakob of Noctua last year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82LZkglNiQ0\nWatch our video (also featuring Jakob) about Noctua's pressure scan results and new Noctua NH-D15 G2: https://www.", "id": 779839, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op3RHX0ijDk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "source_obj__id": 428, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/op3RHX0ijDk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Fan Bearing Differences: Fluid Dynamic, Ball, Hydro Dynamic, & Sleeve Explained, ft.
