		An investigative report has demonstrated that irregularities persist in elections in Africa despite the governments presenting election technology such as biometrics registration and verification systems as some sort of a panacea for fraud. A response from Laxton, the country’s biometric voter registration technology supplier, refutes many of the central points of the report.

The report, which is the second in a series, specifically looks at the case of Mozambique where results have been reportedly truncated despite a biometric voter registration system being in place since 2008.

The system has been presented to the public as a major step towards guaranteeing the transparency of polls in the country.

		Google is trying to “investigate the investigator,” Texas says in a court filing opposed to the search giant’s deposition request in a biometric data privacy lawsuit. Granting the request would set a precedent that would cripple the state’s ability to address public harms, its attorneys say.

<a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/klpynngeavg/Google-motion-compel-Texas-deposition.pdf">Google’s motion</a> (via Reuters) states that Texas waited for 20 years to enforce the law, and seeks “astronomical” compensation.

<a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/egpbooyndvq/Texas-opposition-Google-deposition.pdf">The response</a> opposing Google’s motion argues that as the company makes no counter-claim against the state, any other investigations or enfor

		Biometric non-profit organization Simprints has received its latest Global Impact Grant from Cisco that will help make its face biometrics open source.

The company, which uses biometric verification for humanitarian aid distribution, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/simprints-plans-to-make-its-biometric-id-open-source-for-greater-social-impact">announced</a> in March that it plans to release a full open-source stack for its fingerprint identification technology by the end of this year. The move should make it easier for ministries of health, non-governmental and other organizations to use their tools and reach the people that need help most, according to Simprints CEO Toby Norman.

		In contrast to the trend of placing fingerprint sensors at the bottom of the screen, Samsung's foldable smartphones have retained the side button biometric scanner.

However, a recent <a href="https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Samsung-Rollables-and-Foldables-with-Full-Screen-Fingerprint-Sensors.pdf">Samsung patent</a> suggests a departure from this design, indicating the upcoming series of foldable and rollable smartphones may feature a full-screen fingerprint sensor.

The patent, brought to attention by <a href="https://x.com/xleaks7/status/1806290512095199445?t=x47xOv96hj7SrJ7uAfGnsg&amp;s=19">xleaks7</a> (David Kowalski) and <a href="https://thenerdstash.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-full-screen-fingerprint-sensor/">The NerdStash</a>, de
