<p>The company best known for RStudio, the leading integrated development environment (IDE) for R programmers, has quietly launched a “next-generation” IDE designed specifically for both R and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3204016/what-is-python-powerful-intuitive-programming.html">Python</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/positron" rel="nofollow">Positron IDE</a> is available in public beta as of today for macOS, Windows, and Linux.</p><p>Created by Boston-based Posit PBC, formerly RStudio, Positron is based on Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3666488/what-is-visual-studio-code-microsofts-extensible-code-editor.html">Visual Studio Code</a>. Users of VS Code will likely find Positron’s look and feel rather familiar, with panels for writing code and viewing code output, consoles and terminals, and an activity bar at the far left offering options for file navigation, version control, debugging, and extensio

<p>Microsoft and its hardware partners recently launched its Copilot+ PCs, powered by Arm CPUs with built-in neural processing units. They’re an interesting redirection from the previous mainstream x64 platforms, focused initially on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Arm processors and running the latest builds of Microsoft’s Windows on Arm. Buy one now, and it’s already running the 24H2 build of <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1615662/windows-11-a-guide-to-the-updates.html">Windows 11</a>, at least a couple of months before 24H2 reaches other hardware.</p><p>Out of the box, the Copilot+ is a fast PC, with all the features we’ve come to expect from a modern laptop. Battery life is excellent, and Arm-native benchmarks are as good as, or in some cases better than, most Intel or AMD-based hardware. They even give Apple’s M2 and M3 Arm processors a run for their money. That makes them ideal for most common development tasks using <a href="https://www

<p><em>Threading</em> refers to the practice of executing programming processes concurrently to improve application performance. While it's not that common to work with threads directly in business applications, they're used all the time in Java frameworks. As an example, frameworks that process a large volume of information use threads to manage data. Manipulating threads or CPU processes concurrently improves performance, resulting in faster, more efficient programs.</p><p>This article introduces you to some basics of traditional Java threads and thread execution in the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3272244/what-is-the-jvm-introducing-the-java-virtual-machine.html">Java virtual machine</a>.
