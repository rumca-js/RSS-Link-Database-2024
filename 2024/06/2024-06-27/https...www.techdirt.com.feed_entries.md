Meta is actually making moves to live up to its promise to integrate Threads into the open ActivityPub standard used by a variety of “fediverse” platforms such as Mastodon and Pixelfed. It’s a fundamental boost to the concept of protocols over platforms, but it’s still not entirely clear how “open” Meta is really going to [&#8230;]

Well, we&#8217;ll see how long ShotSpotter/SoundThinking will keep making that New York money. The outlook is not good. A lot of this will depend on how well the NYPD can defend the useless product it&#8217;s spending millions on, but at the end of the day, the city still holds the purse strings and it has [&#8230;]

In the wake of a Supreme Court case built on grifters peddling nonsense evidence, it&#8217;s only fitting that some media reporting is buying into the same fantasy-land narrative at the heart of the case. You would hope that professional journalists would do better, but apparently that’s too difficult. Earlier this week, we covered the Murthy [&#8230;]

You just can&#8217;t tell Florida &#8220;no,&#8221; which is a bit ironic. The state obviously feels it can say &#8220;no&#8221; to all sorts of things, even if doing so means violating the Constitution. Another dumbass bill written by dumbass legislators and signed into law by the state&#8217;s dumbass governor, Ron DeSantis, continue to bleed money from [&#8230;]

Paramount (CBS) Corporation this week simply erased decades of music journalism in the blink of an eye. Last year the company shut down MTV News and fired all its staff as part of a &#8220;strategic realignment.&#8221; This week, without warning, the company deleted the entirety of the MTV News archives, erasing decades of music journalism [&#8230;]

[screaming at my mute laptop screen]: WHO GOT TO YOU This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve felt this way. In 2022, the Fifth Circuit got a decision very right. It said it was very fucking definitely a rights violation to arrest a journalist for publishing information she had received from a law enforcement source. Rather [&#8230;]
