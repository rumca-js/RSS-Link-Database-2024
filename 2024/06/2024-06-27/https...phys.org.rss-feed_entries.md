Despite gaining a bad rap in mainstream media in recent years, nanoparticles have been successfully used for decades in targeted drug delivery systems. Drug molecules can be encapsulated within biodegradable nanoparticles to be delivered to specific cells or diseased tissues. However, blood flow dynamics can significantly affect the nanoparticle's ability to bind at the target site and stay adhered long enough for the drug to be released.

The field of synthetic biology, the science of manipulating biology, has a lot of "cooks in the kitchen," which has both helped it flourish and made it unusually difficult to create a cohesive, consistent curriculum for students at every level of study. Each discipline involved—from chemical engineering to ethics—has a unique approach to teaching and literature, which creates inconsistencies between what scientists learn.

The bottom of the ocean is not hospitable. There is no light; the temperature is freezing cold; and the pressure of all the water above will literally crush you. The animals that live at this depth have developed biophysical adaptations that allow them to survive in these harsh conditions. What are these adaptations and how did they develop?

Plants are powerhouses of molecular manufacturing. Over the eons, they have evolved to produce a plethora of small molecules—some are beneficial and valuable to humans, while others can be deadly. For years, a good way for scientists looking for new medicines to distinguish beneficial plant-derived molecules from harmful ones has been through a scientific sniff test—dab a bit of the molecule at one end of a petri dish and drop tiny nematode worms (C. elegans) at the other, then wait to see if the chemically sensitive worms move toward or away from the compound in question, a process known as chemotaxis.

The study focuses on the so-called Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a low-pressure trough near the equator whose position and intensity changes seasonally with the position of the sun. Trade winds from the northern and southern hemispheres meet here. This results in heavy cloud formation and heavy rainfall. To analyze how the ITCZ has changed over the past 30,000 years, researchers use the stable oxygen isotope δ18O in calcareous deposits in cave systems on land and deposits of calcareous organisms on the ocean floor.

Engineering proteins for desirable traits has been the holy grail of modern biotechnology. For example, the food industry can benefit from engineered enzymes which have the ability to enhance biochemical reactions at higher temperatures, as compared to natural enzymes. This can save valuable resources such as labor, money, and time. However, the process of arriving at a functional protein of interest with the desired trait presents significant challenges.

Weeds are a pesky irritant for most home gardeners, but in large agricultural settings, weeds can pose an especially deadly problem. For example, Amaranthus palmeri, known as Palmer's pigweed, has evolved in many areas to be completely resistant to modern herbicides, enabling it to take over fields of corn, soybeans, and other important crops. To make pigweed susceptible to herbicides again, you would need to change its genetics.

This fundamental chemical reaction takes place in every combustion engine, whether it runs on gasoline, petrol, or kerosene. In theory, this reaction can be reversed: with the addition of (renewable) energy, previously released CO2 can be converted back into a (synthetic) fuel.
