When the USS Charlotte emerges for the first time in eighty years after a tropical storm, Noah’s friends visiting the island insist for them all to do a once-in-a-lifetime dive on the newly discovered wreck before it’s handed over to the authorities. The dream dive rapidly turns into a nightmare as they become trapped in the darkness of the Charlotte’s interior, thirty meters down and with a dwindling air supply. And then they discover that they are not alone.

Directed by Joachim Hedén (Breaking Surface), the film stars Kim Spearman (As I Am), Jack Parr (“Peaky Blinders”), Alexander Arnold (Yesterday), Erin Mullen (“Midsomer Murders”), Arlo Carter (“Doc Martin”), and Julian Sands (A Room with a View).

You'll need to scavenge and rebuild your mobile castle as it takes damage from attackers along the way. You'll start small before eventually recruiting a larger crew and building yourself into a giant, intimidating fortress on two (or more) legs. It's in development for PC.
