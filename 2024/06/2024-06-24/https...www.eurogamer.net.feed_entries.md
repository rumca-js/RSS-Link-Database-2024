High-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has been ousted from Midnight Society, the game development studio he co-founded in 2021, after new allegations relating to his much-publicised Twitch ban surfaced late last week.
</p><p>
Beahm was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-banned-by-twitch">permanently banned from Twitch</a> in the summer of 2020 - a year into a two-year exclusivity contract with the company - but neither party has ever revealed why. The closest Twitch came to an explanation was a statement shared at the time of the ban, saying it takes "appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service... regardless of status or prominence in the community." In August 2021, Beahm announced he was suing Twitch over the ban - but th

Three thoughts struck me after my first encounter with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>'s electrifying Divine Beast Dancing Lion boss: "WHAT?", "<em>Ouch</em>", and, dimly, "What <em>is</em> going on under there?". And one kindly modder has now helpfully answered that last question by derobing the thing and giving us all a peek at how the sausage is made (spoilers: no sausage is involved, but there are some Dancing Lion-related spoilers ahead so proceed with caution).
</p><p>
For the uninitiated, the Divine Beast Dancing Lion is one of the Elden Ring DLC's earliest major boss encounters and is found hanging out at the top of the Belurat tower settlement. It's an impressive sight too; a twirling, soaring, gnashing creation inspired by (as its name strongly

Scorched Caldera, on the other hand, is a "vast volcanic crater that you must terraform into a life-filled freshwater lake". </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/terra-nils-first-major-update-vita-nova-is-available-now">Read more</a></p>

As we've already covered, Bethesda did a creditable job in bringing performance options to the Xbox Series X rendition of the game, but the junior Xbox didn't get the same treatment. We pointed out that this was a shame at the time, and the mods appear to suggest that Series S could have benefited likewise.</p><p>Going back to the 'stock' game, it's essentially a match for the Series X version, albeit with very slight cuts to visual features. The big difference comes from the resolution. It runs at a reconstructed 1440p, using 900p as the base internal resolution. Bethesda maintains consistency by running at a capped 30 frames

As if she hasn't been through enough already, Tomb Raider's Lara Croft is now set to join Dead by Daylight as a Survivor.
</p><p>
"Lara Croft has survived expeditions few would dare attempt, locked eyes with death and lived to tell the tale... Now, she must face yet again a dark adventure shrouded in Fog," the Dead by Daylight team teased, noting that while this may be her first foray into horror, she has certainly seen things many of us can only imagine during her own global escapades. Remember when she took down a tyrannosaurus rex?!
</p><p>
The Lara heading to Dead by Daylight is from the Survivor trilogy, specifically the 2013 reboot (see image above). However, while she has her jade necklace and tank top, she does not have her bow and pistols, meaning she will have to find other ways to survive the f

At least I had sacrificed enough to send my God Talkers on a divine petition to maybe, just maybe, persuade them to prevent another famine.

Fortnite has launched a major new battle royale mode, Reload, which drew in more than a million players to the game over the weekend. 
</p><p>
Available in both regular and Zero Build variants, Reload is a smaller-scale battle royale option with 40 players organised into 10 squads, with respawns enabled if at least one team member is still alive. 
</p><p>
If that sounds familiar, it's because Reload is very much inspired by Call of Duty: Warzone's popular Resurgence mode, which offers very similar mechanics. Respawning isn't instant and requires a wait time which increases over the match - though aggressive play can reduce it, if your teammates take out other players or entire squads.

Undead Labs added a touching tribute into State of Decay 2, immortalising a player's father who passed away three years ago.
</p><p>
In a reddit post over the weekend, community member EmbarrassedBudget859 said they contacted the developer after their father passed away a few years ago, asking if Undead Lads would include him in the game. "And they did what they could, which means just adding his name to random survivors," EmbarrassedBudget859 wrote.
</p><p>
The State of Decay 2 team did more than just include EmbarrassedBudget859's father's name, however. The developer actually created a fleshed out character called Bruce Allen Buncombe in his honour, complete with traits and all. And, over the weekend, EmbarrassedBudget859

With the release of DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring players are back to their old tricks by playing the game in weird and wonderful ways.
</p><p>
Take Twitch streamer Perrikaryal, who's already played the game with her mind and is now tackling Shadow of the Erdtree. Yes, you read that right.
</p><p>
Perrikaryal uses a bluetooth, portable EEG reader to analyse patterns of brain activity and, along with an eye-tracker, convert these to inputs. She then thinks about specific actions, which trigger rolls, attacks and the like in game - <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/perrikaryal/clip/SpinelessFilthyPresidentShazBotstix-NCMKhK02R5dFDFsE">here's an explanation clip</a>.
