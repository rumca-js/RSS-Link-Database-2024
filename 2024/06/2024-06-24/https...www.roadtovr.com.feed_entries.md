<div>The 2D to 3D photo conversion feature coming to Vision Pro in VisionOS 2.0 makes a novel capability meaningful for the first time. Cue “Apple didn’t even do it first!” in the comments.

<div>RIVEN (1997), the sequel to iconic point-and-click puzzle-adventure MYST (1993), just got the VR treatment in its new remake. Unlike Myst, which felt a little too game-y and obtuse at times, Riven plays a lot more like a modern title, which thanks to Quest and SteamVR support, is true in every sense of the word now.

<div>Sony is getting ready to release tethered PC VR support for PSVR 2 this summer, but that may be one of the last meaningful things the company does for its increasingly latchkey VR hardware. According to a report by Android Central&#8216;s Nicholas Sutrich, Sony isn&#8217;t leaving any budget for first-party content. Paraphrasing for anonymity, Sutrich&#8217;s [&#8230;]</div>
