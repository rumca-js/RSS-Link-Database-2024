<p>Did you know that it&rsquo;s entirely possible to use Windows 11 with a local-only account, the way it worked way back when computers still used floppy drives?</p>



<p>You&rsquo;d be forgiven for not knowing, because it seems like Microsoft is going out of its way to hide this option from you, hoping to push you onto a connected Microsoft Account instead. In fact, they&rsquo;re straight-up erasing information that might tell you otherwise.</p>



<p>Microsoft keeps a pretty sizable collection of short, to-the-point guides for some of the most frequently searched functions on Windows. For example, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20&amp;xcust=2-1-2375396-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/fee

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Arm-powered Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2371003/copilot-laptops-land-at-retail-minus-recall-features.html">the next big thing in PC hardware</a>, but what happens when they break? That&rsquo;s when you head over to iFixit, search for a repair guide, and maybe even look for replacement parts.</p>



<p>As they&rsquo;ve done for several years, iFixit has torn down the latest Microsoft Surface hardware to see how easy they are to fix.</p>



<p>Microsoft has been pushing devices that can be repaired by end users (or, at least, by someone who knows their way around a Torx screw). And according to iFixit&rsquo;s presenter Shahram Mokhtari, the latest devices live up to that even though it seemed as if the Qualcomm Snapdragon-based hardware would make it a harder job.</p>
