NordVPN is conquering best VPN lists and almost every NordVPN review is filled with praise… but how much of that is just  hype? That’s what I want to find out with this review of NordVPN, so I’ll focus on pros & cons – and talk about things people tend to leave out.

🔎 Is NordVPN safe?

I found a strict no-logs policy, meaning they’re legally bound to NOT monitor, collect, or share user data. Yet the actual PRO point here is the fact that NordVPN heavily enforces this promise. For one, they keep putting it through independent third-party audits, and got it confirmed 4 times already. Two – NordVPN uses RAM servers. Once such a server is restarted, all data is completely wiped. So NordVPN simply doesn’t have the means to collect sensitive information.
