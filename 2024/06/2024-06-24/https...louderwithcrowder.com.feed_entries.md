You can’t hate anything unless it has to do with conservatives. And another rule of this woke cult is to be beholden to the ideology, even if it means humanizing child, gang rapists. Subsequently, a woman was handed down a longer jail sentence for sending hateful remarks to child gang rapists who also happen to be migrants, than the predators themselves. And as of writing this, it’s unclear if the victims of rape are legally allowed to hate their victimizers.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockqu

Subsequently, he/she was permitted to join a female rugby team even though the other players were worried about injuries.
