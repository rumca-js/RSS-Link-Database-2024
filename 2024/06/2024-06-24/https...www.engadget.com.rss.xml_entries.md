<p>Google is reportedly building new AI-powered chatbots based on celebrities and YouTube influencers. The idea isn’t groundbreaking — startups like Character.ai and companies like Meta have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-unleashing-more-than-25-ai-chatbot-personalities-onto-the-world-181428710.html"><ins>already launched</ins></a> products like this — but neither is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-putting-more-restrictions-on-ai-overviews-after-it-told-people-to-put-glue-on-pizza-011316780.html"><ins>Google’s AI strategy</ins></a> so far.</p>

## Uber is locking New York drivers out of its apps and blaming a city pay rule

<p>For the last month, Uber has been locking New York City drivers out of its apps during low-demand periods, and Lyft has threatened to do so, too. <em>Bloomberg</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-24/uber-is-locking-out-new-york-city-drivers-mid-shift-to-lower-minimum-pay">reports</a> that the ride-hailing companies blame a New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) rule for their behavior. At least one drivers’ union says it may consider striking if the lockouts continue.</p>
<p>The mid-shift lockouts stem from a six-year-old NYC pay rule that requires ride-sharing companies to pay drivers for idle time between fares. Capping how long drivers without passengers can be paid means Uber pays less, but it also means drivers are taking home much less money for the same amount of time on the clock. And they can’t predict when they’ll lose access to the app.</p>

On Monday, the company posted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">15 percent off deals</a> on two discontinued <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719-180026139.html">Steam Deck LCD models</a>, offering the 64GB variant for under $300 and the 512GB edition for under $400.

<p>The star of the fire sale is the 512GB (NVMe SSD) LCD Steam Deck model. Initially, it was $449, but the handheld is available for only $381.65.

<p>Major music labels are taking on AI startups that they believe trained on their songs without paying. Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group and Sony Music Group sued the music generators Suno and Udio for allegedly infringing on copyrighted works on a “massive scale.”</p>
<p>The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) initiated the lawsuits and wants to establish that “nothing that exempts AI technology from copyright law or that excuses AI companies from playing by the rules.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The music labels’ lawsuits in US federal court accuse Suno and Udio of scraping their copyrighted tracks from the internet. The filings against the AI companies reportedly demand injunctions against future use and damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work. (That sounds like it could add up to a monumental sum if the court finds them liable.) The suits appear aimed at establishing licensed training as the only acceptable industry framework for AI mo

<p>There’s <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2024-06-01">already a patch</a> for the zero-day exploit but it requires a visit to the settings app to make sure the device is up to date.

<p>Open-ear headphones can come with some sacrifices to audio quality, but this set features a custom 16.22mm graphene driver.
