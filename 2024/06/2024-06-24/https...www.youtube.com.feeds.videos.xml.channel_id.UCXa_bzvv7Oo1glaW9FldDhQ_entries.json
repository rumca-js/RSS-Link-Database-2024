The long-awaited expansion is finally available for consoles and PC and sees players venturing to the Realm of Shadow for one last adventure.\n\nEverything fell in place for its launch, from the pre-release hype to universal acclaim from critics. Its player numbers on Steam were (and remain) very strong, and many players are awed by the sheer scale of its content. However, shortly after launch, it began to see a fair bit of backlash.\n\nThough some of this regards PC performance, several others have complained that the difficulty is too high. You may consider this ironic since one of FromSoft's selling points is the difficulty, but here we are. Do they have a point, though? Is Shadow of the Erdtree unfairly challenging?
