When it first debuted, A Quiet Place shocked audiences not only with it's mostly silent audio, but the world it created felt familiar and unique at the same time.  First time director John Krasinski caught lightning in a bottle with the first A Quiet Place movie, so naturally a sequel was fast tracked, and when A Quiet Place 2 dominated the box office, it was only a matter of time before it got the prequel treatment with A Quiet Place Day One.  The only question is, are franchises doing them selves a disservice by over saturating their own market with sequels and prequels?
