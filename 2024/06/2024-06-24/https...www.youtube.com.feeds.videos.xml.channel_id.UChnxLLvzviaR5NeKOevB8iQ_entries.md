i've been thinking some nasty thoughts
brain got me crawling down deep in the dirt
the rain came down and flushed me into your life
now I'm wriggling at your feet, baby, praying that you feel this is right

would you love me if i was worm?
would you love me if i was worm?

would you love me if i was worm?
would you love me or leave me to burn
in the ground at your feet
I've never felt so complete
would you love me if i was worm?
