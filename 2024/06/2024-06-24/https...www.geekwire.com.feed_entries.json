LEGO fanatic Shane Deegan, who previously wowed us with his build of Seattle&#8217;s T-Mobile Park, added another sports stadium to his stable of creations. Deegan pieced together more than 7,000 of the toy bricks in what he says is probably the biggest build he&#8217;s ever done. &#8220;This is the second time I&#8217;ve built Husky Stadium,&#8221; Deegan said Monday via email. &#8220;When I first&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/greatest-setting-in-college-football-gets-the-lego-treatment-with-fans-elaborate-husky-stadium-build/\">Read More</a>", "id": 763106, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/greatest-setting-in-college-football-gets-the-lego-treatment-with-fans-elaborate-husky-stadium-build", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "\u2018Greatest setting in college football\u2019 gets the LEGO treatment with fan\u2019s elaborate Husky Stadium build", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-24T20:27:36+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"1038\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ORCA_Android_WearOS-1260x1038.png\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Transit riders hopping on a bus or ferry across the Seattle area can now use a digital ORCA card via their Google Wallet on Android and Wear OS devices.

The chatbot service, code-named &#8220;Metis,&#8221; would be accessed via web browser and powered by a new foundational model, according to Business Insider, which cited sources and documents. The move would add Amazon to a growing list of tech giants and startups offering new AI assistants, including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon-backed Anthropic, among several others. Amazon declined to comment in response to an inquiry from GeekWire.

But while companies are landing these funds, the payments often trickle in slowly or sometimes there&#8217;s a need for cash up-front to make purchases to get the work going. A startup with roots in the Pacific Northwest is helping bridge that cash-flow gap. Enduring Planet launched in 2021 offering loans against government grants, and more recently expanded its offerings to provide loans to companies with government contracts. It also added chief financial officer services on a part-time or fractional basis. &#8220;Our overarching mission&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/meet-the-climate-startup-helping-other-climate-startups-fund-their-ventures-with-lower-cost-loans/\">Read More</", "id": 763109, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/meet-the-climate-startup-helping-other-climate-startups-fund-their-ventures-with-lower-cost-loans", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Meet the climate startup helping other climate startups fund their ventures with lower cost loans", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-24T16:20:36+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"1014\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BoxedUp-Team-Photo-2024-2-1260x1014.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />BoxedUp, a startup founded by ex-Amazon employees to help equipment rental companies set up and run online stores, raised $2.85 million in a seed funding round.
