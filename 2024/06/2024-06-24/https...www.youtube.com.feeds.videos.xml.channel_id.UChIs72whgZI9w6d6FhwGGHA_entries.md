This engineering discussion features Jakob Dellinger of Noctua, who helps to explain an acoustic phenomenon we recently observed in a case review. The phenomenon has to do with the beat frequency observed from fan interactions. There are other types of annoying noises, such as vibrations, resonance, or coil whine, caused by computer parts as well; however, for beat frequency, it is specifically related to an undesirable interaction between two fans. This can happen in particular with CPU air coolers. With the inbound Noctua NH-D15 G2, the long-awaited cooler that is supposed to replace Noctua's best CPU air cooler, this topic is fitting as it relates directly to the NF-A14 G2 fans.
