Jason Koebler reports on the lawsuit filed today <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24184710/riaa-ai-lawsuit-suno-udio-copyright-umg-sony-warner">by the RIAA against Udio and Suno</a>, the two leading generative music startups.</p>
<p>The lawsuit includes examples of prompts that the record labels used to recreate famous songs that were almost certainly included in the (undisclosed) training data. Jason collected some of these together into a three minute video, and the result in pretty damning. Arguing "fair use" isn't going to be easy here.

<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/issues/451">New blog feature: Support for markdown in quotations</a></p>
Another incremental improvement to my blog. I've been collecting quotations here since 2006 - I now render them using Markdown (previously they were just plain text). <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/russ-cox/">Here's one example</a>. The full set of 920 (and counting) quotations can be explored <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=quotation">using this search filter</a>.
