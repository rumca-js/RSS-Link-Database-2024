LEGO fanatic Shane Deegan, who previously wowed us with his build of Seattle&#8217;s T-Mobile Park, added another sports stadium to his stable of creations. Deegan pieced together more than 7,000 of the toy bricks in what he says is probably the biggest build he&#8217;s ever done. &#8220;This is the second time I&#8217;ve built Husky Stadium,&#8221; Deegan said Monday via email. &#8220;When I first&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/greatest-setting-in-college-football-gets-the-lego-treatment-with-fans-elaborate-husky-stadium-build/">Read More</a>

The chatbot service, code-named &#8220;Metis,&#8221; would be accessed via web browser and powered by a new foundational model, according to Business Insider, which cited sources and documents. The move would add Amazon to a growing list of tech giants and startups offering new AI assistants, including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon-backed Anthropic, among several others. Amazon declined to comment in response to an inquiry from GeekWire.

But while companies are landing these funds, the payments often trickle in slowly or sometimes there&#8217;s a need for cash up-front to make purchases to get the work going. A startup with roots in the Pacific Northwest is helping bridge that cash-flow gap. Enduring Planet launched in 2021 offering loans against government grants, and more recently expanded its offerings to provide loans to companies with government contracts. It also added chief financial officer services on a part-time or fractional basis. &#8220;Our overarching mission&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/meet-the-climate-startup-helping-other-climate-startups-fund-their-ventures-with-lower-cost-loans/">Read More</

The era of growth-at-all-costs and easily accessible venture capital is over. The focus is now on demonstrating the ability to grow — but in a profitable and efficient way, without the need for additional investor dollars. &#8220;Given that venture purse strings are tight, we are running Kevala to turn profitable on our terms,&#8221; said Todd Owens, co-founder and CEO of the Seattle-based staffing software startup. &#8220;We are still investing, but we scrutinize every single investment.&#8221; Higher interest rates and persistent inflation, among other market factors, caused venture capitalists&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/default-alive-tech-startups-focus-on-survival-and-slower-growth-in-new-
