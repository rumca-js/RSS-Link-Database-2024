<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been using the note keeping app obsidian since last few months. I liked it's tree structure of notes feature. It helps to track my notes and thought process. Yesterday suddenly I thought how about tracking my search history on YouTube or Google with such tree like mapping. But how to do that (for free of course ) ? Does Google have any such visualisation features? </p> <p>I'm open to your valuable suggestions , ideas and similar stories of experience. </p> <p>Thanks in advance. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Informal-Garden-5936"> /u/Informal-Garden-5936 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1dnmigk/how_to_get_treelike_map_of_my_search_history/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1dnmigk/how_to_get_treelike_map_of_my_search_history/">[comments]</a></span>
