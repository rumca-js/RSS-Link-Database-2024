<p>Transport system failed to cope and supporters were left walking in the rain to get to England’s game against Serbia</p><p>The No 107 tram pulls up next to a racecourse just outside Gelsenkirchen and judders to a halt. We wait. And wait a little more. Five minutes become 10, and then 15. Songs and idle chat gradually turn to sighs and anxious hubbub. One England fan thinks this tram might be getting diverted back to Essen. Another thinks it might be going straight to the stadium. In fact, its final destination is Gelsenkirchen railway station, where – as one of the few passengers with working phone signal confirms – the crowds are “utter carnage”.</p><p>Which is also a pretty decent description of the tableau unfolding outside the windows. Here thousands of England fans in various states of distress and confusion, some in shirts and some not, are swarming in all directions across the pasture: some staggering, some running, some trying to clamber over the metal crash barriers in an

<p>The former GQ editor’s memoir is a ‘precarious balancing act’, revealing parental abuse while emphasising his celebrity-heavy career</p><p>The efflorescence of men’s magazines in the UK lasted from about 1985 to 2010. You may recall their titles on newsagents’ shelves – <em>Arena</em>, <em>GQ</em>, <em>Maxim</em>, <em>Esquire</em> – near in time but now as defunct as the clay tablets of Babylon. They are gone, mostly, along with those newsagents’ shelves. It was a short-lived, almost parenthetical age. To revisit it in this new memoir by Dylan Jones, former editor of <em>GQ</em>, is to be transported to a world of scarcely imaginable glamour, of expense-account carelessness, of sybaritic indulgence unrivalled since the days of Rome. You can barely make it out through the rain of rose petals.</p><p>And squarely at the centre is Jones, scene-maker, master of the revels, and friend to the stars. Quite an irony today to read of his editorial perfectionism, and his insistence that every

<p>Starmer’s closest aide is credited with putting the party in a position to win but his popularity is not universal</p><p>For a man at the heart of the Labour party, Morgan McSweeney lives a long way from Westminster. He spends much of his time doing a six-hour commute from home in Lanark, the town south of Glasgow where he lives with his family, to Labour’s HQ in Southwark. Despite the distance he travels, he is in many ways the ultimate Labour insider – one who has made it his mission to transform the way the party appeals to the country.</p><p>As Labour’s elections guru and Keir Starmer’s closest aide, McSweeney has near-unrivalled influence. He is credited by many for steering Labour to all-but-certain victory in the election next month. Adored by many staffers and key shadow cabinet ministers alike, some party figures retain more affection for him than they do the leader. The highest form of praise in Labour HQ is: “Morgan loves it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/pol

A designer and campaigner renowned for her political punchiness, she has made the text snappy and succinct, all in trademark capital letters. “In here is everything that’s missing,” she laments, “from this so-far awful election. Both main parties want us to feel like progressive ideas are in the bin. Forgotten.

I have never cleaned the inside of my own oven.

I have never, to my knowledge, dusted any of my shelves. Last week, I happily washed about 40 wine glasses after a book event, noting the different shades of lipstick as I went. Washing up in my kitchen makes me want to punch a hole through the sink.</p><p>Cleaning anything that isn’t my own home feels less boring, less pointless, less like my soul is being leached into an abyss of dirty hobs and splattered toothpaste.

<p><strong>Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff</strong><br />Welsh National Opera pull no emotional punches in this production of David McVicar’s staging of Puccini’s variously suspenseful, tragic and comic triptych</p><p>Puccini wrote passion and pain like no other, as the first two operas – Il Tabarro and Suor Angelica – of his triptych indisputably demonstrate.

Conductor laureate Carlo Rizzi is in his element, eliciting lustrous playing from the WNO orchestra and attention to the score’s descriptive detail, conveying Wagnerian drama and moments of suspense that might be from film music.</p><p>In Il Tabarro, the tragic loss of a baby

<p>Everywhere I go in Britain, people are exhausted. But there’s good reason to believe a Labour government would bring unseen possibilities</p><p>In the midst of dizzying opinion polls and a seemingly unprecedented Tory collapse, it is worth remembering a basic political fact: Labour governments do not get elected very often, and it is a feat that is chronically difficult to pull off.</p><p>Some of this is down to the UK’s creaking electoral system, and the awkward coalition of voters Labour must build to surmount it, from pensioners in post-industrial towns to urban twentysomethings. But some of the party’s eternal challenge is also down to a set of deeply sceptical attitudes, in England in particular. Younger voters seem to be largely free of such ideas, but in other parts of the electorate, Labour is for ever suspected of being profligate and wasteful, while the wider political left – not entirely unreasonably – is seen as pious, privileged and unbearably bossy.

<p><strong>Leeds Playhouse</strong><br />Opera North brings shimmering music to this gorgeous and crisply choreographed co-production, which preserves Shaw’s critique of the British class system</p><p>Some have called it “the perfect musical”. An exaggeration? Not if success is the measure. <em>My Fair Lady</em> ran for a record-breaking 2,717 performances following its Broadway opening in March 1956; has been given an unprecedented number of stagings around the world; and, translated to the screen in 1964, became an Oscar- and Bafta-winning hit. Its seemingly universal appeal is partly explained by the beautifully balanced combination of Frederick Loewe’s melodies (including I Could Have Danced All Night and Get Me to the Church on Time) with Alan Jay Lerner’s vivid storyline, adapted from George Bernard Shaw’s <em>Pygmalion</em> – the 1913 play and its 1938 Oscar-winning film version (adapted by Shaw and others).</p><p>In this <a href="https://www.leedsplayhouse.org.uk/event/my-fair

<p><strong>Whitechapel Gallery, London</strong><br />From post-pop art to late-flowering expressionism, the South African artist is one of his country’s most significant, and this huge survey shows off his extraordinary range<br /></p><p>Gavin Jantjes – pronounced Yanchez – is not a name on many people’s lips, although he should be. Born in Cape Town in 1948, the year the apartheid regime first devastated South Africa, he is one of the country’s most significant artists. But a lifetime’s exile, moving between Germany, Norway and England, and shifting between several different roles as art historian, writer, educator and curator, have perhaps obscured his singular qualities as an artist.

<p>For 45 years, Britain has been blighted by Conservative ideologies that promised a path to prosperity, but achieved nothing of the sort</p><p>The Tory party in three weeks’ time promises to be in a more ruinous, even life-threatening position than Labour was in the aftermath of the 2019 general election. Labour at least had a route to recovery after an epic defeat – to blend mainstream and centre-left opinion around a pragmatic programme for government, to eliminate all traces of antisemitism and to marginalise its toxic extremists.

<p>With his groundbreaking use of colour, the New York photographer captured a sense of freedom with flamenco artists living under General Franco’s rule</p><p>The celebrated New York-born photographer <a href="https://www.joelmeyerowitz.com/">Joel Meyerowitz</a> was 28 when he went to Málaga in 1966. He was on a road trip through Europe, 20,000 miles and 10 countries, but in Andalucia he found something like the authenticity he had been looking for. A friend of a friend introduced him to flamenco musicians in the Romany quarter, and he spent six months taking pictures, observing their lives. The Escalona family, members of which are pictured here, could trace their musical lineage back to Antonio Escalona, whose guitar-playing had inspired the revolutionary poet Federico García Lorca.</p><p>By the time Meyerowitz reached Málaga, the city had lived under General Franco’s dictatorship for nearly 30 years.

<p>Combine a winning fragrance with that sublime glossy finish</p><p>I’ve always loved oils: the glide, the texture, the way they immediately absorb into your skin and give you that sublime glossy finish that catches the light in all the right places and just makes everything look more alive. There is also something quite luxe and indulgent about the tangibility of an oil – much more exciting than, say, a body lotion, which can feel a bit noncommittal and pedestrian. The lush factor of an oil is taken up a notch when you add the element of fragrance to it. I love a product that is effective, makes the daily chore of beauty a delight and, crucially, has a dual purpose – which a scented body oil absolutely does. It will deeply moisturise your skin so it doesn’t fall to pieces, but it will also make you smell really nice – particularly with these oils here, many of which have been developed with world-class perfumers. Still, there are lots of people who automatically swerve body oils, fo
