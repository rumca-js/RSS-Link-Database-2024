The fact that players can tune their difficulty in the region is also noteworthy, to say nothing of all the new enemies and bosses that will encourage new strategies.\n\nWhile there's still a lot we don't know, especially considering the purported scale of the expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree looks to offer everything that fans could want on top of expanding into new directions.", "id": 721201, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sjDOUXgi8o", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/2sjDOUXgi8o/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree - WHAT'S CHANGING?", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
