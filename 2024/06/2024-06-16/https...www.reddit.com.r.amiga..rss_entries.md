<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>According to google. &quot;The Commodore Amiga's sound chip, Paula, has four independent hardware-mixed 8-bit PCM sound channels that can support waveform output rates from around 20 samples per second to almost 29,000 samples per second. Each channel has 65 volume levels and independent sampling rates. The channels are mixed down to two stereo outputs, one for the left and one for the right speaker. The Amiga also includes a software-controlled low-pass audio filter.&quot; What Hertz was the sound 440 Hertz?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/StealthJediPro"> /u/StealthJediPro </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dh1o0g/why_did_the_amiga_sound_so_much_better_than_any/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dh1o0g/why_did_the_amiga_sound_so_much_better_than_any/">[comments]</a></span>
