<p>Cause of blaze, named Post Fire, unknown as two buildings damaged and nearby valley and lake reservoir close</p><p>A wildfire that forced the evacuation of at least 1,200 people in southern California has burned more than 16 sq miles, officials said Sunday.<br /><br />
 The blaze, named the Post Fire, started Saturday and was burning near the Interstate 5 freeway in Gorman, about 62 miles (100km) north-west of Los Angeles, according to the California department of forestry and fire protection.<br /><br />
 California state park services evacuated 1,200 people from the Hungry Valley recreation area in Gorman and both Hungry Valley and the Pyramid Lake reservoir were closed as a result of the fire threat, the Los Angeles county fire department said.<br /><br />
 The flames broke out at around 1.45pm, authorities said. The cause isn’t known.<br /><br />
 No homes were threatened by the fire but two commercial buildings have been damaged, the Los Angeles county fire department said Sun

<p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/12/denmark-finland-euro-2020-match-report">Christian Eriksen collapsed</a> in Denmark’s opening game of the Euros three years ago, his unconscious body surrounded by his teammates as he received CPR, what then would have seemed a reasonable hope for the future? To survive? To lead a relatively normal life? To resume his career? Did anybody in those dreadful moments think he might play at the next Euros? Even the most optimistic, surely, could not have foreseen a performance quite like this. But football can be dreadfully capricious: brilliant as Eriksen was, it was not enough to deliver a win for Denmark.</p><p>Perhaps Slovenia, at their first major tournament since 2010, were slightly overawed. Perhaps the plan was always to bide their time. Perhaps Benjamin Verbic, who came on after 67 minutes, really does make that much difference. But for them, the final 30 minutes could hardly have been more different from the first h

<p>Marie Amachoukeli’s low-key tale of a child and her nanny boasts a star turn from six-year-old Louise Mauroy-Panzani</p><p>One of the year’s most hypnotic performances nestles inside this seemingly modest French-language coming-of-age drama. Gifted six-year-old newcomer Louise Mauroy-Panzani is middle-class Parisian Cléo, whose world falls apart when her adored nanny, the titular Gloria (Ilça Moreno Zego, also superb), is forced to return to Cape Verde. Gloria, about to become a grandmother, hits on a compromise: Cléo can visit during the summer holidays and get to know Gloria’s pregnant daughter, Fernanda (Abnara Gomes Varela), and wary young son, César (Fredy Gomes Tavares, fantastic).</p><p>The motherless Cléo, with her thick glasses and soft cheeks, is plainly vulnerable. Yet a strength of the script is that all the main characters are shown to have missed out on mothering. Equally refreshing is the fact that Gloria doesn’t conform to “good” servant stereotypes (she’s very diff

<p>The theologian and journalist suggests that slaves in the Roman empire contributed to the core texts of Christianity in this refreshingly readable book</p><p>Graham Greene, who wrote so much about Catholicism in his novels, was regularly asked whether he was still a believer. It was listening to the gospel accounts of Jesus’s life, he replied, and hearing fleeting references thrown into the narrative that had no obvious purpose for being there – like the “other” unnamed disciple who sprints past Peter on his way to the empty tomb – that tempted him to believe the gospels might just be fact.</p><p>At least that speedy but redundant disciple is there in plain sight.

We showed in court that the government had violated its legal obligation to obtain free, prior and informed consent from Indigenous communities. We won a moral and legal victory on behalf of our ancestral home in that moment – or so we thought. Now, however, Ecuador’s president plans to plough through that legal judgment and recommence oil drilling on nearby Indigenous lands.

I like patatas bravas and sangría, don’t get me wrong, but Spain is so much more than that.”</p><p>Fortunately, the public were eager to learn and Pizarro, who grew up eating his mother’s “simple but amazing” food in Extremadura, made it his mission to spread the word. He worked at several Spanish restaurants, including Brindisa, where he was executive chef.

<p>Vividly bringing to life the everyday struggles of trans people, this Almodóvar-endorsed bestseller, set in 1980s Madrid, is affecting and evocative</p><p>Alana S Portero’s debut novel <em>La mala costumbre</em>, or <em>Bad Habit</em>, starts at an intensity of 11 and barely lets up. The first time the protagonist falls in love, aged five, is with her neighbour’s bloodied corpse after he has plunged to his death in a drug-induced stupor. He is a fallen angel to her: “I simply yearned with my entire soul to kiss something so lovely and helpless.”</p><p>This juxtaposition of the sacred and the profane runs throughout the rest of the novel, from its title to the many secondary characters, each of which is assigned a mythical double: the abusive man who lives across the hall is Bluebeard, his daughters Lady Godiva and Joan of Arc. Portero’s background as a historian lends these parallels depth and perspicacity, elevating what might otherwise be an unremittingly bleak story into a highe

A macho, feckless and sporadically pious Moroccan ex-con (Abdellatif Masstouri) ropes his adult son (Ayoub Elaid) into doing a “small job” for a dog-obsessed gangster. Over the ensuing 12 hours, father and son spin around town with a problematically XL corpse, encountering a series of volpine/toothless/insidiously sozzled figures, who offer help (of sorts). All creatures great and small are fighting for their lives in this blasted landscape and, though the tension often flags, the actors, many of them non-professional, give consistently good face, especially Masstouri, who resembles a leathery, bushy-haired John Garfield.</p><p>In cinemas and on <a href="https://homecinema.curzon.com/film/houn

<p>A trip to Auschwitz raises painful family history in a film that fumbles its honourable intentions with overstuffed and miscast characters</p><p>Stephen Fry and Lena Dunham play a Jewish father and daughter who miscommunicate their way through 90s Poland, until a visit to Auschwitz allows them to dig up the past (literally). There’s no doubting the good intentions of Dunham, Fry and the esteemed German director/writer, Julia von Heinz. All three clearly want to use this adaptation of Lily Brett’s novel <em>Too Many Men</em> to explore survivor’s guilt and enduring antisemitism. Alas, most of the film’s big scenes are either tonally muddled or soul-crushingly predictable.</p><p>Fry, who learned Polish to play Edek Rothwax, is miscast as an honorary New Yorker whose avuncular persona masks fear and fury. We believe in the character’s charm and suppressed pain (Fry is pitch-perfect in the chilling segment of the movie in which Edek visits his requisitioned family home). What he can’t

<p>The normalisation of ideas once confined to the fringes is cause for concern, not complacency</p><p>Far right? Hard right? Radical right? Or just plain right? The success in the recent EU elections of parties such as Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National, or RN, (the rebadged Front National), and Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), has generated a debate about whether the label “far right” should be retired because, as <em>Spectator</em> editor Fraser Nelson argues, many parties that carry that moniker <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-truth-about-the-rise-of-the-far-right-in-europe/">are “now mainstream</a> in a way that wasn’t the case 15 years ago”.</p><p>Such parties are, for Nelson, better categorised as “new right”.

Artem Dovbyk had been playing in Ukraine’s third tier for most of that time but the 20-year-old had something different. Rather than being dragged into the morass around him he had risen above it, handling himself physically against grizzled opponents and scoring almost a goal a game. The Danish club needed a replacement for Alexander Sørloth, who was about to earn them a windfall by joining Crystal Palace. That transfer went through and, on the same day, Dovbyk’s arrival from Dnipro was confirmed. The towering No 9s were ships in the Jutland night.</p><p>Last season their worlds collided at last.

Lindo refused, and ran away, and his rebellious sister duly chased after him. But then, disaster. He wasn’t concentrating on the traffic; a car hit him, an accident that broke his spine. He would spend the next three months in hospital. Ziyanda, though, kept on running, not even stopping to check up on him.
