The feature comes with playback controls similar to those you’d find in music or podcast players, letting you pause, change the reading speed, scrub forward, or skip ahead or back by 10 seconds at a time.</p>
<p id="QRCtQy">You can also change the voice it uses, as well as the language. The feature supports several, including English, French, German, Arabic, Hindi, and Spanish, according to a <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/14768725?hl=en">Google help page about the feature</a>.

  <p id="c54Anr">If your local McDonald’s has been getting your order confidently wrong with an AI chatbot at the drive-thru, I have good news for you: The company is ending the program for now. The company told franchisees that it’s winding down an AI drive-thru ordering partnership with IBM “no later than July 26th, 2024,” <a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/mcdonalds-ending-its-drive-thru-ai-test">according to trade publication <em>Restaurant Business</em></a>. </p>

  <p id="qOVVfT">The thinness of the OLED iPad Pro is only the beginning of a renewed effort by Apple to make increasingly thin computers, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-16/when-is-apple-intelligence-coming-some-ai-features-won-t-arrive-until-2025-lxhjh86w?srnd=undefined">according to <em>Bloomberg’</em>s Mark Gurman</a> in today’s <em>Power On</em> newsletter. The company plans a “significantly skinnier” iPhone 17 and is also working on shaving off some of the thickness of the MacBook Pro and the Apple Watch, he writes.</p>

  <p id="lp2RtS">Siri may do more than make the edges of your iPhone a glowy rainbow when iOS 18 drops this fall. Apple Intelligence features <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24176494/apple-intelligence-ai-upgrade-cycle-here">won’t be out until 2025</a> for anyone not testing them in beta this year, but reports suggest that Siri itself will still get natural language updates and other key features before the year is out.</p>
<p id="j2Z0FI">For instance, users will be able to type to Siri without <a href="https://arc.net/l/quote/foterpcs">diving into accessibility settings</a>, and it will be more conversational, understanding you even when you trip over your words
