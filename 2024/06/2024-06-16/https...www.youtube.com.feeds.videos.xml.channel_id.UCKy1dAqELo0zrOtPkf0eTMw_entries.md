WondLa is an animated adventure series distributed by Apple TV+ based on the New York Times bestselling book series “The Search for WondLa'' by Tony DiTerlizzi.

“WondLa” centers around Eva, a curious, enthusiastic, and spirited teenager being raised in a state-of-the-art underground bunker by Muthr, a robot caretaker. On her 16th birthday, an attack on Eva’s bunker forces her onto the Earth’s surface which is now inhabited by aliens, covered with other-worldly fauna, and no other humans to be found. In fact, it’s no longer called Earth but Orbona. Otto, a loveable giant water bear with whom Eva shares telepathic powers and Rovender, a cantankerous alien with a troubled past join Eva as she leads the team on a dangerous quest to find humans, her home, and her true destiny.

WondLa stars Jeanine Mason, Teri Hatcher, Brad Garrett, Gary Anthony Williams, Chiké Okonkwo, D.C. Douglas, Alan Tudyk, and more. The series is showrun and executive produced by Bobs Gannaway.
