The grammar and word choice just sound weird. You&#x27;re always cutting out flowery words like &#x27;therefore&#x27; and &#x27;nevertheless&#x27; that don&#x27;t fit in casual writing. Plus, you have to fact-check the whole thing because AI just makes things up, which takes forever because it&#x27;s not just big ideas. AI hallucinates these flippant little things in throwaway lines that you&#x27;d never notice.
