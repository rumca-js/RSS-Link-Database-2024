Estevan and Alejandro Gutierrez are Swiss brothers with Ecuadorian heritage, and their latest album, Sonido Cósmico — “cosmic sound” — was born in part in the desert of the U.S. Southwest. “Driving through New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada [was] definitely an inspiration,” Estevan explains, “but in general, just being on the road and then meeting new people … these are all inspirations that we take.”

Sonido Cósmico released June 14 on Dan Auerbach’s Easy Eye Sound label. Hermanos Gutierrez recently visited The Current to play music from the new album.
