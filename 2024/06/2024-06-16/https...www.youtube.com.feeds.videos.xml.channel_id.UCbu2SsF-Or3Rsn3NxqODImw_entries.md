Black Myth: Wukong is an upcoming Action RPG, and while Phil found there to be some Souls-ish elements like recovering health similar to having an Estus Flask, or checkpoints akin to bonfires, in general, he found the gameplay to not be in the Souls-vein, with less deliberate combat.

Playing as Sun Wukong, aka "The Destined One", means players will be frequently dodge-rolling away from enemy attacks, with a deep combat system. Black Myth: Wukong is currently set to release August 20, 2024 to PC and PS5.
