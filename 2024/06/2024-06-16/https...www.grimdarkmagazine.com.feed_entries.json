Haefele is a nonfiction book discussing the role of August Derleth in the creation of HPL&#8217;s modern mythology. More precisely, it is more of a rebuttal to S.T. Joshi&#8217;s The Rise, Fall, and Rise of the Cthulhu Mythos. If you haven&#8217;t read that, the book is going to be nonsensical. August Derleth is controversial in certain parts of HP Lovecraft fandom. By which I mean the literary types who know who he is. For most people out there, who know who HP Lovecraft is, a lot larger group than used to exist, they primarily know him through Cthulhu plushies, board games, tabletop roleplaying games, as well as video game adaptations. Go a little further and you&#8217;ll know him through his inspirations to authors like Stephen King as well as maybe spin off novels set in his world. Only by the time you pass them do you know about the guy who founded Arkham House and is a guy who either saved HP Lovecraft", "id": 720614, "language": "en-AU", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-a-look-behind-the-derleth-mythos-by-john-d-haefele", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 137, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "REVIEW: A Look Behind the Derleth Mythos by John D.
