These systems utilize distinct physiological characteristics, including fingerprints, facial features, and iris patterns. However, biometrics are typically used for three separate processes, which perform different functions, and it is up to organizations to determine which is appropriate to their use case.\n\nIn biometric security, it's important to distinguish between authentication, verification, and identification, as these terms are often <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/201206/explainer-verification-vs-identification-systems\">mistakenly used interchangeably</a>.
