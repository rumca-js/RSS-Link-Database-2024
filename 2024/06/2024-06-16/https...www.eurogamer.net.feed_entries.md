Taskmaster VR is finally out and on this week's episode of VR Corner, you can watch me try my hand (and spatulas) at a virtual episode of the popular TV show!</p><p>I'm playing the Quest 3 version in the video above because the PC version has been delayed due to <a href="https://x.com/scallywagarcade/status/1801187731189477698" target="_blank">technical issues</a>, but I'm sad to say that the Quest 3 version is far from perfect. There are some really poor framerates on show here and, rather annoyingly considering that the game relies on a lot of delicate physical movements, there are some occasional issues with object collision and interaction too.  </p><p>To be fair to the game, this wonkiness can often work in favour of the shows wacky, clumsy and comical vibe, but I think the control issues mixed with the poor framerates will insta

Within several of its planets lay your remaining clones, beings ripped from your body, causing a gradual cellular degeneration should you not locate and extract the vital fluid from each before it's too late. There are just five left, but you don't know where they are, and there are thousands of planets to explore. The outstanding clones, or numbers, can only be found by interrogating many of the alien species that populate the galaxy. There's just one problem: you have no idea what they are saying.</p><p>It sounds like the premise of that weird indie game you've got on your Steam wishlist. But it isn't. This is the plot of Captain Blood, the huge hit of 1988 from French publisher ERE Informatique. And like many games of the time, it began life as a tech demo.
