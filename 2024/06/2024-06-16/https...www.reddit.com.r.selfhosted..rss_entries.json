Every comment when this topic comes up is &quot;You shouldn't be self hosting production data, use a managed service&quot; or &quot;If you don't know how to script this, you shouldn't be doing it at home. Everyone competent just scripts it&quot;. </p> <p>Sure I could probably script it. But are there really no pre-existing tools to do this? I know some basic tools exist to dump the database on S3, but I'm talking about fine-grained management with features more than just &quot;dump the database every hour&quot;. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Regis_DeVallis\"> /u/Regis_DeVallis </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.co", "id": 723013, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dhdm6k/is_there_really_no_way_to_self_host_replicate", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Is there really no way to self host / replicate what managed database services accomplish?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-16T17:59:42+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The problem is finding a platform that fits the requirement:</p> <ul> <li>can replace the default photos app on ios and android</li> <li>handles auto backups</li> <li>has public image sharing links</li> <li>is open source/possible to self host</li> <li>has an exit strategy when the platform gets killed/bought out/abandoned</li> </ul> <p>I've looked at:</p> <ul> <li><strong>immich</strong>: active development, they don't want me to use it as my only method of storage</li> <li><strong>nextcloud photos/memories</strong>: can't replace the default photos app, needs an entire nextcloud instance which i don't have and seems overkill for just photos</li> <li><strong>librephotos</strong>: no app for ios</li> <li><strong>photoprism</strong>: has no apps</li> <li><a href=\"http://ente.io\">ente.io</a> looks good but e2ee means i can't just pull data from my volume if all hell breaks loose</li> </ul> <p>At this point, my best option really seems to be just using G", "id": 722764, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dhd9py/looking_for_a_google_photos_replacement", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Looking for a Google Photos replacement", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-16T17:41:37+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I\u2019m looking for something specific that may take a combination of things.

Wondering what\u2019s the best way to make exact copy of the hard drive? Is there duplicate function I can do to copy the drives ie: I want to copy everything from Drive 1 to an empty drive 2. I appreciate any advice I'm super new, and this is my first NAS I'd appreciate any information and guidance thank you!</p> <p>I have the UGREENNAS but maybe other NASes have similar functions?

This gives me a visual representation quickly by opening Explorer, as each drive shows a &quot;progress bar&quot; representation of how full they are. However, I'm running out of drive letters, and this isn't a very efficient solution. I had Conky set up on my Linux desktop last year, until I couldn't stand using Linux as my main desktop anymore and had to return to Windows.</p> <p>I'm aware of solutions like Netdata (which is a very well-made software), but the key thing I need is something SIMPLE. While searching I keep finding some great, flexible solutions with a ton of options like in-depth drive usage data etc., but I'm not looking to sift through all that. A desktop widget would be awesome, but since most FOSS tends to target Linux, I'm also open to a web app (preferably with a Docker container).
