No AI will take this away from you. … You need to just realize how beautiful this is, to be a human. And you will see that you can do so many more things, thanks to this [technology].&#8221; Our guest this week on the GeekWire Podcast is Léonard Boussioux, an assistant professor in the Department of Information Systems and Operations Management at the University of Washington&#8217;s Foster School of Business, and adjunct assistant professor at the UW&#8217;s Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering.

Instead, you&#8217;d have to look back at least as far as 1869 &#8212; a full century before humans walked on the moon. That&#8217;s just one of the fun facts you&#8217;ll learn from the Museum of Flight&#8217;s new exhibition, &#8220;Home Beyond Earth,&#8221; which opens today. Geoff Nunn, the museum&#8217;s adjunct curator for space history, said this exhibit is meant to provide fun as well as education in the subjects of science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/museum-flight-space-station/">Read More</a>

The 90-year-old spaceflier&#8217;s son, Greg Anders, confirmed his father&#8217;s death in an interview with The Associated Press and said the family was &#8220;devastated.&#8221; &#8220;He was a great pilot, and we will miss him terribly,&#8221; he told AP. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson paid tribute to Anders in a posting to the X social-media platform. &#8220;In 1968, during Apollo 8, Bill Anders offered to humanity among the deepest of gifts&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/apollo-8-astronaut-bill-anders-earthrise-dies-crash/">Read More</a>
