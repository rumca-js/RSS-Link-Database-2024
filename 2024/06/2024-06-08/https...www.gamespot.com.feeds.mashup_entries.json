After the Slitterhead tease, many expected a Survival Horror title, similar to Silent Hill's Resident Evil roots, but instead, Slitterhead is an action game with the twist that you can swap characters on the fly.   As you control a ghost who possesses various people, Jake compared playing Slitterhead to the likes of Driver: San Francisco or Watch Dogs: Legion.", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/possess-everyone-in-slitterhead/2300-6464302", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "source_obj__id": 126, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1823/18237460/4315829-slitterheadhandson_thumb2.jpg", "title": "Possess EVERYONE in Slitterhead", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-08T22:45:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1823/18237460/4315828-cairn_breakout.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Learn more about Cairn's math based movements in this developer interview with Creative Director Emeric Thoa and CEO Audrey Leprince of The Game Bakers during GameSpot Summer Live.", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/cairn-doesnt-have-animations-it-has-math-based-movements/2300-6464300", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "source_obj__id": 126, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1823/18237460/4315828-cairn_breakout.jpg", "title": "Cairn Doesn't Have Animations It has Math-Based Movements", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-08T22:27:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1823/18237460/4315827-poe2_site.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Check out a live cooperative gameplay demo of Path of Exile 2 with Trevor Gamon the Console Game Director from Grinding Gear Games and our very own Kurt Indovina.
