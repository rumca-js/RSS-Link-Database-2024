The Arkham Horror series is pretty much what I wish Call of Cthulhu had done with their fiction line decades ago, which is tell a popularized Pulpy adventure series where the investigators have a (small) chance of thwarting the supernatural horrors around them. The Countess Zorzi series is one of the Pulpiest with the Catwoman-esque protagonist and her sidekick, taxi driver Pepper Kelly. Unfortunately, while the Countess Alessandra Zorzi managed to survive the K&#8217;ynan&#8217;s vengeance in the previous book, she has left behind a large number of enemies. One of these is the Comte Henri d&#8217;Erlette, an former lover with a family history of black magic, who kidnaps Pepper in order to force the Countess to retrieve his copy of Cults des Goules. It turns out the Countess stole it from him and he takes that personally. The Comte is not the only individual who wants the infamous tome, however", "language": "en-AU", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-shadows-of-pnath-by-josh-reynolds", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 137, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "REVIEW: Shadows of Pnath by Josh Reynolds", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
