Instead, you&#8217;d have to look back at least as far as 1869 &#8212; a full century before humans walked on the moon. That&#8217;s just one of the fun facts you&#8217;ll learn from the Museum of Flight&#8217;s new exhibition, &#8220;Home Beyond Earth,&#8221; which opens today. Geoff Nunn, the museum&#8217;s adjunct curator for space history, said this exhibit is meant to provide fun as well as education in the subjects of science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/museum-flight-space-station/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/museum-flight-space-station", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Museum of Flight exhibition celebrates 150 years of space station dreams and realities", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-08T01:54:24+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"Bill Anders suiting up for Apollo 8 in 1968\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"1126\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/240607-anders2-1260x1126.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders, who snapped the iconic &#8220;Earthrise&#8221; photo of our planet as seen from lunar orbit, died today in a plane crash in waters off the San Juan Islands. The 90-year-old spaceflier&#8217;s son, Greg Anders, confirmed his father&#8217;s death in an interview with The Associated Press and said the family was &#8220;devastated.&#8221; &#8220;He was a great pilot, and we will miss him terribly,&#8221; he told AP.
