Silverstone often has some of the most unique and mechanically advanced cases at Computex, and for #computex 2024, we most liked the Alta D1 for its modularity and ability to swap components all around the case with a simple rails system. Silverstone also had some new budget PC cases, like a $60 Fara 515X and $100 Fara 514X airflow case.
