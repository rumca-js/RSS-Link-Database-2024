<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Back in 1987 or early 1988 I was visiting a computer fare in Aabenraa that was hosted by the local german Chaos Computer Club.</p> <p>I don't have many memories of it, other than there was a &quot;demo&quot; running on an Amiga that got me hooked then and forever since (and that it was a 12 km bicycle trip, each way :-) )</p> <p>The demo was really basic, it was the front part of a lion slowly running left, then the picture flipped and the lion was running right. Then it flipped again to start over.</p> <p>The music was some kind of electric guitar, maybe with drums.</p> <p>Can anyone remember this? Got a link or something?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mr_Nissen"> /u/Mr_Nissen </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1db20eu/looking_for_an_early_lion_demo/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1db20eu/looking_for_an_early_lion_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I picked up a perfectly working 1084S-P1 not long ago. Came with the 23F to 9M cable. Can anyone tell me if they think it is possible that the 9M end of this cable into the back of the 1084 can function <strong>without pins 4, 6, 7 and 9</strong> ? (So those pinouts are Green, Intensity, Not Used and V Sync). Because mine seems to work fine. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maxkraus08"> /u/maxkraus08 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1db09jc/1084s_standard_rdb_cable_23f_to_9m/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1db09jc/1084s_standard_rdb_cable_23f_to_9m/">[comments]</a></span>
