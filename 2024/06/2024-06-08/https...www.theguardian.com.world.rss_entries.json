garden of the Gregori family home on the outskirts of Civitavecchia, a port city close to Rome, is a well-curated grotto containing a tiny, rusting statue of the Virgin Mary surrounded by plants and flowers. The figurine was bought from a souvenir shop at the Catholic pilgrimage site in Medjugorje, Bosnia.</p><p>In late April, as a group of pilgrims huddled around the grotto to pray, the statue purportedly exuded a scented oil. It was not the first time it was said to have sweated oil, but the moment, filmed by some of those present and shared on social media, reignited fascination in Italy over claims of the supernatural, pitting believers against naysayers. The story was all the more intriguing because the Gregoris were the protagonists of another mysterious weeping statue case in the mid-1990s.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/08/italian-home-weeping-statue-virgin-mary", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "source_obj__id": 342, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e5f3dd0947256488d72880dfa633eef5ddebcc1/368_980_2581_1549/master/2581.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a0aad51acd619133f689eac796ac45d0", "title": "Blessed are the leaks: Italian home plays host to another \u2018weeping\u2019 statue", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-08T03:00:55+00:00", "description": "<p>Opposition leader reportedly told News Corp he would oppose the legislated 2030 emissions target \u2013 a 43% cut compared with 2005 levels \u2013 at the next election</p><ul><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul><p>Peter Dutton has been accused of planning to break Australia\u2019s commitment to the landmark Paris climate agreement after he said he would reject the country\u2019s 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target.</p><p>The opposition leader reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/peter-dutton-puts-carbon-emissions-target-onlabors-back/news-story/9f92fdee1dc0a65105bae4ae21875f60\">told the Weekend Australian</a> that he would oppose the legislated 2030 emissions target \u2013 a 43% cut compared with 2005 levels \u2013 at the next", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/08/peter-dutton-accused-of-trying-to-rip-up-australias-commitment-to-paris-climate-agreement", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "source_obj__id": 342, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dadef1f9a8cff1c3c5900a38c8883c3b09e4ff1/0_0_7032_4219/master/7032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3800fe4e00e939e0bb545cd24511b0b2", "title": "Peter Dutton accused of trying to \u2018rip up\u2019 Australia\u2019s commitment to Paris climate agreement", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
