Others, with a modest drink or two.

After a slow race, Ingebrigtsen, the reigning Olympic 1500m champion and double 5,000m world champion, pushed for home at the bell. Yet the 25-year-old Mills refused to submit, harrying his esteemed rival down the back straight before Ingebrigtsen powered away to win his third European 5,000m title in 13mins 20.11sec.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/

<p>Once a glamorous destination that attracted the likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Abba, the Cypriot resort of Varosha was abandoned on 14 August 1974 when Turkey invaded. For 50 years, the town has been deserted, but in 2020 it was opened up to tourists. British-Cypriot writer and editor <a href="https://alexchristofi.com/">Alex Christofi</a> and his father were some of the first people to be granted admission, while Alex was researching his new book on the history of Cyprus. “I felt quite dissociated as it was difficult to process what I was seeing,” he says. “There was almost no one else there. With the rope barriers, it felt as if I were touring the set of a film about a disaster that had wiped out humanity. There is something deeply melancholy about what remains.”</p><ul><li><em><a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/cypria-9781399401852/">Cypria: A Journey to the Heart of the Mediterranean</a></em> (Bloomsbury Continuum, £20) is out now</li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.c

<p>The city has one bathroom for every 8,000 residents – and they’re ancient and disgusting. Can anything be done?</p><p>Why is it so hard to find a public bathroom in New York? The city of over 8 million people operates a paltry 1,000 bathrooms – that’s one for every 8,000 New Yorkers. Anyone running errands in one of the five boroughs who doesn’t want to pay for an overpriced bottle of water in exchange for a cafe’s bathroom code must brave a decades-old public toilet that might be poorly lit, out of toilet paper, or covered in … something.</p><p>Now Mayor Eric Adams has a plan … well, sort of. In a press conference this week, Adams launched Ur In Luck (get it?), an initiative to expand access to public restrooms across all five boroughs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/08/new-york-public-toilets">Continue reading...</a>

It wasn’t a conscious decision, but it happened all the same. I was six and had just been given a new doll.

Inside the cavity above the doll’s pelvis was a tiny baby. I traded the baby for a pencil and the doll for butterfly stationery. On one of the sheets, I wrote what I wanted to be when I grew up: banjo player, pony trainer, story maker. Mother was not one of them.</p><p>Then came the teen and young adult years moulded by the women around me – my mother, grandmother, stepmother and the female friends who had chosen names for their unborn babies. No woman I knew rejected motherhood, so I inched closer to that life in total darkness with only my intuition as a guide. Suspecting the

The Empireland author explores the dangers of denial</p><p>In 2021, Oliver Dowden, the then culture secretary, appeared at&nbsp;the History Matters conference organised by the rightwing Policy&nbsp;Exchange thinktank. He had recently urged museum curators not to “denigrate” British history, as if history were a fixed, fragile thing, akin to a faltering tower of Jenga, and not something complex, changing and robust, with fresh discoveries and new arguments forever changing our sense of it.</p><p>According to a report in the Times, he proceeded to talk about the risk of curators “being pushed around by unrepre­sen­t­ative campaign groups … to remove our history, to remove statues and&nbsp;so&nbsp;on”, thus equating history with statues when statues are not history: they just offer one view of&nbsp;a historical figure at one particular point in history – and propoundin

Like most medications, they are imperfect tools: they have side-effects and don’t work for everybody.

For those they do help, antidepressants undoubtedly improve depression and reduce the risk of suicide.</p><p>Very rarely, in my clinical practice, do patients complain that they cannot stop their medication because of the symptoms when they try.

<p>Some households received demands for nearly £2,000 for a month after problems with supplier’s IT upgrade</p><p>Alison Woods lives frugally by herself in a two-bedroom flat, but as far as British Gas is concerned she is burning through enough energy to fuel a cannabis farm. The estimated readings on the quarterly bill that arrived in March were up by 1,000% on the same period last year. At nearly £2,000, the cost was more than the average household pays in a year, according to Ofgem estimates. Woods has a smart meter and usually pays between £70 and £110 a month.</p><p>“I have not changed my habits in any way,” she said. She has tried several times to complain to the company. “Every time I open a complaint, I receive a response that firstly ignores any of my questions about how my bill could be so high, secondly uses the same stock phrases and makes me think it is written by a bot, and thirdly tells me the complaint has now been resolved as everything is in order,” she said. “It is

<p>There’s a lovely variety of textures in these crushed roasties</p><p>Today’s recipe has been on our menu at <a href="https://www.pocotapasbar.com/">Poco in Bristol</a> for the past 12 years, so it has really survived the test of time, having been handed down from chef to chef over the years and now to the new owners, who recently took the place on. It’s a delicious way to use up leftover boiled potatoes, or a glut of potatoes. We served this all year round, using different varieties over the course of the year depending on what was in season, from waxy news to fluffy desirees. All are delicious in their own right, but new potatoes are my favourite here; if you want a more classic, crisp roast potato, though, larger, fluffy varieties such as maris piper, desiree and king edward work best.</p><p>Discover this recipe and many more from your favourite cooks in <a href="https://app.adjust.com/1bgiux9n?creative=Endnotes&amp;fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Finsideguardi

She flips a potential downside – being so close to the person documented – into a virtue by crafting an emotionally rich film that truly could not have been made by anybody else. It is filled, like Otto’s performances, with light and shade.</p><p>Otto by Otto (which premiered at this year’s Sydney film festival and arrives on Stan on 16 June) begins unassumingly, with grainy home videos and footage of the now-retired actor hanging out with his cats in his cluttered Petersham ho
