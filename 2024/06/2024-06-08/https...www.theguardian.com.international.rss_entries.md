The Dutch came awfully close to knocking off South Africa at the Nassau County Ground on Saturday, but lost, in the end, by four wickets with just seven balls left to&nbsp;spare.</p><p>Given that the Netherlands won this fixture in the last T20 World Cup, and then again in the ODI version last year, the result must count as yet another upset in a week that’s been full of them.

<p>A moss specialist and a Romanian labourer connect over homemade soup in Bas Devos’s lovely, intimate film</p><p>The lovely, low-key films of the Belgian director Bas Devos have deservedly gathered an appreciative following on the festival circuit. With his 2019 picture <em>Ghost Tropic</em><em>,</em> which follows a cleaner who falls asleep on the last train, and now <em>Here</em>, which finds human connections through soup-making and the study of tiny, insignificant plants, Devos has always encouraged his audience to look at the city of Brussels with fresh eyes, to see the details that might otherwise be overlooked. By making one of the central characters in <em>Here</em>, a Belgian-Chinese woman named Shuxiu (Liyo Gong), a bryologist – a specialist in mosses who finds endless worlds of fascination in something that most people barely notice – Devos weaves into the picture a neat metaphor for the intimacy and curiosity of his own film-making.</p><p>As with <em>Ghost Tropic</em>, <

<p>Even in the less conventional summer of 1984, the Spielberg-produced comedy horror was a gleeful rule-breaker</p><p>There’s no character in Joe Dante’s Gremlins more beloved than Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton), a struggling inventor from small-town Kingston Falls who travels the country bearing a great sales pitch (“I make the illogical logical”) and a bunch of products that keep backfiring on him. His Bathroom Buddy, a combination shaving mirror/toothbrush/toothpick/nail file/dental mirror, could be a Swiss army knife for overnighters were it not for a misfiring toothpaste button. His coffee machine makes sludge. His peeler-juicer is a kitchen-wide pulp explosion. And his egg-cracker is much more successful at breaking eggs than it’s designed to be.</p><p>Yet when Randall comes home for Christmas, he’s greeted to a hero’s welcome from his son, Billy (Zach Galligan), and his wife, Lynn (Frances Lee McCain), who laments that her husband’s inventions only work well for a couple of week
