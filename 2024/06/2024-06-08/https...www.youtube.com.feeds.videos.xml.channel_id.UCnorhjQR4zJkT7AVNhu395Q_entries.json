I've missed renovating this way. I'm doing something different this time around. I want you all to be part of the action so for this project not only will I be filming tutorials for YouTube, we will be LIVE streaming the renovation too. \n\n Join me on my first work with me LIVE while I demo the walls to make room for my open concept kitchen. I can't freaking wait! I'll share more about my plans of this house and what you can expect from this renovation project. And if you can't make it LIVE you can watch the replay on the LIVE tab of the channel page. \n\nGoing LIVE on Saturday June 8th at 11am EST \nSee you in the comments.
