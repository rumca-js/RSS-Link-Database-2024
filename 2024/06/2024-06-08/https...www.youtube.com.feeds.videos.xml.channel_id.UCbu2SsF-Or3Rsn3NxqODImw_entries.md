GameSpot's Jake Dekker and Jean-Luc Seipke got a chance to play Slitterhead - the latest project from Silent Hill creator, Keiichiro Toyama. After the Slitterhead tease, many expected a Survival Horror title, similar to Silent Hill's Resident Evil roots, but instead, Slitterhead is an action game with the twist that you can swap characters on the fly. 

As you control a ghost who possesses various people, Jake compared playing Slitterhead to the likes of Driver: San Francisco or Watch Dogs: Legion.
