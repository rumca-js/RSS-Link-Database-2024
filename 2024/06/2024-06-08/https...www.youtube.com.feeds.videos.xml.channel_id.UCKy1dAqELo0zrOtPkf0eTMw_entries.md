Wuthering Waves reviewed by Jess Reyes on PC, also available on iOS and Android.

Wuthering Waves’ combo-heavy action, quick movement, and enticing Echo collection enhance combat and exploration enough to let it respectably stand out from its competitors. The fights are polished and sophisticated, rewarding reactivity and optimal builds and teams. On top of that, the Echo equipment system ties your character progression into the environment in a way that encourages you to uncover every inch of the map, which can be satisfying despite the repetitive process of fighting overworld mobs. Unfortunately, the story is a bland, exposition-heavy slog, with dull writing and voice acting. So while the quests aren’t its main draw, Wuthering Waves is still worth looking into as a refreshing spin on the typical open-world gacha RPG.

MultiVersus reviewed by John Carson on PC, also available on PlayStation and Xbox.

MultiVersus is an entertaining and deep platform fighter, but everything outside of simply jumping into a match as one of the eclectic characters in its cast is tedious. It’s worth coming back to experiment with things like Iron Giant’s perk build for team play or learning how to use a new character like Banana Guard to its fullest, but it would be easier to be glued to this game if there were more opportunities to earn memorable variant skins or provide a challenge in increasingly tough PvE battles. Instead, MultiVersus offers days of grinding to earn the opportunity to grind more to attain its most enticing rewards, whether that’s the chance to play as an upcoming character sooner or to swag out your favorite fighter. While it’s a huge boon that the actual fighting is solid and worth the time to dig into, it’s going to take an injection of more fun objectives to complete and more fruitful rewards to
