<p>To celebrate the release of the Sisters of Battle Codex for the 10th edition of Warhammer 40.000, I've created an extra detailed tutorial for The Order of the Golden Light. This is perfect for all kinds of models in golden armour, such as Stormcast Eternals or Adeptus Custodes (regardless of gender). In this tutorial, I also explain how to paint details like leather, cream-coloured robes, and purity seals, which are universally useful.</p>
