I love that there are passionate retro enthusiasts making new hardware for old computers. My latest acquisition is the A2FPGA - a card with a built in FPGA that can create a host of new expansion options. Right now the card will output video and audio over HDMI and simulate a "Mockingboard" card which greatly enhances the audio on a few select games.
