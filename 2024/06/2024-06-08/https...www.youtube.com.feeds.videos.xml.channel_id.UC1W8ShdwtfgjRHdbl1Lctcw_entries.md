I colorized , restored and applied face restoration and created a sound design for this video of Boston, Massachusetts 1949, we can see streetcars from the Maverick subway stations to the streets of East Boston and the Suffolk Downs racetrack, cars and stores and people going about their daily lives

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔sound design added only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
