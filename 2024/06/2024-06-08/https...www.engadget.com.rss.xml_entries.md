<p>I cannot think of a game from recent times that I’ve tried more aggressively to get my friends into than <em>Cult of the Lamb</em>. Maybe this is the whole cult mindset talking, but something about it all just begs to be enjoyed with a pal. I’m clearly not the only one who feels this way — fans have been asking the developers for months to add a multiplayer option so they can fight side-by-side with their friends. And now, it’s actually happening. <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> publisher Devolver Digital has announced an upcoming free update called “Unholy Alliance” that adds local co-op to the game along with a new playable character: The Goat.</p>
<p>“Unholy Alliance” will be available to download August 12 for PC, PS5 and PS4, Xbox Series S/X and Nintendo Switch. With the update, you’ll be able to take on the full campaign with the help of a second player. Per the announcement <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5rNzsy-5hA"><ins>notes</ins></a>, “The L

<p>The first gameplay trailer for <em>Neva</em> is out and, wow, I cannot wait to play this one. <em>Neva, </em>from <em>Gris</em> developer Nomada Studio, is an action-adventure game that follows the story of a woman named Alba and a horned wolf cub that has become her companion in a decaying world. While it appears thematically and artistically similar to <em>Gris, </em>the new trailer shows <em>Neva</em> will have a fair amount of combat, unlike its predecessor. And it looks absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>Publisher Devolver Digital released the latest look at <em>Neva</em> during Summer Game Fest. It doesn’t have a firm release date just yet, but it’s slated to come out this year. <em>Neva</em> will be available for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC. Prepare for an emotional experience.</p>

<p>Meta will now let you create massive community chats on Messenger with people you aren't connected to in any way. Back in 2022, the company launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-community-chats-163119498.html">community chats for Facebook Groups</a>, giving people belonging to the same groups an easy way to talk in real time. While that community feature is tied to groups on the social network, this one isn't — it will let use Messenger like Discord to connect with as many as 5,000 random people using the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company didn't post an announcement, but it confirmed the new feature's rollout to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/07/meta-quietly-rolls-out-communities-on-messenger/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>. All community chats will be displayed in one place inside the Messenger app, with each one having a &quot;Home&quot; space where administrators can post updates and announcements.

The studio is gearing up to release <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyper-light-breaker-hands-on-im-here-for-the-hoverboard-210045970.html"><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em></a>, a big ol' online adventure game, and it just revealed another title that's in development and due out soon: <em>Possessor(s)</em>.

<p><em>The Crush House</em>, the latest game from Reigns developer ​​Nerial, will debut on August 9.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Described as a &quot;thirst-person shooter,&quot; <em>The Crush House</em> has you playing as a camera person tasked with filming a 1999 reality show. You’ll cast four out of 12 potential characters for the show, and then film them at a secluded Malibu mansion for a week to create your season. The aim is to find the perfect reality-show balance of drama, romance and near-violence to keep audiences hooked. Similar to the Reigns games, you’ll have to play to different audiences’ desires to keep the show ratings up, and pleasing everyone is a near-impossible task.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There seems to be a lot more to <em>The Crush House</em> than just a run-of-the-mill reality show. From the trailer, there’s clearly some dark horror going on behind the scenes, and you’ll be able to explore the mansion af
