  <p id="YNOLoB">A 20-month old child was rescued after being trapped in a Tesla Model Y in Scottsdale, Arizona — where temperatures have exceeded 100 degrees this week — after its 12-volt battery died, according to a report from <a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2024/06/20/toddler-trapped-car-when-tesla-battery-dies-scottsdale/"><em>Arizona’s Family</em></a>.</p>
<p id="kHx4lR">The child was safely removed from the car after firefighters used an axe to smash through a window. But the issue raises concerns about why there isn’t an easy way to open the car from the outside when its 12-volt battery — the one that powers things like its door locks and windows — loses power.</p>

  <p id="t3KrlF">TikTok mistakenly posted a link to an internal version of its new AI digital avatar tool without guardrails, letting users create videos that say just about anything. The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/video/tiktok-ai-avatar-disinformation-hitler-digivid">hiccup was first spotted by CNN</a> and allowed the outlet to generate videos containing quotes from Hitler and a message telling people to drink bleach, among other phrases. TikTok has since taken this version of the tool down, while the version TikTok intended to launch remains available.</p>

  <p id="NlODVY">I have a bad habit of accidentally deleting files that I suddenly need a day later. Luckily, when files are “deleted,” they are actually not fully wiped from a system — and if they’re backed up to connected cloud storage services, well, those services have their own ways of handling deleted files. So it’s a good idea to know where to look.</p>
<p id="8uZxz1">This is also something to keep in mind if you’re selling or giving away a system — because in that case, you’ll want to make sure your files are completely, totally wiped.</p>
