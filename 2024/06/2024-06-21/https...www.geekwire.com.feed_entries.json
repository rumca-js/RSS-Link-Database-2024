That&#8217;s one of the takeaways from the announcement Friday morning of the members of Washington state&#8217;s new Artificial Intelligence Task Force, which was significantly downsized as part of the legislative process after Attorney General Bob Ferguson proposed the group in December. &#8220;The task force will convene technology experts, industry representatives, labor organizations, civil liberty groups and other stakeholders to discuss AI benefits and challenges,&#8221; the AG&#8217;s office said in a news release, explaining that the group &#8220;will issue findings, guiding principles, and submit reports with policy recommendations.&#8221; Here are the 18&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/here-are-the-18-members-of-washington-states-new-artifi", "id": 754096, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/here-are-the-18-members-of-washington-states-new-artificial-intelligence-task-force", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 90, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Here are the 18 members of Washington state\u2019s new Artificial Intelligence Task Force", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-21T16:39:37+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"732\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-21-at-7.52.55%E2%80%AFAM-1260x732.png\" width=\"1260\" /><br />AI can&#8217;t handle The Needling. The Seattle-based satirical news site that describes itself as &#8220;Seattle&#8217;s Only Real Fake News&#8221; is quickly learning some of the pitfalls that come with the latest AI models. The Needling, which draws inspiration from The Onion and the show Portlandia, publishes fabricated stories related to topics and people in the &#8220;real&#8221; news. A Needling story from 2022 \u2014&#160;Geologists: Mount Rainier Will Not Erupt During Your Lifetime, with Possible Exception of Very End \u2014&#160;started showed up last month in Google&#8217;s new prominent AI Overview section on searches related to Mount Rainier and an eruption.

So earlier this year they launched Equity Angels, a social impact organization aiming to increase the diversity in real estate tech or &#8220;prop-tech&#8221; by helping underrepresented founders land funding for their startups and get their businesses going. Equity Angels has a three-part strategy to reach that goal.
