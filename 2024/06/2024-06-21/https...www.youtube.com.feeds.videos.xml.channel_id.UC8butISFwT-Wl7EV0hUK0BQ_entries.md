On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Adrian Twarog. He's a Software Engineer who started his career by working as the office IT guy at a school and other offices for 10 years. He's since published YouTube courses that millions of people have watched.

We talk about:
How Adrian built his development skills by volunteering to taking on web design projects at work
How he started making design tutorials on YouTube and published 300 in a single year
How he was early to the AI engineering craze and published GPT tutorials with millions of views
– Adrian's many freeCodeCamp courses, and his gorgeous book on design fundamentals
Being a dev in Perth, Australia – on the other side of the Earth from Silicon Valley – yet still staying at the forefront of the state of the art

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1995 industrial rock anthem.

Also, I want to thank the 9,771 kind people who support our charity e
