		Another voice has joined the chorus criticizing the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act, this time arguing that important provisions of the AI Act do not follow a truly risk-based approach.

A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4870387">legal study</a> is arguing that the world’s first attempt at comprehensively regulating AI could lead to “legal uncertainty and potential over-regulation, as well as unjustified increases in compliance costs.” But there is a silver lining.

“The AI Act provides for sufficient tools to support future-proof legislation and to implement it in line with a genuine risk-based approach,” writes Martin Ebers, president of the Robotics &amp; AI Law Society (RAILS) in Germany and professor of IT Law at the Univ

		Switzerland is debating on how to proceed with the technical implementation of its national digital identity as the 2026 deadline for its launch approaches. The main tasks are developing the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/swiss-digital-identity-law-approved-by-parliament-lower-house">US$113.3 million</a> electronic identity (e-ID) and creating the trust infrastructure necessary for its operation. The European nation, however, is still deliberating on the best way to proceed despite growing impatience among e-ID stakeholders.

In January, the Federal Department of Justice and Police (FDJP) concluded an informal consultation on selecting the technology for the trust infrastructure. The decision, however, has not been taken yet, FDJP head Beat Jans explained at t

		A recent audit by the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) has called for the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) to improve its screening and vetting processes for noncitizens applying for admission into the United States and for asylum seekers with long-pending applications.

The report highlights several shortcomings in the current procedures and technologies used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Despite deploying new technologies like Simplified Arrival to enhance traveler screening, CBP lacks access to all necessary federal data for thorough vetting, <a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2024-06/OIG-24-27-Jun24-Redacted.pdf">according to the report</a>.

		The Kenya Police Service says it is working to put in place a new biometric system that will accelerate the processing of police clearance certificates.

A system upgrade will see the Automated Palm and Fingerprint Identification System (APFIS) replaced by a Multi-Biometric Identification System (MBIS).

The new system will have a storage capacity for ten million criminal records as opposed to the old one which could only hold two million.

A contract between <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia">Idemia</a> and the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) of the police service to this effect was signed Tuesday.

DCI Director Mohamed Amin, speaking during the signing ceremony, said the move is part of efforts to eliminate delays often noticed in the processi
