Saturday Night Live is one of the longest running, most successful network TV shows in history.  Looking at the juggernaut that is SNL today, it's hard to imagine a time that Saturday Night Live was so terrible, it was almost taken off the air completely.  It wouldn't be until SNL's creator Lorne Michaels returned to right the sinking ship that it would go on a run not unlike anything people have seen before.  Thankfully it wasn't cancelled, and Saturday Night Live is still going strong nearing it's 50th anniversary.
