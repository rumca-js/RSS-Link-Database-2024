## England shirt hangs heavily on Gareth Southgate’s edgy and frazzled team

<p>Despite four points from first two games, players look unconvincing and dream of winning trophy feels like a burden</p><p>How did this happen? The motif of the Gareth Southgate years has been the relative lightness of the England shirt and it has been well documented how the manager has gone about making it so; the cultural reboot, the relaxed and empathetic environment, the moves to seize control of the narrative. Having a host of top players helps, too. But all of a sudden, it has come to look awfully heavy again.</p><p>It is worth saying that England <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/16/serbia-england-euro-2024-match-report">have four points</a> from their opening two ties at Euro 2024. They have never won the opening pair of games at the tournament. They are on track to qualify as the winners of Group C.

<p>This game was supposed to be the moment when Robert Lewandowski marked his arrival but an ultimately comprehensive defeat to Austria means Poland’s stay at this tournament is all but over. Marko Arnautovic capped victory from the penalty spot after Wojciech Szczesny upended Marcel Sabitzer, giving them hope of qualifying from Group D when they meet the Netherlands here on Tuesday. On the eve of this game Szczesny told how Lewandowski’s presence would spook these opponents, but arguably Poland’s greatest export did not appear on the pitch until the hour and his impact was minimal at best, 11 forgettable touches.</p><p>A peculiar event, at least a lesser-spotted thing, happened with 24 minutes showing on the big screens on three sides of this stadium, the Marathon Gate at one end, once home to the Olympic flame, meaning a fourth is logistically tricky if not impossible.

## Yaremchuk completes comeback for Ukraine in victory against Slovakia

<p>Roman Yaremchuk is a big man but one blessed with a remarkable deftness of touch. Mykola Shaparenko’s ball into him after 80 minutes seemed neither one thing nor the other; too high to take in his stride, too low to head. But Yaremchuk cushioned it with an upward thrust of his leg and, in one movement, nudged it past Martin Dubravka. The shot barely had enough pace to get over the line, but it had enough, and Ukraine had a win that at half-time had seemed very unlikely.<br /><br />
 The comeback means that both Ukraine and Slovakia will qualify for the last 16 if they win their final group games next week. But bright and engaging as the game was, it was inevitably overshadowed by the political context. Even beyond Kylian Mbappé and Marcus Thuram and their explicit appeals against the Rassemblement National in France, politics has lingered just below the surface of this tournament.</p><p>There were the disgraceful chants directed at Serbs by Albania and Croatia fans in Hamburg; the
