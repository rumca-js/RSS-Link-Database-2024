But what about biology, the study of life itself? AI can sift through hundreds of thousands of genome data points to identify potential new therapeutic targets. While these genomic insights may appear helpful, scientists aren't sure how today's AI models come to their conclusions in the first place. Now, a new system named SQUID arrives on the scene, armed to pry open AI's black box of murky internal logic.", "id": 751066, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2024-06-tool-ai-genomics.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed", "source_obj__id": 251, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2024/squid-pries-open-ai-bl.jpg", "title": "New computational tool helps interpret AI models in genomics", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-21T03:54:26+00:00", "description": "In the pampas, Argentina's vast and fertile grasslands outside Buenos Aires, grain silos overflow with this year's harvest\u2014but nobody is selling just yet.", "id": 750797, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2024-06-argentina-surplus-harvest-farmers-milei.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed", "source_obj__id": 251, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2024/a-farmer-harvests-his.jpg", "title": "Argentina has surplus harvest, but farmers want more from Milei", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-21T00:00:01+00:00", "description": "Space exploration has always captivated our imagination, offering the promise of discovering new worlds and pushing the boundaries of human capability.
