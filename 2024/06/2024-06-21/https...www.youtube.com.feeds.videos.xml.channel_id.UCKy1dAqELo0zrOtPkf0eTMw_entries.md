In today's Daily Fix:
Elden Ring's high-anticipated DLC expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, is now available on all platforms, but some fans are puzzled by the lack of PlayStation trophies or Xbox and Steam achievements. Is it a bug? Did the game's update break something? Nope, don't worry, ye Tarnished, the DLC actually doesn't have any of those. The new land and enemies are hard as heck, so honestly completing the DLC is an achievement unto itself. In related news, Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red has congratulated Fromsoftware, as Shadow of the Erdtree has surpassed CDPR's own Witcher 3 expansion, Blood and Wine, as the best-reviewed expansion for a role-playing game. And finally, Sony's foray into VR gaming may be coming to an end as the company cuts investment into the technology.

Recent news confirms actor Jonathan Majors will be returning in an upcoming movie. Jonathan Majors will see a return in Martin Villeneuve’s indie revenge thriller Merciless. The film is about a CIA agent who goes to great lengths to save his girlfriend who is seemingly overpowered by sinister forces. Not much else is known about the movie, but it’s directed by Dune director Denis Villeneuve’s brother, Martin, and written by Frank Hannah.  While Majors avoided jail time, he was sentenced to one year of domestic violence counseling, where he’ll be doing a 52-week in-person program in LA. While he was convicted of reckless assault in the 3rd-degree, he was acquitted of intentional assault and aggravated harassment. The upcoming movie is being developed by producer Christopher Tuffin under his new global media venture that, “refuses to let the court of public opinion and selective prosecution undermine great art and artists.” Jonathan Majors is slowly working his way back into Hollywood f

Elden Ring’s highly anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree is here, and with it comes a slew of new regions to explore, bosses to conquer, and weapons to wield. By this point you’ve almost surely cemented your build, and you already know what works best for you in battle. But here’s the thing: Shadow of the Erdtree adds eight new weapon types to the game. That’s not eight new weapons -- it’s types, categories. These toys give you completely new ways to approach combat, so at the very least, you’re going to want to know how they work. This guide will explain each new weapon type, where to find one, and some recommendations for Ashes of War and accessories to make the most out of these new combinations.

Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch! This week Daemon is joined by Ryan McCaffrey, host of IGN's Xbox podcast, Podcast Unlocked, and Seth Macy, from IGN's Nintendo Voice Chat podcast. Now that Nintendo finally had their big summer showcase, all of the big three console makers have laid their cards on the table for the next 12 months. Who do we think will dominate for the next year? Will it be Xbox with their massive stable of first- and second-party games, Sony and their pivot to more family-friendly fare like LEGO Horizon and Astro Bot? Or will the Nintendo Switch go out with a bang with the one-two punch of a new Zelda and Metroid game?

Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance reviewed on PC by Michael Higham. Also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.

I was more than happy to revisit Shin Megami Tensei V, one of my favorite games of 2021, through this definitive version. Vengeance doesn't necessarily make drastic improvements per se, but I enjoyed the new twists, content, and quality of life upgrades it does bring all the same. And while the storyline and route exclusive to Vengeance are a bit better than the original, their appeal as a returning player is really just in how they shake things up at certain points. Don’t get it twisted, though – there’s never been a better time to play this hard-nosed RPG, if not for its satisfying turn-based combat, then for its masterful execution of a uniquely demonic world. There’s a certain attitude that comes through vividly in its art style, character design, and music that you just don’t get in other games. So, if you're simply looking for more SMT or have yet to experience Atl
