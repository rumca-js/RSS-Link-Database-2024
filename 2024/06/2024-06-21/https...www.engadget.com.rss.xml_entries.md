<p>Replacing a talent like the late Kevin Conroy, the man who voiced Batman in fan favorites like <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> and the Arkham game trilogy, must be a monumental feat. Conroy’s deep, steady voice defined the character for decades — it’s a challenge just to think of a cartoon Batman and not hear Conroy’s voice behind the mic. Sadly, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/arts/television/kevin-conroy-batman-dead.html"><ins>Conroy passed away</ins></a> in 2022 and Batman must carry on without him.</p>

<p>The illegal streaming service Jetflicks once boasted on its website that visitors could watch just about any TV show or movie “Anytime. Anywhere.” Now the five people behind the bootleg streaming service are facing some serious jail time.</p>
<p>A jury found Kristopher Dallman, Douglas Courson, Felipe Garcia, Jared Jaurequi and Peter Huber guilty in a Las Vegas federal court on Friday for conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement. Dallmann was also found guilty on two counts of money laundering and three counts of misdemeanor criminal copyright infringement for leading the Jetflicks operation, according to court documents and a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/five-men-convicted-operating-major-illegal-streaming-service"><ins>US Department of Justice press release</ins></a>.</p>

<p>I’ve always been a PC guy, even when other content creators were waving <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-macbook-140032524.html">MacBooks</a> around. I’ll state up front that I don’t game, so everything I do on a laptop revolves around video editing. To handle that, I use a high-end desktop Windows machine at home and up till recently had a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-04-gigabyte-aero-15x-review.html">Gigabyte Aero 15X</a> laptop for video editing on the go.</p> 
<p>Then, the Aero 15X died. The keyboard stopped working and the Lightning port failed. I didn’t even really mourn the loss — it was always noisy and hot. Battery life was never great, and to do any serious video work, I had to plug it in with a comically large and heavy power brick.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

In this episode, Devindra and Sam will answer your questions about Microsoft’s new hardware, and we'll deliver some of our first impressions. It turns out Microsoft may have finally gotten Windows on Arm support right! And some of the Copilot+ AI features are actually useful, surprisingly enough. But we'll have to wait a few months to test out the controversial Recall feature, which was pulled from the Copilot+ launch.</p>

<p>Did you know Meta has a customer services department? If you have a problem with Facebook, Instagram and the rest, you might find it hard to get <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-small-claims-court-became-metas-customer-service-hotline-160224479.html">some of that service</a>. Instead, people have been taking Meta to small claims court to get some kind of response to their complaints. Engadget spoke with five individuals who have sued Meta in small claims court over the last two years. In three cases, the plaintiffs were able to restore access to at least one lost account, but all eventually got the attention of Meta’s legal team.</p>
<p>The company has argued that it is not liable for more than $100 in damages according to its terms of service. However, some plaintiffs were awarded thousands of dollars — which still might pale compared to lost earnings for those whose businesses revolve around their Facebook or Instagram presence. We chart the mixed results of these users and

<p>Smart displays have evolved quite a bit since the initial debut of Amazon’s first Echo Show back in 2017. In fact, the category didn’t really come into its own until Google joined the fray with its own line of hardware about a year later. Now, both of these companies are essentially dominating the smart display landscape, with each offering their own take on a smart assistant with a screen.<br /><br />It’s that screen that can make smart displays much more useful than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-speakers-151515264.html">smart speakers</a>. Rather than just having a voice assistant recite the current weather report, for example, you can see a five-day forecast as well. The same goes for when you ask about your shopping list or calendar; it's simply easier to read the whole list or your day's appointments at a glance. Plus, touchsreens offer other benefits that speakers can't, like watching videos or checking your webcam to see who's at your front door. We've tested
