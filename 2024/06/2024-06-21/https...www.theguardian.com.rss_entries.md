Yes, there was a game of Super League to be played here but it was categorically the backdrop to a night celebrating the life of Burrow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/21/leeds-pay-touching-tribute-to-rob-burrow-with-victory-against-leigh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kylian Mbappé sat proceedings out with his broken nose and France, positive but achingly profligate, showed how much they will need him back. The first goalless draw in this European Championship was not short of scoring opportunities and it must concern Didier Deschamps that, without his talisman, the favourites were ultimately blunt. They could even have lost to a bright Netherlands team if the largely English team of officials had not, via a VAR check extending for more than two and a half minutes, disallowed a potential winner from Xavi Simons in what was a wafer-thin call.</p><p>France knew there was little to be gained in risking Mbappé from the start, particularly in a format that serves up little jeopardy for the big hitters. Protective tricolore mask or not, a stray elbow to the face could bring potentially catastrophic consequences for their summer and that of the tournament’s biggest star.

<p>Southgate’s selection gambles are not paying off, especially on the left, with an early exit the likeliest outcome</p><p>The longer England’s malaise goes on, the more this begins to feel like a weird mesh of previous tournament disasters. After almost a decade of positive vibes and considered, thoughtful management under Gareth Southgate, the end is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/20/denmark-england-euro-2024-group-c-match-report">threatening to unravel </a>in a way that was supposed to have been consigned to the past.</p><p>Never before have England looked so dysfunctional and misshapen under Southgate.

<p>Commanding and versatile actor known for his roles in M*A*S*H, Don’t Look Now and The Hunger Games</p><p>Donald Sutherland, who has died aged 88, brought his disturbing and unconventional presence to bear in scores of films after his breakthrough role of Hawkeye Pierce, the army surgeon in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/nov/22/guardianobituaries.filmnews">Robert Altman’s</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/mash-altman-comedy">M*A*S*H</a> (1970), one of the key American films of its period. It marked Sutherland out as an iconoclastic figure of the 60s generation, but he matured into an actor who made a speciality of portraying taciturn, self-doubting characters.

The answer was generally “no” but it still got England to the quarter finals in most tournaments. Thankfully – a difficult word to say, <a href="https://x.com/_fantasyED/status/1803787665352884226">just ask Stephen Warnock</a> – things have moved on and the big question is: can 11 Englishman be on the same pitch without looking completely disjointed and confused?</p><p>“Maybe I needed to give them more rest.

<p>She has always loved mysticism, shamanism and crystals – but until now, she’s kept it a secret. Her new documentary brings it all out into the open</p><p>When Suranne Jones’s husband first suggested they make a documentary about witch trials she felt uncomfortable. “What are people going to think?” she worried. After all, it would involve revealing her longstanding interest in “alternative medicines, shamanism and crystal work”. She grew up near Pendle, Lancashire, where the UK’s most famous witch trials took place, and where they would “all talk about the trials. My Auntie&nbsp;Jean&nbsp;especially.” Nonetheless, she’s rarely spoken publicly about her interest in witches. “Because it’s still taboo.”</p><p>Fortunately, that reluctance didn’t last and her two-part documentary, Suranne Jones: Investigating Witch Trials, airs on Channel 4 this week. In it, Jones visits famous sites of witch trials – Salem in Massachusetts, Bamberg in Germany and Pendle itself – to explore the horrifyi

He has lived there ever since, has a job and a family, and his mum spent 25 years working as a nurse for the NHS. “I’m British,” he says proudly. Philip J Morris’s production is a straight retelling of Bryan’s life shattering into pieces, after he receives a letter from the Home Office.

Herbert is under the impression that Ripley was a close friend of his son’s at Princeton; in fact they met, but only briefly. He reveals how young Dickie has been living the high life in Europe with his friend Marge Sherwood, but is now needed back home as his mother has leukaemia and not long to live. Since his son is ignoring his letters, will Ripley go on an all-expenses-paid trip to Italy to persuade him to stop idling and come home?

<p>After so many disappointments, whisper it, but on the evidence of a sneak peek, this could be the episode to remind us all why we loved these movies</p><p>It has been so very, very long since we got the chance to really experience a great Alien movie, that it is easy to forget what it actually feels like. The creeping sense of dread, the icky body horror, the fear of the unknown. Of all the horror experiences, nothing quite beats the idea of being stuck in space with something that wants to impregnate you, burst out of your chest and run around murdering all your mates, all the while dripping acid blood and delivering more phallic aggression than the average Andrew Tate video. HR Giger’s nefarious nasties really do feel as if they have stepped out of the seventh layer of hades, yet a succession of poor sequels and over-ambitious spin-offs to Ridley Scott’s original 1979 Alien and its bombastic 1986 sequel Aliens, from James Cameron, have reduced the franchise to just another sci-fi

He had been trying to cut the ribbon with&nbsp;his teeth, and his capped front tooth had fallen off. The groomsmen managed to find the tooth and&nbsp;a&nbsp;dentist who could reattach it – not easy on a&nbsp;Saturday. The groom and I raced there. He was super nervous, looking at his watch the whole time. It took the dentist five minutes to do it, and he didn’t charge! The groom did the big reveal about the tooth during his speech.

<p>Obviously you need to dress for dancing and good times – but have rain and mud covered, too</p><p>Something strange happens to perfectly normal people when they go to a festival. They lose sight of the coordinates of who they really are, and therefore of what they wear, and dress as “festival revellers”. Entirely sane women who you see on the school run in low-key summer dresses and trainers suddenly appear in flower crowns and face glitter and fairy wings, as if they’re in a student production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Someone who yesterday morning was leading a meeting in tailored trousers and a crisp shirt will pop up in hot pants and a cowboy hat. It becomes borderline fancy dress very quickly. I’m all for letting your hair down and having some fun. But, guys, come on! It’s a day out, not a personality transplant.</p><p>Great festival outfits are possible, though. Look at this photo.

In May 2014, he was made president of FromSoftware – the Japanese game developer known for its breakout dark fantasy hits Demon’s Souls (2009), Dark Souls (2011) and Bloodborne (2015), all games he himself directed. Back then, FromSoftware’s games were critical darlings with devoted followings, but they were not enormous bestsellers, shifting a few million copies each. But in 2022, the company released the splendid, imperious Elden Ring, a collaboration with fantasy writer George RR Martin that is not only Miyazaki’s masterpiece but also by far his most popular work: to date it has sold 25m copies. FromSoftware is no longer a niche maker of cult hits. It is now the home of a genuine blockbuster.</p><p>Has this changed Miyazaki’s outlook? Perhaps unsurprisingly, give

## Bronzing gel: the easiest route to a subtle, skin-boosting sunny glow | Sali Hughes on beauty

<p>This is a winner even for people who don’t like putting on makeup – it goes on with fingers and washes off at the end of the day</p><p>If you have no interest in makeup but occasionally feel you might need it, try a gel bronzer. I barely consider bronzing gel to be makeup at&nbsp;all. Makeup requires thoughtful colour selection, brushes and some aptitude for application. Bronzing gel needs none of that, so it’s the fastest, easiest way for someone of any gender to bring sunny, natural-looking colour to a dull, indoorsy or peaky complexion.</p><p>The gel can be applied with fingers like face cream (although if you’d prefer to buff it on with a fat, fluffy brush, be my guest) and instantly adds a golden-brown tint. It’s almost clear, so won’t cake or go ashy, and at the end of the day it washes off, so has none of the commitment of self-tan. Men love it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/21/gel-bronzer-natural-colour-skincare-washes-off">Continue readi

<p><strong>(Kill Rock Stars)</strong><br />Pivoting from riot grrrl to baroque ruffles, Nash nonetheless retains her trademark unvarnished lyricism on her fifth LP</p><p>Kate Nash is no stranger to pivots, as a kitchen-sink songwriter who later found success as an actor and with a new riot grrrl-tinged musical direction. Her fifth album is another about-face: with lush string arrangements inspired by old Hollywood and musical theatre, it feels more of a piece with Bridgerton than the boisterous wrestling ring of her Netflix show Glow.</p><p>Some songs successfully unite her conversational lyricism with this new sound. Kitsch and baroque, Horsie has a twinkly piano melody that could map on to Taylor Swift’s Enchanted – albeit one brought crashing down to earth by lyrics about crying in the car park of a DIY store. Ray and Millions of Heartbeats are similarly upfront about bouts of poor mental health, the former stripping back Nash’s frills to reveal simple acoustic guitar. Promising he

<p>From ferry rides to remote islands to stunning empty beaches, our tipsters are fired up by Scottish adventures</p><p>We live in the north-west Highlands of Scotland and frequently spend our free time having micro-adventures. We tend to avoid the busiest times of year. One February half-term, my sister and I loaded our ageing campervans with mattress and children and headed north to Inchnadamph. Our destination was the Bone Caves of Assynt. The wild camping was free, we were cosy tucked up in the van and awoke to a sprinkling of snow, blue sky and a glorious sunrise. We made the walk up to the caves and back through an uninhabited glen following the limestone river that bubbled over ground and occasionally underground too. The weather held for a chilly paddle in the sea at Clachtoll followed by a camping dinner cooked in the bitter cold at the car park at Knockan Crag with its incredible sculptures and geological timeline that the children deeply connected with.

With Carmy closer than ever to getting a Michelin-starred establishment up and running, self-sabotage must be on the cards for the volatile chef. Cue some magnificently quixotic tantrums over various “non-negotiables”, including a constantly evolving menu and tiny discrepancies in crockery sizes. It’s clear that nothing is ever going to be enough for Carmy, whom Jeremy Allen White continues to invest with nervy intensity. The Bear has always been a brilliant ensemble piece, though, and permanently exasperated sous chef Sydney (the superb Ayo Edebiri) has problems of her own to deal with. <em><br />

Releasing lost songs from those years that rank among Cash’s best, his son and bandmates explain how he came back around</p><p>In the early 1980s, Johnny Cash was at a low ebb. The Man in Black – who once sang to an audience of prisoners that he “shot a man in Reno just to watch him die” – had become little more than a family entertainer. “He’d turned into a weird old grandpa and he didn’t like that,” says the guitarist Marty Stuart. Stuart had just joined Cash’s band and “expected to see that guy who made Folsom Prison Blues and <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/27819-Johnny-Cash-Johnny-Cash-At-San-Quentin">San Quentin</a>.

<p>In this year’s presidential election, there is hardly a more divisive issue than immigration. Earlier this month, President Biden signed an executive order to temporarily limit asylum claims on the southern border, but just two weeks later he announced a citizenship pathway for hundreds of thousands of undocumented spouses. In his speech, he said: ‘I’m not interested in playing politics with the border or immigration; I’m interested in fixing it.’ As he faces accusations of being both too hard and too soft on the issue, will his political gamble pay off?

Esther Addley reports</p><p>When Nigel Farage arrived in Clacton to launch his campaign to become the Essex constituency’s new MP, he was greeted with an adoring crowd – and a milkshake in the face.
