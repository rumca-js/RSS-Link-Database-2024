We caught-up with KINGPIN, now formerly of EVGA, to talk about his plans for the NVIDIA RTX 50 series, a potential new video card company partnering with him, his claw machine, and talk shop. The video combines GPU discussion, GPU overclocking basics, and a studio or lab tour. Vince "KINGPIN" Lucido has taken over the former EVGA "gaming arena" in Taipei, Taiwan and now has his own overclocking and electronics shop there. This is the first time we've caught-up with him since the split from EVGA.
