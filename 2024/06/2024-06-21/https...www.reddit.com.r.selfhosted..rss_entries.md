I created two A records (for the domain itself and any subdomain) that point to my Oracle VPS that has a public IP. In the VPS, I am trying to setup a Wireguard connection to my Homelab. However I am struggling with configuration as I can see (with traceroute) that my domain is currently pointing to the VPS but it does not reach the Homelab. On the other hand, if I use the VPS IP + port I can see services deployed in the homelab. Can someone assist me on figuring out what is wrong?</p> <p>Also, do I need to open any other ports besides 443 and 80? </p> <p>And, since it is a .dev domain, do I also need SSL certificates in the VPS and/or the Homelab?</p> <p>(I have Nginx Proxy Manager in the homelab but that also does not appear to be working correctly) </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zbirinight"> /u/zbirinight </a> <br /> <span

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I'm not entirely sure if this fits into this subreddit but I will post this anyway.</p> <p>I've wanted to set up mail with my own custom domain because I thought it would be a cool thing. I've hosted my own mailcow server which worked incredibly well, but I didn't like the sogo web app. Now I've bought Zoho Mail for 0,9€ a month and now that I switched to there I actually started asking myself &quot;Why did I even switch from my gmail?&quot;. After a while I right now feel like this custom domain stuff is completely useless and I should've just stayed with my gmail and my google calendar, which I can link and synchronize with many other tools</p> <p>Edit: I just thought about the best way might be to have that mail for some special things and just leave the rest and my calendar stuff via google</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dezaku"> /u/Dezaku </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi All,</p> <p>Building out my home network and now onto the brains of the operations. I have been running dual NAS 918+/220+ as my 'servers.' Because they are always on, I figured this would be a good way to keep power consumption down. However, I have reached the point of VM HA + Docker Containers (Scrypted, PiHole, Kuman) that the NAS just seems to slow down during heavy loads. I have compared the processors in these and they are pretty weak to keep power efficiency up.</p> <p>My question for the community is not a keyboard rage discussion, but a genuine discussion. I have been thinking about getting a RPi5, but then I compared the specs to a mini-PIC, N100 from Amazon. I read all the stuff that an N100 doesn't have the brute strength needed for a true server all the time. However, it only uses 6W. The other option I have is an i7-3770 X86 box that I can deploy. However, with a 300W power supply, I think it is total overkill for some of this light

I found documentation which allowed me to remove that button, but is their anything within Authentik I can set which would ensure no new users are ever created unless I specifically do it myself manually. </p> <p>My concern is there being
