<p>Modern external computer data storage technologies (DAS, or Direct Attached Storage) run the gamut from USB hard drives, to optical discs (yes, still), to USB thumb drives, to the latest, greatest NVMe SSDs in high-speed Thunderbolt or USB 4 enclosures. </p>

<p>Windows updates don&rsquo;t just exist to annoy you and make you reboot your computer twice as often as you normally would. They often include some actually important stuff.</p>

<p>In 2017, Russia-based Kaspersky Antivirus Software was deemed an unacceptable risk to US national security, thus fully barred from use by federal agencies in 2018. Then, in 2022, Kaspersky earned a spot on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/626854/kaspersky-blacklisted-as-a-risk-to-u-s-national-security.html">US Federal Communications Commission&rsquo;s blacklist</a>.</p>



<p>But while federal subsidies could no longer be spent on Kaspersky, individuals and private businesses were still free to buy licenses. This will soon change with an upcoming US ban on Kaspersky&rsquo;s products.</p>

No, many an experienced gamer has been enticed by the glittering imagery and exciting performance promises of a shiny new manufacturer-made rig.
