That&#8217;s one of the takeaways from the announcement Friday morning of the members of Washington state&#8217;s new Artificial Intelligence Task Force, which was significantly downsized as part of the legislative process after Attorney General Bob Ferguson proposed the group in December. &#8220;The task force will convene technology experts, industry representatives, labor organizations, civil liberty groups and other stakeholders to discuss AI benefits and challenges,&#8221; the AG&#8217;s office said in a news release, explaining that the group &#8220;will issue findings, guiding principles, and submit reports with policy recommendations.&#8221; Here are the 18&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/here-are-the-18-members-of-washington-states-new-artifi
