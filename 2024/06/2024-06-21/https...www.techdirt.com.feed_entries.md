Definitely loving all of this. And right up front (just in case the defendant thinks she can rob Peter Techdirt to pay Paul Eric Posey), I&#8217;ll make it clear this post will be filled with colorful expression, hyperbole, highly opinionated takes on the lawsuit, and&#8230; possibly&#8230; archaic slang. A lot of people (especially the most [&#8230;]

If ExTwitter is the bastion of free speech, you would think that it would allow for the publishing of newsworthy documents revealing a politician&#8217;s funding briefings, right? Apparently not when that politician is politically aligned with Elon Musk, whose commitment to open discourse appears to be about as floppy as the Cybertruck’s giant windshield wiper. [&#8230;]

New York Governor Kathy Hochul’s response to the horrifying shootings in Buffalo in 2022 was not to look for ways to limit access to guns or improve mental health care. It was not to look into why law enforcement ignored the threats that the shooter had made, which they were aware of. It was not [&#8230;]

Fire up a wild ride across the cosmos with a fresh take on Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. In this third-person action-adventure game, you are Star-Lord, and thanks to your bold yet questionable leadership, you have persuaded an oddball crew of unlikely heroes to join you. Some jerk (surely not you) has set off a [&#8230;]

The inevitable is upon us: a police officer has been caught using Clearview AI for non-law enforcement purposes. That wouldn&#8217;t mean anything if the officer had private access to the most ethically dubious player in the facial recognition tech market. But he didn&#8217;t. He was using access purchased by his employer, so it wasn&#8217;t only [&#8230;]

Back in 2018 (pre-brunchlord owned) Deadspin posted the definitive video on Sinclair Broadcasting, highlighting in less than two and a half minutes how the local broadcaster is a right wing propaganda mill pretending to be a local news organization and the poster child for why media consolidation limits still matter: Like Fox News, OAN, Newsmax, [&#8230;]

As the line from the Bill Murray movies goes, &#8220;It&#8217;s Groundhog Day&#8230; again.&#8221; Back in 2015, Valve launched its &#8220;Paid Creations&#8221; platform on the Steam client, through which those who made game mods could list them in a marketplace for a cost.
