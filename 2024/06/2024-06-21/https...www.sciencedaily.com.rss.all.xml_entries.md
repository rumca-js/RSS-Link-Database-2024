Green hydrogen often, but certainly not always, leads to CO2 gains.

Behavioral analysis can provide a lot of information about the health status or motivations of a living being. A new technology makes it possible for a single deep learning model to detect animal motion across many species and environments. This 'foundational model', called SuperAnimal, can be used for animal conservation, biomedicine, and neuroscience research.

As part of an investigation to boost agricultural yields and develop crops that are resilient to climate change, Berkeley Lab scientists have introduced RhizoNet, a computational tool that harnesses the power of AI to transform how we study plant roots and root behavior under various environmental conditions. A paper describing their innovative deep-learning approach, combined with a unique hydroponic device that facilitates in-situ plant imaging, was published June 5 in Scientific Reports.

## Lab-grown muscles reveal mysteries of rare muscle diseases

Biomedical engineers have grown muscles in a lab to better understand and test treatments for a group of extremely rare muscle disorders called dysferlinopathy or limb girdle muscular dystrophies 2B (LGMD2B). The research revealed the biological mechanisms underlying the disease and showed that a combination of existing treatments could alleviate its symptoms.

## Research finds causal evidence tying cerebral small-vessel disease to Alzheimer's, dementia

While previous studies suggested an association of the most common cerebral small-vessel disease with dementia risk, new research provides evidence of causal link, identifying it as a major vascular factor.

## Restoring the Great Salt Lake would have environmental justice as well as ecological benefits

Inland seas around the world are drying up due to increasing human water use and accelerating climate change, and their desiccation is releasing harmful dust that pollutes the surrounding areas during acute dust storms. Using the Great Salt Lake in Utah as a case study, researchers show that dust exposure was highest among Pacific Islanders and Hispanic people and lower in white people compared to all other racial/ethnic groups, and higher for individuals without a high school diploma. Restoring the lake would benefit everyone in the vicinity by reducing dust exposure, and it would also decrease the disparities in exposure between different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups.

## Activating molecular target reverses multiple hallmarks of aging

Researchers have demonstrated that therapeutically restoring 'youthful' levels of a specific subunit of the telomerase enzyme can significantly reduce the signs and symptoms of aging in preclinical models. If these findings are confirmed in clinical studies, there may be therapeutic implications for age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, heart disease and cancer.

## How to make aging a 'fairer game' for all wormkind

Researchers have discovered a new fundamental mechanism governing the rules of ageing in worms. The researchers were able to manipulate the mechanism through genetic interventions which dramatically extend not just the lifespan of the worms, but also their health-span. In other words, trading weak, frail old age with vigorous golden years -- all without altering their diet, environment or other external factors.
