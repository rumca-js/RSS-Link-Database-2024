<p>The first in a new sci-fi series, Heavenbreaker is a fast-paced tale from author Sara Wolf that follows Synali von Hauteclare, a young woman living in the year 3442 with one thing on her mind: revenge. Heavenbreaker starts with a bang. Living in the poorest section of a space station orbiting a gas giant, Synali has just killed her noble father after he had her commoner mother killed. Not content with this act of revenge, Synali aims to take down the entire House Hauteclare by first entering a massive sci-fi jousting tournament between the great houses. Controlling massive military machines, the competitors risk death but Synali doesn’t care about the dangers involved as she teams up with former prince with vengeance of his own in mind. Synali rides in the titular Heavenbreaker (this made me think of Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim), fighting one enemy at a time against other machines that were left over from a great war. Whilst commoners starve, the ruling class amuse themselves
