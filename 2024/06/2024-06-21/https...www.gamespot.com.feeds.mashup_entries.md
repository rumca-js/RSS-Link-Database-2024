<p>Ubisoft San Francisco is making some gameplay and progression changes after taking in feedback from players for XDefiant.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1804186289471979968">executive producer Mark Rubin</a>, the team will double the speed at which players level up, which currently takes 3000 experience points. It will be changed to only require 1500 experience points. However, the levels that players need to unlock mastery skins will stay the same. This means that the grind for Gold status will be 14% faster than it was before, and unlocking weapon attachments will be even faster. The change is coming soon, but there is no date yet.</p><p>Rubin explained that XDefiant's main grind was its Weapon Mastery system. As it was the only grind the game had, the studio was afraid that players would max out the grind too fast and it would make unlocking skins feel less rewarding.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-boss-reacts-to-progression

<p>The next Assassin's Creed is once again featuring two playable protagonists. However, instead of having the choice of playing as a man or a woman (like in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey/">Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla/">Valhalla</a>), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> takes a page out of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-syndicate/">Syndicate</a>'s book and sees you play as two separate characters: a shinobi named Naoe and a samurai named Yasuke. Beyond the fact that it seems like Ubisoft is incapable of making an Assassin's Creed game with a woman as the sole lead, there doesn't seem to be a good reason as to why Yasuke (a real person from history--a first for a protagonist in the Assassin's Creed franchise) is also playable. Really, I can't see any reason as to why Assassin's Creed is doing two playable protagonists

<p>Still in early access, Evil Empire's The Rogue Prince of Persia is already an entertaining 2D roguelike, building a world composed of vibrant colors and dozens of monstrous soldiers that are ever-so-delightful to slice and crush over and over. For now, the game falters when it comes to delivering a compelling story, but its use of narrative breadcrumbs to lead the player through its assortment of levels helps to maintain an incentive to push forward when its challenging combat presents a roadblock that takes a handful of attempts to overcome. It's still too early to say anything definitive about the full game, but what's here is more than a sound bedrock--this is a great spiritual successor to Dead Cells that builds on an already engaging combat loop with smooth parkour and movement mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Rogue Prince of Persia, you play as the eldest of two princes, who has found himself stuck in a time loop.

<p>Oscar-nominated actor Benedict Cumberbatch has shared a key piece of news about the next Avengers movie. In a video for Netflix about his new miniseries Eric, Cumberbatch teased that his MCU character, Doctor Strange, will appear in the next Avengers film and it might start shooting relatively soon. Cumberbatch also spoke about how playing Doctor Strange gives him the financial freedom to explore "less commercial" projects.</p><p>"I am very much looking forward to Avengers next year, which is cooking up a storm," he said. It would be not surprising at all to learn that Doctor Strange is in Avengers 5 after it was reportedly recently that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deadpool-and-wolverines-shawn-levy-in-talks-to-direct-avengers-5/1100-6523946/">the film could feature a whopping 60 MCU characters.</a> In terms of his "next year" comment, that's likely in reference to when filming may begin on the 2026 movie.</p><div>          </div><p>Cumberbatch went on to say that he
