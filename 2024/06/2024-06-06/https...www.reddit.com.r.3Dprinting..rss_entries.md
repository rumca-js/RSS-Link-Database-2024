<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Currently, I am printing on a Creality CR-10, which has undergone numerous modifications over many years of use, such as a dual Z-axis, a 220V heated bed, an E3D Titan Aero head, BLTouch, an enclosure, a nozzle that can reach 300Â°C, better electronics, and more. Despite this, the equipment is becoming increasingly problematic and outdated.</p> <p>I am considering purchasing a new 3D printer and am torn between the Creality K1C and the Bambu Lab P1S. Initially, I was leaning towards the K1C, but I noticed a promotion on Bambu printers, which makes the P1S available for about 700Euro. This prompted me to reconsider.</p> <p>According to available comparisons, the Bambu Lab P1S is often regarded as the better printer. However, the initial models of the Creality K1 had some issues that are reportedly resolved in the newer K1C version. I would like to know what these issues were â€“ were they merely slicer setting issues, or something more complicated?</p> <p
