We all probably remember all too well just how things went down when Assassin’s Creed Unity launched in 2014. It was, after all, a memorable launch, and for all the wrong reasons.

Whether it’s gameplay reveals for highly anticipated, previously announced titles we’re talking about, or new announcements of games we all want to finally be turned into realities, here, we’re going to talk about pie-in-the-sky announcements that are almost definitely not going to happen anytime soon, but would generate a mountain of hype if they did.
