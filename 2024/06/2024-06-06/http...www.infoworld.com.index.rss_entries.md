<p>Many programming languages allow passing objects by reference or by value. In Java, we can only pass object parameters by value. This imposes limits and also raises questions. For instance, if the parameter value is changed in the method, what happens to the value following method execution? You may also wonder how Java manages object values in the memory heap. This article helps you resolve these and other common questions about object references in Java.</p><h2 class="toc">Passing object references in Java</h2>
<p>In this article you'll learn the difference between passing by reference and passing by value in Java and how to pass Java object references:</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3512039/does-java-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>What has always fascinated me about Moore’s law is that for more than half a century, the technological computing innovations we take for granted—from the PC to smart watches to self-driving cars—hinged on solving one small, specific problem: the distance between transistors on a chip. As our software-powered world becomes more and more data-driven, unlocking and unblocking the coming decades of innovation hinges on data: how we collect it, exchange it, consolidate it, and use it.</p><p>In a way, the speed, ease, and accuracy of data exchange has become the new Moore’s law.</p><p>TL;DR: Safely and efficiently importing a myriad of data file types from thousands or even millions of different unmanaged external sources is a pervasive, growing problem.
