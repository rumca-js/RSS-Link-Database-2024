Cooler Master's exhibit at Computex 2024 showed off a number of interesting cases, but also a "Super Conductor" heatsink -- that's Nobel prize worthy! The company also had some clever mini-ITX cases, including a new NR200P variant with a GPU showcase design cut into the panel.

DeepCool established itself in the affordable air cooler market a couple years ago with the AK620 and AK400, and now it's coming out with the DeepCool Assassin IV VC Vision (Vapor Chamber with a display on top). Vapor chamber air coolers have been tried in the past, but they are often prohibitively expensive to bring to market for CPUs. Now that CPU coolers have gone up in price and CPUs themselves have gotten harder to cool, there might be reason to try again -- we'll see when it releases later this year. The Noctua NH-D15 G2 would likely be in direct price competition with this air cooler, as they existing Assassin IV is already about $100.
