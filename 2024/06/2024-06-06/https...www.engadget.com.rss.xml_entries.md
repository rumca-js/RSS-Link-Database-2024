<p>Apple plans to build a password management app right into the next versions of iPhone and Mac operating systems, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/apple-to-debut-passwords-app-in-challenge-to-1password-lastpass?sref=10lNAhZ9">reported</a> <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman on Thursday. The new app, simply called Passwords, will compete against existing password managers like 1Password and LastPass, which typically charge people a monthly fee for generating and storing unique passwords. Apple plans to reveal the app at the company’s annual <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wwdc-2024-how-to-watch-apples-keynote-on-june-10-153000518.html">Worldwide Developers Conference</a> on June 10.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It'll soon be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple/">Apple's</a> turn to talk about its next major operating system updates, giving developers a chance to get their apps ready ahead of a broad rollout this fall. The company's Worldwide Developers Conference is right around the corner. Apple is sure to reveal some of the main features of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, as well as what's ahead for the likes of watchOS, macOS and visionOS at WWDC 2024.</p>
<p>Given the current tech climate, though, it seems likely that Apple is about to follow its rivals by making a big leap into the realm of generative AI. That could be a major focus of the keynote, since those are the only two letters investors seem to give a hoot about hearing these days.</p>

<p>Flat-top griddles are insanely popular. Even if an aspiring grill master prefers charcoal or pellets for their main machine, chances are they’re packing a griddle for smash burgers, breakfast and other items that need an even surface. Or, at the very least, they have an insert that transforms a grill into a flat top. Griddles are versatile and they keep a lot of the mess of cooking things like cheesesteaks, fajitas and fried rice out of your kitchen. However, they all basically offer the same premise: a large metal slab on some sort of cart that runs on propane. Since there’s not a ton of variation in the general design, the devil is in the details for companies like Blackstone, Traeger and Weber.</p>

<p>SpaceX’s Starship just soared through a series of critical milestones in its development, surviving reentry through Earth’s atmosphere and demonstrating a landing burn for the first time, before splashing down in the Indian Ocean. Starship lifted off from the company’s Texas Starbase at around 8:50AM ET for its fourth flight test, which focused on demonstrating the reusability of the massive spacecraft and the Super Heavy booster.</p>
<p>A few minutes after launch, Super Heavy separated from Starship and successfully performed a controlled descent to splash down in the Gulf of Mexico as planned. Starship continued flying for about an hour, starting its reentry a little after the 45 minute mark. Live views from an onboard camera made for a nailbiting final few minutes — at an altitude of about 33 miles above Earth, one of the ship’s flaps started to burn off. Then the camera cracked, obscuring the view so little more than flashes of light from plasma could be seen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, you could set it to send you an email notification when a number drops below or above a certain amount or when a column's value changes at all. You can also set rules that align more with a project manager tool, like getting a notification when a task's status or owner

Now, Dell has addressed this to a minor extent by dropping the price of both models by $200 across all configurations, the company told Engadget in an email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dell cited a couple of examples of high-end configurations.

## The Morning After: Humane’s AI pin is hot (not in a good way)

<p>Remember Humane’s AI pin that was hyped as the next big thing right up until people used it? Turns out being an unusable piece of tat wasn’t the only thing wrong with it: Humane has now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/after-its-reputation-went-up-in-flames-humane-warns-users-its-charging-case-may-too-215119193.html"><ins>advised users its charging case may pose a fire risk</ins></a>.
