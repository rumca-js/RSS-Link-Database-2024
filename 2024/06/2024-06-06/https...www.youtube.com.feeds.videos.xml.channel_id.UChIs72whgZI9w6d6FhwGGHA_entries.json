The company also had some clever mini-ITX cases, including a new NR200P variant with a GPU showcase design cut into the panel.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?

Vapor chamber air coolers have been tried in the past, but they are often prohibitively expensive to bring to market for CPUs. Now that CPU coolers have gone up in price and CPUs themselves have gotten harder to cool, there might be reason to try again -- we'll see when it releases later this year. The Noctua NH-D15 G2 would likely be in direct price competition with this air cooler, as they existing Assassin IV is already about $100.\n\nWatch our Noctua NH-D15 G2 coverage here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDxYlkp-_A\nWatch our coverage of Tryx's strange liquid cooler: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td0XORmSJp8\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store:", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXMcMgrVIxw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "source_obj__id": 428, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/wXMcMgrVIxw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Noctua Has Competition: Vapor Chamber Air Cooler (DeepCool Assassin IV VC)", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
