There are plenty of existing tools that companies use today to automate repetitive tasks, such as robotic process automation (RPA) software. But they are limited when it comes to more complicated workflows with dynamic processes and data. That&#8217;s where Tektonic AI comes in. The 5-person startup is building AI agents that understand natural language queries and help employees speed up how they get work done across various applications and systems.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ai-startup-lands-10m-seed-round-from-madrona-point72-ventures-to-automate-complex-workflows/">Read More</a>

The FTC is seeking information about Microsoft&#8217;s hiring of AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman and colleagues from Inflection AI earlier this year, the Journal reported, citing sources and records. It is investigating whether Microsoft structured a deal to gain control of Inflection without going through an FTC review.
