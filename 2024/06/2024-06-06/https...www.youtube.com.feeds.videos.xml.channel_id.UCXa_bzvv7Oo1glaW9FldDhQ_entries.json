It was, after all, a memorable launch, and for all the wrong reasons. \n\nTouted originally as the genre\u2019s big next-gen step forward, the game failed to do that in its initial form, attracting widespread criticism from critics and players alike not only for its severe technical issues and the plain and simple fact that at the time Unity came out, the formula had worn incredibly thin for more than a few people. \n\nLooking back, however, does Assassin\u2019s Creed Unity merit a re- examination? With its technical issues long fixed and the demand for old Assassin\u2019s Creed once again on the rise, are Unity\u2019s strengths able to shine brighter than they could back in 2014?", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQuO2AMSZto", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/YQuO2AMSZto/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "10 Years Later, IS ASSASSIN\u2019S CREED UNITY FINALLY FIXED?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-06T09:30:10+00:00", "description": "Heading into 2024\u2019s summer season, we\u2019ve got a number of major events to look forward to, from Summer Game Fest to Xbox Games Showcase to what have you, and though we have spoken plenty about the games that are likely to show up and be announced at all of these showcases, what we haven\u2019t spoken about are the games that have a much lower chance of being showcased in the near future- and yet, we just can\u2019t hoping that they do show up. \n\nWhether it\u2019s gameplay reveals for highly anticipated, previously announced titles we\u2019re talking about, or new announcements of games we all want to finally be turned into realities, here, we\u2019re going to talk about pie-in-the-sky announcements that are almost definitely not going to happen anytime soon, but would generate a mountain of hype if they did.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsmE1njREb0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/LsmE1njREb0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "15 UNEXPECTED Game Reveals That Will Make Us Go INSANE", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
