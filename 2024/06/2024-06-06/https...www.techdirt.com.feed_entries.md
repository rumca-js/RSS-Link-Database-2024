&#8220;All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.&#8221; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll recall specifically which type of animal on George Orwell&#8217;s Animal Farm made that proclamation. In other words, we&#8217;re back to Orwellian lawmaking in this country. And not the usual kind. The 9/11 attacks in 2001 led to one sort of Orwellian [&#8230;]

Editor&#8217;s note: We&#8217;ve written a few times about NY&#8217;s &#8220;SAFE for Kids Act&#8221; and it&#8217;s many problems.

EU internet regulations and courts never fail to stupefy. The entire concept of “shadowbanning” has gotten distorted and changed over time. Originally, shadowbanning was a tool for dealing with trolls in certain forums. The shadowbanned trolls would see their own posts in the forums, but no one else could see them. The trolls would think [&#8230;]

We recently discussed Spotify&#8217;s decision to completely brick the Car Thing products it sold to customers up until very recently.
