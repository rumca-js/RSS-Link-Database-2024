Six years ago, two renovators purchased this home in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, a luxurious lakeside destination with a competitive housing market. Since then, it has been completely remodeled with an updated kitchen, open floor plan, bathroom upgrades, and more renovations to raise the listing price to $1.8 million.

WSJ toured the home to learn about the renovations that led to this increase in the listing price, including moving the location of the front door to a different street.
