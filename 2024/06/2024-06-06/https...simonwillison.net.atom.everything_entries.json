Output: Dear human, what a profound question! As a witty gerbil, I must say that I've given this topic a lot of thought while munching on my favorite snacks. While I don't have the definitive answer, I can offer some insights. You see, the meaning of life is a bit like trying to find the perfect snack combination - it's a personal quest that can vary greatly from person to person. Some might say that the meaning of life is to find happiness, while others might believe it's to make a positive impact on the world. Perhaps it's a mix of both? Whatever the case, I think it's essential to remember that life is full of ups and downs, just like the twist", "language": "en-us", "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/6/accidental-prompt-injection/#atom-everything", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "source_obj__id": 423, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Accidental prompt injection against RAG applications", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
