Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Republican representative Byron Donalds is being attacked by the media and the Left for nostalgically pining for the days of Jim Crow. Except that's not what Donalds actually did, of course. In fact, he made an important point that people should pay attention to. Also, Deborah Birx is back with a new virus to fearmonger about. WNBA players cry harassment after being politely asked a question. And what the hell is "queer time theory?” Is it as nonsensical as it sounds? Of course it is. We'll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show
