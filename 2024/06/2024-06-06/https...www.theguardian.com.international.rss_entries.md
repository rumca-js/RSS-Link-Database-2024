<p>The Israeli leader is weak at home, unpopular among Jewish Americans and undermining peace. We shouldn’t prop him up</p><p>When Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin<strong> </strong>Netanyahu, feels squeezed at home – and trapped by a Democratic White House – he turns to his most trusted consigliere, Ron Dermer, to fix things. Dermer, an American-born Israeli who functions like a Republican Party operative, is the Bibi whisperer on Capitol Hill. His official title in the Netanyahu government is Minister of Strategic Affairs. In practice, he is a Republican fixer.</p><p>During a previous US administration, Dermer was the one who worked with then-Republican House speaker John Boehner to have his boss address a joint session of Congress, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/ron-dermer-john-boehner-israel-white-house-114771">infuriating</a> Barack Obama and his then vice-president Joe Biden by going behind their backs.

<p>The Anglo-American novelist’s angsty inner life is under the spotlight in this impressively researched biography</p><p>Christopher Isherwood was constantly pulled between the&nbsp;camp and the heroic. As a schoolchild, he went from military drills, emulating his soldier father, to doing square dances with his mother in her dresses. As a young man, he escaped upper-class England for 1930s Berlin with its drag acts and cabarets, but moved to the slums, wanting to join the workers he saw as the real heroes. Just before the war, he gave up&nbsp;politics and went to Hollywood, embracing the glamorous but rackety world of screenwriting. But he still needed the kind of challenge that he capitalised in his writing as the Test. He found a Hindu guru, Swami Prabhavananda, and tried out celibacy in his monastery just when he was finally within reach of the best gay scene he had ever encountered.</p><p>Katherine Bucknell’s Isherwood isn’t as camp as his previous biographer <a href="https://www

<p>This intricately plotted tale moves from a cruising spot for queer men in 1980s rural China to immigrant life in New York </p><p>Jiaming Tang’s debut novel opens in China in the 1980s, at the Workers’ Cinema in rural Fuzhou, a cruising spot for queer men. The cinema is described as a magical, almost utopian place, and the language Tang uses contributes to this&nbsp;dreamy, soft-focus vision. The men come to the cinema, he writes, “looking for love”; in the semi-darkness of old war movies projected onscreen for 10 hours a day, “men loved and loved and loved”.</p><p>Bao Mei, the woman who works as the cinema’s cleaner and ticket seller, also assumes the role of protector of the men’s safe space: she turns away policemen as well as the confused and sometimes grief-stricken women who come seeking their husbands. She’s been guided to the cinema by the ghost of her dead brother, Hen Bao, and it’s perhaps Hen Bao’s watchful spirit that keeps the cinema safe.</p> <a href="https://www.thegu

One hesitates to dispense any praise lest it encourages the film-makers; then again, the whole mean, bullying spirit of the franchise is to rile critics and “spoilsports” who supposedly don’t get the joke.

I did this because the film in question was supposedly one of the scariest ever made. I would wear the monitor, and my involuntary responses would provide everyone with quantifiable proof of just how scary it was.</p><p>But it backfired, because the film wasn’t actually very good. It was a generic found-footage horror called As Above, So Below; the central conceit of which was basically “Aren’t the Paris catacombs scary?” It turns out, they are not.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jun/05/under-paris-best-shark-movie-netflix"

<p>Serving up morsels of good news amid platefuls of horrors regarding animal cruelty, ultra-processed diets and the environmental impact of dairy and meat production </p><p>Robert Kenner’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/11/food-inc-film-review">2008 documentary Food, Inc</a> was an angry wake-up call to the evils of industrialised food production. Now Kenner is back for another bite, co-directing with Melissa Robledo. In the ensuing 16 years, the food crisis hasn’t gone away – but what’s changed is that the message is out there. So, if you’re already that person in the supermarket looking on the back of the crumpet packet at the ingredients list, or you’re cutting down on meat, there’s perhaps not a lot here that you won’t already know.</p><p>Like the proverbial turd sandwich, the documentary feeds its audience thin slices of hope wrapped around the stomach-churning stuff. In positive news, Senator Cory Booker is on a mission in New Jersey to make healthy fresh fo

<p>From nepotism to pay so bad that even Bafta winners are quitting the industry, the odds are stacked against working-class talent. No wonder stars like Lucy Beaumont want to ‘jack it all in’</p><p>Lucy Beaumont is furious. A <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/working-class-creatives-in-film-and-tv-at-lowest-level-in-decade">new report</a> shows that just 8% of TV and radio workers are from working-class backgrounds – the lowest figure in a decade. Beaumont – who grew up in a low-income, single-parent family in Hull, and is now an award-winning TV comedian, creator and writer – feels forced to speak out: “My mum became a writer with no qualifications, really struggled and couldn’t carry on in the industry. I was an actor, and then it was the recession and regional theatre went under.”</p><p>“Nothing has changed. It makes me want to leave. I’m sick of it. I can’t tell you the amount of scripts I’ve tried to help people get away and the actors I’ve tried to champion. I’m really ups

<p>People may be told their condition is a gift. But that’s little comfort when looking back at a trail of destruction</p><p>Discovering in my 40s that I have ADHD was a bit like how, I imagine, Tarzan felt when he found out he was a human and not a chimpanzee. For years he must have wondered why he was so different to the other chimps. Why did he have to use rope instead of his arms to swing from the trees? Why did he prefer to eat berries rather than termites and why, no matter how much another chimp shook its arse at him, he didn’t get the horn.</p><p>I know how it feels for people around you to think you are not doing things their way just to be annoying. “If only you applied the same focus to swinging from branches as you do to making things with your hands, you wouldn’t be so behind,” his chimp teachers must have said, as he whittled wood to make a cutlery set.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/06/has-it-made-me-creative-or-held-me-back-shaparak-k
