<p>Griffin Dunne’s memoir is full of wonderful tales about Martin Scorsese, Carrie Fisher and Madonna. But the killing in 1982 of his 22-year-old sister – and the subsequent trial – overshadows everything</p><p>Griffin Dunne has just written a book. He had been meaning to do so for ages. It was one of the items on his bucket list: learn a musical instrument, master Spanish and write his damn memoir. “One down, two to go,” he says, beaming in via video link from his home in upstate New York. The actor and film-maker turns 69 this weekend. He reckons that still leaves him time for the music and Spanish.</p><p>Dunne imagined his memoir as a family portrait in the style of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/20/david-sedaris-death-father-lou-happy-go-lucky">David Sedaris</a>’s Me Talk Pretty One Day.

<p>Self-help books and wellness culture celebrate the individual overcoming adversity. It sounds empowering – but you can’t think your way out of a broken system</p><p>There are two visions of childbirth that dominate the popular conversation. The first perspective is that unmedicated, natural birth is painful, scary, dangerous – even primitive. According to this way of thinking, to counteract the pain and danger of childbirth, we need to throw everything we can at it. Modern medicine delivered in a hospital – inductions, epidurals, C-sections – ensures the safety and often survival of babies and their mothers. Anything less is dangerous and irresponsible.</p><p>The other perspective: birth is a natural, physiological event; if there’s anything to be feared, it’s not labor and birth, but the consequences of messing with nature. This version of birth has many patron saints, among whom the midwife and author Ina May Gaskin may be the best known. According to this perspective, birth isn’

<p>My day consists of staring at different sized glowing rectangles – sometimes multiple at a time. This is called living life to its fullest</p><p>The primary task of all parents is to worry. You are given a thousand things to worry about across the course of the day, ranging all the way from “What’s that in their mouth?” to “How am I going to get this cleaning done?” across to “How will we get through the rest of the year?” and all the way back to “OK, they’ve got something else in their mouth now. What is it?”</p><p>Once we are done with the immediate worries, we have the joy of worrying in the abstract, about things entirely out of our control. This again moves on a spectrum all the way from whether they will be a good person to whether they will have a breathable atmosphere.

Nowadays, the tension is brought about by how ludicrously expensive it is to support a Premier League club. Football businesses (because they are not clubs anymore) might pretend they have some interest in the good old “legacy fans” who have been turning up for decades regardless of the ownership.

<p>Featuring more than 900 candid interviews, the Old Lesbian Oral Herstory Project seeks visibility for those long denied it</p><p>Two women who met as teenagers, fell in love, and stayed together for 69 years – spending all but the last decade of their relationship in the closet. A woman who, in her 70s, finally decided to come out to two friendly lesbian strangers she saw together at the grocery store. One woman, born in 1918, who found herself in a lesbian bar one day, not knowing such a thing existed, and finally felt at home.</p><p>These are all stories pulled from <a href="http://www.olohp.org/">the Old Lesbian Oral Herstory Project</a> (OLOHP), a catalogue of more than 900 interviews with lesbian seniors in the US.

<p>From a 17th century Swedish queen to drag king Stormé DeLarverie, a new book charts the myriad styles of women-loving women through the ages</p><p>‘When it comes to lesbians, clothes can really shape our place in the world,” says the fashion historian Eleanor Medhurst. “They can let us be recognised by others in our community, or allow us to be hidden to the world at large.”</p><p>She takes the example of Christina, Queen of Sweden in the 17th century. While Christina’s sexuality remains ambiguous, there is evidence she felt romantically towards women. Her clothing choices still speak to some lesbians today, Medhurst included, in the way that she toyed with stereotypes. “She would play with gender through her self-presentation,” says Medhurst. “She was often, throughout her life, mixing masculine and feminine clothes,” wearing men’s shoes, shirts and vests, as well as elaborate women’s gowns and skirts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/06/but-you-ha

<p>This mind-boggling documentary about a man who was imprisoned for a crime he didn’t commit will prompt rage, tears – and a sense of wild injustice</p><p>Right from the start, the events that led to Andrew Malkinson’s imprisonment for rape were absurd. It was summer 2003 when police pulled over the motorbike on which the then-37-year-old was riding pillion – the exchange, according to local reporter Neal Keeling, was “quite amicable”. Weeks later, those same officers receive a description of an attacker from a woman who has been raped. For some strange reason, they recall their brief encounter with Malkinson and decide he fits the bill. Malkinson is put into a police lineup, then a courtroom, then prison – for 17 years. Truly, though, he was transported into what he calls a “parallel nightmare world”, where he remained until last year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/26/appeal-court-overturns-manchester-rape-conviction-of-man-who-spent-17-years-in-jail-andrew-m

<p>By mastering the not-so-simple art of standing sideways, you also learn tenacity and mindfulness</p><p>It’s January 2022 and my seven-year-old son is standing on his skateboard at the top of a concrete ramp that’s known in these parts as a “funbox”. Right now, it doesn’t seem so fun. I can feel the fear vibrating from him. I’m urging him to give it a go. Pleading, almost. The reason for my fervour? Only a few weeks earlier I’d stood, frozen, in that exact spot, before taking my own plunge. And I know how amazing he’ll feel afterwards. So, we take baby steps. First, we hold hands as he rolls down. Then we hold fingers. Then fingertips. Then, finally, he does it all on his own. As he makes it, the smile on his face lights up the entire skatepark.</p><p>There’s a strange alchemy to skateboarding: in a flash, terror turns into delight.

<p>The star directs, writes, composes and acts in this beautifully shot and sombre film about an old-school hero in a 19th-century frontier community fraught with tragedy </p><p>This sinewy, sombre, handsomely crafted and beautifully shot western is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/viggo-mortensen">Viggo Mortensen</a>’s second feature as a director, an impressively authored movie in which Mortensen is also writer, composer and star. With almost anyone else that might be the recipe for narcissism, and yet the self-effacing and even reticent quality in Mortensen’s screen presence works against that danger. He is, however, certainly working within the traditional strong, silent template of the old-school western hero.<br /><br />

But The Matrix seemed to me then – and seems to me now – more exciting than any of them, first among equals in the previous century’s final graduating class. Rereleased for its 25th anniversary, this barnstorming sci-fi paranoia thriller, produced by action veteran Joel Silver and written and directed by the Wachowskis, holds up tremendously well. The martial arts sequences choreographed by Yuen Woo-ping are gripping and nothing about the bullet-time effects or production design feels dated. Even the ringing payphone – an unexceptional detail in 1999 – now looks like an inspired steampunk touch.</p><p>Ke

I love it stirred into Tunisian fricassee, which is a sandwich made with deep-fried bread stuffed with tuna, olives, boiled eggs and potato. Though harissa is perhaps the Tunisian ingredient I turn to the most, the country’s food encompasses so much more, and is a world of flavour I can’t get enough of exploring.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jun/06/tunisia-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi-houria-carrot-salad-pastries">Continue reading...</a>

They are called “cognitive books” as they are designed to help stimulate the mind of someone with dementia. He is a gerontologist, someone who specialises in understanding the processes of ageing.

<p>In the West Bank and Gaza, a growing number of birdwatchers are pursuing their hobby despite the dangers of the conflict</p><p>Sitting in the shade of an olive tree in the valley of Ein Qiniya, north-west of Ramallah, the wildlife photographer and birdwatcher <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MohammadSheaibi/">Mohamad Shuaibi</a> starts to enumerate the birds he can spot. Swifts and swallows flit and swoop, a short-toed eagle hovers in the distance, a jay perches on an olive branch and a kestrel returns to its nest in the limestone cliffs.</p><p>He also starts counting the times he has been stopped by Israeli soldiers or police out in the field with his camera. “I was detained four times already since October, and each time was worse,” he says. He now avoids going out at certain times: “To watch birds we need to go out very early in the morning. But most of the military operations are in the early hours, so you can be shot if you’re out around this time.”</p> <a href="https://www.t

<p>She is bringing her Eras tour to the UK this week. But just how easy is it to steer clear of the world’s biggest pop star? The Guardian’s stage editor finds out</p><p>Playing Cluedo, I realise I’ve cracked. There’s something about my Miss Scarlett card – that glint in her eyes, the knowing smile. Or maybe this is what happens when you have spent an entire month on an impossible mission to avoid the planet’s biggest pop star.

<p>Knepp estate was £1.5m in debt. Now it thrums with wildlife, visitors flock there – and farmers are stampeding to copy its success. We meet the star of a captivating film about this amazing rebirth</p><p>Take a stroll through the classic English countryside of West Sussex, and you’ll notice things becoming strange just beyond the village of Dial Post. Here, a patchwork of tidy fields bordered by neat hedgerows becomes a bamboozling maze of flowery glades and thickets of hawthorn, blackthorn and sallow. Rabbits dart between billowing brambles, watched by a fallow deer sporting furry new antlers. Stranger than the unexpectedly abundant plants and mammals is the cacophony of birdsong – the common melodies of thrushes, robins and blackcaps but also songs virtually extinguished across Britain: cuckoos, nightingales and turtle doves. Oddest of all is a clacking noise that sounds like two hollow sticks being banged together.</p><p>“Isn’t it a great sound?” says Isabella Tree, landowner, a

<p>Once upon a time, it was only hardcore bodybuilders who pumped themselves up with testosterone. Today it is no longer niche. But how dangerous is it?</p><p>Dave is an ordinary office worker in the north of England. He is about average height for a British man – 5ft&nbsp;10in – and to catch a glimpse of him between 9am and 5pm, the only hint that his leisure time is spent shattering the natural limits of human growth might be his slightly ill-fitting XXL shirt, or the fact that he sometimes wears women’s trousers, to better accommodate the steep slope between his trim&nbsp;waist and bulging thighs.</p><p>But in the videos and photos Dave posts online, to approving comments from other weightlifters (“huge progress  ”), he is a total beast. His chest looks herculean, and the skin on his legs is pulled so tight that it has ceased to conceal the striated landscape of muscles underneath. Looking at him brings to mind the peeled-back diagrams of an undergraduate anatomy textbook. You can

<p>Exclusive: as Reform courts Tory vote, chancellor insists election campaigns are won from the centre ground</p><p>At the first three doors that Jeremy Hunt knocked on during his canvassing session in leafy Godalming earlier this week were voters who said they would back the Conservatives.<br /><br />
 The chancellor, looking a bit embarrassed, admitted that they were not representative of what his team have been seeing across this Surrey constituency, where his 8,800 majority is under threat from the resurgent Liberal Democrats. <br /><br />
 But at the fourth door, Tory voters Stephen and Caroline told him they felt it was time for change. “The Conservatives have had a good crack at the whip,” said Stephen. “Unfortunately I think they’ve lost their way.”<br /><br />
 Many in Westminster were surprised when Hunt announced that he would be running again, with former colleagues like Theresa May and Michael Gove having decided it was time to stand down after 14 years running the count

<p>How does it feel to report on the refugee crisis when it’s also the story of your own family? <strong>Aamna Mohdin</strong> explains</p><p><strong>Aamna Mohdin</strong> was a young rookie reporter when she got her first foreign assignment. She was being sent to Calais to write about “the Jungle”, an informal refugee camp that had sprung up, made up of people hoping to cross the Channel for a better life in the UK. She was nervous about doing a good job but as she walked around the chaotic maze of tents with people cooking on open fires she began to feel strange and uneasy.</p><p>It wasn’t just the sadness of the stories she was hearing but something more like deja vu. When she told her mother about her trip, her mother asked a question that astonished Aamna: why would she want to go to a refugee camp when they had risked everything to flee one themselves? The question sent Aamna spiralling as she realised she had repressed her own memories of living in a camp in Kenya as a child, a
