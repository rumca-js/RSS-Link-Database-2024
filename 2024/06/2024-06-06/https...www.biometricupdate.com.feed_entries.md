		Travel is already one of the more visible touchpoints for biometrics in many people’s lives. But <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202405/could-be-25-years-before-tsa-gets-facial-recognition-in-all-us-airports">facial recognition</a> systems for customs and border control are just the beginning. A session at EIC 2024 breaks down how <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/digital-travel-credentials">digital travel credentials</a> (DTCs) will shape the future of travel through enhanced biometric security and a smoother passenger experience.

Digital identity brings its own challenges, notably around compliance with various <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202406/age-assurance-and-childrens-data-privacy-regulations-come-with-endless-complexit

		One of the more existentially pressing questions being discussed at EIC 2024 is the digital identity sector’s version of the thought experiment about a tree falling in the forest – namely, even if <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/uk-relying-parties-unclear-on-value-of-digital-ids">digital identity</a> has clear and present benefits, what happens if no one uses it?

In the concluding panel of the conference’s fourth day, “Are buyers ready for digital ID?,” Geraint Rogers, market SME: identity, fraud and financial crime for <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/daon-inc">Daon</a>, offers a reality check to digital identity insiders pondering why their products haven’t exploded into the mainstream.

		The UK’s first national election to require a photo ID document has finally set its date to July 4th. But as the deadline approaches, some experts are warning that the ID requirement alongside existing issues with voter registration could demand a “huge” logistical effort while rights organizations are decrying the voter ID’s potential for discrimination.

“The volume of registration and identification applications will pose a considerable challenge for electoral administrators,” says Toby James, a professor at the University of East Anglia and deputy director of the Electoral Integrity Project.

		There is a small but growing lobby made up of people who have been wrongly arrested as a result of facial recognition technology. Among them is Robert Williams, an American who was handcuffed in front of his family in 2020 after <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202107/the-key-to-coherent-biometrics-laws-it-might-be-found-in-people-whove-been-wronged">police facial recognition</a> misidentified him as a suspect in a federal larceny case.

Williams is now calling for police forces in Ireland to scrap their plans to deploy the biometric tech. In comments made at an event in Dublin hosted by the <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/">Irish Council for Civil Liberties</a> (ICCL) and issued in a release, Williams points to the risk that comes with using tools that are prone to
