The company, which specializes in cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) technology, said it opened a new 12,000-square-foot headquarters this week at the Corporate Campus East complex in Bellevue, Wash., doubling its desk capacity and increasing its number of conference rooms in the process. Acumatica, led by CEO John Case since early 2022, was previously based in Kirkland, Wash.

There are plenty of existing tools that companies use today to automate repetitive tasks, such as robotic process automation (RPA) software. But they are limited when it comes to more complicated workflows with dynamic processes and data. That&#8217;s where Tektonic AI comes in. The 5-person startup is building AI agents that understand natural language queries and help employees speed up how they get work done across various applications and systems.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ai-startup-lands-10m-seed-round-from-madrona-point72-ventures-to-automate-complex-workflows/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ai-startup-lands-10m-seed-round-from-madrona-point72-ventures-to-automate-complex-workflows", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "AI startup lands $10M seed round from Madrona, Point72 Ventures to automate complex workflows", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-06T05:25:38+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/microsoft-logo-1260x945.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Microsoft is facing a pair of new antitrust probes from the Federal Trade Commission, according to reports Wednesday evening from The New York Times and Wall Street Journal. The FTC is seeking information about Microsoft&#8217;s\u00a0hiring of AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman\u00a0and colleagues from Inflection AI earlier this year, the Journal reported, citing sources and records. It is investigating whether Microsoft structured a deal to gain control of Inflection without going through an FTC review. Microsoft reportedly paid around $650 million to Inflection in a licensing deal.
