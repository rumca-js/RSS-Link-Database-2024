<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a CM3588 Nas with 4 x 4TB M.2 SSDs I'm trying to setup and I'm stuck between the RAID configurations. It sounds like RAID-5 isn't the best since they SSDs are over 3TB; haven't fully confirmed this, just something I've read (LTT used it on this setup though). RAID-Z sounds like the best option so far, but only allows for 1 drive failure and I don't really see me utilizing &gt;8TB anytime in the near future. Because of this, I'm wondering if I should start with RAID-10, and adjust/recreate the configuration to RAID-6 and then/or RAID-Z later on?</p> <p>Just started looking into RAID configurations, so this is all new to me.

These are regularly manually imported into a content management system hosted on a windows remote desktop client hosted on AWS.

Unfortunately, the remote windows client is configured to not allow software to be installed to the client.
