## FFXIV Dawntrail Takes New Jobs And Stories Where FFXIV Has Never Been | GameSpot Preview

Between its critical cultural context and taking Jobs in a fresh direction, Dawntrail represents FFXIV treading new waters while staying true to itself.

For the first time in 11 years, the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV is embarking on an entirely new era for its story arc. Dawntrail sets its sails for completely separate regions filled with cultures and histories never seen in the game's long history--you can gather as much from the intro cinematic or the several Live Letters from director and producer Naoki Yoshida where he's talked extensively about this new journey. We had the chance to play an early preview build of Dawntrail, and while there wasn't any major story content, experiencing the land of Tural itself already told so many stories.
