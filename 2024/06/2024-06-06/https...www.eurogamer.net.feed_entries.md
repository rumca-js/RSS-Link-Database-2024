Killing Time - the cult classic haunted house FPS originally released for the short-lived 3DO console back in 1995  - is being resurrected and remastered by retro specialists Nightdive Studios, and the developer is teasing that 2002's The Thing is up next.
</p><p>
Set in 1930s Maine, Killing Time's spookily comedic action unfolds on the expansive, island-bound estate of a wealthy heiress who disappeared after attempting to use an Ancient Egyptian water clock said to grant eternal life. It's up to players, in the role of an Egyptology student, to fend off the estate's many horrors (ranging from killer clowns to demonic maids and cleaver-wielding chefs), locate the water clock, and end its evil influence.
</p><p>
It's a shoot-y, puzzle-y type of journey set across more than 45 seamlessly connected areas incorporating hundreds of

Yooka-Laylee, the Banjo-Kazooie-inspired platform collect-'em-up from developer Playtonic Games, is getting a bit of a spruce-up for PC and unspecified consoles by way of a newly announced (and dubiously named) remaster, Yooka-Replaylee.
</p><p>
The original Yooka-Laylee launched back in 2017, garnering modest acclaim - Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yooka-laylee">called it</a> a "gentle, irreverent platformer let down by spotty handling and a slight shortage of genius" - and was followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair-review-a-brilliant-and-better-follow-up">far superior side-scrolling sequel</a>, the Donkey Kong Country-inspired Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, two years later.

Yooka-Replaylee, though, revisits the colourful if occasionally cumbersome original wi

Microsoft is reportedly working on a remaster of Bungie's classic first-person shooter Halo: Combat Evolved and is eyeing up a PlayStation release - alongside multi-console releases for the likes of Hellbalde 2 and the next Doom - potentially marking a landmark moment for one of Xbox's most recognisable exclusives.
</p><p>
That's according to The Verge's Tom Warren, who (in the site's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">paywalled Notepad newsletter</a>) says a new Halo: Combat Evolved remaster is currently in the early stages of development. It's one of several new games being considered for Project Latitude - Microsoft's internal name for its new multi-console release strategy - following multi-console launches for the

As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-confusion-over-whats-happening-with-dragon-age-dreadwolf-this-week">Eurogamer reported earlier today</a>, Dragon Age Dreadwolf has a new name - which has now been formally announced as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. 
</p><p>
BioWare boss Gary McKay revealed the game's new title in a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/">blog post</a> today that also offered fresh details on the game - and an explanation for why its name has changed at the eleventh hour.

"Every Dragon Age game has delivered a new standalone story," McKay wrote. "Set in the world of Thedas, these tales explore epic locales and threats, always thrusting you into a new conflict. Each game also introduces a

Sony's rumoured Lego game based on Guerrilla's Horizon series will launch day one on both PlayStation 5 and PC, it is claimed. 
</p><p>
The latest word on this yet-to-be-announced project comes from reliable leaker Billbil-kun of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-tout-nouveau-jeu-de-playstation-a-paraitre-bientot-et-day-one-sur-ps5-mais-surtout-sur-pc-egalement-52357">Dealabs</a>, who said we can expect to hear more about the Lego Horizon game in the coming days, as part of Summer Game Fest. 
</p><p>
"In addition, the pre-order phase of the game will open right after this announcement. Thus, we can also conclude that we will probably be treated to a gameplay trailer during the Summer Game Fest 2024," Billbil-kun wrote.

This ebb and flow between the quiet and the loud serves as the fabric of Selaco, a new FPS developed by a small team and derived from 26-year-old technology. </p><p>The game's technically in early access, but you'd never guess it - the included campaign has a lot of meat and the experience is impressively polished. It's also more distinctive than most modern boomer shooters, almost a union between Monolith's seminal FEAR, Irrational's System Shock 2 and id Software's Doom. It's that latter point that is so crucial. Selaco is built on GZDoom, a fork derived from ZDoom, which itself was created thanks to John Carmack's release o

Microsoft has detailed the next selection of titles coming to Xbox Game Pass, arriving from today until the middle of June. 
</p><p>
This includes the return of Octopath Traveler for cloud, console and PC, as well as Octopath Traveler 2. Both of Square Enix's well-received HD-2D role-playing games are available to play via Game Pass as of today. 
</p><p>
Another highlight worth mentioning is Still Wakes the Deep, from the team at The Chinese Room that previously released Everybody's Gone to the Rapture. An atmospheric horror set on a remote Scottish oil rig, this one has been on Eurogamer's radar now for some time.

Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League game was a flop for Warner Bros. due to multiple issues resulting in a tumultuous development.
</p><p>
That's according to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, which details a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision as key reasons for the live-service game's failure.
</p><p>
During an earnings call last month, Warner Bros. revealed it had taken a $200m loss on Suicide Squad, while earlier in the year the company's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">the release

Chatty games journalist Jeff Grubb has discussed Dragon Age's appearance during the upcoming Geoff Keighley-fronted livestream a couple of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2PBbxN9HT0">times</a> this week, hinting that while "Dragon Age" was there, "Dragon Age Dreadwolf" would not be. 
</p><p>
On reddit and <a href="https://x.com/JackdawYT/status/1798438437126918288">social media</a>, this prompted fans to begin wondering whether BioWare was set to unveil a new Dragon Age 1 remaster, or that Dreadwolf

I have always appreciated this sentiment. Often when things are feeling overwhelming and I can&rsquo;t quite get my thoughts in line, I will put the kettle on. It's a simple ritual, but there is something incredibly soothing about the whole process. The selection of which leaf - something that changes depending on the time of day - and finding the perfect mug to go with it. Then, pouring the boiling water into a pot, watching as the tea leaves slowly start to stain it with swirls of brown, and, ah! That restorative first sip. As the warm liquid slips down, I take a deep breath. Yes, where there is tea, there is hope.</p><p>I thought of this again when I played the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1614440/B_Path_of_the_Teal_Lotus/">Steam Next Fest demo</a> for B&amp;omacr

It's about time the Scions of the Seventh Dawn had a holiday, right? After the adventures of A Realm Reborn and its four expansions - the latest of which took them to the moon and beyond - the heroes of Final Fantasy 14 deserve some sun.
</p><p>
And so they land in Tural, with its crystal waters, sandy beaches, lush jungles, and low poly tacos. Between its vibrant setting, its graphical update, and a new paint-splatting Job, Dawntrail is Final Fantasy 14 at its most colourful.

Of course, it's unlikely the holiday spirit will last too long. But at a recent hands-on preview, I was able to soak up the sights and explore a small portion of this new region in relative peace. All story details and NPC quest givers were removed to avoid spoilers, yet from what I played Dawntrail has a more playful tone compared
