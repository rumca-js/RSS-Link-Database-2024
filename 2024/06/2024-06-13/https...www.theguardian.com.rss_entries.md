<p>This unsensationalist documentary maps the appalling suffering a demagogue caused parents whose children died in the Sandy Hook shooting – and their legal fight against him. It is dizzying</p><p>On 14 December 2012, an armed man entered Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. He shot and killed 20 children aged between six and seven and six members of staff.</p><p>It is impossible to imagine a worse thing, isn’t it? The massacre of children and those trying to protect them. And yet it did get worse, thanks to a rightwing bloviator with merch to sell. The Truth vs Alex Jones maps, in painful, unsensationalist detail, the additional suffering the bereaved families were caused when Jones began to call the shooting a hoax. This, he told viewers of his “alt-right” internet show Infowars, was the “false-flag operation” he had been warning them about – a fake shooting orchestrated by gun control advocates to give the left the leverage it needed to come for patriots’ weapons.

<p>In a year of major releases from stars, the British singer has managed to come out on top with Brat: a catchy, internet-consuming album that captures a particular moment</p><p>How famous is Charli XCX? Even Charli XCX isn’t sure. “I’m famous but not quite / but I’m perfect for the background” she sings on I might say something stupid, the single slow-ish track off her new album, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/06/charli-xcx-brat-review-insecurity-obliterating-anthems-by-pops-most-human-superstar">Brat</a>. She’s not wrong; a good portion of the public knows the British singer, if they know her at all, for a top 10 hit from more than 10 years ago. But to a community of largely women, LGBTQ+ people and music critics, she is the biggest pop star in the world, the one everyone’s obsessed with – a persona Charli has leaned into with uncompromising, deadpan bravado: “It’s OK to just admit that you’re jealous of me,” she taunts on Von Dutch, the lead single off

<ul><li>Nation has never played in tournament knockout stage</li><li>Liverpool defender captains side in Germany opener</li></ul><p>Andy Robertson has explained how Scotland are being fuelled by the chance to attain “legendary” status in their homeland by emerging from the group stage of Euro 2024. Scotland, who open the tournament against Germany on Friday evening, have never played in a knockout phase of a tournament. This miserable run dates back to the 1954 World Cup.</p><p>“We want to make history,” said Robertson. “We know what’s at stake. What’s the worst that can happen? We join the list of Scotland teams who haven’t got out of a group? We have so many incentives here, but becoming a legendary squad is the biggest. That’s what has to drive us forward.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/prospect-of-becoming-legends-drives-us-says-scotlands-andy-robertson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The point guard has kept his off-court opinions to himself and rejuvenated his career in Dallas. But he has been unable to stop the relentless Celtics so far</p><p>Late in Game 3 of the NBA finals on Wednesday night, the Dallas Mavericks were on the brink. They had mostly clawed back a 21-point deficit to get within three points of the Boston Celtics. Then Luka Dončić, the Mavs’ superstar scorer, fouled out – the first time he’d ever done so in a playoff game.</p><p>That left Kyrie Irving, the Deadpool to Dončić’s Wolverine, to carry the day. And when he went on to score Dallas’s next four points, including an 18ft jump shot that cut the Boston lead to one, it looked as if the Mavericks might actually make this a competitive series. But it was not to be. Boston are simply too good and too tough.

<p>Since Kremlin staged fresh incursion on 10 May, strikes have increased threefold, destroying buildings and killing dozens</p><p>The apartment at 24 Liubovi Maloi avenue was an eerie ruin. Its roof and outer walls had disappeared. In one corner a row of suits hung in a wardrobe. There was a TV, a coffee cup, and a maroon jacket on a peg.

The flat’s inhabitants, however – Svitlana Vlasenko and her grown-up daughter Polina – were not coming back.</p><p>The Russian missile that fell on their building on a Friday night killed them and six of their neighbours.

<p>Brexit border checks are just the latest hurdle placed before British farmers. Labour must do more to back our food producers</p><p>Just before the election was called, news broke of Sue Gray’s so-called “shit list”: an inventory compiled by the Labour leader’s chief of staff of the immediate challenges an incoming Labour government would face. They include the potential collapse of Thames Water, prison overcrowding and chronic-acute issues with the NHS. One challenge was notable for its absence: the very real risk of empty supermarket shelves. The fact is British agriculture is in crisis. Its absence from the list is not entirely surprising. Historically, Labour has been an urban party. At the 2019 election it <a href="https://www.survation.com/conservatives-face-losses-in-rural-strongholds/">won just three</a> of the 100 most rural seats.

With crazy grandiloquence, it took us through all the big questions of existence, and the tragicomic limits of physical pleasure were finally exposed by the restaurant scene in which Mr Creosote explodes. Like John Landis’s portmanteau comedy The Kentucky Fried Movie from 1977, this was full of very chancy, confrontationally bad-taste material that wouldn’t get on television then or now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jun/13/fantasia-to-flesh-and-fantasy-the-coens-to-cavalcanti-anthology-films-ranked">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Hopkins’ Sigmund Freud locks horns with Matthew Goode’s CS Lewis in an imaginary encounter that is watchable but not terribly profound</p><p>Here is a determinedly old-fashioned drama, verbose and elaborate but also forthright and watchable in its way. It is a Stoppardian what-if meeting, imagining a bruising encounter between two celebrated historical figures who could, theoretically, have run into each other; it is adapted by director Matt Brown from a stage-play by American dramatist Mark St Germain, in turn inspired by a 2002 book by Harvard psychiatrist Armand Nicholi who had seized upon a report that Sigmund Freud met with an unnamed Oxford don just before his death. What if that don was CS Lewis, the Christian apologist who in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pilgrim's_Regress">his 1933 book The Pilgrim’s Regress</a> had mocked atheist Freudianism and every other sort of godless trendiness?</p><p>Anthony Hopkins plays Freud at the very end of his life in exile in L

Seven’s duties include refilling the soap dispenser, “which dribbled like a nosebleed”, gathering “bouquets of dark hair” from patients in the vacuum cleaner, and folding ageing towels that “hung like pigskin over my forearm, clinging directly to my meat, nursing on my heat”. She works in a windowless room, where “it&nbsp;was always warm, and the wet fluorescent light flicked my earlobes with its tongue”.

At the little spines on its head. A spiky crown. Like a unicorn under water. Such sightings are always precious, but this one feels unique because I’ve convinced myself that he’s giving birth. I watch them daily, these bony little fish, tails curling twigs, fanning delicately, performing their sunrise greetings (my heart!). This little fella angles this way and that while bubbles, <em>or perhaps</em> thousands of tiny seahorse babies ejected from his pouch, rise around him. It’s hard to tell, but who needs proof? The possibility is magical enough. Life is fairytale-special. If you choose to see it that way.</p><p>We’re in northern Greece, the seahorses and me, a few miles south-east of Preveza, in the Ionian sea.

<p>Having created a watchdog for the environment, the government took its teeth out and muzzled it. Can public outrage rouse the Environment Agency to action?</p><p>When Helen Nightingale joined the National Rivers Authority, the predecessor to the Environment Agency, in 1991, she thought of her work as a calling. She had been fascinated by nature since she was a child, when she used to poke around in the earth on her father’s allotment, looking for worms and beetles. In her job, Nightingale spent most of her time walking along the rivers in Lancashire and Merseyside, taking water samples and testing oxygen levels. She was responsible for protecting rivers, and she often learned about sewage and pesticide pollution from members of the public who called a dedicated hotline. “They’d phone you up and say, ‘There’s something wrong.’ And you would go out straight away,” she recalled. “You stood a much better chance of figuring out what was wrong if you could get there quickly.”</p><p>Night
