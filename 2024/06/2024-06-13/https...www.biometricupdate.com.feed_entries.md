		The entourage forming around eIDAS continues to grow, as the EU regulation pushes Europe toward a digitized society activated through the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202406/wallet-to-wallet-coverage-digital-identity-opportunity-arrives-with-eidas-2-0">European Digital Identity Wallet</a> (EUDIW) scheme. The non-profit go.eIDAS-Association, which aims at fostering interoperability and trust for digital identities, has partnered with a number of German tech firms and foundations to launch the eIDAS-Testbed. According to a <a href="https://www.eid.as/news/default-5ea2dac82c/">news item</a> on go.eIDAS’s website, the testbed “aims at fostering sovereignty, interoperability and trust for digital identities in Europe and beyond.

A letter addressed to Ofcom by eight peers, including online safety advocate Baroness Beeban Kidron, a former culture secretary and a former health minister, warns that a failure to use the regulatory powers it has been given by parliament will undermine faith in that regulation. Ofcom’s own figures put the number of children in the UK between 8 and 11 years old using social media at around 1.6 million.

		A recent study commissioned by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/regula">Regula</a> has concluded that digital IDs are not yet poised to replace physical documents in the near future. Despite the global rise in automation and biometric technologies for remote identity verification, the reliance on traditional physical ID documents remains strong.

The Forrester Consulting study, titled "<a href="https://regulaforensics.com/resources/digital-ids-study/">The New Imperative: Digital IDs</a>," highlights the methods companies use for identity verification. The findings reveal that 46 percent of organizations still manually verify documents, even in remote settings such as video interviews or when submitting passport scans. Some companies have a

		<a href="https://www.privado.id/">Privado ID</a>, previously known as Polygon ID, has officially separated from Polygon Labs to address the increasing global need for digital identity and reputation software that integrates onchain and online data. Developed by the creators of the Iden3 Protocol and PolygonID, Privado ID is designed to operate across various blockchain networks, not limited to Polygon.

Privado ID says it offers decentralization and private interactions to lower costs, reduce complexity, and minimize counterparty risks. The company’s self-sovereign identity (SSI) technology allows individuals to control their own data, facilitating direct interactions with apps for receiving benefits or information. It streamlines processes such as iden

		When it comes to safe, seamless and secure access to digital services for citizens, it is important to think big, be flexible, prioritize collaboration and ask a lot of questions in developing governance. So says a new report from the <a href="https://dtlab-labcn.org/en/">Digital Trust Laboratory of Canada</a> (DTLab) covering five key areas of identity and access management (IAM) for digitized services.

A release from DTLab says the report, sponsored by the Government of Yukon’s Department of Highways and Public Works, recommends preparing to transition to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/digital-travel-credential-trials-resume-with-flights-from-netherlands-to-canada">digital credentials</a> through pilot programs and continuous monitoring of progress and

		The southern African nation of Zambia is the latest country to join the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/50in5">50-in-5 campaign</a>, an initiative whose target is to marshal the development of safe, inclusive and interoperable digital public infrastructure (DPI) by at least 50 countries in the next five years.

SMART Zambia Institute -- the unit under the office of the country’s president responsible for digital government services – announced the membership in a press release last week.

The Institute said joining the campaign underscores the country’s desire to accelerate progress towards attaining the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

		<em>By Rohan Pinto, CTO for <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/">1Kosmos</a></em>

The increasing reliance on mobile devices for implementing secure, passwordless authentication in workplace settings presents a significant and evolving challenge, especially in environments where the use of mobile technology is heavily restricted, sometimes called Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities. For example, high-security/privacy call centers, manufacturing floors, or sterile clean rooms -- places where traditional methods of authentication, reliant on passwords or mobile devices, fall short.

This is not just a minor inconvenience; it's a significant barrier to maintaining both security and operational efficiency. In these unique workspaces, password
