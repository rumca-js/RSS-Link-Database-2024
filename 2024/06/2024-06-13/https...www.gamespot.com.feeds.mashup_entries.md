## Kunitsu-Gammi: Path of the Goddess Made Me Feel Smart In Ways Few Action Games Have Before

<p>When I first saw the Kunitsu-Gammi: Path of the Goddess' reveal trailer last year, the gameplay made it seem like Capcom was returning to the hack-n-slash action of Onimusha. The style of the trailer was rooted in a fantastical and monstrous Sengoku Japan setting, and a masked hero, armed with a sword, slashed through mobs of grotesque beasts. There wasn't much need to decipher it beyond that--it was an old-fashioned brawler from a developer that has done plenty of them in the past. Now that I've had hands-on time with the game, I find that my initial assumption from a year ago--while not entirely wrong--was only half right. Kunitsu-Gammi: Path of the Goddess is more than a return to a tried-and-true genre, and is instead shaping up to be an all-new twist on two genres I love.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4318829-pbkg1vqr.png"><img alt="Kunitsu-Gammi: Path Of The Goddess" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads

<p>Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons' <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Watchmen-2019-Alan-Moore/dp/1779501129?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">Watchmen</a> changed the shape of superhero comics for decades to come after it was first published by DC Comics from 1986 to 1987. After the film adaptation spent decades in development hell, Zack Snyder brought Watchmen to the big screen in 2009. Later this year, Watchmen is getting a mulligan from Warner Bros. Animation with a two-part adaptation. Now, the first teaser trailer for the Watchmen animated movies has arrived.</p><div>          </div><p>The trailer recreates a handful of iconic moments from the comic, including the murder of The Comedian, Doctor Manhattan's appearance in Vietnam, and Rorschach's investigation into a possible "cape killer." The animation style of the movie doesn't quite recapture the incredible details in Gibbons' artwork, but it seems to be largely true to the spirit of the original.</p><p>Snyder's Watchmen played pret

## Lies Of P Art Book Has The Best Cover We've Seen On A Pinocchio Book

<p>Lies of P isn't just a terrific Souls-like game, it's also a visual feast for the eyes. A dark retelling of the story of Pinocchio, the game combines its Bloodborne inspirations with a rich world of grim design and homicidal machines, and you can see just how a mountain of incredible art shaped the development of Lies of P. Now available to preorder, The Art of Lies of P will arrive on <strong>November 12</strong> and is priced at $50.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Pinocchio-Carlo-Collodi/dp/0062905279?tag=gamespot-promos-20">MinaLima Edition of The Adventures of Pinocchio</a> has a pretty awesome cover, but we'd argue Lies of P has it beat. That said, we wouldn't recommend swapping out the classic children's tale for The Art of Lies of P at story time. This spin on Pinocchio is, unsurprisingly, not suitable for youngsters.</p><h2>The Art of Lies of P -- $50</h2><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/

<p dir="ltr">There are a few interesting guns to be claimed from the Pale Heart of the Traveler in Destiny 2's new expansion, The Final Shape, but The Call is the standout. This little sidearm fires rockets--it's only the second rocket-assisted sidearm to come to Destiny 2, with the first being Indebted Kindness, a gun you could only get from the Warlord's Ruin dungeon. The Calling is easier to get and comes with a mess of good perks, but most importantly, it hits like a truck; once you get a good one of these, it's likely to stay in your loadout for a good, long time.</p><p dir="ltr">The Call sports a lot of options for perks, and quite a few of the combinations are pretty good.

The show is based on the novel of the same name by Daniel P. Mannix, which was also used as the basis for Ridley Scott's Gladiator and its sequel. However, the first full trailer for Those About To Die reminds us more of Starz's Spartacus series than the Gladiator movie starring Russell Crowe.</p><div>          </div><p>Anthony Hopkins has top billing in this series as Emperor Vespasian, which is also his first leading role on television since HBO's Westworld.

<p dir="ltr">The Dragon Ball franchise has seen its share of video games throughout its history, but none make players pine for the past more than the Budokai Tenkaichi series of fighters. Despite robust story-based adventures like Kakarot and the frantic 2D madness of Dragon Ball FighterZ, fans still long for the behind-the-back, go-anywhere feeling of the PS2 era. Later this year, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is finally answering the call, and we recently visited Bandai Namco at Summer Game Fest to get our hands on the future of Tenkaichi.</p><p dir="ltr">Our hands-on session allotted us about 30 minutes of Versus Battle gameplay, where we could choose a team of up to three warriors--for both ourselves and the CPU--and a stage to fight in.

<p dir="ltr"><em>The ROG Ally is celebrating its 1-year anniversary today, June 13, 2024. Below, we look back at how it overcame launch troubles to become a viable Steam Deck competitor, and a sign of how open the portable PC market can be.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Given how much the market for portable gaming PCs has exploded ever since Valve launched the Steam Deck in early 2022, it's remarkable to remember that its closest competitor is just a year old. Over a year after the Steam Deck hit the market, Asus followed up with the ROG Ally, a Windows-based gaming handheld that, on paper, was a big step-up over Valve's handheld. Not only was it more powerful (and potentially significantly so), it offered an experience that, at the time, was lacking on Valve's Linux-based SteamOS when it came to game and launcher compatibility.

<p dir="ltr">In 2021, Amazon Games launched New World, a robust MMO that served as the publisher's first-ever release. After three years and a multitude of changes, Amazon is planning on continuing its maiden voyage into uncharted waters, as New World Aeternum will bring the full experience and more to consoles this fall. We had the chance to check out Aeternum during Summer Game Fest, and so far, Amazon's adaptation adventure is smooth sailing.</p><p dir="ltr">Our hands-on began with New World's robust character creation system, and we could have spent the entire session there. Dozens of options in multiple categories--face, hair style, scars, tattoos, and more--give plenty of agency over how your characters will look, and the virtual cursor system makes selecting each one easy.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317960-nwa_announce_archetype_musketeer_v2_1920x1080.jpg"><img alt="Muskeeter archetype" src="https://www.gamesp
