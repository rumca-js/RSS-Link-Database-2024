  <p id="c63ssi">Microsoft delivered the best Xbox showcase I’ve seen in years over the weekend. Layoffs, studio closures, and Xbox exclusives coming to PS5 had fans worried about the future of the platform, but Sunday’s showcase put many of those fears to rest.</p>
<p id="7fSycp">Xbox chief Phil Spencer kicked off the show with <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> — cementing that Xbox is now the home of <em>Call of Duty</em> — before moving on to new reveals and gameplay. Three titles stood out for me personally: <em>Perfect Dark</em>; <em>Fable</em>; and <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>.</p>

  <p id="lrBc4J">TikTok is introducing a new way for musicians on the platform to promote their music — this time through a video series.</p>
<p id="MdYUGA">The series, called “Off the Record,” is produced by TikTok and features musical artists like Shakira, Charli XCX, and Meghan Trainor. The short clips are similar to series like <em>Song Exploder</em> or <em>The New York Times’</em> “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/diaryofasong">Diary of a Song</a>,” where artists talk about their inspiration behind songs, the writing and recording process, and more. The videos — some of which have already gone live — are shared by artists over the course of June.</p>
