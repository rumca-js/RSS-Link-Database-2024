Daniel Fitzgerald, a State Department Official responsible for allocating U.S. foreign aid to the Caribbean, told a Veritas investigative journalist that President Biden’s $300 million plan to send Kenyan cops to fight gangs in Haiti is “truly a disaster.”

“It’s truly a disaster and we’re throwing so much money at it."

“It’s a lot of money. But that’s like chump change compared to what we’ve dropped in Haiti before… and look where it’s gotten us.”

“[People] feel obligated, responsible to care [about Haiti].”
