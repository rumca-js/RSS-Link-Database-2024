<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 13 June 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01919-8">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01919-8</a></p>Interstitial oxygen conductors have the potential to enable efficient oxygen-ion transport at lower temperatures. An approach combining physically motivated structure and property descriptors, ab initio simulations and experiments is now proposed for the discovery of fast interstitial oxygen conductors.
