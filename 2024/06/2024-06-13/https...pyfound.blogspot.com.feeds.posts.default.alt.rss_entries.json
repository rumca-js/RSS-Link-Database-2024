These changes are all centered on our membership experience: making it simpler to qualify as a Member for Python-related volunteer work, making it easier to vote, and allowing the Board more options to keep our membership safe and enforce the Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>Voting Members will be asked to vote on these items during the July Board of Directors election. If the majority of voting members vote in favor of any of the changes, those changes will be incorporated into the bylaws and go into immediate effect.</p>\n<p>We're sharing these changes with you today as an opportunity to understand why these changes are being proposed, and to give you an opportunity to ask questions of the Board before you vote, either by emailing <a href=\"mailto:psf-elections@pyfound.org\">psf-elections@pyfound.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:membership-wg@pyfound.", "id": 706832, "language": null, "link": "https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/for-your-consideration-proposed-bylaws.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://pyfound.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss", "source_obj__id": 267, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "For your consideration: Proposed bylaws changes to improve our membership experience", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
