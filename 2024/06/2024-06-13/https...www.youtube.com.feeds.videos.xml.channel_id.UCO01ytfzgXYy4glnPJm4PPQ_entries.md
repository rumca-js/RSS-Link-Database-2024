Today on the Matt Walsh Show, trigger warnings are becoming more and more common as Hollywood puts them in front of movies and television shows to help the audience avoid "trauma." But since when did "trauma" become such a common and frivolous thing? We'll talk about it. Also, cable news journalists are worried that Trump will get elected and then put them into camps. Is there any validity to that concern? The WNBA is enjoying unprecedented interest and publicity, yet will still lose 50 million dollars this year.

We'll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.
