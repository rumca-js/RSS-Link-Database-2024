This pedantic point of fact helped my friends and me process this disturbing incident as tragicomedy.</p><p>This is how racism is widely understood – as a character defect that causes predatory boors like Steve’s mate to shout slurs in the street – but it is a woefully shallow analysis.

<ul><li>West Indies 149-9, New Zealand 136-9, WI win by 13 runs</li><li>Sherfane Rutherford rescued co-hosts with blazing 68 not out</li></ul><p>New Zealand is on the brink of elimination at the group stage of the men’s T20 World Cup after falling 13 runs short of West Indies’ target at Brian Lara Stadium in Tarouba. The co-hosts recovered from a horror start as Sherfane Rutherford came to the rescue with an unbeaten 68 to build a total of 149-9 that proved to be enough for victory on Wednesday night local time.</p><p>West Indies then restricted New Zealand to 136-9 in the chase as Alzarri Joseph claimed four wickets and Gudakesh Motie took three, to seal a third consecutive win and a spot in the Super Eight stage. New Zealand have lost both of their T20 World Cup matches so far and would need to defeat Uganda and Papua New Guinea while hoping that other results go their way to leapfrog Afghanistan and snatch a spot in the next phase.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/art

<p>A fond but frank memoir of an eccentric showbiz family shaped by tragedy</p><p>Early in this deft and multifaceted family memoir, Griffin Dunne admits that&nbsp;he has been known to tell the odd tall tale. His father was the journalist and author <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/aug/27/dominick-dunne-trash-top-drawer">Dominick Dunne</a>, and his aunt and uncle <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/joan-didion">Joan Didion</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jan/02/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries">John Dunne</a>, so while most children might fabricate a story about an imaginary trip or pet, for example, Dunne’s family was privileged enough that he could invent a casual encounter with Jackie and John Kennedy at church and&nbsp;have it be believable. “I had been brought up on stories told by people who loved to tell stories,” he writes. And&nbsp;while he quickly learns not to trust anything&nbsp;he has heard, particularly from his fa
