Superhero movies have dominated the box office for well over a decade at this point, but it wasn’t always like that. While it may look dated by today’s standards, the 1978 Superman movie paved the way for the genre on the big screen.

Superman definitely raises some questions. Like why did Clark start a love triangle against himself? What was with that little poem recital? How did Lex figure out that would be lethal, let alone that it existed on Earth?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Superman!
