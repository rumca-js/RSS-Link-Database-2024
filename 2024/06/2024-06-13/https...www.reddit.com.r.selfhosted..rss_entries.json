So the solution I came up with to have both mail and calendar working for my work:</p> <ol> <li>Mail - continue using RoundCube for my [<a href=\"mailto:name@customdomain.com\">name@customdomain.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:name@customdomain.com\">name@customdomain.com</a>) email linked to my iOS and MacOS</li> <li>Calendar - signing into Google Calendar via my [<a href=\"mailto:name@customdomain.com\">name@customdomain.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:name@customdomain.com\">name@customdomain.com</a>) and sending out calendar appointments through Google Calendar</li> </ol> <p>I'm ok that #2 even tho it means that I don't see my appointments in RoundCube/Mail but at least my calendar functions seems more reliable via Google Calendar (also connected to Mac Mail app). So I can admin my inbox and calendar via the Mail app on iOS and MacOS.</p> <p>So is there any downside to this setup?

I run qBittorrent and a bunch of other apps (radarr/sonarr etc.) in docker containers on my Linux server. I run all of them through a vpn using gluetun. I prefer to access all these apps on my personal computer, because it\u2019s a lot quicker/easier to do so. Does that defeat the purpose of the vpn in this scenario? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/quantumfedex\"> /u/quantumfedex </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1depyby/if_im_running_services_in_containers_that_i_pass/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1depyby/if_im_running_services_in_containers_that_i_pass/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 703346, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1depyby/if_im_running_services_in_containers_that_i_pass", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "If I\u2019m running services in containers that I pass through a vpn, am I exposed if I access the web UIs of these apps on a computer on the same network that\u2019s not on a vpn?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-13T03:40:28+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have a server I only want in and out traffic to be on the local network.
