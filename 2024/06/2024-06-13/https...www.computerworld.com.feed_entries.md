<p>When you think back to the heady days of last week, it’s hard to ignore that the introduction of <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2140505/wwdc-apple-intelligence-makes-email-great-again.html">Apple Intelligence</a> on Monday now means the company formerly known as “behind on AI” just overtook Microsoft to bring home the world’s biggest and most trusted platform for generative AI (genAI).</p>



<p>The reason it’s hard to ignore is because it is true. Sure, Microsoft Copilot does lots of things already and once you can actually spend cash on Surface devices that run Copilot, Microsoft will be a powerful AI platform.  But Apple will be, too. (You can understand why <a href="https://w

<p>Adobe will change language in the terms of use for its software, as it seeks to clarify its position on content ownership and the use of customer data to train generative AI (genAI) models. </p>



<p>The move comes in response to a customer backlash over an update to Adobe’s terms of use for Creative Cloud and Document Cloud software earlier this month. Some customers had interpreted the language to mean Adobe would gain access to their work for training purposes. </p>



<p>The updated terms include several changes, including a statement that Adobe “may access your content through both automated and manual methods, such as for content review.”</p>

<p>The built-in Windows Reliability Monitor remains an oft-overlooked troubleshooting gem. It’s actually a specialized part of Windows’ general-purpose Performance Monitor tool (perfmon.exe). While more limited in scope and capability, Reliability Monitor (a.k.a. ReliMon) is much, much easier to use.</p>



<p>Reliability Monitor zeroes in on and tracks a limited set of errors and changes on Windows 10 and 11 desktops (and earlier versions <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-performance-team/using-reliability-monitor-for-troubleshooting/ba-p/372962" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">going back to Windows Vista</a>), offering immediate diagnostic information to administra
