Three years on from its original release for the Switch and PC, Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin has made its way over to the PlayStation 4, with the developer porting the game to go along with the launch of its remastered predecessor, and though it obviously isn’t the new mainline entry we’re all waiting with bated breaths for (we’re going to have to wait until next year for that), for fans of the franchise, and especially for fans of traditional JRPGs, it’s still a game that’s rather easy to recommend. 

Boasting an endearing and heartfelt story, a genuinely engaging and mechanically complex combat system, meaningful customization options, and a gorgeous art style, Monster Hunter Stories 2 is a solid game that’s worth your time.

But though that strategy means there’s never a shortage of great first party exclusives on PlayStation consoles, that abundance of riches means there’s also more than a few properties that have, as a result of being crowded out by other fellow first party franchises, been forced into dormancy. Here, we’re going to talk about a few such franchises that we would love to see sequels for but know how unlikely (if not impossible) that will be.
