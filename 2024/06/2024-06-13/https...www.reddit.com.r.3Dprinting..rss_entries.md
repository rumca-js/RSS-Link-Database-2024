<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all. So I'm new to resin printing and very limited on space. To be exact, I'll be doing all the printing/cleaning etc.. in my work-room which I also spend a lot of time in as I work fully remotely. For me, health is critical. This means I've opted to mostly adopt this users guide (<a href="https://www.asianjoyco.com/resources-tutorials/ventilation-upgrades-for-3d-resin-printing">https://www.asianjoyco.com/resources-tutorials/ventilation-upgrades-for-3d-resin-printing</a>).</p> <p>However, I also wanted to include my washing station in there. As I live in a high apartment and almost only have inward ventilation, I have to vent it out. As stated in the guide, there is a chance of fire hazards due to the electronic sparks of an extraction fan. I'm extremely cautious about the fumes getting ignited and causing a chain reaction into the 5L IPA container. This leaves me with only 1 option. An explosion-proof system. This is all fine for me, but for the

Basic idea is to increase deflection strength across layer lines by offsetting walls like brick laying.
