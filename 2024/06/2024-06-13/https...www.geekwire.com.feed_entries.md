Business leaders, GeekWire sponsors and members, neighbors and representatives from the Fremont Chamber of Commerce gathered for the event on the sunny decks of the office space, which in previous incarnations was a coffee shop and a residence. Cyclists pedaled past on the Burke Gilman Trail and seaplanes departing from Lake Union buzzed overhead during the requisite ribbon cutting. Given that the occasion was focused on GeekWire&#8217;s new workspace, we took the opportunity to talk to guests about their offices&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/companies-are-still-feeling-their-way-on-return-to-office-as-geekwire-celebrates-opening-of-new-hq/">Read More</a

The new Seattle startup aims to democratize information about cybersecurity products&#160;while connecting buyers and sellers through its platform. &#8220;The root of the problem is that what gets discovered is what gets marketed really well,&#8221; said Cypher co-founder and CEO Vinay Narayan.
