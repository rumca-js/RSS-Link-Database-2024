In today's Daily Fix:
The latest patch for Helldivers promised sweeping changes, fixes, and tweaks across nearly every aspect of the game. Some of the less popular stratagems got buffs (like the Orbital Gatling Cannon), visible supply lines on the galactic map, tweaks to the lighting, invite-only lobbies, and more. Tons more. And the new Viper Commandos warbond has introduced new skins and weapons to the game. In other news, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is almost upon us, and publisher Bandai Namco has released sales figures for the base game. Around 25 million units of the game have been sold since launch, and we can expect a few more copies to be sold once the DLC arrives. And finally, Discord integration with the PS5 is finally here, so all you console Helldivers can now keep your chats private when squading up with randos.
