Realistic-looking graphics are great, but does it come at a cost? Are AAA games suffering from our preoccupation with high graphic fidelity? Lately, the gaming discourse has been centered around AAA gaming not being sustainable because of the cost and time it takes to make them, and developers are likely to take less risk because of how much money is involved. This video discusses AAA games taking less risk and why graphic fidelity could be the main culprit.
