We love making this series of discussion videos! These are just for fun -- don't take them too seriously. Watch our "Is Intel Actually Screwed?" Round 4 with Gordon! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGd6Dsm_lo

This video features some unstructured thoughts and discussion about AMD's current market position, and for this one, the focus is on its GPU division. We talk about AMD Radeon vs. Intel Arc vs. NVIDIA GPUs, including topics such as pricing strategy and whether AMD needs a flagship "RTX 5090" (or whatever it'll be called) competitor.
