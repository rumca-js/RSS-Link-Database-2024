<p>Tesla shareholders have again approved Elon Musk’s multi-billion dollar pay package several months after a Delaware court <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musks-56-billion-tesla-pay-package-has-been-tossed-out-by-the-court-074235803.html"><ins>invalidated</ins></a> it. During the electric car maker’s annual shareholder meeting, the company's stockholders signed off on a proposal to reinstate Musk’s pay package, currently worth about $48 billion, according to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-13/tesla-vote-results-approve-elon-musk-s-56-billion-pay-deal"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Judge Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware’s Chancery Court previously called the Tesla CEO’s pay, worth $56 billion when it was first approved in 2018, an "unfathomable sum.” Musk responded by threatening to move the company’s state of incorporation to Texas. During Tesla’s meeting, shareholders officially

<p>A class action lawsuit filed by two women against Apple seeks damages for 12,000 current and former female employees for allegedly underpaying them. <a href="https://altshulerberzon.com/2024/06/13/apple-sued-in-class-action-alleging-sex-discrimination/"><ins>The complaint</ins></a> says the tech giant “systematically” paid them a lower wage than their male employees over a four-year period.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed in a California state court in San Francisco County on Thursday claims Apple’s systematic behavior of sexual discrimination stems from a policy that set employees’ salaries based on their previous employment, according to the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FwcGx

<p>Jabra has been a mainstay in the true wireless earbuds category since 2018, but it won’t be any longer. Shortly after revealing two new products in its Elite lineup <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-updated-its-elite-earbuds-with-an-le-audio-case-improved-anc-and-more-090046844.html">this week</a>, parent company GN announced that it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-says-its-exiting-the-consumer-headphones-business-a-day-after-launching-new-earbuds-164518215.html">shutting down</a> its consumer earbud business to focus on other audio devices. The news was a shock given the timing and quickly put a damper on any excitement around the second-generation Elite 10 and Elite 8 Active.</p>
<p>“This announcement by GN is in an effort to concentrate resources and efforts on Jabra's enterprise products within audio, including enterprise-grade true wireless earbuds, as well as video and OTC hearing devices,” a Jabra spokesperson told Engadget. “While this puts a stop to the l

<p>My task for our AI overlords was simple: help me crack the <em>New York Times</em> Spelling Bee.</p>
<p>I had spent a large chunk of a Saturday evening trying to shape the letters G, Y, A, L, P, O and N into as many words as possible. But three hours, 141 points and 37 words — including “nonapology”, “lagoon” and “analogy” — later, I had hit a wall. A few more words was all I needed to propel myself into Spelling Bee’s "genius" echelon, the title reserved for those who unscramble 70 percent of all possible words using the given letters, and the point at which the puzzle considers itself, effectively, solved. (100 percent solvers are bestowed the rank of "queen bee," but even I have limits.)</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>My human mind was clearly struggling, but this task seemed like child’s play for AI, so I fired up ChatGPT, told it I was trying to win the Spelling Bee, gave it my letters and laid out the rules. “Give me a list of every word that can be formed with

<p>I’m sure some of you have looked at robo mowers as Roombas for your yard but, sadly, many of them require you to install a boundary wire around the perimeter of your lawn. And any product that requires you to dig a trench is the opposite of what “low effort” means to me. That’s why I was interested in trying Segway’s Navimow i105, its £945 (around $1,200) GPS-equipped mower which eliminates that busywork. And keeping your lawn neat and tidy is a job that’s all busywork.</p>
<p>Ask a gardener and they’ll tell you the secret to a great lawn is to seed a piece of flat land and then mow it into submission. Regular, militant mowing kills off all the other flora, ensuring only grass can grow until everything looks well-manicured. But that relentless mowing requires a lot of time, a luxury I’ve never had. It’s the sort of job a robot mower was born to do, given it can scuttle around and trim grass without you there.</p>
