Life is Strange: Double Exposure will support and respect whichever ending you chose in the original Life is Strange game, developer Deck Nine has said as part of an extended look at its upcoming sequel.
</p><p>
Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-returns-with-its-original-protagonist-now-all-grown-up">last week during Summer Game Fest</a>, Double Exposure continues the story of the Life is Strange series' original teenage protagonist Max Caulfield, now an adult.
</p><p>
But the surprise return to Max's story immediately prompted questions from fans as to whether their previous narrative choices will be supported, and their consequences shown on screen. Now, we know more.

We&rsquo;ve had cat focused forums, cat-themed flash games, art and even a website dedicated to pictures of cats in sinks, aptly named <a href="https://www.catsinsinks.com/">Cats in Sinks</a>. Not to forget about I Can Haz Cheezburger and Nyan Cat. (Look I can&rsquo;t list them all, we&rsquo;d never get to the video game part.) The rise of social media has brought us accounts, some with millions of followers, solely focused around someone&rsquo;s cat. If you&rsquo;re online, there&rsquo;s truly no escape from our fluffy friends; &lsquo;cats&rsquo; is one of the most searched for terms on Google after all. Thanks to this feline fever, you really shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised when I tell you about Neko Odyssey - an upcoming game all about photographing cats for social 

## Ark: Survival Ascended is the worst optimised Unreal Engine 5 game we've seen on console

Ark: Survival Ascended, a UE5 remake of 2015's Ark: Survival Evolved, might just be the worst to date. </p><p>In remaking Survival Evolved, originally an Unreal Engine 4 game, over to the new UE5, developer Studio Wildcard opted to tap into as many new cutting-edge rendering features as possible while also shipping the game on Series X and Series S (via Game Pass) plus PS5 and PC. There are no last-gen versions, thankfully, but even on current-gen machines it's clear that the game provides a stern performance challenge. </p><p>After all, despite the original island from Survival Evolved arriving intact, the difference in fideli

Everywhere, the next project from ex-GTA producer Leslie Benzies, is getting a closed beta next week.
</p><p>
It's a "zero-code toolset" for aspiring game developers to build experiences, or remix other people's, and share them with the community - a bit like Media Molecule's Dreams.
</p><p>
The Builders Beta will launch on PC on 18th June and includes plenty for players to use, play and remix from a number of studios.

Sonic Dream Team has received another update, adding additional levels and an endgame mission.
</p><p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-3d-platformer-sonic-dream-team-announced-by-sega">Apple Arcade exclusive was released in December last year</a>, but developer Hardlight has continued to update the game ever since.
</p><p>
Previous updates added the Sweet Dreams Zones as a bonus for completing the main adventure. This new update adds two new Acts to the zone, with new level features and new takes on missions.

Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Konami's forthcoming remake, will have a visual filter to recreate the look of the original game.
</p><p>
On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDCppzRLwpw&amp;rco=1">Xbox podcast</a>, producer Noriaka Okamura discussed more about the game and confirmed the Legacy control style "applies a visual filter to more faithfully recreate the screen look of the original game".
</p><p>
Konami has since confirmed to Eurogamer this visual filter can be applied to either control style, meaning players can use modernised controls with the classic filter. More information is expected soon.

David Gaider, creator of Dragon Age and lead writer on the series' previous installments, has praised BioWare's reveal of new game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> - the first title in the series he will not have had a hand in.
</p><p>
Gaider left BioWare in 2016, two years after the launch of Dragon Age: Inquisition, after early work on the ill-fated Anthem. Now, the brains behind Dragon Age's world of Thedas has shared his own thoughts on this week's look at what's next for the franchise he founded. 
</p><p>
"I've been pretty busy, but I finally got a chance to sit down and watch the gameplay reveal," Gaider wrote in a long <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801052703130526077">thread</a> on social media platform X. "Overall,

Fans of the 1993 film Jurassic Park will be able to revisit many locations from Isla Nublar on Jurassic Park: Survival's release, but also some previously unseen spots.
</p><p>
Jurassic Park: Survival was announced at last year's Game Awards. It's a single-player action-adventure coming from Saber Interactive in partnership with Universal, and will take place the day after the events of the film. 
</p><p>
The announcement trailer, which you can see for yourself below, showed us poor scientist Dr. Maya Joshi running from the now-destroyed visitor centre before coming face-to-face with a mighty T-Rex. Other than this brief tease, further details were quite sparse.

It is not at all weird and horrifying, not remotely a glimpse into the abyss. Moments after first arriving off the bus you won't find yourself trapped in the garden by a bridge with a rotten plank. You won't accidentally murder a magpie while chopping down tall grass. And you thoroughly <em>won't</em> be stalked by a nameless tormentor as you go about your gardening work.</p><p>Okay, thankfully for everyone I can't keep that up. Grunn is weird: deliciously, horribly weird, and while I don't want to spoil too much, I can at least tell you that you're in for a surprise. The game's made by Sokpop, after all, the tiny collective whose games like to subvert expectations. Also, the atmospher

Sony is rolling out the ability to join Discord calls from your PlayStation 5 without relying on the service's PC or mobile apps.
</p><p>
This means you can now use the Discord tab in the PS5 Control Center to access a Discord server or DM group directly, and from there pick from the available voice channels to join. 
</p><p>
You might not see the option available today - Sony says it is rolling out first in Japan, before Europe, Australia/New Zealand, the Middle East and finally the Americas in the coming weeks. See how it all looks in the video below:

It cast you as one of the last Exiles in space - a kind of monk - and tasked you with outrunning a universe-swallowing darkness known as the Gloom. But underneath, it was a game about maths. A game about careful space flight and fuel economy, and about planning many steps in advance to execute a plan. Run at it with the expectation of easy progress and you will meet with an abrupt thump. It wasn't a game for everyone. But the people who persevered, loved it. Chris Tapsell called it "dense and brilliant, like a neutron star" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-banished-vault-review">Banished Vault review</a>. "When it all clicks, and the fog of numbers and tables and energy calculators clears, it's magic."</p><p>To celebrate that a bit, I
