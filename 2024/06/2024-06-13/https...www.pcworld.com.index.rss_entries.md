<p>What makes a great PC case? If you ask ten different computer nerds, you&rsquo;ll get ten different answers. But if you ask <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@GearSeekers&amp;xcust=2-1-2366793-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Nick Cole of the Gear Seekers YouTube channel</a>, you&rsquo;ll get answers that come with some incredible experience and insight.</p>

<p>Laptops have been getting slimmer and lighter, but that&rsquo;s come with a cost: recent laptops don&rsquo;t have enough ports anymore.</p>



<p>Thankfully, you can expand your laptop&rsquo;s connectivity with a USB hub&mdash;and the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Adapter-Docking-Station-Monitors-Compatible/dp/B08CRCRPCJ/&amp;xcust=2-1-2366348-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Mokin 6-in-1 USB-C Hub is just $34 right now</a>.

<p>Shopping for a graphics card on a budget is often a study in compromises, and video memory is usually the first thing to get cut.</p>



<p>The Radeon RX 6500 XT <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/562257/finally-amds-radeon-rx-6500-xt-brings-ray-tracing-under-200.html">launched at $200</a>&mdash;a pittance in today&rsquo;s market of four-figure &ldquo;enthusiast&rdquo; graphics cards&mdash;but did so with just 4GB of GDDR6. Asrock is giving it a boost with double the memory, at a price tag that&rsquo;s still less than it was at launch.</p>

<p>Framework is gaining lots of applause for its uniquely modular laptop designs, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2215545/framework-laptop-16-review.html">the larger 16-inch model turned heads</a> by adding a discrete graphics card option.

<p>If you&rsquo;re sick of AI being shoved into in more and more consumer electronics, then you&rsquo;re in good company: I&rsquo;m sick of writing about it. But Google most decidedly is not sick of it.</p>



<p>In fact, Google is trying to inject its own AI into every one of its products. That includes both Android and ChromeOS, which are getting a little closer to each other to achieve this end goal.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.chromium.org/2024/06/building-faster-smarter-chromebook.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2366606-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">latest Chromium blog post</a>, the Google-developed laptop and desktop system will be &ldquo;embracing portions of the Android stack, like the Android Linux kernel and Android frameworks, as part of the foundation of Chrome

<p>Telling them apart can be tricky, though. Thanks to a few name changes, what&rsquo;s old sounds new and what&rsquo;s new sounds old. If you haven&rsquo;t kept up with the updates, it may not be clear which one you want &mdash; or if you actually prefer to run both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help you decide, I&rsquo;ve broken down what each app does. Let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>
