It's made a huge difference for thousands already - teachers love it for their students or even use it to brush up on their own skills before starting piano lessons. Jon's super passionate about this; for him, it's not just another course. It's the result of years tweaking and testing this method, both as a student and a teacher. Now, he's ready to share it with the world, hoping to shake up music education in a big way. For anyone jumping into this course, it's not just learning the notes; it's becoming part of something bigger, something that's changing how we learn music.\n\n#learnpiano #piano #sheetmusic #learntoplaypiano", "id": 758031, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZkOb9rQLE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCmKurapML4BF9Bjtj4RbvXw", "source_obj__id": 352, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/AYZkOb9rQLE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Learn to Read Sheet Music at a 2 Year Level in 2 Months!", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
