SharkBite tee tip‚Ä¶the first mistake DIYers make is not properly prepping copper. I cut the pipes and deburr the inside and outside. Sharp burrs can damage the SharkBite‚Äôs O-ring, leading to leaks. Use the depth gauge tool. This ensures you push the copper pipe and PEX into the tee to the correct depth for a secure connection. SharkBite fittings are convenient, but proper prep is essential for a leak-proof installation.
