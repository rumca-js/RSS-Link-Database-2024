Three months later, they were again beaten into second place by the Vipers, this time in the 50-over Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy.</p><p>On Saturday at Derby, Gordon finally avenged those defeats by leading her side to a seven-wicket win in the final of the Charlotte Edwards Cup, with eight balls to spare. If it was not quite poetic justice – their win came not against the Vipers but against the South East Stars, after Stars saw off reigning champions Vipers in their earlier semi-final – it was, nonetheless, the sweet taste of first-time silverware, and it tasted pretty good.</p> <a href="https://www

Which is something, given neither of the past two Cups of Nations were played in the right year. But it won’t end in 2025, kicking off on 21 December and finishing on 18 January. Yet the truth is, that is probably the least bad option available – and for once it isn’t really Caf’s fault.</p><p>This will be the seventh Cup of Nations in a row that has not gone ahead as originally scheduled for a variety of reasons including unrest in Libya, Moroccan panic over an outbreak of Ebola in Guinea, delays in the construction of Cameroonian infrastructure, Covid and the Ivorian rainy season.

<p>Just as sanity looks like returning in Britain, the French are tearing each other apart; can the masked hero Kylian Mbappé save the day?</p><p>Following the UK’s election campaign feels soothing for a French political observer. The sight of Britain recovering its senses after years of shambles is a joy like no other; like seeing a dear friend turning a corner after a really bad patch. Meanwhile, France, in a sudden fit of rage, decided to overturn the table. The president dissolved parliament, but it is as if he had dissolved the whole country. And, in return, French voters are playing with the suicidal idea of giving him either a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/20/can-new-popular-front-france-overcome-electoral-threat-from-far-right">far-right or a far-left majority</a> in the national assembly.</p><p>Many voters have already warned that, if confronted with such a stark choice in the second round, they will simply refuse to choose between the xenophobic

<p>The film-maker’s debut is an affecting tale about the epidemic of violence against Indigenous women. She talks about her friendship with its star, and why the industry has woken up to her culture’s storytelling</p><p>When Erica Tremblay was a small child she would watch her aunts and uncles making everyone laugh with their storytelling. “I noticed this physical shift in the audience, where people would lean in. And I thought, I want that power. I want to be a person that has other people leaning in.”</p><p>Among the Seneca Cayuga Nation, on the borders of Oklahoma and Missouri, near the small town where she was raised by her mother, communal storytelling was part of everyday life. But so were financial hardship and violence, the unsolved murders of women and the forced removal of their children. “It’s a massive bleeding wound that still exists,” she says. “From the first moment of contact, violence against Indigenous women has been an epidemic, and it remains one to this day.

Which might sound like a stupid question – sitting before them was a man who has commanded €90m in transfer fees and has been in the national team for six years, not some unknown – but it wasn’t, and if anyone was to blame it was Luis de la Fuente.

Or maybe like César Azpilicueta you could just call him Dave. “Fabián,” Fabián said.

<p><strong>Essex:</strong> At first we wondered where the usual mallards were in our local pond – it was as if they had disappeared</p><p>My little sister and I love to go and feed the ducks in our local pond. We especially love to see the ducklings, their fuzzy little bodies taking one tentative step at a time. Their adorable, big, black eyes glinting in the sunlight, with their protective mother duck watchfully standing close by.</p><p>As they were waddling around, I noticed something different about the drake mallards. Their usual brilliant jade green necks were dull and spotted with brown speckles. They looked more similar to a female duck. At first, I thought they were muddy or ill. Eager to discover the reasons behind this, I learned that they were in fact moulting their feathers! This transformation is called the “eclipse plumage”; it often occurs in summer, when the males can lose their flight feathers all at once so they can replace them.

It was the birthplace of Henry Tudor, father of Henry VIII, and is one of the country’s best preserved medieval strongholds, containing a&nbsp;maze of passages, tunnels and stairways, as well as a vast gatehouse tower. Scientists have discovered that the fortress has also been concealing a startling secret. A cave, known as Wogan Cavern, which lies directly underneath Pembroke Castle, has been found to contain a treasure trove of prehistoric material, including ancient bones and stone tools left behind by early Homo sapiens<em> </em>and possibly by Neanderthals.</p><p>These remains will provide key information about the settling of Britain in prehistoric times, say scientists, who last week began their first major excavation of the year at Wogan.

I was baking a&nbsp;gingerbread man for our son’s second&nbsp;birthday.

My&nbsp;husband was out running a half marathon a bit outside Aarhus, on Denmark’s east coast, where we lived. He was late as usual, but I was determined not to&nbsp;let it bother me.</p><p>Everything was ready. Bunting hung from the living room ceiling, balloons stuck up everywhere.

We are in the green room, all mirrors and concrete, backstage at Labour’s Scottish launch in Inverclyde, and unless I’m mistaken he still has on a layer of foundation. Ready? He folds his arms across his chest. “Yes, by all means.”</p><p>But then he can’t really say if he’s strictly an optimist or a pessimist and, no, doesn’t know if he’s an extrovert or an introvert, either. “I’ve never really thought about it.

<p>This drama about a newsreader caught making misogynistic jokes is full of cartoonish depictions of young people. Steven Moffat’s latest is neither funny nor interesting</p><p>Something happening in TV a lot is what I like to call the “coffee order scene”. It doesn’t always have to be a coffee order, but it normally is: an exasperated person who was born in a year when they could experience ecstasy before 1996 and buy a property before 2000 walks into a coffee shop and orders a “large coffee, black”. They look around the coffee shop like a panther is prowling after them through the woods.</p><p>The barista has a tattoo and a haircut. They will clarify that the person ordering means a “venti”. We see a palpable change in blood pressure. “Do you want any cream with that?” No cream. “Any alternative milks?” No alternative milks. “Any syrup?” They notice that the barista has pronouns printed on their name badge. “Just give me the damn coffee!” they say.</p> <a href="https://www.theguard

They moved into this house in Muddles Green, Chiddingly, with their two-year-old son Antony in 1949.

<p>A controversial deselection has rocked the local party, and campaigners are divided over the leadership</p><p>In many ways, Keir Starmer’s makeover of the Labour party has been a deeply conventional project. Since the 1950s, a decade his buttoned-up style would have suited well, the majority of Labour leaders have moved the party rightwards. It’s what the mainstream media and big business usually advise these leaders to do, arguing that a less leftwing Labour is more politically and economically realistic – while not so readily acknowledging that such a party also offers less of a threat to their interests.</p><p>Labour’s rightward shifts don’t always work. Neil Kinnock, Jim Callaghan, Harold Wilson and Hugh Gaitskell all led the party to painful defeats. But on 4 July, Starmer’s orthodox approach looks likely to be vindicated, in electoral terms at least.</p><p>Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/22/keir-star
