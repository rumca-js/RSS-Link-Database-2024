This note-reading course isn't just another class on the list; it's Jon Schmidt's labor of love, a game-changer he's been perfecting since he was 16. It's made a huge difference for thousands already - teachers love it for their students or even use it to brush up on their own skills before starting piano lessons. Jon's super passionate about this; for him, it's not just another course. It's the result of years tweaking and testing this method, both as a student and a teacher. Now, he's ready to share it with the world, hoping to shake up music education in a big way. For anyone jumping into this course, it's not just learning the notes; it's becoming part of something bigger, something that's changing how we learn music.
