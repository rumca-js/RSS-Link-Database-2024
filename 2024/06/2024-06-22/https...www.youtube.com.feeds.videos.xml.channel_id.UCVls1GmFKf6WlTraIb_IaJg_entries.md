6:05 Why don't you grow your hair long like Fabio?
6:29 How can I know which packages that I run are not open source?
9:31 Just wanted to point out that BSD OS's wait on adoption of new software (like Wayland) until it becomes proven...
10:54 My Emacs init.el was a mess. Your video series prompted me to redo the whole thing...
