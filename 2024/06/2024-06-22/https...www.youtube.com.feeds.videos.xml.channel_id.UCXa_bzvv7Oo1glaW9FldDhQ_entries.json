FromSoftware\u2019s Elden Ring is a principal example, but there\u2019s been enough gold in open world games over recent years to forgo worry the genre is stagnating. \n\nHowever, the warning signs are there, and they\u2019ve been there for a while: environments built without character mechanics in mind, unrewarding quest design, overabundance of \u201cthings to do\u201d, over-numerous collectibles. Ubisoft are the biggest offenders for these unnecessary distractions, but even open world games famous for their story or combat have been bogged down by boring side-content. \n\nWhen firing on all cylinders, there\u2019s no game genre more immersive, and more freedom granting than open world, but its inarguable there\u2019re boring aspects to these games that need to be eradicated.", "id": 759296, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YQs01YZoN0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6YQs01YZoN0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why Are So Many OPEN WORLD GAMES BORING?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-22T10:30:20+00:00", "description": "Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Series X might be behind Sony\u2019s current-gen offerings in terms of the first-party library and sales units, but due credit needs to be awarded to Microsoft\u2019s efforts towards crafting a powerful machine that\u2019s capable of handling high-fidelity games at 4K resolution. \n\nIt\u2019s always an interesting thought to see how crafting a similarly specced PC would cost, and that too with brand new PC parts.

Launching last year for Xbox Series X/S and PC as Microsoft's first $70 title, it bombed critically and commercially. Long-time fans of Arkane wondered how the studio behind Prey could release such a disappointing mess, rife with technical issues and none of the gameplay charm that defined its earlier releases.\n\nDespite spending a year on the market before Microsoft pulled the plug on future support (barring one last update), Redfall had a purported development of around six years. It was reportedly caught between two worlds - satisfying a broader market while not fully embracing the live-service model, meaning no microtransactions or in-game store.\n\nThough its final update is available and adds some worthwhile features, Redfall's legacy is disappointing. The fact that Arkane Austin shut down before it could return to what it did best makes things even worse.\n\nNote: Sorry for the re-upload.
