<p>Summer Game Fest 2024 officially wrapped up on June 10, after a long weekend of game previews, developer interviews and unlimited cold brew — but we just published our final stories from the show this week (held under embargo, of course). Those were Mat Smith's impressions of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-preview-sgf-2024-133059684.html"><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tales-of-the-shire-is-a-cozy-village-sim-where-you-cant-run-but-you-can-skip-130027018.html"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a>, and they capped off a month of juicy video game news out of the summer's biggest show.</p>
<p>No, <em>Silksong </em>did not make an appearance.</p>

<p><em>In this installment of What We're Listening To, Engadget editors dive into some of the recent music releases we've been playing on repeat. Yes, Brat has us in a chokehold, too. </em></p>
<h3 id="jump-link-uncle-acid-and-the-deadbeats---nell-ora-blu"><strong>Uncle Acid and The Deadbeats - </strong><strong><em>Nell’ Ora Blu</em></strong></h3>
<p>When I first heard Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats was putting out an album inspired by 1960s-70s giallo films, I felt like my interests, personally, were being targeted. It’s the kind of crossover that now seems like it <em>had</em> to happen at some point, but I never realized my need for it until this moment. (One person on <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UncleAcid/comments/10r3lzv/uncle_acid_should_score_a_horror_movie/">Reddit</a>, though, was really onto something with the idea last year). Lo and behold, <em>Nell’ Ora Blu</em> dropped last month and it scratches a very specific itch in my brain.</p>

<p><strong><em>The following contains spoilers for “Empire of Death.”</em></strong></p>
<p>“Empire of Death” is the typical Russell T. Davies series finale: It’s bombastic, dense and totally uninterested in resolving its own story. The episode bounces around for the requisite amount of time before leaping to its climax with an arresting visual of little substance. Because what Davies is <em>really </em>interested in is the scenes afterward, and the all-too-brief moment where Ruby Sunday gets coffee.</p>
