<p>Swan song runway show for his eponymous label feels like a love letter to fashion from retiring designer</p><p>In 1986 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dries-van-noten">Dries van Noten</a> kickstarted his fashion career when he and five other graduates from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp (including Ann Demeulemeester and Walter van Beirendonck) crammed into a rental van and drove to a London trade show.

<p>On a clammy, boisterous afternoon in Dortmund Portugal ensured they will now top Group F with a disarmingly low pulse rate 3-0 defeat of an outmatched Turkey. This was a statement victory for Portugal, not because of what they did, but because of what they didn’t have to. At times it felt a bit like watching a team of grown-ups strolling past the local primary school eleven. The biggest obstacle Roberto Martínez’s team experienced here was an excessive number of spectators (five of them) running on to take stolen selfies with Cristiano Ronaldo.</p><p>If Portugal were able to play in battery saver mode it is tribute to the coherence of the-set up here, a 4-3-3 with strength in every position and a beautifully fluid sense of control in the centre. Many English pundits seem to be convinced England’s hand of talent is the envy of the world. Portugal have a stronger team man for man, a more natural balance, a Portuguese way of playing that everyone comes in understanding.</p> <a href="h

For a new exhibition, Helm gallery in Brighton has reimagined the figures in styles ranging from pop art to 80s trading cards to a psychedelic reinterpretation by a French tattoo artist. “Mr Men are naturally very playful, with bold and bright colours,” says <a href="https://www.instagram.com/edenmaseyk/">Eden Maseyk</a>, the gallery’s co-founder. “We wanted to honour that while keeping the individual artists’ flair and style intact.” Five artists were enlisted, including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iamwillblood/?hl=en">Will Blood</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pablo_dalas/?hl=en">Pablo Dalas</a>, to put a modern spin on the figures and “to see how different artists channel childhood imagery and their own sense of nostalgia”.</p><ul><li><a href="https://helm-gallery.com/blogs/exhibitions/mr-men-little-miss-reimagined">

<p>Jeff Nichols adapts photographer Danny Lyon’s late-60s biker gang adventure, with stellar performances from Jodie Comer, Austin Butler and Tom Hardy</p><p>The outlaw appeal of the motorcycle gang – the machismo, the glinting chrome and the open road – has long held a seductive appeal for film-makers. Jeff Nichols’s loose, freewheeling account of the rise and fall of a fictional Chicago biker gang shares DNA with the films that came before – <em>The Wild One</em> and <em>Easy Rider</em> are namechecked – but there’s also kinship, in the revved-up posturing and Valkyrie-like shots of the gang as road warriors, with the B-movie bikesploitation flicks of the late 60s and early 70s. However, while Nichols (<em>Mud</em>, <em>Take Shelter</em>) is clearly enamoured of the closed world he depicts (the film is based on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2023/nov/17/danny-lyon-photography-civil-rights-motorcycle-clubs-new-mexico-landscapes">the pictures and interviews of phot

<p><strong>Longborough festival opera, Gloucestershire; Wigmore Hall; Bold Tendencies, London</strong><br />Remarkable performances and storytelling produce a visceral Ring cycle, while a part-time pianist masters a formidable Alkan concerto and Maki Namekawa channels the freewheeling spirit of Keith Jarrett</p><p>A full staging of Wagner’s Ring cycle in a converted barn in rural Gloucestershire once seemed eccentric. You may say it still is. Now in its 33rd season, Longborough festival opera, which began modestly in 1991, has become a centre of musical seriousness. Its popular founders, Lizzie and Martin Graham, who happen to be Wagner fans but open-mindedly – or sensibly – allow other composers to feature, have passed the artistic leadership to their opera director daughter, Polly Graham. With a 500-seat theatre, a dedication to environmental sustainability and an expanding programme of education and participation, the festival is a mainstay of the summer opera season. Its success i

It turned out that he lived in his car, which was parked in Marlborough. This story pretty much sums up my colourful dating history, which started when I got my first boyfriend at 16. He was a wannabe firefighter in the year above me at school, and was a perfect first in every way, but he also became the first boy I lived with. He moved into my parents’ house when his own family situation became untenable and I got very used to going to bed next to someone every night.</p><p>That’s probably why I spent the next decade as a&nbsp;serial&nbsp;monogamist, hopscotching between men.

After sixth form, and then university, I met most of them at work in London, where
