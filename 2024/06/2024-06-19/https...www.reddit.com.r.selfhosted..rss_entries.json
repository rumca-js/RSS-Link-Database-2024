To be honest, I've never really done much with file systems or volume management before.</p> <p>My master plan is to set up a RAID0 array on a collection of cheap SSDs I have, and use that as the 'working' drive.<br /> I also have a 1TB and several 250GB HDDs. I was thinking of setting up the 250s in a RAID5 array and using them as a place to store backups (since the SSD array has no redundancy, it will be backed up nightly). Most of the actual data I need to access for the servers I'm running can all fit on the SSD array</p> <p>Now I'm trying to figure out what filesystem(s) I should go with. I've heard that XFS has potentially better performance for a fast array. I also wonder if BTRFS or ZFS are worth considering for the 'backup' disks/array.</p> <p>I haven't used BTRFS - it sounds cool but kinda seems like it'd ", "id": 736438, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dj7g7i/setting_up_disks_and_volumes", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Setting up disks and volumes", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-19T01:28:46+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi :D</p> <p>I want to run both Dashy and Qbittorrent in my Docker Compose file, I use them both with Gluetun so I can have a VPN widget that shows VPN information in Dashy, it was working great until Dashy's internal port changed to 8080, which is the same as Qbittorrent...
