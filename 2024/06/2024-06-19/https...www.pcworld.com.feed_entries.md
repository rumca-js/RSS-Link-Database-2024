<p>While computer monitors seem to be more or less the same once you get past the size and the ports, that&rsquo;s not really true. Even the most common type, the humble LCD, has a lot of sub-types. And while the differences between them are subtle, they can vary greatly in how they perform and how you use them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The simple idea of a monitor hasn&rsquo;t changed a lot since we all moved from cathode ray tubes (CRT) &mdash; the big, old-fashioned gray boxes that some of you are too young to remember seeing in real life &mdash; to relatively tiny liquid crystal displays (LCD).&nbsp;LCDs have been around for decades, first being paired with simple computer displays way back in the 1970s. </p>



<p>The physics of how they work are fascinating, complex, and frankly too much to cover in an article you probably Googled just to figure out something on a spec

<p>An ordinary home network router with a Wi-Fi 5 or Wi-Fi 6 access point is usually enough for most homes with a modest living space and central internet serving phones, laptops, and other everyday devices.</p>



<p>But not all devices connected to the same wireless access point experience the same connection quality. In fact, the quality of one device&rsquo;s Wi-Fi connection is mainly determined by its distance from the router and what obstacles sit in between.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-wi-fi-router-alone-isnt-enough">The Wi-Fi router alone isn&rsquo;t enough</h2>



<p>If you want to serve Wi-Fi to a <strong>larger home or one with an unusually shaped living area</strong> with structural obstacles, you may find that a single access point isn&rsquo;t good enough.</p>



<p>In this case, you may need several access points&mdash;ideally distribut

<p>My first impression of the Microsoft Surface Pro (2024) tablet was not a good one. As soon as I finished setting it up &mdash; bam! &mdash; it spontaneously and unexpectedly rebooted. And all I did was start playing around with the keyboard!</p>



<p>In fact, the one thing that I think consumers may hate about this new &ldquo;Microsoft Surface Pro, 11th Edition&rdquo; &mdash; and I never believed I would say this &mdash; is the new Surface Pro Flex Keyboard. Out of the box it was unresponsive, fidgety, and&hellip;underpowered? Yes, you need to charge it up, and that&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;ll have to get used to.</p>
