With this week's Episode 4, the plot is getting started in earnest as every major character races to the same place: the planet Khofar, where the Jedi Kelnacca has been living reclusively since the Jedi incursion to the witch coven on Brendok went so badly.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: The following contains major spoilers for Episode 4 of Star Wars: The Acolyte.

<p><strong>Warning: This article contains a small spoiler about a minor character appearance in Episode 4 of Star Wars: The Acolyte.</strong></p><p>One of the more appealing aspects of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-acolyte-review-not-messing-around/1900-6418234/">Star Wars: The Acolyte</a> has been its standalone nature, taking place so far before the main parts of the franchise that it feels pretty separate. But the further the series has gone on, the closer to the films it's felt--and we peaked on that front when an actual movie character made a cameo appearance this week--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-acolyte-episode-4-a-big-jedi-cameo-new-story-connections-and-other-easter-eggs/2900-5522/">the biggest Easter egg of the series so far</a>. It wasn't a major or particularly consequential part, but it's certainly a surprising one.</p><p>The Jedi in question is the cone-headed Ki-Adi-Mundi, who was a member of the Jedi Council in the prequel films--a rol

This fourth episode finally brings all the story setup to a close--we know what we need to know about Osha and Mae; the two of them have come to grips with each other's survival, and now it's time for them to figure out where they truly belong in this conflict between the Jedi and everyone else.</p><p dir="ltr">But one big detail we don't know is the identity of Mae's mysterious master. We have a big reason to believe that this person is a Sith, and it's usually a safe bet that the mysterious villain in a situation like this--where the creatives behind the

<p>Between Yellowjackets, Army of the Dead, and now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-amazon-show-review-of-the-people-for-the-people/1900-6418209/">Fallout</a>, Ella Purnell has already built up a small list of projects involving either cannibalism or flesh-eating zombies. It's something the actress can joke about, especially because Yellowjackets and Fallout have gone a long way towards establishing her as a star. Even so, Purnell doesn't want to be known for only taking those kind of roles.</p><p>"What's so funny is that I didn't put two and two together with Yellowjackets and Fallout," said Purnell during an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/ella-purnell-fallout-season-2-yellowjackets-1235925068/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "I never ever was like, 'Oh God, what are people going to say about my cannibalism trend?' It never occurred to me until I started doing press, and I was like, 'Oh yeah, I guess it's a thing.' So, hopefull
