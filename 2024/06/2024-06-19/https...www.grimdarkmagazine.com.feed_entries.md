In The Mercy of Gods, we follow a group of team members as they drive their careers as part of the bleeding edge of scientific research industry. They chase funding, protect their research from other teams, and politic their way around trying to find out who is trying to break their team up. Their work is all consuming, the only thing they really care about, until one of them accidentally discovers cloaked ships in the local space around their planet. All of a sudden, which faction is trying to break their team up and take over their research is the most insignificant problem they, or humanity, will ever
