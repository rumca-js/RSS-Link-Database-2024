Tuberculosis is a serious health threat, and the efficacy of the BCG vaccine against tuberculosis diminishes in adulthood, making booster vaccines a realistic option. Mycobacterial DNA-binding protein 1 (MDP1), a protein found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, elicits higher protective IFN-gamma responses in individuals who suppress tuberculosis, thus making it a vaccine candidate.

Measuring the heart rate of great apes in captivity is essential for both health management and animal studies. However, existing most methods are either invasive or inaccurate. Now, researchers have investigated the potential of using millimeter-wave radar technology to estimate heart rate from subtle body movements in chimpanzees. Their efforts will hopefully pave the way to better practices and techniques for monitoring heart rates in wild and captive primates.

## Blessing in disguise: Mycoviruses enhance fungicide effectiveness against plant pathogens

An innovative synthesis strategy opened up the way to 2D/3D fused frameworks using inexpensive quinolines as feedstock, report scientists. By leveraging a light-sensitive borate intermediate, the scientists could transform quinoline derivatives into a great variety of 2D/3D fused frameworks in a straightforward and cost-effective manner. Their findings are expected to enable the synthesis of highly customizable drug candidates.

## More effective cancer treatment with iontronic pump

When low doses of cancer drugs are administered continuously near malignant brain tumors using so-called iontronic technology, cancer cell growth drastically decreases. Researchers demonstrated this in experiments with bird embryos. The results are one step closer to new types of effective treatments for severe cancer forms.

## Interaction with insects accelerates plant evolution

Looking under the microscope, a group of cells slowly moves forward in a line, like a train on the tracks. The cells navigate through complex environments. A new approach now shows how they do this and how they interact with each other.

## Much of the Nord Stream gas remained in the sea

Scientists have achieved a significant research milestone in the field of spinal cord injuries -- mapping out the cellular and molecular dynamics of paralysis in unprecedented detail with their open-source project 'Tabulae Paralytica'. Gr goire Courtine and his team have integrated cutting-edge cell and molecular mapping technologies with artificial intelligence to chart the complex molecular processes that unfold in each cell after spinal cord injuries (SCI). This seminal work not only identifies a specific set of neurons and genes that plays a key role for recovery but also proposes a successful gene therapy derived from its discoveries.
