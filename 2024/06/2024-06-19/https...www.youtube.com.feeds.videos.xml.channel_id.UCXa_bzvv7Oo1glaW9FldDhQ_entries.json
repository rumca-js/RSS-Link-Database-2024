Bugs can be quashed, animations polished further, and performance improved.

As such, the package needs the most basic of features, a proper competitive multiplayer structure, and actual progression to warrant long-term investment.", "id": 740438, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fi33UJoKK8", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/3fi33UJoKK8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Bodycam Early Access Review - Does This Ultra Photorealistic Shooter Deliver?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-19T14:00:05+00:00", "description": "The history of Redfall is fascinating in retrospect. Launching last year for Xbox Series X/S and PC as Microsoft's first $70 title, it bombed critically and commercially. Long-time fans of Arkane wondered how the studio behind Prey could release such a disappointing mess, rife with technical issues and none of the gameplay charm that defined its earlier releases.\n\nDespite spending a year on the market before Microsoft pulled the plug on future support (barring one last update), Redfall had a purported development of around six years. It was reportedly caught between two worlds - satisfying a broader market while not fully embracing the live-service model, meaning no microtransactions or in-game store.\n\nThough its final update is available and adds some worthwhile features, Redfall's legacy is disappointing. The fact that Arkane Austin shut down before it could return to what it did best makes things even worse.", "id": 739398, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GJnJALihi0", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/7GJnJALihi0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Redfall - The Mess, ONE YEAR LATER", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-19T10:30:28+00:00", "description": "It has been a long, long time coming, but Nintendo has announced a new 2D Legend of Zelda game at long last.
