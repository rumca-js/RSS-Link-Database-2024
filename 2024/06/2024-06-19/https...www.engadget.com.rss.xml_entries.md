<p>The march of big-budget Tolkien fantasy has hit gaming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-14-take-two-private-division-indie-games.html">yet again</a>. While ignoring Gollum’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lord-of-the-rings-gollum-will-finally-arrive-on-may-25th-193755108.html">misadventures</a>, another game, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tales-of-the-shire-trailer-shows-what-life-as-a-regular-hobbit-looks-like-163041185.html"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a>, offers a gentler, low-stakes way to play in the universe of Bagginses, lembas bread, and Gandalf.</p>
<p>Set somewhere between the end of The Hobbit, but before it all kicked off in Lord of the Rings, Tales of the Shire sees you settling into Bywater, helping fellow villagers achieve their tasks and dreams. That involves fishing, farming vegetables and cooking up a storm to improve your relationships and unlock new recipes and possibly other activities.</p>

<p>Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, has <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/06/18/governor-newsom-supports-efforts-to-get-smartphones-out-of-schools/">issued a statement</a> in support of efforts aiming to restrict the use of smartphones in schools within the state. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/us/california-newsom-smartphone-ban.html?smid=url-share"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reports, the governor aired his stance merely hours before board members at the Los Angeles Unified School District voted to pass a proposal for a school phone ban. Newsom said he will work with lawmakers &quot;to restrict the use of smartphones during the school day&quot; this summer, because children and teens &quot;should be focused on their studies — not their screens.&quot;</p>
<p>The governor also mentioned and agreed with the US Surgeon General's op-ed published by <em>The Times</em>, wherein he said that social media platforms should be required to <a href="https://www.en

<p>Nintendo sidestepped sharing the spotlight with all the other gaming companies at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest</a> last week, promising its own Direct later in June. And that happened yesterday, teasing a lot of new games with Nintendo favorites. Mario games, yes. Zelda games, yes, and even a new Metroid game, confirmed. (More on that below the fold).</p>
<p>The funny thing is the new Zelda game is all about… <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-will-finally-let-you-play-as-zelda-herself-143612318.html">Zelda</a>. You play as the princess in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>. It opens where most Zelda games finish, with Link defeating Ganon. But just as he frees Princess Zelda, our usual hero is sucked into an alternate dimension. The game is played top-down and borrows the art style of the <em>Link’s Awakening</em> remake. However, Zelda’s main weapon and tool is the trirod. With this, she can

<p>No Tech for Apartheid (NOTA), a coalition of tech workers demanding big tech companies to drop their contracts with the Israeli government, is close to reaching its goal for a <a href="https://notechforapartheid.com/students">campaign</a> asking students not to work with Google and Amazon. As <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/stem-students-refuse-to-work-at-google-and-amazon-over-project-nimbus/"><em>Wired</em></a> reports, more than 1,100 people who identified themselves as STEM students and young workers have taken the pledge to refuse jobs from the companies &quot;for powering Israel's Apartheid system and genocide against Palestinians.&quot; Based on its website, NOTA's goal is to gather 1,200 signatures for the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;As young people and students in STEM and beyond, we refuse to have any part in these horrific abuses. We’re joining the #NoTechForApartheid campaign to demand Amazon and Google immediately end Project Nimbus,&quot; part of the pledge read
