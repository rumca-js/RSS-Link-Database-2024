<p>It was all stuff that has been on the agenda for years, illustrated with a single picture of a lower-profile leader</p><p>Things are looking up. For so long the Tories have looked utterly bereft, cast adrift by their former supporters. Alone and friendless. It couldn’t have happened to nicer people. But now they find themselves with company – albeit not the bedfellows they might have expected or even wanted. For the SNP is now facing its own electoral Armageddon. The latest polls suggest the party could win only 15 seats out of a possible 57 on 4 July. Cast your mind back to 2015, when you couldn’t move for Scots Nats MPs. It’s not quite a wipeout, but it’s not far off. At the very least it’s a profound existential crisis.</p><p>Not that you would have known that from its election launch event four weeks ago.

It was when I went to the undertaker to get his ashes. They weren’t ready, said the lady there, but she did have his watch to give me. This she handed over in a little velvety bag. As she went into an explanation about the hold-up with the ashes, I got the watch out of the bag and just stared at it, stunned. I couldn’t believe that it was still ticking away, showing the correct time. I mean, I know: why would a cheap, battery-powered watch have died just because the wrist it had been around had gone for ever? At some level I must have thought it would have had the decency to stop at the moment that my dad stopped, as a mark of respect. But no, on it went regard

Yet Jeff Nichols – this genial, softly spoken director, with his pink face and modest quiff of wavy, silver-streaked hair – is responsible for The Bikeriders, a movie thick with the roar of engines and the smell of grease. Inspired by photographer Danny Lyon’s 1967 book of the same name, it stars Tom Hardy as Johnny, the ageing leader of a Chicago biker gang; Austin Butler as Benny, its coolest member; and Jodie Comer as Kathy, who falls for Benny. Lyon rode with and profiled the Outlaws but Nichols has fictionalised the gang, renaming them the Vandals to avoid aggro from the real-life subjects.</p><p>“Becoming the historian of the Outlaws was not my goal,” explains the 45-year-ol

Forester Aldo Leopold’s concept was to create a pristine place untouched by man – there would be no mechanised vehicles or buildings, but horses, rafts, hunting and fishing would be allowed. How we designate a wilderness hasn’t really changed in the last century. In some ways, Gila was ahead of its time – in the early 20th century, nobody was really thinking about conserving the land. But they also forgot about the people living in this area: the Chiricahua Apache had been there for 200 years, and the Mogollon before that. The Gila is an example of how contradictory conservation can be, back then and now.</p><p>One of the most interesting examples of this is the elk. These were once widespread in the

<p>It started with tzatziki and taramasalata, now it’s all whipped feta and truffle hummus. How did Britain get such an appetite for the scoopable stuff?</p><p>On 30 May 1987, Waitrose announced the introduction of a new range of dips: tzatziki, taramasalata and hummus. This was the first time they had appeared on supermarket shelves in the UK and they were so novel that they needed explaining. Hummus “is a traditional Middle Eastern hors d’oeuvre made with chickpeas and sesame seeds,” the label advised, under an illustration of palm trees and minarets. Fast forward 36 years, and our appetite for dips appears bottomless. They – and their partners in crime, crispy snacks – are a shopping basket and restaurant staple, and not a summer or Christmas goes by without a new limited-edition dip causing a storm online.</p><p>They’ve become “mandatory”, says restaurateur David Carter, whose latest opening <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/may/17/oma-london-se1-grace-dent-di

<p>Kim enjoys the recognition and backs Putin in Ukraine. Putin’s war, meanwhile needs North Korean weapons. It’s a dangerous alliance </p><p>They make an odd couple. One is smiley-faced and chubby. The other is thin-lipped and scowls a lot. Both are dictators, sinister, brutal and unaccountable in their different ways. Both have made it their mission in life to overturn the post-1945 global order, defying the US, its chief patrolman. And both are sanctioned, ostracised and a little bit feared by the countries of the west.</p><p>Those fears are likely to intensify after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/vladimir-putin-to-visit-north-korea-as-he-seeks-further-military-support">yesterday’s Pyongyang summit</a>, both symbolic and substantive, between this unofficial Laurel and Hardy tribute act.

<p>The good comedian mocks the powerful. And is there anything or anyone more powerful than God? I don’t think so </p><p>What subjects, if any, should be off limits for comedians? For Jimmy Carr, Ricky Gervais and particularly Dave Chappelle, the answer appears to be “nothing”. But for the rest of us (because, while I’m hardly in the their league, I am, for my sins, a comedian as well as a vicar) the golden rule is “Punch up, not down”. In other words, it’s OK to mock the powerful but laughing at any minority group, as old-school comics such as Bernard Manning used to do, is a form of bullying.</p><p>By that logic, God, the most powerful being in the universe, is a legitimate target for humour. Pope Francis himself said as much last week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/19/pope-francis-god-comedy-standup-religion">Continue reading...</a>

A T20 World Cup match in Nassau County, New York is unusual at the best of times; it becomes even stranger as the scene of a long-awaited competitive return to international cricket, the end of a 17-month absence that could so easily have been permanent. India’s wicketkeeper entered at 22 for one, the target a meagre 97 against Ireland, but the track posing enough danger to force Rohit Sharma off with a blow to the upper arm.

It’s a terrifying scenario that, incidentally, avoids the perennial problem with shark films: how to keep people in the water.

<p>Striker helped out defenders before opener but is ready to be more than just Harry Kane’s understudy in Germany</p><p>At some point over the next four weeks, there is likely to be a moment when England need Ollie Watkins to do more than impersonate Dusan Vlahovic in training. As with any understudy, the trick is being prepared for any opportunity that comes his way.</p><p>There is no telling when Gareth Southgate will turn to Watkins. And unfortunately for the Aston Villa striker, he currently has one of the hardest jobs in football. Much like Vincent Janssen, Carlos Vinícius and Roberto Soldado in previous seasons at Tottenham Hotspur, there is not much that Watkins can do other than accept that being behind Harry Kane means spending a lot of time on the bench.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/19/ollie-watkins-england-striker-euro-2024">Continue reading...</a>

<p>David Baddiel engagingly overshares about his outre childhood</p><p>In another life, David Baddiel’s mother, Sarah, could have been an aristocrat living in a big house with servants and married to a rich businessman – or so she imagined. In the early 1930s, her German Jewish parents, Ernst and Otti, had been extremely wealthy; according to a cousin, they owned a painting by Rubens. But then the Nazis took their home, their livelihood and murdered their relatives, so they fled with their baby to England. Twenty-five years later, their daughter was living in a modest house in London’s&nbsp;Dollis Hill with three sons and her husband, Colin, an emotionally detached, working-class research scientist who, after being made redundant, sold Dinky Toys on a market stall. For Sarah, the most exotic life got was when the family went on their annual holiday to Swansea. And so, to assuage her disappointment and “block out complex realities”, she embraced a fantasy version of her life with the h

<p>When I boarded the train at Beijing I felt timid, a cautious traveller. But a chaotic and vodka-soaked party set me off on a very different path</p><p>In 2001, after spending a year studying in Beijing as part of our degree, two friends and I decided to travel to Mongolia and Russia on the Trans-Siberian Railway. We did everything as cheaply as possible, to the extent that I was terrified we were going to be flung off the train at the Mongolia-Russia border, because we’d got our visas from a tiny, dodgy-looking agency in a random tower block in Beijing.</p><p>Being worried was pretty much my default state at that time. I found talking to strangers difficult, and struggled to raise my hand in class. I was always terrified of making mistakes. Though it wasn’t a devastating shyness, I envied the way that friends and classmates always seemed at home in different groups and situations – a feeling that had always eluded me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/20

<p>It’s lent poignancy by the current rise in antisemitism. But it contains little new, is full of clunky dialogue – and its plot is an exhausting exercise in box-ticking</p><p>By virtue of being a story of the Holocaust, the eight-part drama We Were the Lucky Ones, is a harrowing one. To watch it at a time when antisemitism is on the rise and some of our own most racist public figures are returning to the political stage only gives it extra emotional torque. Whether even that is enough to disguise the screeching mechanics of the plot or slide you past some poor dialogue to a truly earned emotional conclusion is the question running alongside the story at all times.</p><p>Based on Georgia Hunter’s 2017 novel of the same name, itself based on the experiences of her Jewish family, the series follows the parents and five children that comprise the Kurc family in Radom, Poland, over a decade. It begins with a family celebration of Passover – unknowingly for the last time – in 1937. Son Ad
