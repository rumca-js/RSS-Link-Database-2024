Ubisoft has pulled its beloved action-adventure Beyond Good and Evil from a number of digital stores, prompting speculation that its previously announced remaster is set to launch very soon.
</p><p>
Beyond Good and Evil's 20th Anniversary Edition - a remaster of the original 2003 game - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-now-playing-ubisofts-still-unannounced-beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition">confirmed to be in development</a> last November, after a "technical error" (as Ubisoft termed it) inadvertently granted some Ubisoft+ subscribers access to an early development build.

At the time, Ubisoft gave its Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition an "early 2024" release window - and the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-remaster-news-teased-for-showcase-tomorro

First there was the impressive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofUi9DR9sc4" target="_blank">gameplay reveal</a> for the upcoming reboot at this month's Xbox Showcase and, literally yesterday, Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-adds-mature-games-selection-starting-with-perfect-dark-and-turok">announced</a> that the original Perfect Dark is now available to play on Switch.</p><p>All of this Perfect Dark news got me perfectly nostalgic, so I jumped back into the original three games and put together a little list video based on some of the most bizarre (and naughty) Easter Eggs and features that Rare's series has to offer.</p><p>Give it a watch on the player above or there's the YouTube version embedded below if you'd prefer to push that one into yo

## What have we learned from Perfect Dark's gameplay reveal trailer?

Yet, I've always preferred a different approach: a linear series of events showcasing what's possible in the game. This style was memorably used to reveal Metal Gear Solid 2, along with titles like Halo 2, Doom 3, The Last of Us and Killzone: Shadow Fall. It's designed to showcase the gameplay vision of a title contained within a single location - a way to help the player understand what sort of game the developer is building. With the reboot of Perfect Dark, finally shown during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-xbox-summer-showcase-combined-banger-games-and-hardware-disappointment">this year's Xbox showcase</a>, I was thrilled to see 

## My first hands on with The Plucky Squire was one of the most joyful experiences in ages

Astro Bot and Lego Horizon Adventures were both a breeze, playful, ebullient family games that put all their focus on simply being a good time. The Plucky Squire, an action game with a domestic dimension hopping twist, however, probably just pipped them to the position of first, in the race to be the most joyful experience I had all week.</p><p>In fact, it was one of the most joyful I've had in video games for a little while. The Plucky Squire is a delight.</p><p>The setup here involved an opening sequence in a 2D part of The Plucky Squire, the main storybook. What's striking is how the edges of the pages, while always visible, seem to just melt away here. You are in this, playing a top-down Zelda-like adventure,

Banana has taken Steam by storm recently, yesterday <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banana-clicking-game-now-9th-most-popular-of-all-time-on-steam-knocks-baldurs-gate-3-out-of-top-10">knocking Baldur's Gate 3 out of the top 10 most popular games on Valve's platform</a> (in terms of peak concurrent players).
</p><p>
In Banana, players click on the image of a banana - or simply leave the software running - to eventually get a banana dropped into their Steam inventory. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-than-100000-people-are-currently-playing-a-steam-game-where-you-click-a-banana">As we previously reported</a>, these bananas can be sold in Steam's marketplace, with some going for pennies while others have a much higher asking price.

Rather than a sword like Link, Zelda will make her way through Hyrule with a new item known as the Tri Rod, which allows her to copy and paste items she finds in the world. She can also pick up and throw rocks at enemies, and copy enemies to do battle for her.</p><p>But, where does the Echoes of Wisdom fall in Zelda's expansive timeline? While there has been nothing defi

TimeSplitters has been rated in Taiwan for PS4 and PS5, leading to speculation of an imminent arrival on PS Plus.
</p><p>
As spotted by Gematsu, two versions of the game are listed on the Taiwanese ratings board website for both consoles. Koch Media is listed as the associated company - it's now renamed to Plaion (which joined Embracer), which acquired the TimeSplitters rights back in 2018.
</p><p>
However, a new game in the series was cancelled last year and studio Free Radical Design was shut down.
