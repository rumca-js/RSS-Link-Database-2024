<p>I’ve focused here on improvements designed to help users get things done. It’s also important to bear in mind that not every rumored feature appears; some show up later, and as of now there’s speculation some AI features will require an iPhone 15 series (or newer) device.</p>

<p>Did you know Google has its own team collaboration app á la Slack or Microsoft Teams? It’s called Google Spaces, and it’s understandable if you’re not aware of it — Spaces looks a lot like Google Chat, and that’s because it’s technically an extension of it. Google Spaces is also integrated into Gmail and has close ties to other Google apps including Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet, and Tasks.</p>



<p>Anyone with a Google account can use Spaces for free, although some advanced features are available only with a <a href="https://workspace.google.com/pricing">paid Google Workspace plan</a>. We’ll take you through the steps of setting up and using Spaces to collaborate with your co-worker

<p>In recent months, privacy policies have veered wildly off course. Instead of being a document that comforts customers/prospects that the company is protecting privacy as much as possible, many now spell out the most frightening scenarios possible — on the off chance the company opts to try any of them.</p>



<p>It’s the same approach the legal beagles (and the companies they serve) take with patents, most of which they have zero intent to turn into a product or service. An
