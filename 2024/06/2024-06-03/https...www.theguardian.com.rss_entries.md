He required a cornea transplant to save his sight but his previous surgery – a graft with a human cornea – failed and doctors warned the next might too.

And as he publishes a memoir, Rise of a Killah, and releases new album Set the Tone (Guns &amp; Roses), he’ll be taking on your questions.</p><p>Born Dennis Coles in 1970 in Staten Island, New York, Ghostface grew up in poverty with a single mother: “Fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment, roaches everywhere,” as the autobiographical track All That I Got Is You would later have it. He went to prison for robbery aged 15, but after falling in with Robert Diggs, known as RZA, co-founded Wu-Tang Clan – it’s Ghostface’s voice ringing out on the first verse of side one, track one of their 1993 debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/03/

<p>When Richard Nixon’s perfidy was exposed, his party support crumbled. But with Trump, GOP leaders rallied around him</p><p>The Republican leaders were of one mind: if the Republican president committed a crime, he could no longer hold office. They had defended him to a point, but they understood that with proof of criminality they would withdraw their support. Even before the evidence was conclusive, their ultimate judgment about their constitutional duty and of the president’s was certain. “If it can be proved that he lied, resignation would have to be considered. It would be quick. Everything would be over, ended. It wouldn’t drag out like impeachment.” So stated senator Barry Goldwater, a previous Republican presidential nominee, still the icon of the conservative movement, in May 1973.</p><p>It did not matter that Richard Nixon was popular, that he had won the presidency twice, the last time just a year earlier, in a landslide, carrying 49 states.

And when I stood still, it was dark and smelled like rotting fruit. There were gnats hovering near the ground. I lifted my foot and looked at the hard folds on the peach pit.

My mum swore by keeping things simple and usually roasted the bird, but my day job means I now have a thing for elevating flavours. In today’s dish, the chicken is enveloped in a medley of anchovies, serrano ham and oregano, all of which enhance its succulence, while the various other herbs and spices infuse the meat, and make it more vital and intense; the chickpeas, sultanas and watercress, meanwhile, introduce a refreshing balance. This is rustic Spanish cooking mixed with contemporary creativity, and a delicious blend of tradition and innovation.</p><p>Discover this recipe and many more from your favourite cooks in <a href="https://app.adjust.com/1bgiux9n?creative=Endnotes&amp;fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhe

<p>This austere reflection on lost friendships was written in the poet’s later years as he fought opium addiction</p><p><strong>Duty Surviving Self-Love</strong></p><p>Unchanged within, to see all changed without,<br />
 Is a blank lot and hard to bear, no doubt.<br />
 Yet why at others’ wanings should’st thou fret?<br />
 Then only might’st thou feel a just regret,<br />
 Hadst thou withheld thy love or hid thy light<br />
 In selfish forethought of neglect and slight.<br />
 O wiselier then, from feeble yearnings freed,<br />
 While, and on whom, thou may’st — shine on! nor heed<br />
 Whether the object by reflected light<br />
 Return thy radiance or absorb it quite:<br />
 And though thou notest from thy safe recess<br />
 Old Friends burn dim, like lamps in noisome air,<br />
 Love them for what they are; nor love them less,<br />
 Because to thee they are not what they were.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/03/poem-of-the-week-duty-surviving-self

Not a cause!” says Samoan husband-to-be Jason (Nick Afoa) in a rare moment of self-illumination in this soapy and stiflingly well-meaning gay rights drama from New Zealand. But the film is all too focused on pushing its cause: same-sex marriage and greater flexibility of religious thought.

Empty-nest syndrome? No thank you. He chose us every bit as much as we chose him. When we first came to visit him at his mother’s home in Essex – not Barking; Herbie gets fed up with that gag – he pushed his siblings out of the way, rolled on to his back and demanded to have his tummy rubbed.

But  some things are better left unsaid</p><p>One of my favourite theories about pet behaviour is that <a href="https://time.com/3898677/actually-your-cat-thinks-you-are-a-giant-cat/">cats see their human owners as fellow cats</a> – just very large, hairless, uncoordinated cats.

Because at some point in the past few years, I joined the ranks of the pet-obsessed millennials. It crept up on me. One day I was idly thinking how nice it would be to get a kitten, the next I was staring into glistening jade eyes, feeling the vibrations of a purr through warm fur, thinking: “Yes, this does seem a fair exchange for lifelong servitude.” Now I participate regularly in the OTT pet-parent customs.

<p>Our convoluted response to the catastrophe in Gaza leaves a bitter aftertaste</p><p>It is common knowledge that we Slovenes are a hard-working, neat but in essence spineless folk. Our favourite pastime is oppressing our fellow citizens, especially our neighbours, peers and co-workers – always putting them into their designated places, preferably somewhere beneath us.</p><p>We remain silent, however, when truth should be spoken to power. Oppressing others and staying silent is hard work! Our inability to resist the will of <em>the great and the mighty </em>– our bosses, rulers, domestic or foreign governments – makes us highly corruptible and, therefore, unreliable. It’s not a coincidence that Slovenes are usually depicted with bowed heads and clasped hands: those are images of obedience, and obedience is, without a doubt, a calculated behaviour.</p><p>Ana Schnabl is a Slovenian novelist, editor and critic</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/03/sl

<p>I’m forced to survive on a credit card, racking up debts I can’t repay</p><p><strong>There is currently a brouhaha concerning people having to repay their carer’s allowance because they exceeded the earnings threshold. I have the opposite problem. I am a carer for an autistic adult son and, depending on his circumstances, I sometimes work, and sometimes stay at home and claim carer’s allowance. I did some work over Christmas and, as always, informed the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), as the pay took me over the earnings threshold. I made a new claim in January when work ended. Four months later, it still hasn’t made a decision, and I am having to survive on a credit card, racking up debt I will struggle to repay. I could weep.<br /></strong><em><strong>JN, Fareham, Hampshire</strong></em></p><p>Carer’s allowance can be claimed by anyone who spends at least 35 hours a week looking after someone with a disability and earns less than £151 a week. It is now worth £81.90 a week

They watched John Major get up every day and suggest to his team that the Tories could win, and then fight – despite all the polls suggesting otherwise. It convinced the then young aides that Major might know something no one else did – that there was hope. Then, on polling day, they went up to the Downing Street flat to find everything packed to move out.

<p>A new three-part series follows Gabriel and his partner Andy as they embark on an emotional roller-coaster. Plus: a new series of Love Island. Here’s what to watch this eveniing</p><p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong> <br />
 Adoption is a long, hard road for most people who try it. For a same-sex couple, one of whom is barely concealing some deep trauma, it is longer and harder still. Daf James’s revelatory and loosely autobiographical drama follows Sion Daniel Young’s performance artist, Gabriel, and his partner, an accountant called Andy (Fra Fee), as they start the process. It is funny, emotionally acute and at times heart-wrenching – particularly when they arrive at an activity day and are presented with a brochure of children, each innocent face hiding a tragic story. It soon becomes clear that the process represents a complete, skeleton-revealing personality audit, with the highest stakes imaginable. <strong>Phil Harrison</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-
