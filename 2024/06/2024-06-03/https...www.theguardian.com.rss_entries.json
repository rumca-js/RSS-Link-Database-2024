For a same-sex couple, one of whom is barely concealing some deep trauma, it is longer and harder still. Daf James\u2019s revelatory and loosely autobiographical drama follows Sion Daniel Young\u2019s performance artist, Gabriel, and his partner, an accountant called Andy (Fra Fee), as they start the process. It is funny, emotionally acute and at times heart-wrenching \u2013 particularly when they arrive at an activity day and are presented with a brochure of children, each innocent face hiding a tragic story.
