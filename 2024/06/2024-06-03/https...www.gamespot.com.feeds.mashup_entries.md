<p dir="ltr">Michael Crichton passed away in 2008, but the prolific author's writing career has continued on with a batch of posthumously published books--and today, his latest novel, Eruption, is finally available to buy. Eruption is a thriller novel set just before "a history-making eruption is about to destroy the Big Island of Hawaii. But a secret held for decades by the US military is far more terrifying than any volcano." Sounds like a classic Crichton story premise to us. Best of all, you can grab the hardcover edition of Eruption at a special launch discount online. It's available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eruption-Coming_Michael-Crichton-Patterson_the-Thriller/dp/0316565075?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https://howl.me/cmn6xYTmTAO?u1=subid_value&amp;p=http://www.gamespot.com/feeds/news&amp;event_type=click">Target</a> for just $19.20 (normally $32.49).</p><div class="norewrite" title="">

"So I think that is something that's a little bit different... When you look at Star Wars films and shows in the past, you see that whether it's the costume or some of the martial arts [and] choreography, there is some kind of Asian influence. So I thought that maybe, because The Acolyte happens in a timeline that is previous to any show or film that's out currently, there was a choice to select an Asian actor for the role of Master Sol."</p><p>Lee also revealed that before he was cast in this series, he was a fan of Russ
