<p>New York is poised to pass a law that will bar social media platforms from showing algorithmic feeds to teens without parental consent. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/new-york-set-to-restrict-social-media-algorithms-for-teens-ce250dfe"><ins>reports</ins></a> that lawmakers in the state have reached a “tentative agreement” on a bill that will be voted on later this week.</p>

<p>Instagram ads may soon be much harder to ignore. As <em>TechCrunch</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/03/instagram-confirms-test-of-unskippable-ads/"><ins>reports</ins></a>, Meta is testing a new type of non-skippable ad in the Instagram feed, which the company is calling an “ad break.”</p>
<p>With the new ads, which have already been spotted by some users, you can’t scroll past the feed ad until the”ad break” finishes. According to screenshots shared on <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1d52psw/ad_break_ie_unskippable_ads_now_on_instagram/"><ins>Reddit</ins></a> and <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/TheDanLevy/status/1796903470210892101"><ins>X</ins></a>, it appears that the “breaks” are a few seconds long, though it’s not clear if the length could change should Meta decide to make the new format official. “Ad breaks are a new way of seeing ads on Instagram,” an in-app message sta

<p>A collection of leaked internal Google privacy cases provides a rare glimpse into the company’s volume and handling of breaches, accidents and other incidents. <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.404media.co/google-leak-reveals-thousands-of-privacy-incidents/"><em>404 Media</em></a> obtained and pored through the database, which covers thousands of internally flagged privacy and security issues from 2013 to 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google verified the trove’s authenticity with Engadget but claimed some of the reports were related to third-party services or didn’t end up being cause for concern. “At Google employees can quickly flag potential product issues for review by the relevant teams,” a company spokesperson wrote to Engadget. “When an employee submits the flag they suggest the priority level to the reviewer. The reports obtained by 404 are from over six years ago and are examples of these flags — every one was reviewed and resolved at that time. In some cases, these empl

<p>A long time ago I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPbh6Ru7VVM">a video about John Nese</a>, owner of the iconic Galco’s Soda Pop Stop in LA, and one thing that stuck with me was <a href="https://youtu.be/gPbh6Ru7VVM?t=636">his response</a> after being asked how much soda he drinks. Nese said that even though he’ll have one or two a day, what it really boils down to is that he “just likes the bubbles.” However, as much as I enjoy hunting down special flavors in stores, nothing beats the convenience of making your own sparkling concoctions at home. So when I heard that Breville was releasing a carbonated beverage maker with a feature not available from rivals like SodaStream I knew I wanted to test it out.

Thankfully, there’s a lot of tech out there that helps ease the burden for moms and dads, from wireless earbuds and tablets, to a simple rattle that can help diffuse a potential meltdown. Tech won’t help with the mountains of dirty diapers or the sleepless nights, but it can at least help new parents stay sane.</p>

<p>Yusaku Maezawa, the Japanese billionaire who signed up for a lunar orbit flight aboard SpaceX's Starship <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-18-who-is-yusaku-maezawa-spacexs-first-lunar-tourist.html">back in 2018</a>, has cancelled his trip. The reason, he said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/yousuckMZ/status/1796778107359359253">series of posts on X</a>, is that Starship is still in development and the &quot;dearMoon&quot; launch may not occur until well into the 2030s.</p>
<p>&quot;I signed the contract in 2018 based on the assumption that dearMoon would launch by the end of 2023,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It’s a developmental project so it is what it is, but it is still uncertain as to when Starship can launch. I can't plan my future in this situation, and I feel terrible making the crew members wait longer. I apologize to those who were excited for this project to happen.&quot;</p>

<p>The first crewed launch of Boeing’s Starliner was<a href="https://www.engadget.com/starliners-first-crewed-flight-gets-scrubbed-just-before-launch-171045016.html"> scrubbed</a> less than four minutes before liftoff after a computer failed to launch the correct countdown. It’s the squillionth setback for the craft, (our math may be out a little) which should support the next generation of spaceflight. NASA says it’ll target June 5 for its next launch attempt. At this point, we’ll believe it when we see it.</p>

<p>ASUS announced a trio of new releases in its ProArt line of laptops at this week’s Computex expo in Taipei. These devices are generally thinner, lighter and more portable than previous generations, though that’s where the similarities end. Let’s get into it.</p>
<p>The ProArt 16 is a thinner and lighter version of the ProArt Studiobook, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-pro-art-studiobook-16-oled-review-the-best-windows-creator-laptop-150041474.html">which we absolutely loved</a>. The refreshed design is based on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-review-not-just-for-gamers-153001954.html">chassis found with the ROG G16</a>, but with some crucial differences. There’s a 4K 60Hz screen and a virtual dialpad instead of the physical knob found on the Studiobook. It features a nano black coating that is said to be fingerprint-resistant.</p>

<p>ASUS unveiled a bunch of new laptops at this week’s Computex tech expo in Taipei, including a Zenbook refresh. The Zenbook S16 is as sleek and well-designed as ever, but comes with a spate of iterative improvements and a couple of major updates.</p>
<p>It's equipped with AMD's Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-unveils-ryzen-ai-300-cpus-for-copilot-laptops-030033575.html">announced just hours ago</a>. That chip promises improved laptop AI performance with 50 TOPS of processing power, triple AMD's previous laptop hardware. That makes it suitable for Copilot+, meaning Qualcomm isn't the only game in town for Microsoft's AI assistant.</p>

<p>Microsoft's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-unveils-copilot-pcs-with-generative-ai-capabilities-baked-in-170445370.html">Copilot+ initiative for super-charged AI PCs </a>is becoming more of a reality at Computex 2024. Today, AMD announced its next major chip platforms, Ryzen AI 300 for notebooks and Ryzen 9000 for desktops, which respectively target beefier laptop AI performance and fast gaming on desktops. Notably, Ryzen AI 300 chips feature a revamped neural processing unit (NPU) with 50 TOPS (tera operations per second) of AI performance, more than three times AMD's previous laptop hardware. The new desktop processors, meanwhile, are reportedly 16 percent faster than their predecessors when it comes to overall performance.</p>
<p>The key takeaway from these announcements is that Qualcomm is no longer the only company able to gloat about fast AI hardware for Copilot+ PCs. That initiative, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-unveils-copilot-pcs-with-gener
