However, it’s unclear if the city will soon pretend to care about that, as three people were <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/shooting-center-city-philadelphia/3874759/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shot in Center City</u></a> last night and we have yet to hear about it. But with how things are going, it’s not likely that the city will do anything to crack down on lawlessness. </p>
<p>While the city does nothing that is significant to tackle real issues, they have decided to set the Guinness World Record for the largest drag story time event because that’s how pathetic they are.

Subsequently, the man was ordered to turn himself in to authorities after the judge was baffled as to why he would do that. However, it turns out his license was actually supposed to be reinstated over two years ago and he is yet another victim of government employee incompetence, aka a “clerical error.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

And just like how they stole the rainbow, this was not up for discussion. But what begs the question is that if we are to have an entire month dedicated to insignificant preferences, why are they so exclusive to the majority of the population? Why is the month so blatantly bigoted towards straight people? </p><p>Well, <a href="https://oldstatesaloon.com/" target="_blank">one bar in Idaho</a> is fighting this anti-straight movement by declaring June “Heterosexual Awesomeness Month”.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">BREAKING: A bar in Idaho, Old State Saloon, in Eagle, near Boise, is celebrating ‘Heterosexual Awesomeness
