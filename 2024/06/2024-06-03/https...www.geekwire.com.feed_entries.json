The cutbacks come as Microsoft tries to maintain its profit margins amid heavier capital spending, which is designed to provide the cloud infrastructure needed to train and deploy the models that power AI applications. Microsoft employed about 227,000 people worldwide at the end of the 2023 calendar year, down from 232,000 a year earlier, according to numbers tracked by GeekWire based the company&#8217;s regulatory filings and earnings calls.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-cuts-jobs-in-azure-hololens-and-other-units-in-latest-move-to-control-costs/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-cuts-jobs-in-azure-hololens-and-other-units-in-latest-move-to-control-costs", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Microsoft cuts jobs in Azure, HoloLens, and other units in latest move to control costs", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-03T21:34:14+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/didgerobots-1260x945.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />A couple of high-tech workers are part of the crew helping to construct a new residential tower in Seattle&#8217;s Belltown neighborhood.

The generative AI boom has led to an increase in deepfakes, or digitally manipulated photos, videos, and audio that use someone&#8217;s likeness to generate synthetic media. Deepfakes have already become a problem in schools, elections, entertainment, and various other sectors of society. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a lot of control over this,&#8221; said Luke Arrigoni, CEO of Loti, a Seattle startup that helps public figures take down deepfakes and&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-startups-tackle-deepfake-and-digital-likeness-issues-spurred-by-generative-ai/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-startups-tackle-deepfake-and-digital-likeness-issues-spurred-by-generative-ai", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "These startups are tackling deepfake and digital likeness issues spurred by generative AI", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-03T17:09:12+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"482\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sheerid.jpeg\" width=\"833\" /><br />Portland-based marketing verification startup SheerID named Stephanie Copeland Weber&#160;as the company&#8217;s CEO on Monday.
