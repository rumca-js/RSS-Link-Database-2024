The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road is shaping up to be one of the very best expansions Bethesda has put out yet for the 10-year-old MMO. The new zone will be familiar to Oblivion fans, as it comprises The West Weald region just west of Cyrodiil. 

West Weald is comparable in size to Vvardenfell and Craglorn, and there’s loads of content to fill in that space and then some. In addition to the autumnal tones of The West Weald’s Gold Road region, players will be able to finally explore the mysterious emergent jungle of Dawnwood, as well as the northern Colovian Highlands home to Ayleid Ruins.

looks to be the team’s most creative yet.

In the first half of this year, then, it's been hard not to be disappointed in how things are turning out for PlayStation.

Suddenly, however, things are starting to look up. Sure, we're not getting a big blockbuster PlayStation Studios release this year along the lines of something like a Spider-Man, Horizon, or what have you, but from smaller first-party games to externally developed titles being published under the PlayStation Studios umbrella to major third-party exclusives, all things considered, the PlayStation 5 has
