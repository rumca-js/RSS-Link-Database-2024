		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/socure">Socure</a> has released <a href="https://www.socure.com/resources/reports/digital-ghost">a new study </a>revealing that 35 percent of Gen Zers in the U.S. and nearly a third of legal immigrants are "Digital Ghosts," lacking sufficient financial history to pass standard identity verification processes required for accessing financial and government services.

Digital Ghosts are, according to the report, characterized by minimal to no engagement with credit cards, loans, rental leases, home purchases, or mobile device plans. The lack of activity results in insufficient credit bureau history and public records, impeding their ability to navigate traditional ID verification systems.

The study found that 54 percent of

ESBI will now be governed by Europeum, a European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (EDIC) which is the official name for legal frameworks that help EU countries implement multi-country projects.

Designed to support cross-border cooperation between public administrations, businesses and citizens, ESBI is currently in its pilot stage. Some of its projects include supporting the EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet in cross-border use cases and deploying it in national digital identities.
