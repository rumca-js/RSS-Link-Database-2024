Starting out his films were unlike anything people had seen before.  Movies like Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou put Wes Anderson on the map.  But as time went on, his symmetrical framing, limited palate, and quirky characters all started to feel part of a formula.  With each passing movie, the tropes got more intense, and it felt he was leaning more into being \"Wes Anderson\" than making quality films like he used to.  It all came to a point during this specific moment when I personally started to get tired of Wes Anderson. \n\n#wesanderson #wesandersontrend #director #nerdstalgic", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpDqbQwoPFk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXjmz8dFzRJZrZY8eFiXNUQ", "source_obj__id": 236, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/GpDqbQwoPFk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Moment We Got Tired Of Wes Anderson", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
