Lian Li announced its Lancool 207 $80 high-airflow budget case, coming out later this year and likely competing as one of the fiercest sub-$100 PC cases for 2024. We'll see how it does in our review. The company also showcased its Lancool 217 with wood paneling at #computex 2024, alongside its SL V3 "wireless" RGB solution (or at least, wire reducing). The Lancool series is exciting for bringing the industry back towards cheap competitors. We're looking forward to seeing how it does. CEO Jameson Chen joined us for some engineering discussion as well.

AMD today announced its new Zen 5 CPU lineup for a release date of July 2024, including the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X, Ryzen 9 9900X, R7 9700X, and R5 9600X. These Zen 5 CPUs are a new architecture, but are supported on the existing AMD motherboards with AM5 sockets; however, AMD also announced its new X870 and X870E motherboard platforms (no word officially on the B-series chipsets yet). In addition to the Zen 5 and chipset announcements, AMD extended its life for AM5 into 2027 and beyond officially, citing success of AM4's life as a reason. For other announcements, the company will release new AM4 CPUs in July of 2024 with the 5900XT and 5800XT. It also has new Ryzen 300 AI CPUs, server products that we won't cover in depth today, and more.
