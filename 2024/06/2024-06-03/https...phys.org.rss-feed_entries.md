Those of us who find it difficult to eat less meat for the sake of climate tend to apologize or justify ourselves in social contexts. And… shaming vegans isn't off limits. This, according to a new University of Copenhagen study. Clearer messaging about meat as a climate problem from public authorities could help, say the researchers.

Astatine is one of the least-studied elements of the periodic table, because all isotopes of astatine are unstable, with the longest half-life barely exceeding 8 hours. Thus, only radiochemists at the production facilities (limited worldwide) can have access to this element to study its properties in a timely manner. Most of these isotopes undergo alpha decay. This type of radioactive decay releases alpha particles, which consist of two protons and two neutrons. These alpha particles can target and destroy diseased cells in the body.

The movement of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans and continents—the carbon cycle—is a fundamental process that regulates Earth's climate. Some factors, like volcanic eruptions or human activity, emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Others, such as forests and oceans, absorb that CO2. In a well-regulated system, the right amount of CO2 is emitted and absorbed to maintain a healthy climate. Carbon sequestration is one tactic in the current battle against climate change.

Donald Trump has recently doubled down on his derogatory depictions of undocumented migrants in his bid to win the 2024 presidential election. In an interview with Time magazine, published on April 30 2024, Trump referred to migrants as "criminals," who "come in and they steal our jobs, and steal our wealth, and they steal our country." Trump was especially disparaging towards migrants from China, who he said are a "major force that's forming in our country." In short, according to Trump, undocumented migration is "an invasion of our country."

To reliably perform complex, large-scale calculations, computing systems rely on so-called error correction schemes, techniques designed to protect information against errors. These techniques are perhaps even more essential when it comes to quantum computers, devices that perform computations leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics.

While invasive alien species have long been recognized as a major threat to nature and people, urgent action now is needed to tackle this global issue. This is the critical evaluation by the 88 authors, representing 101 organizations from 47 countries, of "Curbing the major and growing threats from invasive alien species is urgent and achievable" published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, including lead author Professor Helen Roy from the UK Center for Ecology & Hydrology and the University of Exeter.

## Scientists develop 'X-ray vision' technique to see inside crystals

A team of New York University researchers has created a new way to visualize crystals by peering inside their structures, akin to having X-ray vision. Their new technique—which they aptly named "Crystal Clear"—combines the use of transparent particles and microscopes with lasers that allow scientists to see each unit that makes up the crystal and to create dynamic three-dimensional models.
