Director Jeff Nichols’ The Bikeriders chronicles a tumultuous decade in the life of a fictional Midwestern outlaw motorcycle club called the Vandals, who transform from a band of speed-loving bike enthusiasts into a full-fledged criminal enterprise during the 1960s and ‘70s. 

The Vandals are led by Johnny (Tom Hardy), an aging boss who finds an heir apparent in the thrill-seeking but fiercely individualistic Benny (Austin Butler). Benny’s strong-willed girlfriend Kathy (Jodie Comer) eventually wants a different kind of life for her and Benny, putting her at odds with Johnny and testing Benny’s loyalties as the world around the Vandals is consumed by violence.

The Bikeriders opens in theaters on June 21.
