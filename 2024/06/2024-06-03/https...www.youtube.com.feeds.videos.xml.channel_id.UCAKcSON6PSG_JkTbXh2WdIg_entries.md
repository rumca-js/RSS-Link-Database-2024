Good News is a feature about music having a positive impact 
Support The Current: https://support.mpr.org/youtube  

There are a lot of reasons you come to The Current: the great music playlist, a chance to learn something new, and a meaningful break in your day. I'd like to elevate that experience with stories about music positively impacting the world. By bringing you Good News each Monday evening at 8 p.m., I hope to turn those happy endorphins up to 11 with a hand-picked song and a story to inspire our community to amplify goodness.

Music can elevate our moods, connect and inspire us, and be an agent of change. In addition to sharing stories that I find, I also want to hear your Good News, too. Maybe a concert led you to find the love of your life, a song inspired you into an act of kindness, you heard the right tune at the right time, or maybe those frequencies are being channeled into changing our world for the better.

Coming up in the June 3 edition of Good News, I will share
