It is a campus bursting with lessons for the body and mind. Maybe you have an affirming experience, where you learn you’ve got way more stamina than you realised, that you <em>are</em> able to let your insecurities go and fully let loose, or that actually you really, <em>really</em> like hardstep and you’re building that playlist just as soon as you get home. Or maybe your Damascene moment is a starker one, where your mental age and actual age collide head-on. For better or worse, you <em>will</em> learn something about yourself.

<p>Forward is at his best coming off the flank, but this may cause an imbalance in the side as they take on Belgium</p><p>When some teams are dull and unimpressive, it is because they are dull and unimpressive. When France are dull and unimpressive, it is because they are managing the tournament. With a World Cup triumph, plus defeats in another World Cup final and a European Championship final under his belt as head coach, Didier Deschamps has earned that sympathy.</p><p>Portugal’s success at Euro 2016 and France’s at the 2018 World Cup are the examples on which Gareth Southgate has to a large degree based his philosophy. Keep it tight, reduce as much as possible the possibility of the opposition scoring and rely on the excellence of the forward players to win the margins. Deschamps clearly learned a lot under Marcelo Lippi at Juventus, but in his approach to tournaments he follows Aimé Jacquet, under whom he captained France to the World Cup in 1998.</p> <a href="https://www.theguar

<p>The first – and only – All Black to come out publicly as gay on his life-changing decision and being a role model</p><p>On a midweek lunchtime in Hawke’s Bay you would not instantly single out Campbell Johnstone as a former New Zealand international prop. Standing outside a local cafe near the beach in Napier in his checked shirt and dark blue gilet, there is nothing much to differentiate him from any other passing Kiwi. Unless, that is, you happen to be aware of his unique place in All Black history and the courageous personal path upon which he has embarked.</p><p>As the first – and only – All Black to come out as gay, Johnstone is better placed than anyone to say whether professional men’s rugby still has a way to go in terms of inclusivity.

His and everyone else’s too. When the <em>selección </em>touched down in Tbilisi to face Georgia in September 2023, the trunk carrying part of their kit was still sitting at Barajas, forcing them<em> </em>to complete the evening session at the Boris Paichadze stadium in trainers, unable to strike the ball. The following night, they scored seven. On his debut, the Barcelona winger got the last of them, aged 16 years and 57 days, and the national team got a new beginning.</p><p>Ten months on, Spain face Georgia again, this time for place in the quarter-final of Euro 2024.

Two sentences earned a mark in pen: “I think we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be, whether we find them attractive company or not. Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on the mind’s door at 4am of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them, who betrayed them, who is going to make amends.”</p><p>We grow estranged from our younger selves at our peril. This warning sits at the centre of Lucy Foulkes’s excellent and insightful new book, <em>Coming of Age: How Adolescence Shapes Us</em>.

For much of his childhood, spent in Germany and the US, Kircher was estranged from his father – who served time in prison for drugs offences and attempted murder – but they were reacquainted when he was 15. For a decade or more after that Kircher photographed the people and places in his father’s wayward life.</p><p>In this picture, he explains: “Dilo is getting her hair dyed in a salon we went to almost every night for two weeks. My father and the owner of the salon were upstairs, smoking weed and snorting cocaine.

<p>The party faces major challenges in tackling the Conservative legacy</p><p>On Thursday, voters will have a historic opportunity, not just decisively to evict one of the worst governments this country has ever endured. They will have the chance to replace it with something altogether different: a Labour administration characterised by integrity and a respect for public office, an understanding of ordinary people’s lives, and an honest desire to make Britain a fairer and greener place. Such simple ingredients, but ones that have been missing in action for the past 14 years, to the detriment of us all.</p><p>Only three Labour leaders have won majorities in the past 100 years.
