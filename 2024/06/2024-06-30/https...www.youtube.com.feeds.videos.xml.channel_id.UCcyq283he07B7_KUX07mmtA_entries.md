Japan is one of the leading producers of shiitake mushrooms. These mushrooms are notoriously difficult to cultivate on a commercial scale â€” especially when using the 1,000-year-old Japanese technique of wood-grown mushrooms. In the US, indoor-grown shiitake sells for upwards of $8 per pound, while forest-grown shiitakes have commanded a much higher price, up to $18 per pound. The most premium shiitake mushrooms are called white flower shiitake, and the forest-grown versions can sell for over $160 per pound. White flower shiitakes have noticeable white cracks on the caps and a strong flavor, but even just a few drops of rain can ruin them completely. Here's why forest-grown shiitake mushrooms are so expensive.
