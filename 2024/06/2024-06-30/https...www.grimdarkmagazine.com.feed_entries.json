Butler\u2019s been on my TBR forever, so I jumped at the chance to review Headline\u2019s beautiful new editions. Parable of the Sower hits the spot perfectly, balancing social criticism and complex characters with a timeless story. Set distinctly within the tradition of Afrofuturism, Parable of the Sower introduces the reader to a world ravaged by climate change, a world in which the lack of natural resources has driven society into small communities. As small, isolated communities tend to, they have regressed in mindset, growing more rigid in what they accept. And with that, Butler holds a mirror up to our collective faces. While the book was initially published in 1993, the story starts in 2024 &#8211; and is no less relevant to this 2024. We meet Lauren, the story\u2019s protagonist, as a teen chafing against society. Her role as a young woman is heavily regimented &#8211; until disaster hits. Having lost her home, Lauren and her companions set out to find safety in the north.
