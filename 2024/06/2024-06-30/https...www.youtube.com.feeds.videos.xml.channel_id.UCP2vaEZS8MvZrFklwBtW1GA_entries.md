Large shower wall tiles are terrific but require special attention. While not always necessary, I often back flat trowel or back not trowel 12x24s. Then I trowel thin-set on the wall such that all the notches are parallel with the 12-inch side. This allows air to escape, the notches to collapse, and the best bond to occur.
