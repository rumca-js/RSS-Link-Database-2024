<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I'm pretty new to the self-hosted thing. I've been a long-time windows guy. 20+ years of supporting the typical Microsoft stack. Plus been around VMWare and Netapp when esxi was new. Recently, I've had the opportunity at work , to support some apache services running on REHL. So, a few months ago, I pulled an old desktop out of he closet and installed Proxmox. Holy Cow, it is amazing how fast you can dive into the rabbit hole. I've got a NAS and built out a network running pfsense router and Aruba InstantOn swithces and APs. Lately, I interested in DYI NAS. So, I'm wondering how often do you guys rip it all out and start down a different fork in the rabbit hole?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OrganizationNew9063"> /u/OrganizationNew9063 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1drrki5/direction_change/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I currently have my speakers connected to a small amp which connects to my desktop PC by USB (dual boots Arch &amp; Windows). I also run proxmox on a mini PC with a bunch of containers for Jellyfin, linux iso acquisition etc.</p> <p>I would like to be able to play music without booting the desktop PC, but not have to swap cables around when I do want to play games or watch videos on the desktop (mostly Windows). The amp has other inputs (Bluetooth, analogue) but I'd rather avoid manually changing inputs, for example if I have been playing a game but am now in the kitchen, I would like to put some music on from my phone without going back to the lounge. The desktop PC, mini PC, and amp are all on the same desk at the moment.</p> <p>I think the solution is plugging the amp directly in to the mini PC, and then solving two problems</p> <ol> <li>Setting up an audio device on Windows that pipes output to the mini PC</li> <li>Setting up one or more container
