Interestingly, July is shaping up to be a month where live-service games are in the spotlight. You have the new Final Fantasy 14 expansion, Dawntrail, launching on July 2 alongside Nexon's The First Descendant, and just two days later, Genshin Impact developer Hoyoverse launches Zenless Zone Zero.</p><p>Beyond a trio of games jockeying for your valuable attention, there are also some good-looking smaller games on the horizon. Slaycation simulator Dungeons of Hinterberg balances dungeon-exploration with socializing at a resort set in the Alps, Anger Foot will let you reboot crime in its ugly face, and Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn brings a gun to a sword fight.</p><p>Originally scheduled to launch on July 25, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-g", "id": 792199, "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-biggest-game-releases-of-july-2024/2900-5543", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "source_obj__id": 126, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1601/16018044/4324492-july-games.jpg", "title": "The Biggest Game Releases Of July 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
