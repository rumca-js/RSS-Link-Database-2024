## Starlight Express review – Lloyd Webber’s bizarre juggernaut is bigger, camper and more OTT than ever

<p><strong>Troubadour Wembley Park theatre, London<br /></strong>Updated with references to net zero, the 1984 musical is back on track in all its outlandish glory</p><p>What bald-faced audacity led Andrew Lloyd Webber to conceive a show featuring the lives – and loves – of train carriages that sing their way through a nocturnal track-race while on roller-skates? Is Starlight Express the most outlandish musical ever to grace the stage?</p><p>It certainly seems so as it rumbles back from its bay after four decades in a bigger, camper and more preposterously OTT revival than its 1984 original, though the most confounding question is how this bizarre juggernaut of a show pulls it off in spite of it all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/jun/30/starlight-express-review-andrew-lloyd-webber-troubadour-wembley-park-theatre-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Midfielder is as close to a footballing certainty as you can get, ensuring Luis de la Fuente’s side broke Georgia’s hearts</p><p>Nothing in football is certain, but Rodri is perhaps as close as it’s possible to get. There are times when it seems he is the teacher stepping in to a kids’ game to make sure it doesn’t become too one-sided, the grown-up who doesn’t have to bother with the things like running. He just strolls about, delivering accurate pass after accurate pass and, occasionally, scoring vital goals.</p><p>This was Rodri’s 89th game since Manchester City lost 1-0 at Tottenham in the Premier League on 5 February 2023. Since then he has lost only twice. If you take out games in which Scott McTominay was on the opposing side, he hasn’t lost at all. Quite why McTominay should be his kryptonite is unclear, but rivals should as a matter of urgency isolate whatever the active component is and start trying to manufacture it synthetically. Until Georgia’s legs went in the second h

<p>Spain versus Germany, then. Don’t mind if we do. The tournament hosts and its best team so far will meet in Stuttgart for a place in the semi-final after the <em>selección</em> took 31 shots and scored four goals to ease past Georgia here. Only ease may not be quite the right word. They were impressive again en route to a victory secured with goals from Rodri, Fabián Ruiz, Nico Williams and Dani Olmo, a lovely combination of quality, control and velocity and are surely favourites, but that may make it sound a little simpler than it was. If only because for the first time here in Germany they trailed.</p><p>At least, it risks diminishing what Georgia did here, however much they deserved to progress – and they did. Willy Sagnol’s men meanwhile are heading home, where 3.7m people will rightly welcome them as heroes. The lowest ranked team here, 74 in the world, 35 in Europe, that is no surprise. What is a surprise is how much they will be missed, how much fun we had watching them, how

Pop punk is very much a thing again, and while you can trace the genre’s roots back to the Buzzcocks’ debut single, no artist can claim to have made punk more pop than Avril Lavigne did in the early 00s: refashioning its sound – and a dash of grunge’s angst – as bratty but harmless tweenage entertainment. She shifted so many copies of her debut album in the process that its follow-up was deemed a commercial disappointment on the grounds that only sold 10m as opposed to its predecessor’s 16m. Moreover, pop punk’s current practitioners have been more tha

The whispers going around Worthy farm was that Twain would arrive on stage riding a horse.</p><p>As often the case with Glastonbury rumours, it proved to have only the slightest, wonkiest bit of truth: Twain’s arrival is heralded by a procession of elaborate, larger-than-life hobby horses, held aloft by a motley group of dancers and drag queens, led by a whip-cracking ringleader. The crowd dissipates to reveal Twain, swamped with pink tulle and crowned, of course, with a rhinestone-studded black cowboy hat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/30/sh

Will hope or hopelessness win out?</p><p>You can’t miss the fact at Glastonbury that there is an election coming. For one, there is a lot of “get the vote out” messaging. A large black box saying: “Use your superpower: vote,” funded by Dale Vince, the founder of the green electricity firm Ecotricity and a Labour party donor, sits in a field. Yellow stickers on tables read: “Crash the party, vote.” One archway is more overt in its message: “Vote out to help out.” Damon Albarn made a surprise appearance to perform with the Bombay Bicycle Club on Friday, enjoining the audience midway through the set to talk about “the importance of voting this week”.</p><p>A couple of signs make oblique reference to the fact that people don’t feel that enthusiastic about the democratic offer: “Politics isn’t about them.

So badly received was the La Scala premiere in 1840 they cancelled the rest of the run.

It would be more than 50 years before he wrote Falstaff, his only other comedy.</p><p>So why revive it now? Well, as Christopher Alden’s frenetic, over-egged soufflé of a staging for Garsington Opera demonstrates, there’s a decent evening’s entertainment in there just itching to be liberated.

<p>Lupita Nyong’o stars as a poet with cancer who wants to live a little in this beefed-up disaster movie set in New York</p><p>It could be the idea of setting the <em>Quiet Place</em> prequel in New York, one of the noisiest places on Earth. Or perhaps it’s because the intimate, taut horror premise of the first two pictures is beefed up with some robust city-smashing disaster movie muscle. Maybe it’s the casting of the always excellent Lupita Nyong’o in a textured and complex role – she plays Sam, a poet and a terminal cancer patient who just wants to live a little before she dies. All of this combines to ramp up the impact of <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em> considerably, compared with its immediate predecessor. It’s a bleak, bruising but also curiously life-affirming account of the start of the end of the world. The directing baton has been passed to Michael Sarnoski (<em>Pig</em>), who co-wrote the film’s deft, light-footed screenplay with the original writer/director, John Krasins

<ul><li>Lyles runs breaks record with fastest time of the year</li><li>Richardson finishes fourth in the women’s 200</li></ul><p>Noah Lyles kept his hopes for the sprint double at the Olympics alive Saturday night, coming from behind to win the 200 meters at the US track trials in 19.53 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year.<br /><br />
 Lyles added the 200, his signature race and the distance at which he is a three-time world champion, to the 100 he won last weekend.<br /><br />
 It was no blowout, as Lyles had to race to the line to pass Kenny Bednarek with about 10 meters left and beat him by .06 seconds. Erriyon Knighton, racing for the first time this year at trials after being cleared after an investigation about eating drug-tainted meat, finished third and made his second Olympic team.</p><p>Lyles’ 19.53 broke an Olympic trials record of 19.66 held by Michael Johnson since 1996.<br /><br />
 Lyles will head to Paris hoping to make up for his only loss in the 200 at a

<p>Extreme class privilege informed the Tories’ worst decisions. This Labour cabinet would represent something very different</p><p>However airless and dull this election campaign has been, one thing remains incontestable: that, unless something very strange happens, we are about to reach the end of a long political era. The years between 2010 and 2024 will be seen as a clearly defined time – of austerity, Brexit, the post-2016 collapse of the Tory party into internal strife … and, underneath it all, a United Kingdom that will end its latest blue period in an immeasurably worse state than when the whole mess started.</p><p>One crucial part of the story, however, might be underplayed. Partly because so many powerful British people come from backgrounds characterised by wealth, privilege and private education, emphasising the importance of such things is still often seen as impolite. But if we are going to understand what has happened to us, how can that subject be avoided?</p> <a href=

<p>Satisfying momentum builds in this involving but inauthentic first instalment of the Hollywood star’s mega-epic of settlers and Native Americans</p><p>The weighty first instalment of Kevin Costner’s western mega-epic, this is unapologetically old-school in its approach. The colours, clay reds and the glistening gold of Sienna Miller’s suspiciously well-washed hair, practically sing from the frame. The score is stirring and self-important. The Native Americans are neatly divided into the ruthless killers intent on exterminating the settlers, and those who take what the film frames as the reasonable approach of appeasement and cooperation with the white folk. This is the kind of handsome, well-nourished film-making that looks an absolute treat up on the screen, but is about as authentically Old West as a set of dental veneers. Still, it’s not uninvolving. The picture takes its own sweet time getting going, but a satisfying momentum builds through the multiple, interlinked storylines.

<p>Most UK children have their own phone by the age of 11. But what if we didn’t give them one? A group of parents wants their kids to enjoy a phone-free childhood – and their numbers are growing</p><p>Last year, Daisy Greenwell and Clare Fernyhough, longtime friends who have eight- and nine-year-old daughters, began having drawn-out conversations about smartphones. Rumours were swirling that children in their daughters’ classes were asking for their own and both Greenwell and Fernyhough were apprehensive about the knock-on effect. If their daughters’ friends owned smartphones, wouldn’t their daughters eventually demand them, too? And what might happen then? Talking to the parents of children who already owned smartphones only helped to increase their concern. “They told us about kids disappearing into their screens,” Greenwell said recently. “They don’t want to hang out with family any more. They don’t want to go outside.” A local teacher told Greenwell he was able to speak with his

<p>A disturbing documentary explores tech’s questionable ability to bring digital ‘comfort’ to the bereaved</p><p>Death is a booming business. For one thing, it’s inevitable. For another, it brings a uniquely vulnerable and receptive market for any product that promises to numb the grief. Enter artificial intelligence. This thought-provoking and bang-up-to-the-minute documentary explores a morally questionable use of AI: the digital afterlife business, tech that recreates the personality (and in some cases speaking voice and even the likeness) of deceased individuals, designed to offer “comfort” to the bereaved. It’s the kind of technology that exists on the knife-edge between thrilling innovation and cynical recklessness. We meet a mother from South Korea who is introduced to an avatar of her daughter through a VR headset; a woman whose “chats” with her late boyfriend take on an unsettlingly demonic quality when the AI tells her that he’s “in hell” and threatens to haunt her.

The vehicle swerved and slid in the storm, lightning flashed on the horizon, thunder shook the air. Whether the old yellow bus would make it back to the ranch house, get stuck or slide and flip depended on his driving.</p><p>Don, in his white Stetson and a blue and white checked western shirt, was our tour guide on this land in northwestern New Mexico that he knew intimately and had dedicated his retirement to protecting.

<p>A Beatrix Potter-meets-ancient-Rome aesthetic brings and dignity and intimacy to Patrick Lynch’s addition to the coroner’s court that held the hearings into Grenfell and the Westminster Bridge attacks</p><p>Westminster coroner’s court is a pretty, playful building from 1893 by the little-known architect GRW Wheeler, red brick with stone trimmings, pertly symmetrical, its style sort of Jacobean. “It’s a bit Beatrix Potter,” says the architect of its new extension, Patrick Lynch. The mood of the original building doesn’t say much about the sombre activities it was built to contain: the identification of bodies, the examination of deaths felt to be in need of explanation, the matter-of-fact delivery of conclusions on causes and circumstances. Its aim seems to be comfort, its message “never mind”.</p><p>Lynch’s stone-faced, timber-framed extension looks, at first sight, as different as can be. It presents, next to the old building’s busy-ness, a smooth, blank, round-ended elevation, wh

<p>By harnessing the power of pension funds, it truly can become the party of growth</p><p>Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism. It needs capitalism to be successful, dynamic and job creating, even while it instinctively distrusts capitalism, with its capacity to generate extreme inequality, invest too little, cut corners and treat workers exploitatively. But its past efforts at improving things – nationalisation, top-down planning, championing strong trade unions or simply (as New Labour did) largely giving capitalism its head – have not been notably successful. It has been a standoff that the Conservative party has ruthlessly exploited.</p><p>The seismic importance of 4 July is that Conservatism’s approach to wealth generation – trying to shrink the state whose size and excess taxes supposedly “crowds out” suppressed investment and enterprise – is exposed as a dead end of stagnant living standards and eviscerated public service

<p>Choose carefully and you will be rewarded with just the right amount of sweetness</p><p>Years ago, my friend Charlotte posited this theory that she had come up with: when people get out-of-the-blue foot injuries (ie not from playing sport or jumping out of planes) it’s their body’s way of telling them to slow down, when they haven’t listened to any of the cues beforehand. Ever since, I’ve thought about this when people have had unexpected foot injuries and, after some gentle interrogation, they tell me they were stressed/busy, etc. Highly scientific.</p><p>I was thinking of this, and all I had to do, in a fog of panic and dread, just before I took a step down into the garden to hang out the washing and turned my right ankle 90 degrees to the left.

<p>The unrelenting pursuit by America exposed how far officialdom will go to hide the truth</p><p>It was a messy ending to an often chaotic story. Julian Assange was released last week from Belmarsh prison to board a flight to the US-governed Pacific island of Saipan. There, under a special deal with the US authorities, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/jun/26/julian-assange-prison-release-inside-saipan-court">he pleaded guilty in court</a> to illegally securing and publishing classified documents in exchange for a prison sentence of five years, which he had already served in British prisons. And so, for the first time in 12 years, Assange found himself a free man.</p><p>Having to plead guilty to espionage was a necessity for Assange to gain personal freedom. But it raises wider questions about journalistic freedom. Assange has been charged with espionage not because he spied for a foreign government but because he did what many journalists do: he published class

<p>Interiors trends are all very well, but this is a horrible time to be a renter</p><p>There was an interiors trend recently that saw people buying shower curtains printed with grand scenes of glamour and escape, and pinning them to their fence or bedroom walls. One was a lifesize picture of a manicured English garden, another of a winding cobbled path leading off into a lush green distance. Somebody hung a curtain printed with a window just above their bath, the window appearing to open on to a scene of blue and exquisite tranquillity. Someone else printed a huge photo of their childhood garden to hang opposite the sink in their kitchen.</p><p>I sifted through the various online responses to this trend, which ranged from outrage (at the laziness of not growing one’s own garden) to mockery, in order to work out why these shower curtains made me feel so terribly, doomily sad.

<p>Travel-sized products make summer holiday packing a breeze</p><p>Many people find packing beauty products for travel a bit of a nightmare. You start to realise how much stuff you use on a daily basis before you even leave the house. Perhaps it’s time to scale back because, let’s face it, does anyone really need a choice of nine lipsticks and five serums for the sake of options? Well, actually, probably a beauty editor (it’s the job), hence we end up carting around everything and the kitchen sink. Decanting your products into smaller containers (Flying Tiger is a good place to get these) helps. But if you can’t be bothered with all that then get yourself minis, aka travel-sized products. They make packing a breeze and won’t weigh you or your luggage down. Their benefits, however, extend beyond travel – it’s an excellent way to trial a product without committing to a full-size option. And it’s much easier to carry around, say, a mini dry shampoo to zhoosh up your hair when you’re goi

<p>Duty on alcohol and tobacco is nothing new, but pegging tax to the abv level of wine is changing the way producers work</p><p><strong>Touraine Rouge Le Bécassou, Domaine des Echardières, Loire, France 2023 (£10.50, <a href="http://thewinesociety.com/">thewinesociety.com</a>) </strong>It’s never going to be a subject that comes up on the doorstep, and it’s hard to imagine anyone posing a question about it at a local hustings or TV debate. Still, wine, like everything else, does have a political dimension and the decisions taken by whichever party takes power on Thursday 4 July will affect those who drink and make it. The most common legislative interventions involve duty. Successive governments have tended to view alcohol, like tobacco, as a convenient and politically neutral place to raise tax revenues: the Office of Budget Responsibility reckons the current duty regime will bring in £16.1bn by 2028/29. Last year, the Tories added another dimension: pegging duty to alcoholic streng

The second half of the year starts here. I can’t help but feel a creeping urgency. So, time to sit back, breathe in, take stock.</p><p>It’s been an odd allotment year here in northwest London. Our early summer growth was unusually slow and, like many others, we have been a bit plagued by greedy gastropods.

<p>A Russian missile killed seven people and wiped out the country’s main book printer in May. But moves are already afoot to rebuild Factor Druk</p><p>Olena Ninadovska was inside Ukraine’s biggest printing house when the Russian missile hit. She was working in the binding department. It was 10.20am. Two colleagues – Tetaina Khrapina and Olha Kurasova – stood next to her. The women were operating a row of book-sewing machines. Another employee, Sveta Arestova, had just stepped away to take a telephone call.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/maria_avdv/status/1794697079962657162">The S-300 missile came through the roof</a>. There was no warning. It instantly killed Ninadovksa and the others at her workstation. Arestova was injured but survived. The blast flipped over a 10-tonne book-­finishing machine, killing Svitlana Ryzhenko, who was sitting at the end of the assembly line. Two more workers died at an adjacent table. Another, Roman Stroyhi, was killed by shards from a guillotine machine.

Coldplay pull out every last stop for their record fifth headline performance, and you’d be churlish not to love it</p><p>It is, as Chris Martin points out, 25 years since Coldplay’s Glastonbury debut, a silver anniversary they commemorate tonight by unexpectedly dusting down an acoustic version of Sparks from their debut album Parachutes. Perhaps more pertinently, it’s the fifth time they’ve headlined the festival, and they’ve got the hang of it to such an extent that it increasingly feels like the job the quartet were put on earth to do.</p><p>Since their last appearance in 2016, they’ve completed a 180 degree turn from earnest stadium balladeers to purveyors of relentless, balls-out, more-is-more visual overload: their gigs are now effectively a 21st-century equivalent of U2’s Zoo TV shows, albeit without any of U2’s accompanying theorising about the media or the relationship between art and commerc
