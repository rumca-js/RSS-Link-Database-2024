<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! (I appreciate feedback in case this is not the place for such question)</p> <p>TL:DR: How do I qualitatively check the results of a search engine? I have around 500k rows and thatâ€™s too much for a human.</p> <p>I recently started as PM for an e-commerce and I am responsible for the internal search of the shop. </p> <p>I have a file with like 500k rows, each one is one search term searched in the past 90days, and each one has the url of how it is resolved currently in the shop.</p> <p>This is so much manual work and humanly impossible to go on each term. Iâ€™ve created several helper columns but there are so many edge cases and language specific (we are in multiple countries).</p> <p>Any feedback on how to check qualitatively a file with so many outputs would be appreciated. Or if you know some other places I could ask or research about </p> <p>ðŸ«¶</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/damnkay"> /u/da
