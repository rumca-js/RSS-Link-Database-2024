On May 9, 2024, a 25-year-old man sang a cover of a 90s song "The Promise" and became a hit overnight in China. His name is Guo Youcai, a barbecue stall owner in Heze, Shandong Province. He deliberately chose the 80s style for his clothes and hairstyle and sang the old song every day at an old train station. Oddly and strangely, he became famous. For 10 consecutive days, he was ranked No. 1 on China's social media hot list, with 1.13 million viewers at peak, and more than 100 million likes.
