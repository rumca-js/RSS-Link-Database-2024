In 2021, SQ4D in Long Island, New York, listed the first-ever 3D-printed house for sale. Homes made by companies like SQ4D are built using a concrete mix and a massive 3D printer. Doing this can save builders over 30% in construction costs and, in some cases, cut building time in half. With the US facing a housing shortage of over 7 million homes, many feel it could be the best solution. We go behind the scenes to explore the construction process, the challenges builders face, and why there aren’t more 3D-printed homes.
