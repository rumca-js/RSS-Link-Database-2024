		In a move that has sparked debate and raised concerns about privacy and civil liberties, the Swedish police are considering the use of cameras equipped with real-time facial recognition to identify suspected criminals in public spaces. The proposed system would automatically scan the faces of individuals against a database of known offenders and alert law enforcement if a match is found.

Proponents of the technology argue that the use of facial recognition cameras could help law enforcement agencies quickly identify and apprehend dangerous criminals, thereby enhancing public safety.

The proposal suggests that the police, in accordance with the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202405/real-time-remote-biometrics-banned-in-eu-with-final-green-light-for-ai-act"

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/omnivision-technologies">OmniVision Technologies</a> has unveiled its latest intelligent CMOS image sensor, the OV01D1R, which integrates multiple functionalities into a single sensor module. This device is designed to perform human presence detection (HPD) and infrared facial authentication and features an always-on (AON) capability.

The company claims that the integrated HPD and facial recognition capabilities of the sensor enhance user privacy and security. The ability to detect human presence and authenticate users without manual intervention adds a layer of convenience. Furthermore, the always-on technology allows the sensor to remain active in a low-power state, continuously monitoring events.
