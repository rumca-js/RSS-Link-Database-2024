<p>Everyone wants in on the AI boom. For now, however, you can probably count on one hand the number of vendors cashing in.</p><p>The most obvious one is <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/957320/can-anybody-stop-nvidia.html">Nvidia</a>, of course. Nvidia has earned nation-state levels of cash for its GPUs ($26 billion in the first quarter of 2024 alone). Beyond Nvidia are the big three cloud vendors and OpenAI. Beyond that cast of five, however, it’s pretty hard to find many—yet.</p><p>That “yet” is the key here. We are absolutely in a frothy period for AI, where vendors are selling “hopium” and enterprises are buying just enough to fuel proofs of concept, without much production usage.

<p>Java's standard class library consists of thousands of classes and other reference types.
