Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree is fast approaching, and there are a number of things you should do to prepare for the DLC and its many new challenges. In a game as big as Elden Ring, that list could practically go on forever, so we’ve condensed this video down to nine main tasks. These are based both on what we know is coming in the DLC, as well as speculation from the community about some of the greater challenges and new bits of lore that may be in store for us in The Land of Shadow.

Elden Ring’s only expansion is fast approaching, and in true FromSoft fashion, the method for accessing it will be a bit obtuse. We’re here to make sure you have everything you need to start Shadow of the Erdtree when it launches.

To even begin Shadow of the Erdtree, you need to take out one of the game’s most difficult bosses, Mohg, Lord of Blood. We already have full area and boss guides on Mohg, and a video on how to best be prepared for Shadow of the Erdtree, so even though we don’t recommend going straight to the DLC access point at a very early level, we’ll just use this video to go over the necessities of how to get to the right place to start it, and will point you to our other walkthroughs for big sticking points along the way. Here’s the fastest way to reach Shadow of the Erdtree in Elden Ring.

## 3 Features Rockstar Needs to Bring Back In GTA 6 | GTFM

Rockstar Games have something special in GTA 6, but there are features other Grand Theft Auto games had that gamers would love to see make a return in #GTA6. There were a few missing ingredients the GTA community noticed weren’t included in GTA 5, that we hope the #RockstarGames devs sprinkle into GTA 6. Bring back the 6 Star Wanted Level.We understand why Rockstar Games made it only 5 Stars in GTA 5: The game’s called Grand Theft Auto 5! So by that logic, you should bring back the 6th star the franchise has been known for in GTA 6. Two: Bodybuilding Physique Mechanics: In San Andreas, playing as CJ, I had the option to eat whatever we wanted, possibly getting wider or hitting the gym to get a bigger physique. That needs to make a comeback in GTA 6, especially with all the varying body types the GTA 6 trailer featured. And Three: Dual-Wielding of weapons.
