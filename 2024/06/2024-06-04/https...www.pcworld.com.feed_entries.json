When it comes to the war on chips, the NPUs (aka neural processing units) inside Qualcomm&rsquo;s new Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors have been taking the news circuit by storm, as it can deliver 45 TOPS of AI computing power. That&rsquo;s impressive, but MSI&rsquo;s new AI laptops, which contain both AMD and Intel processors, offer more than 100 combined TOPS of power. Pop off, sis.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of NPUs and AI features, Microsoft has been pushing its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2341861/microsofts-copilot-pc-push-l", "language": null, "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2352612/msi-unleashes-10-laptops-that-bring-ai-to-everyone.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.pcworld.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 246, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "MSI unleashes 10 AI-infused laptops for pretty much everyone", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-04T03:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>You bought into the hype and purchased a first-gen AI laptop with an Intel Core Ultra (Meteor Lake) chip inside.

But in a world that shifted overnight to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2341861/microsofts-copilot-pc-push-leaves-existing-ai-pcs-behind.html\">Copilot+ PCs with much more stringent requirements</a>, were you a fool for doing so?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a tough question, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2344727/if-you-rolled-the-dice-on-first-gen-ai-pcs-you-lost.html\">one that&rsquo;s already hit home</a> for us, as well. But Intel executives say that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case, and there are plenty of reasons to own an older AI PC &mdash; which includes the possibility that AI PCs will be able to run Copilot+ functions in Windows over time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the conundrum: A Core Ultra Series 1 chip (Mete", "language": null, "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2352615/did-meteor-lake-laptop-buyers-get-burned-by-copilot-pcs.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.pcworld.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 246, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Were first-gen AI laptop buyers burned by Copilot+ PCs?
