Hitman 3 is headed to Meta Quest 3 via a VR version that adds dual-wielding, and features a new cel-shaded art style.
</p><p>
Officially titled as Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded, the project is being worked on by Leeds-based studio XR Games in collaboration with original developer IO Interactive. 
</p><p>
Its addition of dual-wielding is a first for the Hitman series, allowing you to hold two weapons or items at the same time for some intriguing new quick-fire possibilities.

My scenic ride through golden fields was interrupted by a hunched monstrosity with dual discs, who pounced on my head and wouldn't give me a second to breathe. A boss fight, you might ask? Nope - this was just a regular enemy. There's a definite sense that even normal enemies in the Land of Shadow hit harder, and are simply more aggressive, than those in the base game. With danger around every corner, you're kept constantly on the defensive, rekindling that same mixture of fear and excitement you likely felt when taking your first steps through The Lands Between.</p><p>This is a DLC that's perfectly pitched to challenge Elden Ring veterans, then.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">Summer Game Fest 2024</a> takes place this weekend, beginning with Friday's two hour showcase of announcements.
</p><p>
Of course, speculation always runs rampant ahead of the show as to what will be shown, with Geoff Keighley himself tempering expectations in a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2162199165">Twitch livestream</a>. 
</p><p>
In the stream, Keighley revealed some games that will and won't make an appearance at Summer Game Fest. He's also released a trailer for the show (below), though this is simply a "mood piece" that comprises games out this year rather than being a firm indication of what we'll see.

Legendary game designer Goichi "Suda51" Suda has said he doesn't know if the world will ever see No More Heroes or its star Travis Touchdown again, following the launch of 2021's climactic No More Heroes 3.
</p><p>
Speaking to Eurogamer ahead of his appearance at MomoCon 2024 last month, No More Heroes creator and director Suda acknowledged that the rights to the No More Heroes series remain with Japanese game publisher Marvelous rather than his own studio Grasshopper Manufacture.
</p><p>
"Honestly, not even I know that," Suda51 told Eurogamer, when asked if No More Heroes and Travis Touchdown would ever return. "Of course I'd love to see him again, but to be honest it's simply not my call to make."

## Tiny Glade is all about making ruins

But you don't need to actually build anything to see how magical it all is. Instead, you can just take the cursor and move it through a patch of wild flowers. Don't click. Don't select. Don't release a twisting rattlesnake of stone wall or a squat, pointed tower. Just watch as the cursor itself, as its physical presence in the world, prods the wild flowers around, ruffles them, gently reorients their petals and stems.</p><p>Stone walls, pointed towers, wild flowers: as these items suggest, Tiny Glade is a game for making pretty little bucolic ruins. You can make a little citadel, with a wall surrounding a central keep and courtyards and battlements and windows to serenade lovers from, but the moment your cursor leaves the screen it will be clear that what you've built is old and ru

## Blue Prince is a looping mystery about rearranging the layout of a mansion, and it's excitingly good

You might reach for the handle and decide there'll be a kitchen on the other end, or a bedroom or a closet. Whatever you decide, it'll be there - there to step into as if someone just imagined it on a drafting table for you. Thick pen lines frame block-coloured panels, all arranged with a slight jazz-like lilt. There's a slight unevenness to it all, a slight unnerving-ness coming from it. Or perhaps you have grander aspirations. Maybe it's not a kitchen or ordinary kind of room you want, but something outlandish and more befitting the mansion you're in. Maybe it's an observatory with a huge, swivelling telescope in the middle of it, peering out at constellations. Or maybe it's a chapel with rows of wooden pews and sunlight coloured through stained glass windows. Pe
