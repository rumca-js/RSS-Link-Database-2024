Here at Goonhammer, we know that it’s hard to keep track of all the news happening all the time in the games industry. So much is always going on with games of all sorts, and their related media, it can be a real blink-and-you’ll miss it situation.  That&#8217;s why every week, we round up five [&#8230;]

For the next few weeks at Turn Order, we&#8217;ll be featuring dispatches from our very own Vrekais as he feels his way through running tabletop games for his own local playgroup. The Encounter at Halen’s House I am not a “random encounter” DM, not by a long shot. I’ve only been DMing regularly for about [&#8230;]

Shadow King (alter ego Amahl Farouk) is one of the many members of the X-Men’s Rogues Gallery. He is a telepathic supervillian who has a particular interest in Charles Xavier, and has battled him multiple times in the Astral Plane. How does he fit into the larger X-Universe, though? Why does he seemingly target Professor [&#8230;]

In this series of articles we take a deep dive into a specific detachment for a faction, covering the faction’s rules and upgrades and talking about how to build around that faction for competitive play. In this article, we’re covering the Bully Boyz Detachment from Codex: Orks. The Tenth Edition release of Codex: Orks gave [&#8230;]

I&#8217;d like to take a moment up top to appreciate the Spires as a triumph of game design. They are a faction that exists in the intersection of many of the most tricky mechanical concepts to balance. They&#8217;re the healing faction, as well as the fast faction, as well as the alpha strike faction, as [&#8230;]

As Sigmar&#8217;s great work neared completion, he turned back to the realms and saw that the dominion of Chaos was almost complete. The hour for vengeance had come. Since my last dive into the history of the Mortal Realms&#8217; 1st Edition, quite a lot has changed in Age of Sigmar.  Critically, we&#8217;re seeing that 4th [&#8230;]

Episode 238 of The Independent Characters sees Josh and Carl take a historical and current view at The Lost and The Damned. Don&#8217;t know what that is exactly? Don&#8217;t worry we will fill you in soon. We think this leads to some very interesting conversation around the current state of the Warhammer 40k Ruleset, how [&#8230;]
