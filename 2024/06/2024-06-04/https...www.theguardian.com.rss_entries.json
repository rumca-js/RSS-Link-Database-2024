ITV News presenter Julie Etchingham will host the broadcast and fire questions in front of a live audience. Sunak and Starmer have said they\u2019re looking forward to the debate but, given the somewhat bumpy start to campaigning, this could well be an excruciating hour of TV. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jun/04/tv-tonight-rishi-sunak-and-keir-starmer-go-head-to-head-in-first-televised-debate\">Continue reading...</a>", "language": "en-UK", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jun/04/tv-tonight-rishi-sunak-and-keir-starmer-go-head-to-head-in-first-televised-debate", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "source_obj__id": 340, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91abd15a186efb6a1665c06748d1220b22057d00/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01b76c894aae4909db0138aa3cb4cd99", "title": "TV tonight: Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer go head-to-head in first televised debate", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-04T05:00:05+00:00", "description": "<p>Charity Ekezie has made it her mission to educate naive westerners about her continent on social media, and have some fun along the way</p><p>When Charity Ekezie first joined TikTok and started posting videos from her home in Abuja, Nigeria, in 2020, she had just left a job at a radio station and thought it might be a good way to keep busy and not let her journalism skills fall away.</p><p>Within months, she began to realise from the comments underneath her posts that some people knew nothing about Africa.
