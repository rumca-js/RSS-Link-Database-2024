The open-world genre continues to move at a rapid pace, and we are being treated to wonderful games that are constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible within a virtual space. 

The best open-world games have the tendency to completely immerse you within their carefully curated virtual escapades, but it’s obvious that not all open-worlds are created equal. 

Many titles fail to overlook some aspect of what makes a game of this ilk really tick, and that failure can lead to these games ending up as boring experiences that are best left as it is.

Bioware is highly regarded for its excellent work on the Mass Effect series, which continues to be a shining beacon of quality to this date. The excellent meshing of an action adventure with RPG mechanics that respects player choice is something that was perfected with Mass Effect 2, and those attributes continue to make it a special time even after all these years. 

It has certainly aged in certain aspects like the visuals, but looking at the grand picture, it’s clear that Mass Effect 2 was a passion project that’s emblematic of Bioware’s storytelling and worldbuilding chops. Looking back at it after all these years, it’s also disheartening to see such games not coming out anymore but then it’s also pleasant to look back on the good times.

The 15 entries in this rundown can only be described as failures; Microsoft clearly haven’t learned from past mistakes. Their determination to follow through on strategy, no matter how muddled, is causing headaches for developers and gamers alike. 

Top of the pile is their insistence that all games be developed for both the Series X and less powerful Series S, but with numerous questionable layoffs, a slim first-party catalogue, and console sales at an all-time low, Microsoft is clearly still mismanaging its once titan home console brand.
