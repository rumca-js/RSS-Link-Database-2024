<p>Samsung usually makes headlines with its Odyssey gaming monitors by being <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445207/samsungs-biggest-ultrawide-monitor-yet-will-bust-your-back-and-your-wallet.html">ridiculously, humongously ginormous</a>. They&rsquo;re big, is what I&rsquo;m saying. But the latest two bring its celebrated OLED panels to more conventional form factors. You can go big (but not too big) with a 32-inch 4K screen, or speedy with a 27-inch one. </p>



<p>The Odyssey G80SD is the one you want if you&rsquo;re interested in showing off your expensive graphics card&rsquo;s <em>chutzpah</em>, with a 32-inch, 3840&times;2160 panel. And with the same built-in streaming tech as Samsung&rsquo;s smart TV line, you can do it even if your gaming PC isn&rsquo;t in the room. At 240Hz and .03ms response time, it&rsquo;s fast, but not so fast that it&rsquo;ll t

<p>4K resolution is now within reach of everyday PC users, promising a massive improvement to image quality, with four times the pixels of a 1080p display.  A 4K monitor is useful not only in games and movies but also when editing documents or browsing web pages. The extra pixels make text look clear and crisp.</p>



<p>After extensive testing, I&rsquo;ve determined that the recommendations listed below are the best 4K monitors available today, covering a variety of budgets and use cases. If you&rsquo;re looking for additional options, see our roundups of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">best monitors overall</a>, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813301/best-gaming-monitors.html">best gaming monitors</a>, and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394751/prime-day-monitor-deals-2023.html">best monitor deals

<p>All the cool kids have a Steam Deck-style portable gaming PC these days. (And by &ldquo;cool kids,&rdquo; I mean &ldquo;multi-billion-dollar PC manufacturers.) Zotac is ready to sit at their lunch table with the new Zone, but this design offers a lot you can&rsquo;t get elsewhere. For a breakdown of all the unique features, Adam checks it out on the Computex show floor. </p>



<p>At a glance the Zone looks a lot like the Steam Deck, and I mean a <em>lot. </em>It&rsquo;s the only Windows-based handheld to get two track pads on either side of the screen, and the only one to offer analog sticks below and to the inside of the device, in &ldquo;PlayStation style.&rdquo; Those are also <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1655730/how-to-get-rid-of-stick-drift-on-the-steam-deck.html">hall effect sticks</a>, meaning they should never suffer from stick drift, and the

This is a fantastic price for a 23.8-inch monitor of this quality and the best price for this particular model.</p>



<p>The ProArt monitor delivers images in full HD (1920&times;1080), but at this price point, you can&rsquo;t exactly expect 4K. Still, this monitor features an IPS panel with a wide 178 degree viewing angle, ensuring that colors remain consistent no matter where you&rsquo;re viewing from.</p>

<p>When the rumors of the ROG Ally X started coming out, one of the first things they said was that it didn&rsquo;t replace the Ryzen APU <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1951380/asus-rog-ally-review-2.html">from the original design a year ago</a>. That made me sort of dismissive of the new portable gaming PC&hellip;and that was a mistake. The upgrades that Asus has made to this thing are far more than skin-deep. </p>



<p>The Asus ROG Ally X has been redesigned in pretty much every component, with the notable exceptions of the processor and screen. The battery is twice as big. The RAM is boosted by 50 percent. The storage can now accommodate a 2280 M.2 drive &mdash; the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=best+ssd+#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=best%20ssd%20&amp;gsc.page=1">same size used in desktop motherboards</a>.

<p>Whether you hate or love the sleek, minimalist vibe, NZXT is known for its aesthetics. At Computex 2024, the company held true to form with two announcements in particular&mdash;one for a new style of RGB fan, and another for a revamp of one of its popular cases.</p>



<p>The NZXT F240 RGB Core, F280 RGB Core, and F360 RGB Core are single-frame fans, which incorporate two 120mm, two 140mm, or three 120mm fans (respectively) as a lone unit. Like modular or daisy chained fans, just one cable is needed to connect for lighting and power signals, if you also use the coming NZXT Control Hub. (Otherwise you&rsquo;ll use a splitter cable to use the 5V ARGB and fan headers on a compatible motherboard.) However, you can&rsquo;t break them apart into individual fans for building flexibility.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407493/best-gaming-laptops.html">Modern gaming laptops</a> have come a long way. They might be slim, powerful, and long-lasting, but they still can&rsquo;t compete with desktop monitors in screen real estate. Even the largest gaming laptops with gorgeous 18-inch screens are still dramatically smaller than even the most modest of external gaming monitors.</p>



<p>But you can have the best of both worlds&mdash;by connecting an external monitor to your gaming laptop!</p>



<p>The way you connect a given monitor to your laptop will depend on your specific monitor and laptop combination, though. You can&rsquo;t connect if you don&rsquo;t have the right cables, and you&rsquo;ll want to make sure your laptop is powerful enough for the monitor&rsquo;s size and resolution.</p>

<p>In daily use, your Windows PC saves countless data, installs and uninstalls programs &mdash; and in the process becomes increasingly slower and more susceptible to problems. But there is a simple solution to breathe new life into your PC: Reset your computer once a year. </p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a good idea to reset Windows periodically, followed by information on how to do it.</p>

<p>Intel announced its next-generation processor, Lunar Lake, today. But chief executive Pat Gelsinger also updated Intel&rsquo;s roadmap &mdash; next up is Arrow Lake, Intel&rsquo;s desktop chip.</p>



<p>Although Intel is talking extensively about Lunar Lake in what is probably an attempt to undercut Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon X Elite laptops shipping by its partners, Lunar Lake won&rsquo;t ship until the third quarter, when Gelsinger promised more than 80 designs from its partners.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is the most consequential time of our careers together,&rdquo; Gelsinger said at a keynote address at Computex, adding that it is the most profound time in the PC industry in 25 years.</p>



<p>Lunar Lake, however, is a mobile processor. For those looking for the next desktop, Arrow Lake will ship in the fourth quarter, Gelsinger said. Gelsinger didn&rsquo;t re

<p>Intel&rsquo;s fastest processors have included hyperthreading, a technique that lets more than one thread run on a single CPU core, for over 20 years &mdash; and it&rsquo;s used by AMD (which calls it &ldquo;simultaneous multi-threading&rdquo;) as well. But you won&rsquo;t see a little &ldquo;HT&rdquo; on the Intel sticker for any <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2350967">Lunar Lake laptops</a>, because none of them use it. Hyperthreading will be disabled on all Lunar Lake CPU cores, including both performance and efficiency cores. </p>



<p>Why? The reason is complicated, but basically it&rsquo;s no longer needed. The performance cores or P-Cores on the new Lunar Lake series are 14 percent faster than the same cores on the previous-gen Meteor Lake CPUs, even with the multi-thread-processing of hyperthreading disabled.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s getting pretty hard to find a laptop with a user-accessible SO-DIMM slot to upgrade the memory. And it&rsquo;s about to get a lot harder. Starting with its upcoming Lunar Lake laptop CPU series, Intel will install memory into the processor SoC itself, offering only 16GB or 32GB initially. Yes, Intel laptops are getting rid of user-replaceable RAM, at least for this series of chips.</p>



<p>Intel is following Apple&rsquo;s lead here &mdash; the latter installs memory along with its home-built, Arm-based M processors, in the same way that memory is offered on smartphones and tablets. It means that these new Intel laptops will offer fewer choices to manufacturers, and none at all to consumers after the purchase. </p>

<p>Today at Computex, MSI announced a slew of new AI-ready gaming and content creation laptops. They&rsquo;re powered by the latest Intel Core Ultra (codenamed &ldquo;Lunar Lake&rdquo;) and AMD Ryzen AI 300 processors, which are more power efficient, resulting in laptops with better battery life and thinner builds. When it comes to the war on chips, the NPUs (aka neural processing units) inside Qualcomm&rsquo;s new Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors have been taking the news circuit by storm, as it can deliver 45 TOPS of AI computing power. That&rsquo;s impressive, but MSI&rsquo;s new AI laptops, which contain both AMD and Intel processors, offer more than 100 combined TOPS of power. Pop off, sis.   </p>

<p>You bought into the hype and purchased a first-gen AI laptop with an Intel Core Ultra (Meteor Lake) chip inside. Congratulations! But in a world that shifted overnight to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2341861/microsofts-copilot-pc-push-leaves-existing-ai-pcs-behind.html">Copilot+ PCs with much more stringent requirements</a>, were you a fool for doing so?</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a tough question, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2344727/if-you-rolled-the-dice-on-first-gen-ai-pcs-you-lost.html">one that&rsquo;s already hit home</a> for us, as well. But Intel executives say that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case, and there are plenty of reasons to own an older AI PC &mdash; which includes the possibility that AI PCs will be able to run Copilot+ functions in Windows over time. </p>
