The world&#8217;s largest bank has been working on artificial intelligence for more than a decade. It employs more than 2,000 machine learning and AI experts and data scientists worldwide, with than 400 AI use cases already deployed in areas such as marketing, fraud, and risk, as detailed in Dimon&#8217;s latest letter to shareholders.

Gates this morning announced a memoir, &#8220;Source Code,&#8221; due out next year. But we&#8217;ll have to wait for that tell-all about Microsoft or the Gates Foundation, or the inside stories of the well-publicized ups and downs and controversies of the mogul&#8217;s adult life. Instead, the book focuses on his childhood, through his decision to drop out of Harvard and start&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/bill-gates-announces-new-book-source-code-a-memoir-about-his-early-years-coming-in-2025/">Read More</a>
