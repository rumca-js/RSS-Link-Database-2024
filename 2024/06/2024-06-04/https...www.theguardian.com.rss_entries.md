<p>As both men interrupt each other and evade simple questions, poor Julie Etchingham is forced into the role of despairing teacher and makes them raise their hands like schoolchildren</p><p>We have arguably become over-accustomed to telegenic, managerial slickness in election campaigns. Hooray, then, for the 2024 iteration of the Conservative party, whose campaign so far – with its drowned-rat Downing Street launch, eye-rolling audiences, photographs next to Exit signs, callbacks to the sinking of the Titanic and general air of hapless slapstick – seems determined to ignore the conventions of modern electioneering in favour of reanimating politics as pure cringe comedy. After two weeks of this pratfalling, observers have stopped invoking The Thick of It for fear of maligning Armando Iannucci’s peerless political satire for a lack of subtlety.</p><p>And yet on Rishi Sunak must go.

<p>The actors feel under-rehearsed, the plotlines are painful cliches and the lead character is totally bland. This adaptation of Candice Carty-Williams’s hit novel just isn’t fun – or funny – enough</p><p>The eponymous heroine of Queenie is called a lot of things in the TV show based on the hit novel from 2019. She’s labelled “angry”, “quirky” and just plain “too much” – but sadly this is a case of telling and not showing, because in fact we are asked to invest in a bland protagonist overcoming pedestrian obstacles that make you long for the show to be led by the OTT gal it alludes to.</p><p>We meet Queenie at the hospital for a gynaecology appointment, where she learns that she has had a miscarriage. Things get progressively worse after she bickers with her aunt (inexplicably attending the pre-work appointment with her), is late to her job as a social media assistant and has a relationship-ending fight at her white boyfriend Tom’s family get together.</p> <a href="https://www.thegua

<p><strong>David Hinchliffe</strong> on how the party must learn from mistakes in the past to bring down waiting lists. Plus letters from <strong>Norman Edwards</strong> and <strong>Fawzi Ibrahim</strong>  </p><p>While welcoming Labour’s pledge to clear the NHS waiting list backlog within five years (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/28/labour-pledges-to-clear-nhs-waiting-list-backlog-in-england-in-five-years">Report, 28 May</a>), I wish the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, would be a little more explicit regarding the proposed use of the private sector in this task. The last Labour government – which did make use of private provision – was able to reduce waiting lists, but the longer-term consequence has been the greater institutionalisation of private practice by NHS staff. The deliberate running down of the NHS under the Conservatives has meant that going private is now the norm far more often, even for patients who can barely afford it.</p><p>Th

I’m sure, during childhood visits to the capital, that my parents must have shown me some of London’s biggest attractions, but the memory that’s really stayed with me is of something much smaller. We had called in at a Georgian townhouse late one dusky afternoon – and once inside were invited to climb up on to the roof. There, as evening fell over the skyline, I found a scaled-down railway station with a miniature train, steam pouring from its chimney, that skated over a pond and occasionally plunged into a tunnel.

<p>Our catastrophes have wrought psychic devastation. It’s worth acknowledging that and trying to be kind to one another</p><p>Everything is weird and everyone is wrecked. This is maybe the biggest and least acknowledged truth of life in the United States and a lot of places beyond right now. It’s the pandemic; the eight years of Trumpism; the distortions, disruptions and corruptions Silicon Valley has promulgated and other looming menaces, including climate chaos. We all know this, because we’re living it, but maybe we should talk more about the fact that our political catastrophes are inseparable from widespread psychic devastation, that the public and private, political and personal, are entangled – or rather that the former has wrought havoc on the latter.</p><p>The wisest people I know are aware that the stresses, atrocities, divisions and divergences from norms of recent years have made them (and everyone else) exhausted and brittle.

<p>From a novel sequence that dispenses with much of what we expect from fiction to fearlessly honest memoirs of motherhood and divorce, Cusk is a challenging writer. But also a genius</p><p>To say that the work of Rachel Cusk has provoked strong reactions is an understatement. The author of 12 novels and three works of nonfiction as well as Coventry, an essay collection, her three-decade career has taken her from witty, observant, and critically acclaimed novels of middle-class manners to fictional experiments at the very limits of character. Yet it is her nonfiction that has provoked the most public vitriol, in its merciless exploration of womanhood and its refusal to sugarcoat or minimise her own actions in relation to divorce and motherhood. Twice longlisted for the Booker, she has received an array of prizes and nominations, and was among Granta’s 2003 list of the best of young British novelists. Those who have already devoured all of Cusk’s writing will be excited to know that h

<p>Lumberjack the Monster, the Japanese director’s long-awaited return to out-and-out horror, is a huge event. So why has it been noiselessly launched into oblivion?</p><p>Last weekend, something fairly momentous happened. Lumberjack the Monster, the new film by Takashi Miike, arrived on Netflix. Lumberjack the Monster is a significant release, because it represents the first out-and-out horror movie that Miike has made in a decade, having spent the intervening years dabbling in other genres. For a certain type of fan, it’s like Scorsese coming back from the wilderness of the 1980s with Goodfellas. Even if his films are too violent and perverse for you, you still have to admit that a new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/takashi-miike">Takashi Miike</a> horror movie is a big deal.</p><p>Unless you’re Netflix, of course.

<p>This dark comedy isn’t quite as clever or funny as it thinks it is, but it’s great fun watching Moreno clearly having a blast as the baddie</p><p>Nerdy swot Ben (Connor Kalopsis) and dropout-in-the-making Tanner (Ramona Young) are high school seniors and best friends. That seems mildly implausible given their wildly different life goals: he wants to get into the same top university his recently deceased father attended, while Tanner just wants to chill and play games until climate change kills everyone off. But their friendship is the least implausible component in this dark comedy which has fun piling twists and unlikely turns of events on top of one another until the whole Jenga pile of silliness topples over in the last act.</p><p>In the end, it’s not quite as shocking, funny or inventive as it thinks it is, but the two young actors have good comic chemistry together and it’s a kick seeing legendary actor Rita Moreno ham it up as the kids’ antagonist, physics teacher Mrs Wheeler

<p>Label’s first catwalk in the country for 70 years goes deep into Scottish influence with every look</p><p>It is not every Dior show that opens with a skirl of bagpipes, three different ways to wear violet tartan, and a sporran dangling from a belt in place of a clutch bag tucked under the arm. Dior’s first catwalk show in Scotland for 70 years, held in Perthshire on Monday evening, was a feistily gorgeous affair.</p><p>The pomp and ceremony of a Parisian fashion house met its match in the natural grandeur and splendour of Scotland. Dior is a luxury juggernaut that its designer, Maria Grazia Chiuri, has described as being “like the national football team” of fashion; but the gardens of Drummond Castle in Perthshire are also no stranger to glamour, having appeared on screen in Rob Roy and Outlander. It proved a formidable combination. To judge by the weather, the auld alliance between France and Scotland seems to hold: the topiary-studded paths of formal gardens known as “the Versail

Now she’s back, starring in epic westerns and collaborating on a new fashion collection</p><p>The funny thing is, Sienna Miller can’t stand boho chic. “Don’t you think it sounds annoying?” asks the eternal poster girl for hippy-luxe, festival-adjacent summer dressing. Actually, from where I’m sitting right now, boho chic looks pretty damn good. Barefoot in jeans and a tissue-fine T-shirt, ropes of Botticelli-blond hair tumbling over her shoulders, Miller looks absurdly radiant even on Microsoft Teams, after “a rough baby night” with her second daughter. “That’s very nice of you,” she says sunnily, “but you know, there just is a bohemian way of dressing, isn’t there? It’s not like I invented anything.” She shrugs. “When I was younger the 70s and 60s really resonated for me. I bought vintage things at markets.”</p><p>But Miller, 42, knows better than most that fame can mean that the media, n

<p>In the spirit of culinary experimentation, the unexpected flavour in this Chinese-inspired dish is the chilli bean paste</p><p>One of the pitfalls of being an avid home cook is that you end up with a hodgepodge of half-used spices and condiments from various world food stores. It can lead to some interesting culinary experiments – tarragon finding its way into an Indian curry, say, or tahini into a French omelette. It’s in that spirit of experimentation that today’s dish was born: ingredients I’d originally bought for making mapo tofu somehow ended up in our Sunday lasagne. The essential flavour here is <em>doubanjiang</em>, or Pixian chilli bean paste, an intensely umami fermented broad bean paste that you’ll find in Chinese shops.</p><p>Discover this recipe and many more from your favourite cooks in <a href="https://app.adjust.com/1bgiux9n?creative=Endnotes&amp;fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Finsideguardian%2F2024%2Fapr%2F17%2Fintroducing-the-feast-app&amp;red

<p>Summer is served: flatbreads stuffed with herby sweet potato and brushed with garlic and seaweed butter, smoky roast tomato, garlic and aubergine butterbeans and a sparky watercress salad</p><p>These three dishes work nicely together as a summer dinner. The stuffed flatbread is divine, while the smoky butter bean dish just happens to be fully plant-based and derives its incredible flavour and creaminess from the smoked tofu ; that’s a rather good protein hit, too. The accompanying salad, meanwhile, is a fresh yet hearty counterpoint to the indulgence of the other two dishes, with cucumber, celery and herbs and a nutty crunch from toasted seeds. In other words, perfect summer entertaining.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jun/04/stuffed-flatbreads-and-butterbean-dip-harriet-mansell-vegetarian-summer-spread-recipes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Scientists are tagging sharks to map Pacific migration routes in a bid to expand marine reserves before more of these endangered species fall prey to illegal industrial fishing</p><p>It’s a three-person job to land a 2-metre shark: two to wrap ropes around its thrashing tail and midriff, a third to clamp shut its powerful jaws. Hanging over the side of the Sea Quest fishing skiff, the crew work quickly to minimise any distress to the animal, a female silky shark. Once onboard, a hose attached to a saltwater pump is placed in her mouth, to irrigate her gills.</p><p>Catching and tagging sharks is contentious among some researchers, who say it is harmful.
