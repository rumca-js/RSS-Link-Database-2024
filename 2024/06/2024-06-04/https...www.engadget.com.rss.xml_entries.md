<p>A group of current and former employees from leading AI companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Anthropic has signed an <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://righttowarn.ai/">open letter</a> asking for greater transparency and protection from retaliation for those who speak out about the potential concerns of AI. “So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public,” the letter, which was published on Tuesday, says. “Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues.”</p>
<p>The letter comes just a couple of weeks after a <em>Vox</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/351132/openai-vested-equity-nda-sam-altman-documents-employees">investigation</a> revealed OpenAI had attempted to muzzle recently departing employees by forc

It’s spread via direct message and doesn’t require a download, click or any form of response, beyond opening the chat. It’s currently unclear how many accounts have been affected.</p>
<p>Even weirder? The hacked accounts aren’t really doing anything. A source within TikTok told <em>Forbes</em> that these impacted accounts “do not appear to be posting content”.

<p>This guide was originally a simple list of products I’ve bought over the years that were good enough to warrant recommending to others. But over time, I wanted to expand things to include tools and gadgets that help solve life’s little challenges. After all, there’s nothing like the feeling of suddenly finding yourself in a jam only to realize the solution is already in your pocket or bag. Or at the very least, if they’re not solving problems, these gadgets will help you pass time more enjoyably. So if you’re looking for a gift for Father’s day, graduation or any other occasion where the recipient will appreciate a finely crafted tool, here’s a list of some of my favorite everyday carry products available today.</p>

<p>Skydance Interactive is best known for <em>The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners</em>, one of the most popular,  games on the original PlayStation VR. Combining visceral fights with TWD’s usual dramatic twists, turns and zombies, it felt like a <em>proper</em> VR game.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Behemoth </em>is an action-adventure game that draws on the combat and physics of The Walking Dead games but focuses more on fighting and less on survival. Like <em>Saints and Sinners,</em> there’s still a crafting system, but it’s a lot simpler, reinforcing the action-adventure slant here. I got to play a slice of the game, which combined early tutorial snippets outlining controls and mechanics with more thrilling set pieces and exploration segments – oh, and a battle with the behemoth itself.</p>

<p>Meta’s rolling out a small spring/summer update for the Quest 2 and Quest 3 headsets. There’s nothing too major here, but there are some small improvements for regular users.</p>
<p>The biggest news is a new and better way to watch Netflix content. There’s long been a standalone Netflix app available for Quest headsets, but it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-25-how-netflix-works-in-virtual-reality-and-why-its-not-in-hd.html">maxes out at 480p</a> and is generally considered to be, well, crappy. Once updated, you’ll be able to watch Netflix directly from the built-in browser. This offers a much-improved experience, with the option to view content in high resolution.</p>

<p>After getting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-reveals-three-anti-glare-odyssey-oled-gaming-monitors-ahead-of-ces-2024-230028536.html">officially announced way back at CES 2024, </a>all of Samsung’s new 2024 gaming monitors are finally available for pre-order today. However, while the massive 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95SD) garnered most of the attention when initial details came out in January, I recently had a chance to check out its smaller siblings in person (plus one of Samsung’s new smart monitors), which are just as impressive due to their lower prices and more-practical screen sizes.</p>
<p>Similar to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alienwares-32-inch-4k-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-is-total-overkill-but-in-a-good-way-153004427.html">Alienware AW3225QF</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hps-new-4k-240hz-oled-gaming-monitor-lets-you-drag-and-drop-files-across-devices-140507464.html">HP Omen Transcend 32</a>, the 2024 Odyssey G8 OLED (G80SD) and Odyssey G6 OLED (G6

<p>After years of rumors of Sonos getting into headphones, the $449 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ace-headphones-review-an-impressive-but-incomplete-debut-130040041.html">Sonos Ace are here</a>. They’re well-designed and have impressive audio quality. Integrating the headphones with its family of speakers isn’t what many expected, but the feature works well, according to Engadget’s Billy Steele. They’re also comfortable to wear.</p>

<p>Intel recently revealed that its upcoming Lunar Lake chips would be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-powered-copilot-pcs-will-be-available-this-fall-204049150.html">available this fall for Copilot+ AI PCs</a>, but the company waited until Computex to give us more technical details. For one, they'll offer up to 48 TOPs (tera operations per second) of AI performance, thanks to an updated neural processing unit (NPU). In comparison, Intel's previous Meteor Lake chips sported a 10 TOPS NPU, while AMD announced its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-unveils-ryzen-ai-300-cpus-for-copilot-laptops-030033575.html">Ryzen AI 300 chips </a>yesterday with 50 TOPS NPUs. The AI race is on, if you couldn't tell.</p>
<p>Intel will once again have to play catch up in the AI PC space: AMD's Ryzen AI 300 chips will be available in July alongside Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus. It's unclear when, exactly, Lunar Lake systems will launch this fall. Still, for the Intel faithful, Lunar
