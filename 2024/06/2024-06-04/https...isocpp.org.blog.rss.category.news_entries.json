By identifying types that can be safely moved via a simple memory copy, Qt was able to streamline reallocations for specific data types like <code>int</code> and <code>QString</code>. This article explores the concept of trivial relocation, how Qt leverages it for optimized data manipulation, and the implications for different container structures and data types.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<h3>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.kdab.com/qt-and-trivial-relocation-part-1/\">Qt and Trivial Relocation (Part 1)</a></h3>\n\t<p>\n\t\tby Giuseppe D'Angelo</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFrom the article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThe container classes introduced in Qt 4 (<em>Tulip</em>, for the aficionados) had an interesting optimization: the abil", "language": "en", "link": "https://isocpp.org//blog/2024/06/qt-and-trivial-relocation-part-1-giuseppe-dangelo", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://isocpp.org/blog/rss/category/news", "source_obj__id": 314, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Qt and Trivial Relocation (Part 1) -- Giuseppe D'Angelo", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
