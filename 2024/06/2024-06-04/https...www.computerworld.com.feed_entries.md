<p>More than a dozen current and former AI industry employees <a href="https://righttowarn.ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">have signed an open letter</a> warning that the technology’s dangers could result in “human extinction.”</p>



<p>The letter was written by 13 people who have worked at OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, all leading providers of generative AI (genAI) technology. Specifically, they raised alarms about a series of risks from AI, ranging from “further entrenchment of existing inequalities, to manipulation and misinformation, to the loss of control of autonomous AI systems potentially resulting in human extinction.</p>

<p>One day when we look back at the last few decades in tech, we will realize that one of the most influential products ever released was, in fact, one that failed. Years ahead of its time, the Apple product unleashed many of the technologies that define consumer electronics today. </p>



<p>What is it? The Apple Newton. </p>



<p>Now, hear me out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What was the Apple Newton?</strong></h2>



<p>Developed by Apple, the Newton was one of the first personal digital assistants ever made.  A handheld gadget capable of understanding handwriting, it was years ahead of its time when it appeared in 1993. But cost and limited functionality meant it was eventually

<p>Developers and DevOps teams must manage many moving parts to deliver an exceptional product on time. Developers have adopted effective tooling such as Jira and Asana to manage and facilitate structured collaboration. But when teams need to solve problems that require creative thinking and don’t have a predetermined outcome — such as determining the goals for the next sprint, understanding the user flow, or brainstorming ideas for a new product — standard conferencing and messaging tools don’t provide enough support. </p>

<p>The Computex trade show in Taipei has become the battleground for AI hardware giants as AMD and Intel unveil new products and strategies, challenging Nvidia’s market dominance.</p>



<p>AMD has announced the launch of its Instinct MI325X accelerator, set for release in the fourth quarter of 2024. This will be followed by the MI350 series, based on the new CDNA 4 architecture, expected in 2025.</p>



<p>The company claimed the MI350 will offer a 35-fold increase in AI inference performance over its predecessor, the MI300 series. AMD also plans to introduce the Instinct MI400 series, leveraging its future CDNA “Next” architecture.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Intel revealed its Lunar Lake client process

<p>The AI smartphone era is upon us.</p>



<p>At its annual <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2130052/apple-promises-best-ever-wwdc-but-will-it-deliver.html">Worldwide Developers Conference</a> next week, smartphone giant Apple is expected to do what some of its competitors have already done, which is to unveil and promote powerful AI features. Those features are expected to be built into Apple’s upcoming iOS 18 and possibly include the long-rumored AppleGPT (which will not be called AppleGPT). That LLM-based chatbot may be baked into Apple’s Siri assistant, or offered as a separate app.</p>



<p>Already, the latest vintage of Apple iPhones contain the Apple A17 Pro chip, which suppo
