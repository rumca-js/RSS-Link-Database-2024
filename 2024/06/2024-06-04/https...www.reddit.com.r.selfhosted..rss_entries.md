<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I intend to run a webserver from home. Most guides for doing this will dump a lot of needlessly complicated extra BS onto the reader at the same time. If you know anything about development or troubleshooting, you'll understand why this is bad and counterproductive. It's better to do things in stages. First, I want to get the absolute bare minimum of stuff set up. Just enough so that a trusted third party can do some tests and ensure that the website is technically functioning as intended and technically on the Web. </p> <p>Once I'm sure that all of those things have been set up correctly, THEN I can worry about SSL certifications, buying a domain name, Docker, reverse proxies, and whatever else you guys highly recommend. Okay? Sound like a good way to proceed? Good. </p> <p>So... can anyone guide me through that bare-minimum first stage?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KeptinGL6"> /u/KeptinGL6 </

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Right now I run a disk wide backup about once a month. This is a manual process where I walk an HDD with a USB caddy down to the server and rync it to the drive in the server. I don't want to keep the backup drive in the same room as the server in case of a flood / fire / theft. </p> <p>It covers me for the important stuff, but I have a couple concerns with this strategy I'd appreciate help with:</p> <p>1) Sometimes I forget to do it monthly, which means if the drive goes down I'd lose a lot of data. Ideally I'd like to run this weekly, but the current process is too much hassle.<br /> 2) If there's some kind of disaster during the backup (flood or electrical), I'd lose both disks. I have a third backup, but that's run even more rarely.<br /> 3) rsync is good, but I worry sometimes about syncing over bad changes, like deleting a directory. Is it good practice to do a dry run first and review the log before syncing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submi
