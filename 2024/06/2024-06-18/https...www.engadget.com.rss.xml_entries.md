<p>The California Labor Commissioner's office has fined Amazon $5,901,700 for infractions related to a law designed to protect warehouse workers. Under the state's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-california-warehouse-worker-quotas-bill-191234363.html"><ins>AB-701 law</ins></a>, large companies are required to tell warehouse or distribution center workers in writing what their expected quotas are, including how often they should perform particular tasks, and what consequences they may face for failing to meet those quotas.</p>
<p>This law was a reaction to stories from Amazon workers who said they would skip bathroom breaks or risk injury in order to maximize their output. &quot;The hardworking warehouse employees who have helped sustain us during these unprecedented times should not have to risk injury or face punishment as a result of exploitative quotas that violate basic health and safety,&quot; Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/09/22/governor-news

<p>The idea of Beats wireless earbuds for under $100 is certainly compelling. Until now, the company has operated in the $150-$200 range, except for the $70 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-flex-review-170048005-170048113.html"><ins>Beats Flex</ins></a>, which offers a great collection of features with good sound quality and a comfy fit.

<div id="c43de482d5cb4851b11a39831abd5002"></div>
<p>It's been about a decade since Nintendo released a new game in the Donkey Kong Country series —&nbsp;and while there isn't a new one coming any time soon, there <em>is</em> a port of one you may have missed on its way. <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>, originally released for the Wii in 2010, is hitting the Switch on January 15, 2025. It was a fine game for its time, and I'm hopeful it'll hold up well some 15 years later. At the very least, the controls should be simpler, as Nintendo won't be forcing motion controls into the mix with this remaster as they did with the Wii original.</p>
<p>This game joins <em>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</em> as the other modern-ish interpretation of the franchise. <em>Tropical Freeze</em> was first released for the Wii U in 2014 — but since no one owned that poor console, its arrival on the Switch in 2018 meant that a much larger audience got to give the game a shot. That's not exactly t

<p>After 18 years and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-25-nintendo-metroid-prime-4-retro-studios.html">a complete reboot</a>, Samus Aran will return in <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> next year, Nintendo announced today. The company also gave us our first glimpse at the game, which sees Samus duking it out with alien hordes on distant planet. At first glance, <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> could easily be mistaken for a <em>Halo</em> game, though there's a bit of enemy scanning and morph ball action, as you'd expect. The teaser ends with the reveal of a new big bad (wearing a suit like Samus's), flanked by two floating metroids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's hard to read too much into a teaser, but as someone who adored the original <em>Metroid Prime </em>on the Gamecube, I'm certainly excited. <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> is currently slated as a Switch title, but

<p>Did you think Nintendo would simply only release remakes and second-tier games until the Switch's successor finally comes along? Guess again. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-the-next-nintendo-direct-here-at-10am-et-120054935.html">During Tuesday's Nintendo Direct stream</a>, the company revealed a brand-new Legend of Zelda game. Nintendo is making many fans' long-held dreams come true, as you'll get to play as Zelda herself.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> opens where most Zelda games finish, with Link defeating Ganon. But just as he frees Princess Zelda, our usual hero is sucked into an alternate dimension. That flips the script, as it's now down to Zelda to rescue her tunic-wearing cohort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is gorgeous. It’s built up a lot of momentum, feeding trailer after gorgeous trailer, and at Summer Game Fest this year, I finally got to play it. Is it just a gorgeous tech demo with a heavy dose of Chinese mythology or your next gaming challenge?</p>
<p>A Chinese folk story, Journey to the West, inspired Game Science Studio’s action RPG. You play as the “destined one,” a monkey hero wielding an extending bo-staff and a handful of magic spells. I was given the higher-specced (though undisclosed) PC rig to play on, ensuring all that Unreal Engine 5 eye candy had a fighting chance of running smoothly. While less than an hour with a game won’t give the definitive answer, <em>Wukong</em> ran smoothly despite my chaotic play style. The game has been held up as a major example of next-gen graphical tech, so I’m relieved it didn't chug during my demo.</p>

<p>At MWC earlier this year, Google announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-brings-gemini-to-messages-and-adds-ai-text-summaries-for-android-auto-080051647.html">Gemini's integration with Messages</a>, giving you a way to access the chatbot from within the texting app. The feature was limited to newer Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones at launch, but now Google has <a href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/14599070#countries&amp;zippy=%2Ccountries-where-gemini-in-messages-is-available">updated its Help page</a> to say that all you need to access it is an &quot;Android device with 6GB of RAM or higher.&quot; <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/17/gemini-google-messages-android/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> first reported the change, along with the news that the feature is launching in India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rxpass-prime-generic-medications-5-a-month-103007949.html">launched its RxPass in 2023</a>, giving Prime customers access to generic medications that treat more than 80 common health conditions for $5 a month on top of a Prime subscription.

<p>Another EV manufacturer bites the dust with Fisker officially declaring bankruptcy. The US-based startup <a href="https://media.deb.uscourts.gov/moveit/Ch11Cases.html">filed for Chapter 11 protections</a> late Monday, June 17, with plans to restructure its debt and sell its assets. Unfortunately, this means the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fiskers-alaska-ev-pickup-has-absurd-big-gulp-and-cowboy-hat-holders-122524635.html">Alaska EV with a designated cowboy hat space</a> will likely never come to fruition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We are proud of our achievements, and we have put thousands of Fisker Ocean SUVs in customers' hands,&quot; a Fisker spokesperson stated. &quot;But like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic headwinds that have impacted our ability to operate efficiently.&quot;</p>

<p>Whether you want to back up the data on your PC, transfer videos from your Mac or offload a few games from your PlayStation 5, a portable SSD is an easy way to expand your storage. These little bricks may cost more than traditional external hard drives, but they’re significantly faster, lighter and more reliable. But figuring out the best portable SSD for you isn’t as simple as just picking the one with the lowest price or the most space. (Well, it <em>can</em> be, but that wouldn’t be very efficient.) To help, we’ve spent the last few months weeding through the portable SSD market, testing a bunch of contenders and sorting out which ones provide the most value. You can find our top picks, plus an overview of what to know before buying, below.</p>

<p>Google's DeepMind artificial intelligence laboratory is working on a new technology that can generate soundtracks, even dialogue, to go along with videos. The lab has <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/generating-audio-for-video/">shared its progress</a> on the video-to-audio (V2A) technology project, which can be paired with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-unveils-veo-and-imagen-3-its-latest-ai-media-creation-models-173617373.html">Google Veo</a> and other video creation tools like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openais-new-sora-model-can-generate-minute-long-videos-from-text-prompts-195717694.html">OpenAI's Sora</a>. In its blog post, the DeepMind team explains that the system can understand raw pixels and combine that information with text prompts to create sound effects for what's happening onscreen. To note, the tool can also be used to make soundtracks for traditional footage, such as silent films and any other video without sound.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, says social media should come <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-says-that-social-media-like-cigarettes-should-come-with-warning-labels-171005572.html">with warning labels</a>, writing in <em>The New York Times</em> that social media is an “important contributor” to the teen mental health crisis. Last year, he issued an advisory making similar arguments, saying social media posed a “profound risk” to teen mental health. In his latest op-ed, Murthy cited a study showing higher social media use was associated with an increased risk of anxiety and depression, as well as a survey where almost half of teens reported “social media makes them feel worse about their bodies.”</p>
<p>He also noted warning labels alone wouldn’t make social media safer — I mean, people still smoke — but would help better inform everyone. “There is no seatbelt for parents to click, no helmet to snap in place… there are just parents and their children, tryi

<p>If vacuuming is your least favorite chore, employing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">robot vacuum</a> can save you time and stress while also making sure your home stays clean. While once most robo-vacs landed on the higher end of the price spectrum, that’s not the case anymore. Sure, you could pick up a $1,000 cleaning behemoth, but it would be incorrect to assume that you <em>need</em> to spend that much money to get a good machine. Now, you can get an autonomous dirt-sucker with serious cleaning chops for $500 — sometimes even $300 or less. But you get what you pay for in this space; don’t expect affordable robot vacuum cleaners to have all of the bells and whistles that premium machines do. After testing dozens of robot vacuums at various price points, I’ve narrowed down our top picks for the best budget robot vacuums you can buy right now.</p>

<p>When I’m traveling, a portable mouse is a must. However, I’ve never really felt the same way about keyboards, because most portable options are still too big or are saddled with some major compromises in the name of lightness. But with the Keys-To-Go 2, Logitech has managed to create a super sleek typing accessory that disappears into your bag and can be paired with almost any device you can think of.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-design-and-features">Design and features</h2> 
<p>Those who like traveling light can always opt for something like an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html"><ins>iPad Pro</ins></a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-10-for-business-review-a-safe-upgrade-for-it-workers-172033986.html"><ins>Surface Pro</ins></a>, which can be paired with their own dedicated detachable keyboards.
