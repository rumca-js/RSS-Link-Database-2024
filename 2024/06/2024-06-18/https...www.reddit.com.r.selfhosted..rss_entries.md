No matter what I use it's so slow. I don't have that many data only 3TB of files. The next cloud app is slow when making the sync, the app makes the explorer freeze and have to reboot ( same problem with one drive as it's the same feature so probably a windows issue). I tried using separate apps but they are not the same, for example synching works incredibly well no issue but it's not what I need. I want to sync on-demand like with one drive where you download the files you need and after some time are deleted, and syncthing is not for that. Also when editing documents on nc the UI is so slow that it's impossible to make anything and I have to use only office locally and the upload the file. I don't know what else to do. Any recommendations? I'm not the only one with this problem I read many peopl

I've a brand new 1TB WD Green SATA SSD lying around that I was supposed to use for something but didn't end up using it. So I was thinking of getting another one and running them in RAID 1 to compensate for their lack of reliability. There would only be 3-4 max users connected to Immich. I'm looking forward to hearing whatever you all have to advise about this.
