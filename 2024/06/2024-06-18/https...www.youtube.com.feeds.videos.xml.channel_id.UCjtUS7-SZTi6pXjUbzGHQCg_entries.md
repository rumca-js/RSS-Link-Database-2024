This is a real piece of nano-technology that has the potential to revolutionize fields like medicine, consumer electronics, and especially solar energy. Quantum dot technology has been in TVs for years, so why isn’t it already in solar panels? Well, there are a few challenges. If we can engineer around these challenges, then these little devices could have a BIG impact - breaking the limits of our current solar panels, and ushering in a new and radically more efficient age of solar energy.
