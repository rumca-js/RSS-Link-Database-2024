In terms of percentages, does the law enforcement community employ a larger number of sexual abusers? Or is it something else? It&#8217;s difficult to prove any of this with statistics, especially since most law enforcement agencies in the nation are able to bury this information, citing state laws, confidentiality agreements with police unions, or the [&#8230;]

In the conversation about keeping kids safe online, the actual experts with the most to offer are all too often treated as outsiders and interlopers. One such expert is Candice Odgers, Professor of Psychological Science and Informatics at the University of California Irvine, who has recently been involved in a lot of debates against people [&#8230;]

We’ve noted repeatedly how early attempts to integrate “AI” into journalism have proven to be a&#160;comical mess, resulting in no shortage of&#160;shoddy product, dangerous falsehoods, and plagiarism. It’s thanks in large part to the incompetent executives at many large media companies, who see AI primarily as a way to cut corners, assault unionized labor, and [&#8230;]

This lawsuit might be a long shot, but it&#8217;s not completely a foregone conclusion at this point. The state of Illinois has tougher privacy laws than most states, which may factor into the judge&#8217;s decision. On the other hand, this lawsuit &#8212; filed by two Illinois residents with the assistance of the Liberty Justice Center [&#8230;]

You may have heard that yesterday the Surgeon General of the US, Vivek Murthy, announced that Congress should mandate “Surgeon General warnings” on social media, saying that it is harmful to kids. Over at the Daily Beast I went into great detail about just how far from the actual science this suggestion is. As with [&#8230;]

We&#8217;ve noted repeatedly how T-Mobile simply hasn&#8217;t been the same company since its controversial 2020 merger with Sprint. All of the pre-merger concerns deal critics warned about came true, whether it was 9,000 layoffs, worse service, or higher wireless prices. Long gone is the company&#8217;s John Legere-era pretense that it was ever seriously interested in [&#8230;]

Every report delivered by the DOJ&#8217;s Civil Rights Division can be described as &#8220;scathing&#8221; or &#8220;damning.&#8221; There are simply no exceptions to this rule. It&#8217;s not like the Civil Rights unit picks a US law enforcement agency out of the hat and then initiates an investigation. (Maybe it should?
