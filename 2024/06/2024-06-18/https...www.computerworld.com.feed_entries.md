<p>Shipments of augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) headsets dropped 67.4% year over year in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of an evolution in the market, <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P35095">new data</a> from International Data Corp. (IDC) reveals.</p>



<p>“The decline in shipments was expected as the market transitions to include new categories such as Mixed Reality (MR) and Extended Reality (ER),” IDC noted Tuesday. “Despite the decline, the average selling price (ASP) rose to over $1,000 as Apple entered the market and incumbents such as Meta focused on premium headsets such as the Quest 3.”</p>

<p>Just as everyone expected, and almost demanded, Apple finally started talking about artificial intelligence — in its own way, of course.

<p>Varjo has unveiled an app that lets users <a href="https://varjo.com/teleport-by-varjo/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">scan physical spaces with their smartphone</a> to create photorealistic 3D “scenes” for virtual reality (VR) devices. </p>

<p>Apple’s artificial/machine/generative AI research team seems to be opening up as it explores <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2147895/everything-apple-intelligence-will-do-for-you-so-far.html">new frontiers in this research</a>, publishing more than 20 new Core ML models for on-device AI through the popular AI community site <a href="https://huggingface.co/apple" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Hugging Face</a>.</p>



<p>It’s a real change in the company’s customary rectitude in being open about what it’s doing, and it seems likely the move comes in response to demands from its research teams to be a bit more transparent. </p>

<p>Remember former Google CEO Eric Schmidt? He now makes flying AI robots that target and kill autonomously. (Really!)</p>



<p>His robots are in high demand for one simple reason: GPS jamming.</p>



<p>I’ll explain more about Schmidt’s robots below. But first, it’s time to catch up on the rising trend of GPS, cell phone and other signal jamming, which is triggering a global arms race between jamming and anti-jamming technologies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The FCC crackdown of 2012</strong></h2>



<p>All jamming devices in the United States were banned 90 years ago — long before jamming devices even existed. The Communications Act of 1934 explicitly prohibited  deliberate inter
