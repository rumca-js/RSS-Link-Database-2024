<p>A night of mayhem and confusion, of futures and pasts dragging each other in different directions, and at its climax a goal of pure catharsis for the Group F favourites. Portugal, one of the tournament favourites, are away: a poacher’s goal by the 21-year-old Francisco Conceição sealing victory in the first minute of injury time after coming off the bench.</p><p>It was tough on the Czech Republic, so close to what would have been a heroic point until a stout defence calamitously gave way at the last. Robin Hranac’s own goal had given Portugal a route back into the game, and now as Pedro Neto crossed, his feet got stuck the loose ball bouncing perfectly for Conceição to finish.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/18/portugal-czech-republic-euro-2024-group-f-match-report">Continue reading...</a>
