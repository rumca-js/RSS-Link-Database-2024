Let's put in all the things.\n---\n\nBen Deane\n\nBen has been programming in C++ for this whole millennium. He spent just over 20 years in the games industry working for companies like EA and Blizzard; many of the games he worked on used to be fondly remembered but now he\u2019s accepted that they are probably mostly forgotten. After getting more interested in modern C++, in the teens he started giving internal company talks and then talks at various conferences, spreading ideas about types, algorithms and declarative and functional techniques.\n\nIn 2018 he left the games industry and worked in finance for a short spell, writing high-frequency trading platforms using the most modern C++ that compilers could support. Now he is a Principal Engineer at Intel where he puts monads inside your CPU.\n---\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bas", "id": 730744, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqiLTgQcDPM", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "source_obj__id": 420, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/EqiLTgQcDPM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lightning Talk: Let's Write a Lambda in C++ - Ben Deane - CppCon 2023", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
