This is just the latest brutal, violent crime committed by someone who shouldn't even be in this country to begin with. And, it's why a large majority of Americans now support mass deportations. Americans are sick of this. And, they should be. Also, the surgeon general proposes cigarette-style warning labels on social media sites. Police in one crime-ridden county in Maryland have devised a new plan to fight crime, and it involves giving out free slushies. And, a firefighter in San Francisco was attacked by one of his coworkers and beaten with a wrench. The victim lost his job and the attacker is still collecting a paycheck.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:36 Opening\n02:12 - 20:05 Americans Are Sick And Tired Of The Illegal Immigrant Crime Epidemic  \n21:15 - 25:05 Surgeon General Wants Warning Labels On Social Media\n25:06 - 30:46 To Combat Youth Crime, P", "id": 735350, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9RqTh9UG0s", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCO01ytfzgXYy4glnPJm4PPQ", "source_obj__id": 212, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/f9RqTh9UG0s/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Americans Are Sick And Tired Of The Illegal Immigrant Crime Epidemic | Ep. 1389", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-18T20:00:15+00:00", "description": "", "id": 735351, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okbpEUAjgnA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCO01ytfzgXYy4glnPJm4PPQ", "source_obj__id": 212, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/okbpEUAjgnA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Imagine how this room smells", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-18T17:00:22+00:00", "description": "", "id": 734288, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsIqW39NC10", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCO01ytfzgXYy4glnPJm4PPQ", "source_obj__id": 212, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/MsIqW39NC10/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "We don't want women action heroes.", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-18T15:00:37+00:00", "description": "Chuck Schumer tried to prove that he's a normal red-blooded American, but it went horribly wrong in this photo op. \n\nBecome a DailyWire+ member and watch the full show: https://bit.ly/4bEQDy6\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos every day. https://www.youtube.com/c/MattWalsh?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch the full episode here: Ep.1388 - https://bit.ly/4ckfTd2\n\nStop giving your money to woke corporations that hate you.
