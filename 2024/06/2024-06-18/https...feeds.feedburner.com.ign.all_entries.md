Off the bat, Aloft’s setup is immediately cool: you start out on a floating island in the sky with nothing. As you work your way through the starting area, you'll eventually get a glider (think somewhere between Avatar: The Last Airbender and Zelda: Breath of the Wild), and take flight to another island. Zooming from island to island looked really freeing, and developer Astrolabe Interactive made a point to incorporate systems to keep it engaging and interesting rather than just a hollow jump from one floating rock to another.

Arena Breakout aims to be a steely military simulator, with no Call of Duty-style acrobatics or titanic Battlefield set pieces. You craft a grim soldier in the character creator and outfit them with a knapsack of survival gear, which all needs to fit, like Tetris blocks, within your limited inventory. (Generally speaking, you'll be bringing body armor, a backpack, a wealth of food and medical supplies, and yes, lots and lots of ammunition.) Over the course of a match, our hero may grow hungry, or thirsty, or need the bullet in their arm to be removed. With luck, you will have brought the perfect antidote for all of those tasks, avoiding an untimely end to the campaign.
