<ul><li>Former world No 1 triumphs 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 in first round</li><li>Murray wins for first time since March, Evans retires </li></ul><p>As his frustrating results dimmed his hope throughout this season, Andy Murray has repeatedly indicated this year that he is unlikely to extend his career past the summer tournaments. Finally, summer has arrived and Murray returned to Queen’s at the beginning of possibly the final grass court season of his career with a solid win, producing a strong performance to defeat Alexei Popyrin 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 in the first round.</p><p>Murray’s victory over Popyrin marks his 1,000th ATP match, a milestone that only four other active players have achieved and an indication of his enduring longevity despite his physical issues. It is also Murray’s first ATP match win since he injured his ankle at the Miami Open in March. Asked how he was feeling physically, Murray noted, with a smile, that he has felt better.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/artic

Played in the middle of a biblical storm, water cascading off the roof of the Westfalenstadion, the Euros best night fit the weather somehow: a wild, wonderful, wide open match that had everything: 38 shots, three efforts that hit the woodwork and four goals. One was historic, Georges Mikautadze scoring Georgia’s first ever at a tournament; two were ridiculous, comic book belters from Arda Guler and Mert Muldur, and the other was scored with the last touch of an astonishing evening Kerem Akturkoglu running 70 yards and rolling the ball into an empty net.</p><p>Right there, with the bench emptying and everyone heading after him, the place erupting yet again when you thought it could hardly erupt any more, Turkey had the victory and this game had the ending it deserved.

<p>A shocking new Hulu docuseries, Cult Massacre: One Day in Jonestown, returns to 1978 and the tragedy that killed over 900 people on a controlling leader’s orders</p><p>In the world of true crime content, Jonestown is an infamous – if often misunderstood – Ur-text: arguably the most well-known, well-publicized and, ultimately, lethal of cults.

So how have such an influential group been so overlooked?</p><p>When Locksley Gichie arrived in England in 1962 from Jamaica, age 13, he landed with a bump. “It was a shock,” he recalls. “It was cold and misty.

<p>There’s no single Mediterranean style but many of my favourites evoke “stone, vine and sun”</p><p>If you asked drinkers which wine best encapsulates the Mediterranean, I have a feeling Provençal rosé would get the most votes. After all, it’s produced in vineyards which, in many cases, have views over the Med and would ideally be drunk in a restaurant in a similar location, the gorgeous, watercolour wash of pale pink inside a beaded carafe contrasting with azure sea and sky.</p><p>It’s a holiday wine, or one to drink in lieu of a trip abroad, and for that reason alone, among the most successful of the past 20 years. For me, it’s only the starting point for any cruise around a vast region in which wine is entwined with history and tradition, and where, even as globalisation has altered habits and aspirations, it retains its dual status as everyday staple and cultural symbol.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jun/18/from-lebanon-to-spain-around-the-med-in-wine

Is there another, similar leader who could give us an insight into how he might behave in office? Starmer’s early promise was similar to that of Spain’s Pedro Sánchez, the electable face of an amicable centre-to-left. But Starmer abandoned that pretence the second he became Labour leader. He wishes he were Joe Biden, to the extent that he has followed the US line on foreign policy so closely as to alienate voters over his stance on Gaza.</p><p>In terms of his demeanour, he is reminiscent of Germany’s Olaf Scholz, and if elected, he may find himself similarly buffeted by history and unable to revive a stagnating economy.

<p>It may all be a bit twee, but fun abbreviations give people a casual way to talk about their lives and their struggles</p><p>If you’ve spent any time online recently, you’d be forgiven for thinking there’s something in the water. Some grown adults – usually of the millennial, gen Z variety, though not exclusively – have regressed to a kind of cutesy, baby language, even while discussing serious topics. In this language, the cost of living crisis is the “cozzie livs”; the upcoming general election is the “genny lec”, and a mental breakdown is a “menty b”. Meanwhile, holidays are “holibobs”, and the wine formerly known as sauvignon blanc is “savvy b”– best paired with a jacky p (jacket potato) for a comforting dinner that’s not too “spenny” (expensive).</p><p>This linguistic phenomena of, well, very silly abbreviations, has created so much confusion, particularly from North American social media users, that decoding British slang is now its own genre in US celebrity interviews (they’

<p>I came out as gay and set out to explore my sexuality without worrying what other people think. Even with this freedom though, I feel lost</p><p><strong>I came out as gay in my late 20s, after years of deep repression (I had a traditional family, plus feelings of shame and fear). I very quickly fell into a relationship with another woman, who I loved dearly, but struggled to find the desire to explore my sexuality with her. I felt I could only do this on my own. After four years I ended the relationship. I was jealous of her freedom to explore her sexuality without shame. Depression and confusion followed. I questioned my queerness and my self</strong><strong>-worth and set out to explore my sexuality without worrying what other people think. But even with this freedom I feel lost. I am trying to become part of a more queer culture and find my tribe but I don’t know who I am – I know I am gay, am I also non-binary? I’m now in my mid-30s and I’m worried this exploration of different

<p>As it celebrates its 200th birthday, the RSPCA has lost its way - and is helping endorse indefensible abuse in factory farms</p><p>How does it happen? How does an organisation end up doing the opposite of what it was established to do? This month marks the 200th anniversary of the foundation of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals: the world’s oldest animal welfare organisation. I wonder what there is to celebrate.</p><p>If you mistreat your dog or cat or horse or rabbit, you can expect an investigation by the RSPCA. If the case is serious enough, it could lead to prosecution. If you abuse animals on an industrial scale, you might face not investigation and prosecution, but active support and a public relations campaign to help you sell your products.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/18/rspca-britain-oldest-animal-welfare-charity-cruelty-abuse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A smoky caesar salad with fried croutons and an anchovy aioli; and a zingy grapefruit, mint and creamy burrata salad with pistachio oil</p><p>Some think of salads as an exercise in restraint. For me, though, they are the opposite. Just think of dressings: delicious mixtures of vinegar, oil and almost anything else. Vinegars lend sparkling acidity to anything they touch, while a good olive oil is full of the right fatty acids, tastes wonderful and carries other flavours effortlessly. And, like all good fats, it really sates you. A great salad is a mouth-watering combination of fresh ingredients, a glossy dressing and all the crisp crunch you could want.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jun/18/thomasina-miers-recipes-for-summer-salads">Continue reading...</a>
