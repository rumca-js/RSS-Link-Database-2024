		Amazon-powered AI cameras are now being used to monitor and analyze passengers' emotions by employing a combination of “smart” CCTV cameras, which can detect objects or movements from the images they capture, along with older cameras that have their video feeds connected to cloud-based analysis software.

The initiative has been trialed in eight train stations across the UK over the last two years, with the aim of enhancing passenger safety and improving customer service. The AI cameras, integrated with Amazon's advanced machine learning algorithms, are designed to detect age, gender and a range of emotions, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-ai-cameras-emotions-uk-train-passengers/">WIRED reports</a>.

		Germany-based biometric security company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idloop">IDloop</a> has introduced the CFS flats, an optical contactless fingerprint scanner that incorporates 3D imaging. This product is designed to operate without physical contact in high-traffic environments, such as airports.

Jörg Reinhold, CEO of IDloop, emphasized that while contactless fingerprint scanners are not a new concept, the advanced 3D imaging capabilities of the CFS flats provide greater detail and accuracy.

“CFS flats represents a paradigm shift in biometric security. Contactless fingerprint scanners aren’t new, but our product is designed for public arenas where the highest level of security is not only neces

		<em>By: Elay Elazar, Head (VP) Of Global Solution Engineering Presales at <a href="http://au10tix.com">AU10TIX</a> </em>

The global transportation network is vast, incorporating ride-share giants such as Uber and Lyft, traditional taxi services, extensive bus lines, micro-mobile companies like scooter rentals, and a complex web of various service providers. At the core of ensuring safety and integrity lies the pivotal intersection of secure transactions and advanced identity verification (IDV).

But with a significant shift from traditional cash transactions to digital in recent years, the challenges have become multifaceted. While digital payments enhance the user experience, evolving regulations and some regions/sectors’ lingering adherence to tra

		The Parliament of Cameroon is examining a bill that will allow the country to accede to two United Nations Conventions relating to the recognition of stateless persons. If it passes into law, stateless people in Cameroon could soon receive legal identity documents.

The bill, which was submitted to members of the National Assembly (the lower chamber of parliament) recently, seeks to authorize the President of the Republic, Pual Biya, to proceed with Cameroon’s accession to the United Nations Conventions relating to the status of stateless persons and on the reduction of statelessness adopted, respectively, on September 28, 1954 and August 30, 1961.

		The question of aging is a particularly tough nugget for legislators to chew on when considering facial recognition or face biometrics for identity verification. There are subtleties in the debate, particularly when it comes to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202406/yoti-responds-to-ofcoms-counterfactual-statements-on-age-assurance-tech">age assurance</a>, which has been proven accurate on young faces, despite statements to the counter by UK regulators.

“Customers have been told to update their facial images and chip-based ID cards by July 1 to avoid disruptions in high-value online transactions,” says the report.
