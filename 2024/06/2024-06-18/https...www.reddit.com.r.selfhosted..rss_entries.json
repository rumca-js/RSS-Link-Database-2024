It worked great for a while, but now I'm having issues with <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/1ZT29dW6\">registering new SSL certificates</a>, and apparently, it hasn't <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/9avS06sy\">been able to renew old ones for an indeterminate period of time.</a> (links are to log files in case anyone can help with the problem itself).</p> <p>This is on Unraid.</p> <p>So, unless I can solve this issue quickly, I think I'll probably use it as the impetus for switching to a new reverse proxy provider. Is there a preferred one that works well with CrowdSec? Without much research, my first thought is to use SWAG.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aldumil\"> /u/Aldumil </a> <br /> <span><a href=", "id": 733434, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1diuilf/switching_to_a_new_reverse_proxy", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Switching to a new reverse proxy", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-18T16:06:02+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have a bunch of markdown files on a folder that is public on the network via SMB, and I want to be able to access them with my phone over the network. is there an app for that?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Im-esophagusLess\"> /u/Im-esophagusLess </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1diuc19/app_for_editing_markdown_files_from_a_network/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1diuc19/app_for_editing_markdown_files_from_a_network/\">[comments]</a></span>", "id": 733435, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1diuc19/app_for_editing_markdown_files_from_a_network", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/.rss", "source_obj__id": 450, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "app for editing markdown files from a network drive?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-18T15:59:09+00:00", "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have multiple server machines (three) and I was wondering what you all do with multiple machines.
