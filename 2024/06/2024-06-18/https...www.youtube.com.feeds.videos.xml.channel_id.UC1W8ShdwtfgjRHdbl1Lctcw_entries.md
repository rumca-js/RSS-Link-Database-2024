I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Paris 1940, under German occupation, views of the streets of Paris, including the Eiffel Tower and the Place de la Concorde. Street scenes, signs, buses, pedestrians and a German soldier, cars, "Café de la Paix" restaurant. 

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound design  only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
