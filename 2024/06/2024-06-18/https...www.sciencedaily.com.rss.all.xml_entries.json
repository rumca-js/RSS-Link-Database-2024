A better understanding of olfactory coding in the locust brain should help to learn more about how the behavior of these insects is controlled, especially their swarming.", "id": 734039, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240618115710.htm", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "source_obj__id": 188, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Odors are encoded in rings in the brain of migratory locusts", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-18T11:56:38+00:00", "description": "Researchers have surveyed people under the age of 25 who have had cancer since 1958.

They guarantee that all body parts end up where they belong and that no ears grow on our backs. The head-tail axis, for example, determines the orientation of the two ends of the body.

However, there appears to be another player in this system, as researchers have now discovered by using an embryo-like model system they developed. In the absence of BMP, the signalling molecule beta-catenin takes on the role of the Nodal antagonist.
