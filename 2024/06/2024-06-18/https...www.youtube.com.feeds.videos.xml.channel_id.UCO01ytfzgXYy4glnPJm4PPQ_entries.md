Today on the Matt Walsh Show, this week an illegal immigrant with a machete raped a child in broad daylight in the middle of New York City. This is just the latest brutal, violent crime committed by someone who shouldn't even be in this country to begin with. And, it's why a large majority of Americans now support mass deportations. Americans are sick of this. And, they should be. Also, the surgeon general proposes cigarette-style warning labels on social media sites. Police in one crime-ridden county in Maryland have devised a new plan to fight crime, and it involves giving out free slushies. And, a firefighter in San Francisco was attacked by one of his coworkers and beaten with a wrench. The victim lost his job and the attacker is still collecting a paycheck.
