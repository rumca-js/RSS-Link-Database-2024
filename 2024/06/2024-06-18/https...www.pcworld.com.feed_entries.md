<p>Free operating system Linux is looking to Windows as its role model, at least in this one way: implementing its own Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) to warn users in cases of a kernel panic.</p>



<p>The BSOD&mdash;with the official name &ldquo;DRM Panic&rdquo;&mdash;will be included in the operating system for the first time with Linux 6.10, prompting users to reboot. Its usefulness will be further expanded in the near future.</p>



<p>The whole thing was solved by direct rendering manager drivers (DRM drivers) and kernel mode setting drivers (KMS drivers). In Linux 6.10, the new DRM panic handler will be integrated into the kernel for the first time. At launch, DRM &amp; KMS drivers SimpleDRM, MGAG200, IMX, and AST are supported, with more to follow.</p>



<p>Nouveau-DRM panic patches are already in preparation, but will probably only be integrated in Linux 6.11

<p>Gaming laptops are fantastic, but rarely affordable. You really have to hunt if you want to find a deal. But that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for! Today Woot has a 16-inch Gigabyte gaming laptop, complete with a Core i7 processor and RTX 4060 discrete graphics card, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://computers.woot.com/offers/gigabyte-aorus-16-laptop&amp;xcust=2-1-2371105-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">for $899.99</a>. That&rsquo;s barely a premium over a non-gaming laptop, and over $500 off its original price. </p>



<p>The Aorus 16&rsquo;s 13th-generation Core i7 processor is among the best you can get in any laptop at the moment. And the Nvidia RTX 4060, while not the beefiest GPU ever, should be more than enough to handle even the latest 3D games. The screen is impressive too: with 2560&tim

<p>PC sales have been struggling this year, and giving the &ldquo;Copilot+&rdquo; label to laptops equipped with newer hardware and the latest Microsoft AI features was supposed to give them a shot in the arm.</p>

<p>Cloud storage is cool and all, but what are you going to do when your internet is down? Or your account gets hacked? Or your cloud service shuts down and leaves you high and dry?</p>



<p>Relying on cloud storage is risky, which is why you should also have a physical drive&mdash;ideally one that&rsquo;s portable, with tons of space, that you can take with you on the go as needed.</p>

<p>If your existing printer suddenly gives up the ghost and can no longer be repaired, a replacement is usually needed quickly. After all, many people can&rsquo;t manage without an output device &mdash; not in the family and certainly not in the home office or small office. It&rsquo;s not a good idea to jump straight to the next best printer offer, no matter how attractive the price of the device may seem.</p>



<p>It is much better to ask yourself a few questions about your future printer model before making a purchase. The more precise your answers are, the better the output device will ultimately suit your application scenario.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s worth the effort when you consider that a well-chosen printer will usually serve you for several years without complaint.</p>



<p>The focus here is not so much on output quality. After all, there is no such thing as

<p>One of the big questions surrounding the launch of the Microsoft Surface Pro (2024) and new Copilot+ PCs is how well those laptops will run the broad ecosystem of Windows applications. So will they run just about everything? Pretty much, says a senior Microsoft executive, minus gaming.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve asked the Windows on Arm &ldquo;app compat&rdquo; question before &mdash; in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2313997/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-pcs-might-just-work.html">April, for example, of Kedar Kondap</a>, the senior vice president and general manager of Compute and Gaming for Qualcomm, told me that the days of app issues on Arm were pretty much over.
