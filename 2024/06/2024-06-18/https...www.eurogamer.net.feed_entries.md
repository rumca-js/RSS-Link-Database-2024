Following the sudden cancellation of Paradox Interactive's ambitious Sims-like Life by You, the company has confirmed it's closing the internal studio behind the project, Paradox Tectonic.
</p><p>
Paradox Tectonic - the 24-person team overseen by former Sims boss and CEO of Second Life studio Linden Labs, Rod Humble - was unveiled with some fanfare back in 2019. It wasn't last March, however, that its first game, Life By You, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-life-by-you-is-an-open-world-real-language-take-on-the-sims">officially revealed</a>.
</p><p>
At the time, it seemed like a solid proposition, promising Sims-like gameplay and ambitious features including an "open game world where everything is customisable" and "real language conversation". Unfortunately, the project quickly ran into trouble, <a href="http

Throne and Liberty - the latest South Korean free-to-play fantasy MMO to land on Amazon Games' publishing slate following 2022's Lost Ark - will get worldwide release on 17th September, with an open beta coming to PC and consoles in July.
</p><p>
Developed by NCSoft, the company behind Guild Wars and City of Heroes, Throne and Liberty promises to be a game of exploration and "massive-scale combat" - accommodating "thousands of players at once" - all unfolding in the "dynamic" open world of Solisium.
</p><p>
"Adapt your fight to survive and thrive through strategic decisions in PvP, PvE or both as you encounter evolving battlefields impacted by weather, time of day, and other players", its promotion blurb explains. "There is no single path to victory as you seek to defeat Kazar and claim the throne while keeping rival

Following starring remaster turns for Pheonix Wright, Apollo Justice, and Ryunosuke Naruhodo, it's finally Miles Edgeworth's time to shine; Capcom has unveiled the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, coming to PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch on 6th September.
</p><p>
The newly announced collection includes two Miles Edgeworth led Ace Attorney spin-off adventures - both incorporating the series' usual mix of crime scene exploration and courtroom cross-examinations - starting with Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth, which originally released for Nintendo DS in 2009.
</p><p>
It's the second included title that's perhaps most exciting, however, given that Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor&rsquo;s Gambit - which initially launched for DS back in 2011 - hasn't previously had an official

That game where all you do is click a banana is now one of Steam's most popular releases ever. In fact, it is so popular, it has today bopped both Hogwarts Legacy and Baldur's Gate 3 down a place on Steam's most played games chart. 
</p><p>
Banana - as the game is aptly called - is now sitting proudly in ninth place on Steam's most played games charts in terms of all-time player peak. 
</p><p>
At the time of writing, that peak is 884,469 banana clickers, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak">SteamDB</a>.

</p><p>
"Dribble, pass and shoot in two-on-two matches, or aim for the highest score against up to three other players in Five Streak Battle," Nintedo says in its latest Switch Sports trailer, which you can see below.

Sure we had to wait over a month (and were then only given 24 hours notice, classic Nintendo), but it was worth it. Well worth it subjectively, I'm sure there are some  disappointment people out there. (Look, we'd all like to play Silksong. Hopefully it will be out next year. Or the year after that...) Anyways, in case you missed June 2024's Nintendo Direct or simply want to revisit the announcements - look no further as you'll find it all below.</p><p>The Nintendo Direct started in pure Nintendo fashion with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-luigi-brothership-bringing-the-action-rpg-series-to-switch-this-year">Mario and Luigi Brothership</a>.

Nintendo made the announcement during this afternoon's Direct broadcast. Both N64 shooters are available from today. In addition, Perfect Dark will arrive with online multiplayer, so who is ready for a round or two later?

As well as these mature games, Nintendo Switch Online users will be able to get their hands on GameBoy Advance's Metroid: Zero Mission and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords. You can see a little taste for what's in store via the video below.

## Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D is the excuse I need to properly play this iconic series

Firstly, a confession: despite being a huge Final Fantasy fan, and fan of the genre overall, I've never played a Dragon Quest game - much to my shame. The first Dragon Quest (released in 1986) is the original, pioneering JRPG and the success of the series is a huge reason why the genre is so popular. But so far, it's passed me by.
</p><p>
I admit this not to reveal my shortcomings, but to say I am absolutely the target market for Square Enix's forthcoming HD-2D remake of Dragon Quest 3. As with much of the series, it's seen numerous re-releases since but isn't available across all modern consoles besides mobile ports and Switch. But now it's making a triumphant return using the graphical style popularised by Octopath Traveler and will arrive on Switc

After a long old wait, Nintendo has finally blessed us with a first proper look at its hugely anticipated Metroid Prime 4 - which now sports the subtitle 'Beyond', and is launching sometime next year.
</p><p>
Metroid Prime 4 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch">originally announced</a> back in 2017, almost a decade after the launch of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption on Wii. Nintendo eventually confirmed it was was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-namco-bandai-is-working-on-metroid-prime-4">being developed by Bandai Namco</a> - but 2019 brought the news the project had "not reached the standard" Nintendo sought and was being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-development-rebooted-from-scratch">rebooted from scratch</a>, this time with original Metroid P

</p><p>
That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-teased">tease was on Dragon Quest day</a>, 27th May, with a short logo showing the game's logo and the words "The legacy begins".

Kicking its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-right-here-with-us">latest Direct</a> off with a bang, Nintendo has unveiled Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, which is heading to Switch on 7th November this year.

</p><p>
Nintendo's Brothership reveal didn't offer much in the way of specifics, but it's described as a "sea-faring adventure that unfolds across mysterious islands", and there's promise of "evolved moves" for the Mario brothers when it arrives.
