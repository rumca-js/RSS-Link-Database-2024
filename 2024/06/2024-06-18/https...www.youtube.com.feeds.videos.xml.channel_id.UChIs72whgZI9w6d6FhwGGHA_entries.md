Our last product video from Computex is at In Win, where we wanted to revisit the creative design center to see unreleased case designs, a new Infinite "Signature" series case, modular Lynx fans, and more. The main focus was on unreleased products, particularly the Silencer case with a foam panel for sound absorption. We also featured some of In Win's designers and product managers in discussions to learn more about the process.
