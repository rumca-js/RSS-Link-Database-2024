After five months in beta, Butterflies is billed as an app where &#8220;humans and AI coexist.&#8221; The Verge editor Alex Heath called the app, whose interface looks like Instagram, &#8220;one of the most provocative — and, at times, unsettling — takes on social media that I’ve seen in quite a while.&#8221; The technology relies on public AI models as well as the startup&#8217;s own image rendering and LLM models to help users create an AI friend, called a&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/butterflies-takes-flight-with-4-8m-launches-social-media-platform-combining-ai-and-human-content/">Read More</a>

The Bellevue, Wash.-based wireless carrier is providing infrastructure to power a new &#8220;KPMG Champcast&#8221; mobile app and online experience that features real-time shot tracking for every golfer. High-resolution drone imagery was used to create a digital twin of each hole at Sahalee, and shot-tracking is powered by a system called ShotLink. Champcast can be accessed via the championship&#8217;s mobile app (iOS; Android) or online.

Rather than offering Recall at launch, as originally planned, Microsoft said last week that the feature would first be released and tested through its Windows Insider program in the coming weeks. The move comes amid broader scrutiny of Microsoft&#8217;s security challenges, as reflected in a Congressional hearing last week, and the company&#8217;s pledge to prioritize security over new features.

And it was through that experience that the Seattle entrepreneur came to a realization. &#8220;There&#8217;s this massive need in the market for a tool that allows people to leverage AI for workflow-specific tasks without prompting,&#8221; Bystron told GeekWire. Bystron is the co-founder and CEO of DeltaGen, a new startup developing software that aims to help companies use AI tools that don&#8217;t require &#8220;prompting,&#8221; or the process of queuing AI systems for a specific answer.

Mudita Venture Partners, a venture capital firm based in Detroit, launched its Mudita Studios arm about a year ago. Stephen Konig, a longtime Google product management leader based in Seattle, runs the program. &#8220;It was important for me to stay here,&#8221; Konig told GeekWire. &#8220;It&#8217;s such an active and vibrant community from a startup and talent perspective.&#8221; Four startups have spun out of Mudita Studios, including three based in Seattle: Official AI, which helps people monetize their digital likeness; Stellis AI, which offers AI&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/google-vet-leads-new-startup-studio-in-seattle-spinning-out-b2b-software-companies/">Read More</a
