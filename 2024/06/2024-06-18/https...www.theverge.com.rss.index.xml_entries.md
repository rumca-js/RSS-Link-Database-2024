  <p id="gJ6ser">Universal remotes might be on a comeback tour if devices like <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cantata/haptique-rs90-a-true-universal-remote-controller">Cantata’s Haptique RS90 and RS90X</a> actually materialize and are as good as advertised. The connected remote purports to double as a comprehensive smart home controller, but it’s merely a Kickstarter hopeful for now. Serial remoters (remotees?) have pledged more than $300,00, with less than $10,000 needed to fully fund the project as of writing, and there’s currently an estimated ship date of August 2024.</p>

  <p id="ArBy3j">After years of playing second fiddle to Link in her own franchise, Princess Zelda is finally getting a video game of her own this fall.</p>
<p id="Zi5pjp">During today’s Direct presentation, Nintendo revealed <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>: <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, the franchise’s first game to follow as Princess Zelda herself embarks on an adventure to save the world from destruction. After Ganon bests Link in battle, Zelda is left to her own devices to battle hordes of monsters that descend upon the game’s take on Hyrule (which seems heavily inspired by 2019’s <em>Link’s Awakening </em>remake).</p>

The brief video was classic <em>Metroid Prime</em>, featuring intense first-person gunfighting <em>and</em> scanning stuff in the environment.

  <p id="YDXn07">Google DeepMind <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/generating-audio-for-video/">has taken the wraps off</a> of a new AI tool for generating video soundtracks. In addition to using a text prompt to generate audio, DeepMind’s tool also takes into account the contents of the video.</p>
<p id="u0YrE6">By combining the two, DeepMind says users can use the tool to create scenes with “a drama score, realistic sound effects or dialogue that matches the characters and tone of a video.” You can see some of the examples posted on DeepMind’s website — and they sound pretty good.</p>
