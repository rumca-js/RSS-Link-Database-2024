								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet the second absolutely horrifying new model Games Workshop has dropped in less than a week: the Malstrain Coalescence, for <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong>'s weirder, narrative wargame cousin Necromunda. This part-man, part-genestealer mutation might cause widespread discomfort, but for those with a stronger stomach, it's yet more proof that truly gruesome, grotesque GW miniatures are back.</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having one of the </span><b>best MTG commanders</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is essential in Magic: The Gathering's EDH format. Your commander is the legendary creature that leads your other 99 cards into combat, dictates the colors you can use, and shapes your strategy, so it’s pretty vital to make the right choice.</span></p>
<p>First rule: not every commander is created equal. Some are powerful deck-pilots born for the role, while others are not cut out for the pressures of leadership.
