In today's Daily Fix:
Nintendo finally had their big summer showcase, and they came with some heavy hitters. Not only did they FINALLY show off Metroid Prime 4 footage, but they unveiled a brand new Zelda game...where you play as Zelda! Now known as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the game has been MIA since its announcement at E3 2017 (remember E3?). The game was originally in development at Bandai Namco, but was brought to developer Retro Studios (the devs behind the original Prime trilogy), who basically started over from scratch. The new Zelda game, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, borrows the art style from the Switch's Link's Awakening remake, and you get to play as Zelda who must save Link this time around. But it isn't all Nintendo news today—Xbox announced Wave 2 of Game Pass games coming later in June.

## House of the Dragon Season 2, Episode 1 Review – "A Son for a Son"

House of the Dragon Season 2, Episode 1 – "A Son for a Son," reviewed by Helen O'Hara. Narrated by Alan Wheeler.

Aside from that one shocking murder – perhaps thankfully less shocking than it might have been visually – this is a period of phony war for the Greens and Blacks, as each side casts about for alternatives to violence and finds none. It’s also an episode with relatively little action, setting up the stakes of this season rather than delivering huge amounts of drama in its own right. Still, that final bloody slaying shows that the cost of all this maneuvering will be high, and that it will be borne by those least able to defend themselves. It’s a horrifying illustration of the cost of a civil war: with a family turned against itself, even the youngest and most innocent are not safe.

The Rogue Prince of Persia reviewed in Early Access by Imran Khan on PC.

With a slick presentation and an incredibly fun combat system, all the right pieces are here for The Rogue Prince of Persia’s success. But while running on walls and zooming through enemies are fast-paced joys, the repetition you’ll face and the faint whisper of a story that loosely ties everything together wear thin far too quickly right now. It will undoubtedly be fascinating to watch The Rogue Prince of Persia fill out as time goes on, but both bug fixes and more of pretty much everything need to be equal priorities in its upcoming updates to move the needle to something great. The Rogue Prince of Persia could have what it takes to one day become the next major roguelite favorite, but it’s pretty far from that goal where it sits now.
