The impossible architecture, the improbable geography and the way that the levels twist and turn and fold back in on themselves really muddles my head and stops me from being able to visualise the locations properly. Put me in those same places in VR though and suddenly, because it feels like I'm actually there, their spaces make so much more sense. The depth, the distance, the perspective, every visual trick that VR provides makes From's abstract scenery much easier for my brain to understand.  </p><p>Not only that though, VR also allows me to appreciate the finer details of the game's assets.
