It’s been 11 years since EA’s last College Football game and in that time, it seems they’ve had ample opportunity to hunker down, analyse football’s second tier, and create a game which encapsulates all the magic found in the student-athlete game. 

Ferocious gameday atmosphere and teams steeped in tradition are but one facet of this dynamic sport. The gameplay itself bears distinction from its NFL counterpart and it’s here we’ll be focusing the meat of this feature. In short: EA Tiburon have developed a raft of new and unique gameplay mechanics that’ll differentiate EA Sports College Football 25 from Madden by a huge degree. 

The entries included here, if anything, highlight EA’s commitment to authenticity – it’s hoped that the mechanics developed will suggest a real-life feeling, more so than Madden.

Over the last decade and a half or thereabouts, it hasn’t exactly been unusual to see FromSoftware setting unprecedented new standards for the medium as a whole- after all, the studio did that as recently as 2022 with the stellar open world masterpiece that was Elden Ring. 

A couple of years later, in fact, the studio is now back with a massive, mind-bogglingly spectacular expansion that is somehow not only bigger, but also much better than anyone could have expected, which is saying an awful lot, given how enormously high everyone’s expectations have been. 

Shadow of the Erdtree is good enough to stand toe-to-toe even with Elden Ring’s base game itself, which, yes, means that it’s better than most full games that you’re going to play this year.

Depending on your mood, "noob" can either be used affectionately to describe players who don't know better or derisively for, well, players who don't know better. Either way, they'll make mistakes, and it's usually funny to long-time players because they've overcome the same.

However, the truth of the matter is: Everyone is a noob at some point or another. We all make terrible decisions in-game even though we should know better. Maybe it's forgetting to hide the bodies in Metal Gear Solid or Hitman, rushing into a team fight 1v5, or accidentally dodge-rolling into the abyss. It all happens at some point or another, whether intentionally or otherwise.

So, let's take a look at and celebrate the 15 most noobish things that players tend to do in video games, reinforcing that they really do happen to the best of us.
