<p><a href="https://fuglede.github.io/llama.ttf/">llama.ttf</a></p>
llama.ttf is "a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model".</p>
<p>You can see it kick into action at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4bOyYctgFI&amp;t=508s">8m28s in this video</a>, where creator Søren Fuglede Jørgensen types "Once upon a time" followed by dozens of exclamation marks, and those exclamation marks then switch out to render a continuation of the story. But... when they paste the code out of the editor again it shows as the original exclamation marks were preserved - the LLM output was presented only in the way they were rendered.</p>
<p>The key trick here is that the font renderer library <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarfBuzz">HarfBuzz</a> (used by Firefox, Chrome, Android, GNOME and more) added a new <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/docs/wasm-shaper.md">WebAssembly extension</a> in <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz
