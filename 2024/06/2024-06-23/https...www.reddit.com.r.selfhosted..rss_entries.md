<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use the Our Groceries home screen widget all the time on my phone and I've moved my recipes over to Mealie. I realise Mealie has a shopping list but is there a widget that can grab the shopping list data from Mealie?</p> <p>I have Our Groceries integrated in Home Assistant if that can provide a link between the two.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/scottb721"> /u/scottb721 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dmblx3/mealie_friendly_shopping_list_android_widget/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dmblx3/mealie_friendly_shopping_list_android_widget/">[comments]</a></span>
