<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Spaghetti detection is great, and it has saved my from wasting filament on occasion, but it seems to me that most of the time spaghetti is caused by an object moving on the print bed. </p> <p>Since objects are not supposed to move on a print bed, why not just take a snapshot of the bed after each layer, and then check whether the same objects are in the the same place after the next one? </p> <p>This seems like an easier thing to detect with less likelihood for false positives and could be very helpful as a protection feature. </p> <p>Just wondering why no one has done this, .or if they have, why is it not more common?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SirThunderCloud"> /u/SirThunderCloud </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1dmbpg0/instead_of_detecting_spaghetti_why_not_detect_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/

I’ve always brought him back a rubber duck each time I went to the arcade. So I printed these guys and found out where he was going for lunch yesterday and upgraded his car while he was inside eating. I managed to go back to work, finish the work day, and then get three counties away before he saw them and texted me. </p> <p>I wasn’t sure if the full duck would fit on his car since it didn’t work on my truck, so I made a full version and a skinny version. <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/@mgrimes?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR2VX1deSKzkoIP26eZmEdXo9Z1yn7jI61ywTfyYK6_R5lVXrVAMTnSgIhc_aem__h39LQINYzrpNkpfSwOf5w">Models here.</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;

Also, I get a lot of stringing, both thin strings like spider web and thicker strings that don't shrivel up under a heat gun and require a sharp tool to remove. Any suggestions on how to get a cleaner finish on my prints? Any help is appreciated.</p> <p>Ender 5 S1 Elegoo Rapid PLA+ Nozzle: 220C Bed: 60C Sliced using Cura</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thejakeinator95"> /u/thejakeinator95 </a> <br /> <span><a

I found it works really well to remove the ugly white sanded surface and returns the color back like new. It available at most powersport dealerships.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wormbait170"> /u/wormbait170 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dma513">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://
