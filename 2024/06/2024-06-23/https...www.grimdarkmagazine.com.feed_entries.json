Tales of her exploits transcend time and space, defying reality. Depending on which name, she is a hero of both sides. A felon with a bounty on her head worth twenty million. Ortiz has officially been declared dead a handful of times and, in some realities, died almost twice that amount. Her next death will be her last. Her last alias will be remembered by all. Ninth Life by Stark Holborn is a compilation of myths, the unofficial story of a legend. The Factus Sequence trilogy spans a hundred years of history regarding the moon of Factus and its war with the Accord. It begins with an Ex-convict medic dubbed Ten Low discovering a crashed spaceship and rescuing Gabriella Ortiz. Ten Low soon realizes Ortiz is not an innocent child, but a genetically enhanced super soldier. Once the Accord\u2019s greatest achievement and pride, it seems these soldiers were betrayed. They are being hunted for elimination.
