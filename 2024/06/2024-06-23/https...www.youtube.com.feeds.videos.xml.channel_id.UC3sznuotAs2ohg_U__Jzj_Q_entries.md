Boy oh boy, loyal Theorist, the Disney+ X-Men 97 show was SUCH a banger. We still can't get over how awesome it is to see Wolverine on the small screen AND on the big screen, in Deadpool & Wolverine, this summer. Now we all know the worst X-Men villains like Magneto, Apocalypse, and Sabretooth; but did you know that NONE of them hold up to the worst X-Men villain of all.... Disney!
