<p>&ldquo;AI&rdquo; applications are so specialized that they need dedicated neural processing units to work. Apparently, anyway &mdash; <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2199565/ai-reality-check-new-npus-dont-matter-as-much-as-youd-think.html">what benefits these NPUs can actually offer</a> for typical users isn&rsquo;t exactly clear. But if you&rsquo;d like to experiment with some very specific AI applications on your Raspberry Pi, that&rsquo;s now an option with an official hardware module. </p>

<p>Ever completely stop for a moment, struck breathless by beauty? The Phanteks Evolv X2, newly announced at Computex 2024, sparks that kind of reaction. (My mug literally paused in mid-air when I saw it.) Its shape may be like other tower cases, but its looks are altogether something else.</p>



<p>Though boxy and rectangular, the Phanteks Evolv X2 carries slender lines, sports a chimney layout, and comes graced with tasteful accents. It looks distinctive and fresh&mdash;and very welcome. These days, most standard tower cases are utilitarian, with air intake from the front, exhaust out the top and back, and perhaps the option to also intake from the bottom. Meanwhile glass aquarium enclosures tend to go wide with dual-chamber interiors.</p>



<p>The Evolve X2 blends the best aspects of each style, keeping the narrower proportions of a traditional tower by only ve

But with hundreds of millions of users still on the older version (and many refusing to upgrade), it looks like Microsoft has a few improvements left to make. A new beta version just dropped for Windows Insiders.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush&mdash;we all love fried food. But we should all admit that it&rsquo;s not exactly the healthiest way to eat. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Capacity-Dehydrate-Technology-AF141/dp/B0CSZ7WBYW&amp;xcust=2-1-2357219-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ninja Air Fryer 4-in-1 is now on sale for $90</a> and it&rsquo;s going to help you get some of that crispiness you crave without dipping your food into an oil bath.</p>



<p>The Ninja Air Fryer 4-in-1 has an MSRP of $120, so the current $30 discount is the best price we&rsquo;ve yet to see for this product so far. This is such a versatile kitchen appliance that we couldn&rsquo;t refrain from sharing the deal with you.</p>

<p>Sure, cloud storage is pretty awesome, but there are just so many risks that it&rsquo;s always a good idea to save them all on a flash drive. Luckily, the SanDisk Ultra Fit is a tiny storage solution with tons of space. In fact, you can get <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-Ultra-Flash-Drive/dp/B083ZS4HYD&amp;xcust=2-1-2357096-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">512GB for just $33</a>, a 63 percent discount from its usual $90.</p>



<p>Getting 512GB of storage space for such a low price is always a feat. You can, perhaps, get the same capacity from other brands across the internet, but there&rsquo;s something to be said about buying a flash drive from a brand such as SanDisk, which has a solid reputation.</p>

<p>The JBL Charge 4 is not a tiny speaker that you can barely hear when you take it out into the yard. No, it&rsquo;s a sizable speaker with a bass strong enough that it can rattle your teeth in the best way possible.</p>



<p>This is a wireless Bluetooth speaker, which means you can connect it to phones and tablets and laptops alike. Even better, it can connect to two devices at once, making it easy to jump from one devic

<p>Windows 10 continues to enjoy overwhelming popularity as an operating system, not least because many users prefer its features and designs to Windows 11. </p>

<p>Montech may not be as prominent as Lian Li, Phanteks, or Corsair, but it&rsquo;s known for fashionable budget PC cases. The company is also apparently not one to shy away from controversial design choices. Just look at the Computex 2024 announcement of the Montech HS01 Mini, a small form factor case trimmed in leather.</p>



<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s correct. Rather than going with wood (the current &ldquo;it&rdquo; material) for accents, the HS01 Mini sports bold diagonal swaths of leather along its sides. Additionally, a thin strip highlights the front ports, while a charming strap forms a carrying handle.</p>



<p>Without that handle, the less charitable might have gotten away with mocking comments about this case&rsquo;s looks (I can hear the references to cows and sheer ugliness already). But the carrying strap gives the HS01 Mini the air of practical <em>haute

No, it&rsquo;s the ROG Mjolnir Portable Gaming UPS, a confusingly named but clearly awesome portable power station described by the company as &ldquo;designed for both indoor gaming and outdoor activities.&rdquo;</p>



<p>(Uninterrupted power supplies typically run only off of AC power and aren&rsquo;t meant to go outdoors, while portable power stations have more options for charging and can be hauled around.)</p>



<p>Why you&rsquo;d want to cart this work of practical art outdoors is a mystery to this city dweller, but perhaps there&rsquo;s wisdom in making the most of an investment. This take
