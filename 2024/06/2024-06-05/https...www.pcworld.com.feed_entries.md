<p>Intel&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2350967/lunar-lake-deep-dive-intels-new-ai-laptop-cpu-is-utterly-different.html">latest Lunar Lake chips for laptops</a> have made a big splash at Computex. The new CPUs use a radical new architecture and show impressive generational gains, which is something Intel needs as competition heats up from AMD and Qualcomm. To dive deep into the new designs, PCWorld&rsquo;s Mark Hachman went straight to the source. </p>



<p>Mark interviews Intel&rsquo;s Dan Rogers (Vice President and General Manager) and Robert Hallock (Vice President and General Manager, Client AI and Technical Marketing) on the big changes for these chips, designed specifically to maximize power and efficiency for thin-and-light laptops. The interview covers a lot of ground, so watch the full thing on YouTube if you have the time. </p>

<p>Several years ago, I got to play with the Acer ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Editon laptop, a revolutionary device that allowed me to view 3D imagery without the need for 3D glasses.</p>



<p>As impressed as I was at the time with it, though, its practical application seemed a bit limited by the content available. I mean, there&rsquo;s only a certain number of times I could view the same image of a beachball popping out of the screen at me in 3D.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;m now having to rethink that stance after Acer announced the SpatialLabs Eyes Stereo Camera at Computex 2024. What is it? It&rsquo;s a camera that allows you to capture your own 3D stereoscopic images and videos. What&rsquo;s more, it comes fully compatible with Acer&rsquo;s SpatialLabs 3D laptops, which means they&rsquo;re back on my radar in a big way.</p>



<p>The camera is quite compact. It measures just

<p>Sure, cloud storage is pretty awesome, but there are just so many risks that it&rsquo;s always a good idea to save them all on a flash drive. Luckily, the SanDisk Ultra Fit is a tiny storage solution with tons of space. In fact, you can get <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-Ultra-Flash-Drive/dp/B083ZS4HYD&amp;xcust=2-1-2357096-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">512GB for just $33</a>, a 63 percent discount from its usual $90.</p>



<p>Getting 512GB of storage space for such a low price is always a feat. You can, perhaps, get the same capacity from other brands across the internet, but there&rsquo;s something to be said about buying a flash drive from a brand such as SanDisk, which has a solid reputation.</p>



<p>Plus, there&rsquo;s also something to be said about the s

<p>At Computex 2024, everyone was talking about AI again. Intel&rsquo;s Lunar Lake hardware and AMD&rsquo;s Strix Point chips will deliver faster AI performance, with upgraded <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2302123/what-is-an-ai-pc-we-cut-through-the-hype.html">neural processing units (NPUs)</a> that meet and exceed <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2337930/meet-the-future-of-windows-copilot-pcs-feature-practical-ai-tools.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot+ PC requirements</a>. That&rsquo;s great.</p>



<p>But the big promise of Qualcomm&rsquo;s soon-to-be-released line of Snapdragon X Elite-powered laptops is the huge battery life numbers we&rsquo;re being promised over Intel and AMD-powered laptops.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We know we haven&rsquo;t necessarily been the highest battery life design point,&rdquo; said Intel&rsquo;s Dan Rogers in <a href="https

<p>NordVPN is not only one of the top VPNs on the market, but a subscription to the service gives you a ton of great features as well. But not all of the best features are commonly known or ready to go right out of the box. Thankfully, with just a little bit of knowledge and a few minutes of your time, you can have the VPN up and purring with ease.</p>



<p>Below I&rsquo;ll show you my top five settings that I think everyone should change in NordVPN to get the most from their subscription. These tweaks will help you optimize your privacy and security, increase connection speeds, and take full advantage of the powerful utilities Nord has to offer.</p>



<p>While I highly recommend NordVPN, if you&rsquo;re interested in other great services, be sure to check out our list of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-adv
