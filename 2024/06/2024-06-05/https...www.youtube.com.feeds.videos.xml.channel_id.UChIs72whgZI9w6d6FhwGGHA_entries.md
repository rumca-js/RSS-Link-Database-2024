Tryx is the weirdest new PC company in the space. It launched officially just this year with its new Panorama 3D liquid cooler lineup, first available only in China and now going worldwide. Tryx is comprised of former ASUS, Cooler Master, and Asetek employees (and is backed by Asetek itself). The company is also working on several new cases, like its "LUCA" and "SPES" cases, alongside a trippy "Otavia" paracord-ish case.

Montech's showing at #Computex 2024 was strong: The company has new budget cases as cheap as $64 for airflow and up to about $200 for a 7-fan case (the King 95 Mega Pro). The company is following-up its King 95 debut with cases like the King 65 Pro, the King 95 Mega, the Sky 3 prototype, and more. We're excited to see how these do in our case benchmarking and in our 2024 Best Cases round-ups this year, because it seems like the fight is fierce for budget cases.

Fractal is releasing its new Era 2 & Mood mini-ITX cases, one of which uses aluminum and wood while the other uses a fabric around the exterior shell of the case. The Fractal Mood uses a single 180mm x 38mm Torrent case fan at the top of the chassis tower, leveraging two blocked-off sides and two open sides to guide air straight into the separated GPU and CPU compartments within the case. The Era 2 uses 2x 120mm bottom fans for intake. We have the price and release date for both the Mood and the Era 2 in this video. Both cases use a clever mechanical design that we think is well-executed, giving a "unibody" feel to the outer shell (but not technically) for easy interior access to components. Fractal also has its Scape headset and Refine chair, although we're not spending time covering them.

## Intel Says Not to Say "LGA1851" or "Z890" | MSI vs. ASUS Features & X870E Boards

MSI is showing off Z890 & X870E motherboards at #Computex 2024 -- and Intel is a control freak, trying to prevent anyone from knowing that its next socket is "LGA18XX" (it's 1851) - but even 18XX has been known for literal years now, and yet Intel thinks it can put that genie back in the bottle. Bizarre Intel control behaviors aside, MSI has new motherboards competing with ASUS on ease-of-installation features, a new case with some unique fans, and an AIO with offset mounting for Intel's upcoming Arrow Lake CPUs.
