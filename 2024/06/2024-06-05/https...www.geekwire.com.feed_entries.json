The company implemented the &#8220;regulatory response fee&#8221; for consumers in January after the city&#8217;s existing minimum wage law went into effect, saying it helped &#8220;cover the cost of these new regulations.&#8221; With the new fee in place, demand fell for DoorDash and Uber Eats, which also added its own $5 charge to each order. The companies also&#160;adjusted tip mechanisms. Some drivers and restaurant owners then complained about the lack of orders on&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/doordash-vows-to-remove-controversial-consumer-fee-in-seattle-if-new-minimum-wage-passes/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/doordash-vows-to-remove-controversial-consumer-fee-in-seattle-if-new-minimum-wage-passes", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "DoorDash vows to remove controversial consumer fee in Seattle if new minimum wage passes", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-05T21:43:59+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"842\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Walk-in-kaleidoscope-2-1260x842.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Another museum is coming to downtown Seattle with the hopes of attracting visitors with a mix of interactive rooms and displays.

The variables of light, positioning, gestures, facial expressions, etc., are endless. Even when you capture the right moment, it&#8217;s common to get back to the office, import the picture onto your computer, and discover that it&#8217;s not really in focus.

The startup&#8217;s focus is purely business correspondence, and it&#8217;s asynchronous video, meaning content that is not live streamed but rather recorded and shared for later viewing.
