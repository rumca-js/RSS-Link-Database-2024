It looks like Sony's recently revealed 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord will take a leaf out of Helldivers 2's wildly successful live-service playbook and launch with a relatively modest price tag of &pound;35.
</p><p>
Concord, the debut game from Sony's FireWalk Studios, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-pvp-shooter-concord-is-firewalk-studios-first-game">announced with only minimal detail</a> last May. More was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-concord-is-a-5v5-sci-fi-shooter-with-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vibes">revealed</a> during last week's PlayStation State of Play, however, when Concord was confirmed to be a 5v5 first-person shooter - seemingly one with a touch of Overwatch in its DNA - featuring 16 launch characters, along with various modes and maps.

UK high street chain GAME will no longer offer Xbox All Access to new subscribers beginning later this month, Eurogamer can confirm. 
</p><p>
Xbox All Access, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-all-access-the-best-way-to-buy-an-xbox-series-x-or-xbox-series-s">which lets you pay for an Xbox Series X or S console via 24 monthly installments</a>, is available through only a handful of partner retailers globally, and just three in the UK. 
</p><p>
GAME is by far the largest chain to have supported the subscription, but Eurogamer understands it is now dropping the offer as part of an ongoing series of changes as many of its high street stores are replaced by concessions in other Frasers Group chains, such as Sports Direct.

Players will be able to learn how to craft instruments from a new NPC, Valory of the Silverstrings. More instruments will be added further down the line.</p><p>In addition to this musical side of things, Melodies of the Mire also introduces a new area to Enshrouded: The Blackmire. This can be found in the north of the Revelwoods, with the developer stating things here are "a little bit bigger". This area holds a number of new quests, enemies, items and so forth for players to discover, as well as new floral pads which can be used as a kind of natural trampoline. You can

With that being said, there are key upgrades. In particular F1 24 brings entirely reworked tracks, with fan favourites like Silverstone and Circuit de Spa - and more - getting major overhauls compared to F1 23. Equally, the drivers get a facelift. All 20 official F1 drivers are re-scanned in to create a more up-to-date likeness, with improved hair rendering to boot. At its core, developer Codemasters continues to use its EGO engine here and who could blame them - it's a proven, dependable foundation, a technology that's served the team well. It's scalable. It's fully cross-gen, and on PC and newer consoles it's capable of ray tracing. Fundamentally the quest

Pokeverse - a Pok&eacute;mon convention partnered with the Make-a-Wish foundation and that featured the original voice of Ash Ketchum from the Pok&eacute;mon TV series - has been labelled as a disaster on a scale with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-someones-made-the-glasgow-willy-wonka-experience-in-fortnite">Glasgow's infamous Willy Wonka rip-off experience</a>.
</p><p>
Speaking to Eurogamer today, attendee BintuRina - whose social media posts describing her experience have since gone viral - said the event lacked proper planning and care for its young attendees.

Ahead of the convention, held in Mandaluyong, Manila last weekend, Pokeverse had been described by organisers as "the premier Pok&eacute;mon-themed expo in the Philippines made by fans for fans!" It was advertised to feature "trainer quests", "stellar headl

FromSoftware's Hidetaka Miyazaki has discussed the size of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree and the desire for players to experience the same sense of discovery as that of the base game.
</p><p>
Previously, Miyazaki described <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever">Shadow of the Erdtree to Eurogamer as the studio's "largest expansion" ever</a>: "In terms of pure surface area, you could think of something larger even than Limgrave in the base game," he said.

Destiny 2's climactic expansion The Final Shape is now available, bringing to a close 10 years of storytelling - but launch issues have meant many players missed key narrative moments.
</p><p>
A string of issues plagued last night's The Final Shape launch, which Bungie has now apologised for. These began with the game's usual traffic issues whenever a big update lands, but continued with further problems that saw players kicked out of the game mid-activity and mid-cutscenes. 
</p><p>
"I was wondering why the pacing felt so weird until I realised I had missed two entire cutscenes and had to look them up," one fan wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d8be3e/this_is_the_biggest_narrative_moment_in_destiny/">reddit</a>.

For example, Marauder Wallop has been removed from the game to be replaced with a staff upgrade known as Rapid Thrasher, which will allow for faster attacks.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2s-second-patch-is-here-bringing-plenty-of-daedalus-hammer-changes-with-it">Read more</a></p>

I think I could watch it forever. Head thrust forward, whole body pointed forward, hands in fists reaching and punching the air, punching what's coming. He's angled low, like a velociraptor, but he's as sleek and as streamlined as the red sash that billows heroically behind him. Something of a modern sports star in the leggings, with a stripe down the outside of the leg to show you which leg is which as he runs. I can only imagine the fabulous, super-light, super-expensive shoes he's wearing. Not available in the shops yet. A gift from the labs.</p><p>The Rogue Prince of Persia leaps into Early Access with a build that's as lithe, and as slim, as its protagonist. Everything works beautifully, but I guess I should note that there also isn't much here yet. What th
