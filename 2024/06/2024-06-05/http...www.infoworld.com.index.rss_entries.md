<p>Python’s rich ecosystem of data science tools is a big draw for users. The only downside of such a broad and deep collection is that sometimes the best tools can get overlooked.</p><p>Here’s a rundown of some of the best newer or lesser-known data science projects available for Python. Some, like Polars, are getting more attention than before but still deserve wider notice. Others, like ConnectorX, are hidden gems.</p><h2 class="toc">ConnectorX</h2>
<p>Most data sits in a database somewhere, but computation typically happens outside of a database.
