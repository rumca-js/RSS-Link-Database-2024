The company implemented the &#8220;regulatory response fee&#8221; for consumers in January after the city&#8217;s existing minimum wage law went into effect, saying it helped &#8220;cover the cost of these new regulations.&#8221; With the new fee in place, demand fell for DoorDash and Uber Eats, which also added its own $5 charge to each order. The companies also&#160;adjusted tip mechanisms. Some drivers and restaurant owners then complained about the lack of orders on&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/doordash-vows-to-remove-controversial-consumer-fee-in-seattle-if-new-minimum-wage-passes/">Read More</a>

The variables of light, positioning, gestures, facial expressions, etc., are endless. Even when you capture the right moment, it&#8217;s common to get back to the office, import the picture onto your computer, and discover that it&#8217;s not really in focus. At least, that was my experience when photographing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently with a DSLR and telephoto lens from my seat in the press section at Microsoft&#8217;s Build developer&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/how-a-photo-of-openais-sam-altman-enhanced-by-ai-sparked-a-journalistic-debate-at-geekwire/">Read More</a>

Cho, the former CEO of Evite, is leading a stealthy new Seattle startup that wants to do away with billions of written emails workers send every day and replace them with video messages. Emovid isn&#8217;t out to be the next Snap or any other app targeting consumers. And it&#8217;s not Zoom or Teams, facilitating video communication in real time. The startup&#8217;s focus is purely business correspondence, and it&#8217;s asynchronous video, meaning content that is not live streamed but rather recorded and shared for later viewing.
