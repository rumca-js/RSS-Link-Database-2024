<p><a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1798368111038779610">My Twitter thread figuring out the AI features in Microsoft&#x27;s Recall</a></p>
I posed this question on Twitter about why Microsoft Recall (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/1/stealing-everything-youve-ever-typed/">previously</a>) is being described as "AI":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it just that the OCR uses a machine learning model, or are there other AI components in the mix here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I learned that Recall works by taking full desktop screenshots and then applying both OCR and some sort of CLIP-style embeddings model to their content. Both the OCRd text and the vector embeddings are stored in SQLite databases (<a href="https://gist.github.com/dfeldman/5a5630d28b8336f403123c071cfdac9e">schema here</a>, thanks Daniel Feldman) which can then be used to search your past computer activity both by text but also by semantic vision terms - "blue dress" to find blue dresses in screenshots, for exam

<p><a href="https://www.andreinc.net/2024/04/24/from-the-circle-to-epicycles">An animated introduction to Fourier Series</a></p>
Outstanding essay and collection of animated explanations (created using p5.js) by Andrei Ciobanu explaining Fourier transforms, starting with circles, pi, radians and building up from there.</p>

<p>I found Fourier stuff only really clicked for me when it was accompanied by clear animated visuals, and these are a beautiful example of those done really well.
