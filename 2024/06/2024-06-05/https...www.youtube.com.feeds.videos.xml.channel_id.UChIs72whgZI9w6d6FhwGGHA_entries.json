It launched officially just this year with its new Panorama 3D liquid cooler lineup, first available only in China and now going worldwide. Tryx is comprised of former ASUS, Cooler Master, and Asetek employees (and is backed by Asetek itself). The company is also working on several new cases, like its \"LUCA\" and \"SPES\" cases, alongside a trippy \"Otavia\" paracord-ish case.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?

The company is following-up its King 95 debut with cases like the King 65 Pro, the King 95 Mega, the Sky 3 prototype, and more. We're excited to see how these do in our case benchmarking and in our 2024 Best Cases round-ups this year, because it seems like the fight is fierce for budget cases.\n\nWatch our Lian Li coverage for another high-performance budget case: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pARWmgnfcVU\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?

The Fractal Mood uses a single 180mm x 38mm Torrent case fan at the top of the chassis tower, leveraging two blocked-off sides and two open sides to guide air straight into the separated GPU and CPU compartments within the case. The Era 2 uses 2x 120mm bottom fans for intake. We have the price and release date for both the Mood and the Era 2 in this video. Both cases use a clever mechanical design that we think is well-executed, giving a \"unibody\" feel to the outer shell (but not technically) for easy interior access to components. Fractal also has its Scape headset and Refine chair, although we're not spending time covering them.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOXHGMQNiQ4", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA", "source_obj__id": 428, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/JOXHGMQNiQ4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Impressive Fractal Era 2 & Mood Mini Cases", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-05T03:56:05+00:00", "description": "Sponsor: DeepCool Assassin IV CPU Cooler on Amazon - https://geni.us/a0Zx\nMSI is showing off Z890 & X870E motherboards at #Computex 2024 -- and Intel is a control freak, trying to prevent anyone from knowing that its next socket is \"LGA18XX\" (it's 1851) - but even 18XX has been known for literal years now, and yet Intel thinks it can put that genie back in the bottle.
