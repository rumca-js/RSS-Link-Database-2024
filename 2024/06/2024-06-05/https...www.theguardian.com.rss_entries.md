Her Oscars for Boys Don’t Cry and Million Dollar Baby were 20 years ago but, although she’s worked fairly steadily since, you can award yourself a quiz point for naming more than two of her more recent roles, and a bonus if you can think of something that was a hit. Alaska Daily, a homely, heartfelt drama about a local newspaper with Swank as its Hollywood wildcard, was cancelled a year ago in the US after one season, so we already know it’s not the show to break the actor’s long run of bad luck.</p><p>At first we’re standing, awestruck, in the lavish offices of a New York news outlet.

<p><strong>O2 Arena, London<br /></strong>The Hollywood actor may not be the world’s greatest rock star, but his committed, fan-friendly performance has charm</p><p>The first sense that this might not be the busiest show in the O2 Arena’s history comes in the concourses: no one is having to queue at the bar before the show. Inside, the top tier is closed, and the arena floor is bizarre: a packed back third, of general admission, and a vast golden circle that is barely a third full. It looks awful, and visitors to the toilet during the show are accosted by arena staff trying to persuade them to take wristbands to go to the front. Thirty Seconds to Mars singer Jared Leto even appeals before the encore for people to go in search of wristbands to come and join the little throng at the front of the stage.</p><p>Still, Leto pulls out everything to entertain the people who are there, rather than fretting about the ones who aren’t. He pulls fans on stage and takes requests from the crowd – th

He joined the army as an ordinary soldier and trained all over the UK while his wife, a former teacher called Alice or “Loll” (short for Lollipop), remained in the north of England. There began a fascinating correspondence between the couple, recording Gerard’s commission in the South Wales Borderers (SWB), which led to his service on D-day on 6 June 1944, and Ali

<p>Based on a true story, this film presents hormone-disordered Rosalie, who has hair on her face and body, as a perky outsider in period dress</p><p>Here is an intriguing, if not wholly successful, attempt to create a hero for gender-fluid times and give them the full mainstream period-film trimmings. In fact, the first half of this account of 19th-century bride Rosalie (Nadia Tereszkiewicz), who has a hormone disorder that covers her body in hair, almost resembles The Devil Wears Prada or another of those perky comedy-dramas about a young outsider who refuses to be cowed in their aspirations.

<p>A psychiatrist’s fascinating quest to understand drugs and addiction – and to describe the indescribable</p><p>When reading a book, I like to understand something about the person who wrote it. The&nbsp;Captive Imagination is rich in words yet strangely elusive in overall meaning, and feels as though it has been written by several different people, at times interrupting each other. So who are these characters? Elias Dakwar is a professor and scientist in the US, but he is also a clinician specialising in the treatment of addiction, a philosopher, a lover of literature and language, as well as a human being striving to understand life’s great mysteries. There is a sense of yearning throughout the book, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it is a quest to find something; Dakwar invokes the fictional strivings of Don Quixote and compares them with the obvious desperation of the heroin addict. But he also notes that his patients often say: “I just want to be happy”, and perhaps this is what he, too, is sa

<p>I had felt self-conscious for so long, but then I held my breath and put my head underwater. It was the start of a slow, determined journey back to my own body<br /></p><p>It was a September afternoon in 2016 when I got on a bike and cycled to the sea. The Pembrokeshire coast was in full Technicolor that day, glowing with the sunlight reflected back from its sandy seabed. The air was thick and warm, and by the time my dad and I had reached the cove, my clothes were damp and itchy on my skin.</p><p>I was 19, and about to enter my second year of university. I had been through a hellish time at secondary school. I had tumbled hard and heavy into my first real relationship – and out of it again. And I was on the brink, I think, of finally starting to know myself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jun/05/a-moment-that-changed-me-after-seven-years-of-hiding-my-skin-i-washed-my-makeup-away-in-the-sea">Continue reading...</a>

Nine years ago, the Taiwanese engineer was at a restaurant with his family when his mother-in-law started picking the green onions out of her food. Asked what she was doing, she explained that onions can harm your liver. She knew this, she said, because she had received text messages telling her so.</p><p>Yeh was puzzled by this. His family had always happily eaten green onions. So he decided to set the record straight.<br /><br />
 He put the truth in a blog post and circulated it among family and friends through the messaging app Line. They shared it more broadly, and soon he received requests from strangers asking to be connected to his personal Line account.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/05/from-beef-noodles-to-bots-taiwans-factch
