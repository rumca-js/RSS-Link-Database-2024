The new CPUs use a radical new architecture and show impressive generational gains, which is something Intel needs as competition heats up from AMD and Qualcomm. To dive deep into the new designs, PCWorld&rsquo;s Mark Hachman went straight to the source. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark interviews Intel&rsquo;s Dan Rogers (Vice President and General Manager) and Robert Hallock (Vice President and General Manager, Client AI and Technical Marketing) on the big changes for these chips, designed specifically to maximize power and efficiency for thin-and-light laptops. The interview covers a lot of ground, so watch the full thing on YouTube if you have the time. </p>\n\n\n\n<figur", "language": null, "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2357624/interview-lunar-lake-deep-dive-with-intel.html", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.pcworld.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 246, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Intel delves into Lunar Lake: \u2018We don\u2019t believe you need to compromise\u2019", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-05T13:50:23+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Several years ago, I got to play with the Acer ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Editon laptop, a revolutionary device that allowed me to view 3D imagery without the need for 3D glasses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As impressed as I was at the time with it, though, its practical application seemed a bit limited by the content available.
