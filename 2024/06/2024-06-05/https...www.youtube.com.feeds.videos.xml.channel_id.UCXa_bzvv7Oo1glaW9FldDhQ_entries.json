As the single expansion DLC for Elden Ring, we have high hopes for its setting, gameplay, and massive new zone. Elden Ring had some of the most outlandish enemy designs seen in a game, and what we\u2019ve seen of Shadow of the Erdtree\u2019s trailers, they are looking crazier than ever.\u00a0\n\nThe weapons and abilities from the first gameplay trailer also looked amazing, with a Bone Fist type martial arts moveset that look like a riot to pull off. Miquella and Marika play a heavy role in the DLC, so it\u2019ll be great to see more backstory for them. The main antagonist might be one of the most challenging boss fights; I mean, Messmer has a serpent, casts flames, and wields a spear as long as a semi-truck. It\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re hyped for Shadow of the Erdtree.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMtos_N8xlk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/GMtos_N8xlk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree  - 15 Things I CAN'T WAIT To Do", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
