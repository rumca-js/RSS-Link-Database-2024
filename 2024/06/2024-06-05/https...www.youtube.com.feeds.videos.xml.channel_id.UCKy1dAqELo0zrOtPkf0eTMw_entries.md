Star Wars: The Acolyte Episodes 1-4 reviewed by Eric Goldman. Narrated by Erik Adams.

Setting its story in a longer, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away allows The Acolyte to feel fresh and different from other recent live-action Star Wars series, with an intriguing storyline that seems to be setting the stage for the return of the Sith we know is coming. However, outside of its exciting Jedi fight scenes its execution sometimes feels off, with frequent cheesy moments and a lack of visual flair that contributes to the ongoing concern that all these Star Wars streaming series have diminished the epic nature of the franchise and what makes it special. Taken on its own terms, The Acolyte does offer some enjoyable character dynamics and an enticing mystery, but its first four episodes fail to coalesce into something that truly shines. But look, it does have a wookiee Jedi, and that’s always a plus.

Bad Boys Ride or Die, reviewed by Eric Goldman.

Following the franchise refresh of Bad Boys For Life, Ride or Die delivers the Bad Boys version of Fast Five: a sequel that takes the best parts of the earlier films in a long-running franchise and builds and expands upon them in a big way. Bad Boys: Ride or Die provides a much more entertaining package than what came before, with thrilling and inventive action direction from Adil & Bilall. Yes, it’s as over the top and silly as ever, but it’s done with more panache and genuine wit than before, proving these Bad Boys, even at their older age, can still deliver.

Description: GTA: San Andreas had a lot to offer gamers, and everything it provided in gameplay was further along given the time. Rockstar Games really put a lot of effort into Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, so we decided to reminisce a bit and discuss it in detail. From Bully to Red Dead Redemption 2, there’s so many features in Rockstar’s back catalog of video games that could be pilfered from in order to make GTA 6 the best it can possibly be. If you’re a fan of #RockstarGames, chances are you’ve played more than just its GTA offerings - and as such, you might’ve noticed stark differences in its other titles. Manhunt, for instance, focuses on stealth kills and survival. Would love to see that in GTA 6! That franchise was essentially GTA minus the grand theft of automobiles, with focus being more on surviving and creatively killing your opponents without being discovered. It had a real grindhouse horror feel to it, with some of the most brutal kills seen in video games at the time. S
