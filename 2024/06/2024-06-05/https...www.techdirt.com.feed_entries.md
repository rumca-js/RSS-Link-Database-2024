In April 2023, TikTok user ghostwriter977 released “Heart on My Sleeve,” featuring AI-generated vocals [&#8230;]

For years, this wasn&#8217;t necessarily a problem. The stuff discarded ranged from bags containing &#8220;substances&#8221; to wallets to the occasional backpack. The intrusion [&#8230;]

While I don’t think that’s a reason to criticize the [&#8230;]

But sometimes, it’s still shocking when people who should definitely know better brazenly parade their cluelessness. Enter Jerry Nadler, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and a man who has been [&#8230;]

The Wild West we all imagine contains two forms of law: the brave people who&#8217;ve decided to be sheriffs.
