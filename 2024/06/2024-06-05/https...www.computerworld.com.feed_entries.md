<p>With support for Windows 10 ending in just over a year, Microsoft is nudging users to update to Windows 11, as many still appear to be in no hurry to make the switch.</p>



<p>Windows 10 has more than 68% share among Windows users worldwide as of May 2024, according to Stat Counter. However, Microsoft has said it will no longer provide <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-of-support" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">technical support or updates for Windows 10</a> after Oct. 14, 2025, a decade after its launch.</p>

<p>The buoyant Apple-in-the-enterprise space is fascinating to watch as it grows and evolves, in part because not so many years ago it didn’t really exist. Now that it does, this part of the device management and services industry is remarkable in that vendors are working hard to diversify what they provide.</p>

<p>Intel is aiming its next-generation X86 processors at artificial intelligence (AI) tasks, even though the chips won’t actually run AI workloads themselves.</p>



<p>At Computex this week, Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/computex-2024-ai-everywhere-power-performance-affordability.html#gs.ad4fah" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">announced its Xeon 6 processor line</a>, talking up what it calls Efficient-cores (E-cores) that it said will deliver up to 4.2 times the performance of Xeon 5 processors.

<p>Goodness, this is an unseasonably chilly June morning. Maybe that’s because the metaphorical sensation of hell freezing over is quietly lingering in this damp virtual air we share.</p>



<p>All right — I’ll stop waxing poetic and get to it: For years now, the common narrative in the tech universe has been that Apple’s iPhones lead the way when it comes to longevity and the knowledge that the device you’re buying will continue to receive current software updates for many, many months to come.</p>



<p>Also for years now, we’ve talked about how <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1615334/android-upgrade-advantage.html">that narrative is actually rather misleading</a> — because compari

<p>The battle royale for the future of workplace culture continues as companies and employees square off over the right to work at home and the return to office (RTO) movement.</p>



<p>A sizable list of <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1611819/will-employees-bow-down-to-stricter-rto-policies.html">companies elected to order employees back to the office</a> earlier this year. Many directed workers to return to three, four, or five days a week. </p>



<p>How’s that turned out so far? Not so well.</p>



<p>Companies that think they’ve won the battle by issuing strict return-to-office (RTO) mandates could lose the larger war. RTO mandates are causing <a href="https://www.computerworld

<p>Contemporary as that concept may seem, it’s the <em>same </em>vision <em>Google</em> once offered on Windows PCs — with Google Desktop 20 years ago. The first release of Google Chrome for Windows PCs, launched in 2008, included a similar, now long-forgotten feature.</p>
