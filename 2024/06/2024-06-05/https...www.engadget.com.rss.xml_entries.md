<p>If the wave of overwhelmingly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-humane-ai-pin-is-the-solution-to-none-of-technologys-problems-120002469.html">negative reviews</a> weren’t enough, it seems that Humane has discovered yet another major issue with its once-hyped AI Pin. The company is warning customers not to use the device’s charging case due to a potential “fire safety risk.”</p>
<p>In an email sent to AI Pin owners, the company said it had received a report of a “charging issue” that led to “a quality issue with the battery cell supplied by a third-party vendor used in your Charge Case Accessory.” Humane didn’t explicitly indicate whether the unspecified “charging issue” caused an actual fire, but it said an investigation found that “certain battery cells supplied by this vendor may pose a fire safety risk.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Humane is so far not using the word “recall,” the company is advising people to stop using the charging case immediately.

<p>Panasonic just announced the followup to its popular Lumix GH6 vlogging camera, the GH7. This Micro Four Thirds mirrorless camera comes just two years after the release of the GH6, which is pretty quick in the videography world. The GH5 was released five full years <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh-6-review-video-a-vlogging-workhorse-153048534-153048948.html">before the GH6</a>.</p>
<p>The 25.2-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor is likely the same as the one on the photo-centric <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-g9-ii-review-its-best-micro-four-thirds-camera-to-date-120020562.html">Lumix LG9 II </a>announced earlier this year. It also offers improved autofocus performance, which has been a much-requested feature, thanks to phase detection auto-focus (PDAF). There’s also a newly added real-time auto-focus recognition algorithm for use on airplanes and trains.</p>

Things are well underway with the second season, and we've known for a while that it won't premiere until 2025. We still don't know exactly when to expect it (though given that they're well into shooting, an early-year debut isn't out of the question), but we do now know that season two will only have seven episodes.</p>

<p>YouTube quietly snuck in a policy change that will age-restrict some gun-related videos and bar others altogether. Content featuring homemade and automatic firearms will be banned for viewers under 18, while tutorials for removing safety devices will be prohibited regardless of age. The new policy will take effect on June 18.</p>
<p>“Starting June 18, 2024, certain content showing how to remove safety devices will be prohibited,” a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7667605?hl=en">disclaimer</a> on YouTube’s firearms policy page now reads. “Content showing the use of homemade firearms, automatic firearms, and certain firearm accessories will be age restricted.”</p>

<p>The Bitzee virtual pet line is expanding to bring some familiar characters into the family, plus some all new ones. Spin Master, which introduced Bitzee to the US last summer, is now gearing up to release two new versions of the device later this year: Bitzee Disney and Bitzee Magicals. The former will feature 30 characters from the Disney/Pixar universe, including Stitch, Olaf, Nemo and Dory, Remy, Mike Wazowski and Sully, and Heihei.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike most digital pet toys, Bitzee doesn’t have a screen. Instead, it functions almost like a pettable hologram in a box, with movement-based controls and a flapping flexible display that allows the player to physically interact with the character. You can run your finger along the top of the display to pet the creature that’s being projected, for example, or rock the little box from side to side to put it to bed. There's also a small swipe bar that serves as a way to navigate the menu of activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ferras Hamad, who used to be an engineer working with Meta's machine learning team, has accused the company of firing him over his handling of Palestine-related Instagram posts in a lawsuit. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/former-meta-engineer-sues-company-saying-he-was-fired-over-handling-gaza-content-2024-06-05/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, he is accusing the company of discrimination, wrongful termination and showing a pattern of bias against Palestinians. Hamad said he noted procedural irregularities on how the company handled restrictions on content from Palestinian Instagram personalities, which prevented them from appearing in feeds and searches. One particular case that involved a short video showing a destroyed building in Gaza seemingly led to his dismissal in February.&nbsp;</p>
