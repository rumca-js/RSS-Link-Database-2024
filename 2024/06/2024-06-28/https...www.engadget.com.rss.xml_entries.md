<p>FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-403529A1.pdf"><ins>has drafted a series of letters</ins></a> to nine major telecom companies, including AT&amp;T and Comcast, to ask if they’re actually doing anything about AI political robocalls. AI-generated voices are getting pretty good at mimicking humans and we’ve already seen this technology in action, when an audio deepfake urged voters to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/phony-ai-biden-robocalls-reached-up-to-25000-voters-says-new-hampshire-ag-205253966.html"><ins>skip the New Hampshire Democratic primary</ins></a>.</p>
<p>“We know that AI technologies will make it cheap and easy to flood our networks with deepfakes used to mislead and betray trust. It is especially chilling to see AI voice cloning used to impersonate candidates during elections. As AI tools become more accessible to bad actors and scammers, we need to do everything we can to keep this junk off our networks,” wrote Ro

<p>There are plenty of Lego sets that feature astronauts, but now there are Lego bricks made out of the stuff that astronauts find out there in the void. The Danish brickmaker <a href="https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Branding_and_Partnerships/The_space_bricks_have_landed"><ins>has teamed up with the European Space Agency</ins></a> (ESA) to make Lego pieces from actual meteorite dust.

<p>It's safe to say <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple/"><ins>Apple</ins></a> and the European Commission aren't exactly bosom buddies. The two sides have been at loggerheads over Apple's compliance — or alleged lack thereof — with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), a law designed to rein in the power of major tech companies.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-may-face-a-mammoth-fine-after-the-eu-said-it-violated-competition-rules-120019892.html"><ins>said last week</ins></a> it would delay the rollout of certain features in the European Union, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-will-reportedly-withhold-new-ai-features-in-europe-due-to-regulations-183313640.html"><ins>Apple Intelligence</ins></a> AI tools, over concerns &quot;that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security.&quot; As it turns out, the EU is not exactly happ

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-aws-stops-accepting-new-customers-russia-belarus-230051139.html">Amazon Web Services</a> has started an investigation to determine whether Perplexity AI is breaking its rules, according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/aws-perplexity-bot-scraping-investigation/"><em>Wired</em></a>. To, be precise, the company's cloud division is looking into allegations that the service is using a crawler, which is hosted on its servers, that ignores the Robots Exclusion Protocol. This protocol is a web standard, wherein developers put a robots.txt file on a domain containing instructions on whether bots can or can't access a particular page. Complying with those instructions is voluntary, but crawlers from reputable companies have generally been respecting them since web developers started implementing the standard in the '90s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Motorola is still trying to reclaim the glory of its original Razr phone with its latest foldables. The new Razr and Razr+ are more stylish than the previous models, and at $700 and $1,000 respectively, they're surprisingly affordable for devices with massive folding OLED screens. In other news, we chat about Wikileaks' founder Julian Assange being freed from prison, Rabbit's massive security hole in the R1 AI gadget, and a horrific Sora AI commercial from Toys "R" Us.</p>

## The Morning After: What to expect at Samsung’s Unpacked 2024 event

<p>Samsung's latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unpacked-2024-galaxy-z-fold-6-watch-ultra-galaxy-ring-and-everything-else-to-expect-143014932.html">Unpacked event will kick off on July 10th</a>. The company has already released its latest flagship phones this year, unveiling the S24 family. But now it’s time for its spinoff smartphones: the foldables. That and the long-teased Galaxy Ring. The tiny wearable is slated to arrive “in or around August,” so it would be more of a surprise if the device didn’t appear at Unpacked. The ring will measure heart rate, movement and breathing to help track your sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m expecting the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 to appear, although with minor tweaks that might not warrant an upgrade from last year’s foldables. That said, rumors suggest that Samsung might use the same 50MP camera as the Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S24 in the Flip 6, which has traditionally had less-powerful cameras than the other Samsung flagships.

<p>Older Assassin's Creed titles are about to get modern reimaginings, mostly likely with better graphics and other improvements for newer consoles and more powerful PCs. Yves Guillemot, the CEO of Ubisoft, has revealed in an <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed">interview on the company's website</a> that Assassin's Creed remakes are in the works when he was asked what's next for the franchise. The remakes will allow the company to revisit and modernize older worlds it has created, he explained, telling the interviewer that &quot;there are worlds in some of [its] older Assassin's Creed games that are still extremely rich.&quot;</p>
<p>Guillemot also said that Ubisoft's goal is to have Assassin's Creed games come out more regularly, &quot;but not for it to be the same experience every year.&quot; The upcoming <em>Assassin's Creed Hexe</em> that's set during the witch trials

It turns out that ChatGPT does not.
