Elden Ring is tough and its DLC Shadow of the Erdtree is even tougher, but what makes it so challenging? Outside of the main bosses and traversal, which enemies are stopping us in our tracks? I've compiled a list of the most difficult (and annoying) enemies to deal with! On their own, they may not be so bad but when you have a group of them, the difficulty takes it up a notch. A lot of patience will be needed in dealing with these enemies but get through them and you are on your way to mastering the DLC!
