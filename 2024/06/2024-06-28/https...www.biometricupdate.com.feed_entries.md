		The Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) has completed the upgrade to its state fingerprint database, replacing the outdated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) with the new Automatic Biometric Identification System (ABIS). In 2021, the state entered into a primary contract with <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia">Idemia</a> as the biometric solution provider.

In the <a href="https://admin.ks.gov/media/cms/KCJIS_Newsletter_May_2024_6c7f3e9b8b662.pdf">KCJIS Newsletter</a> for May 2024, the State of Kansas says that ABIS will eventually include face and iris recognition in addition to fingerprints, palm prints, and latent prints.

“The upgrade to ABIS will aid the criminal justice community in countless ways. This new technology makes the proc

		From schools and streets to and public companies and parks, Serbia has been building up its CCTV surveillance system, reaching 8,000 cameras. While the Balkan country has not yet legalized biometric surveillance, civil society organizations are warning that digital surveillance is growing – and the European Union’s AI Act may not be enough to prevent it, according to a new report by the <a href="https://birn.eu.com/">Balkan Investigative Reporting Network</a> (BIRN) Serbia.

The report details the development of surveillance technologies in the country amid a decline in democratic standards recorded by international organizations.

Serbia has attempted to legalize biometric surveillance with a draft Law on Internal Affairs. While the draft was quashed under public pre

		Police across the U.S. are putting eyes in the sky, as the adoption of drones for law enforcement emerges as a trend. Forces deploying drones – also called Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) – for surveillance and public safety have promised not to use the flying robots for discriminatory policing.

So far the notion of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/controversy-sticks-to-the-use-of-facial-recognition-by-us-police">facial recognition</a> drones remains speculative. But the number of police departments adding drones to their technology arsenal – happening in parallel with a surge in AI-assisted fraud and the development of powerful facial recognition algorithms – makes the prospect of mobile biometric surveillance a pla

		Symisc Systems subsidiary <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/pixlab">PixLab</a> has launched a digital know your customer platform for developers to build ID document scans and selfie biometrics into enterprise and consumer-facing applications.

The platform is a spin-off of PixLab’s original platform, the company’s Community Manager Vincent Garnier told <em>Biometric Update</em> in an email. The main reason for the spinoff is the volume of API calls the platform handles each month, numbering several million, he says. That scalable architecture makes it suitable for enterprises and large organizations, PixLab says.
