<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Tldr from previous post: I made an server that can call programs in Unix (including shell scripts) and make them be called on the web with http.</p> <p>I went through an more complex path to ensure the lambdas themselves are really simple, at the cost of making the server and client more complex. This allows bidirectional async communication with WebSockets, single direction streaming with EventSources, and standard http get and post methods. This API can then either be used to build an ui with ruby, the server that serves the API and manages auth, or consumed on your own apis. Think of accessing the repl for some application, or getting the current system stats. With an simple bash script and a line in the yaml file you have built an API for Unix management.</p> <p>I am optimizing the way of writing lambdas for simplicity (a bash script can become a lambda by skipping the first three arguments and changing the exit code), and I am optimizing the serv

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a pretty neat setup of few self hosted apps that I use on a daily basis and everything works. Some of them are on docker containers and some are directly installed into the debian os. I have pretty much figured out how to get things going when a docker container fails and i have to spin it back up. But the apps installed into the OS(this is because i started selfhosting as a noob and installed into the os before i got to know about docker containers and it worked so i left it as such), how do i backup the configs and apps as such? Ideally i would like to backup the full os and for emergency purposes just restore it if anything goes wrong. I have no idea where to start or what tools to use, and i would like to do it without disturbing the setup(i.e not boot into a recovery to backup). Any help is appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/karthick892"> /u/karthick892 </a> <br /> <span><a
