After a long (and in my case, slightly impatient) wait, Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse - the third and regrettably final season of Telltale Games' episodic point-and-click adventure series - will be getting the remaster treatment on 14th August this year.
</p><p>
Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse originally released back in 2010, wrapping up Telltales' Sam &amp; Max adventures in style, following the release of 2006's Sam &amp; Max: Save the World and 2007's Sam &amp; Max: Beyond Time and Space.
</p><p>
For their third and final Telltale outing, the irrepressible crime-fighting dog and bunny duo - originally created by cult comic book artist Steve Purcell - faced down Eldritch gods, alien warlords, and more in a battle to control an ancient, otherworldly power.

It's funny to think about names. If circumstances were just a tiny bit different, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkUVRGCidjE">Chuck Spadina</a> could have been up on stage winning over E3 by telling it how breathtaking it is; we might have all have been round the arcade <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-could-have-been-called-kong-dong-nintendo-court-documents-state">giggling at a Kong Dong cabinet</a>; or perhaps sitting down over breakfast for a quick game of Mr Bugs Wordys Nugz.

That's the unlikely title developer Josh Wardle once considered for his daily word game phenomenon Wordle before settling on the one that's since become a household name. "Had I called the game Mr. Bugs," Wardle admitted to an audience at the recent <a href="https://config.figma.com/agenda/session?session_id=d418949a2beb&amp;lang=en

The developer of Concord, Sony's upcoming PlayStation 5 and PC hero shooter, has discussed how it will handle the game's monetisation - and why the game requires a PSN account log-in on PC. 
</p><p>
Speaking to Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell earlier this month, Concord developer Firewalk explained the game's relatively cheap &pound;35/$40 price point, and said it was a fair proposition for the amount of content the title contained. 
</p><p>
"When you buy the game, you get... the 16 characters, 12 maps, six modes," Firewalk's director of IP Kim Kreines said. "Every season, all that seasonal content, that's all free.

Hey everyone. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/do-you-have-any-questions-for-inside-eurogamer">mentioned earlier in the week</a>, our lovely features editor Christian Donlan is soon to be Eurogamer features editor no more. He's leaving that role - but his words will still be staying on the site. 
</p><p>
From Monday, Christian - or just "Donlan" to all of us - will move to a freelance writing position, with regular articles for Eurogamer most weeks. He'll also have a new title, of Contributing Editor. 
</p><p>
The move has been in the planning for a while (so is nothing to do with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-has-a-new-parent-company">more recent changes</a>) and is entirely to make sure Donlan has more time in his life for other things,

I felt it using the delectable Grappleshot in Halo Infinite for the first time; when floating through a trippy music video-like sequence in Control; and when fighting the beautifully horrific Hyperion boss to ethereal organ tunes in Returnal. Perfectly preserved memories I reach for when I need a reminder on how good games can be. Imagine my surprise then when that giddy mood resurfaced during a hands-on preview for Zenless Zone Zero, Genshin Impact developer miHoYo's upcoming release. Something I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-would-be-brilliant-if-it-didnt-keep-wasting-your-time">already previewed during its second beta</a> - and had a lot of issues with at the time.</p><p>It was the Twin Marionettes that did it.

The reason for this apology? Because they are "getting fed false hope and poor information by people looking for likes".</p><p>In a post on social media platform X, Kevin McAllister said this kind of behaviour is "not fair" to fans of Days Gone, who are eager to hear more news about more games in the series. This is something that is not on the cards.</p><p>While McAllister did not name any names in his post, earlier this week former studio director <a href="https://x.com/John_Garvin/status/1805083382327718080">John Garvin</a> said he had written Days Gone with a cliffhanger "with the full intention of there being a trilogy (NOT just a sequel)".

Some big changes are coming to FM25. Last year, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-football-manager">an exclusive interview with Eurogamer on the future of Football Manager</a>, Sports Interactive gaffer Miles Jacobson described those big changes, particularly those coming to the game's UI, as "the most dangerou changes you can make - because people who have muscle memory of knowing exactly where to go won't have that anymore"
</p><p>
With a game like FM, where the UI effectively is the game, he's not exaggerating. Now, we've had a first look at what some of those changes are, and it seems clear the studio is getting the negatives out of the way first. The first <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25">FM blog</a> on FM25 lists a range of features that will be left out of th

Does doing every distinct, individual part of a game as well as it can be done lead to a good game in itself? We're a step away from "what makes a good game?" here, a mountain-sized can of worms. A worm volcano. Not going near that one - but Concord does make me wonder.</p><p>A 5v5 hero shooter that is online and multiplayer-only, Concord's initial reveal was awkward. Its true nature became apparent only after a lengthy, lavish Guardians of the Galaxy-style narrative cinematic, that had all these interesting new characters galloping about an interesting new universe. People saw that, and saw Sony, and then saw what it actually was. Enter discussion of live service burnout and bait-and-switch marketing and quite astonishingly final dismissals of it, befor
