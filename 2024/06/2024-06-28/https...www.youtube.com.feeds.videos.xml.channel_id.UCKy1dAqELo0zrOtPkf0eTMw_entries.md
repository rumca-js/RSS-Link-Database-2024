In a new teaser for Deadpool and Wolverine, Sabretooth makes his return to take on Logan. In the trailer, we see Wolverine ready to take on his rival, while Deadpool does his best to cheer him on. #Deadpool3 is shaping up to have quite a few cameos. Actor Tyler Mane is reprising his role here as Sabretooth, one of the first mutants we saw in the 2000 X-Men movie and the first to fight Wolverine. Of course, this isn’t the first movie to feature Deadpool, Wolverine, and Sabretooth - all three characters appeared in X-Men: Origins - Wolverine… that’s the one where they decided to take Deadpool, the chattiest guy in Marvel Comics, and sew his mouth shut. There’s guaranteed to be more familiar faces for all those True Believers out there when Deadpool and Wolverine hits theaters July 26th. #DeadpoolAndWolverine
