This is one of the stupidest things ever in terms of public records lawsuits. And that&#8217;s saying a lot, considering how often this site has covered public records lawsuits. This traces back to April of last year. Ben Camacho, a Los Angeles journalist who contributes to sites like Knock LA, sent out a records request [&#8230;]

Of course, as we’ve detailed repeatedly, the actual research on this does [&#8230;]

You might recall that Elon Musk claims to&#160;hate taxpayer subsidies. They should all be “deleted.” Except for the subsidies given to his companies (sometimes for doing nothing), of course.
