For hundreds of years, the clarity and magnification of microscopes were ultimately limited by the physical properties of their optical lenses. Microscope makers pushed those boundaries by making increasingly complicated and expensive stacks of lens elements. Still, scientists had to decide between high resolution and a small field of view on the one hand or low resolution and a large field of view on the other.

Land surface temperature (LST) is the key variable in land–atmosphere interaction, having an important impact on weather and climate forecasting. Although there have been advances in data assimilation within land-atmosphere coupled models, weakly coupled assimilation remains predominant. This means that the cross-component interactions between land and atmosphere are not adequately considered during the assimilation process, making it difficult to achieve consistent analysis between the land and atmospheric variables.

When a particle beam hits a target in an isotope production facility, it generates heat that is removed by water channels. The transfer of heat between the target and the flowing water produces subcooled flow boiling. This is a situation where evaporation and condensation occur simultaneously. Without sufficient cooling, temperatures can reach a critical point, melting and destroying the target.
