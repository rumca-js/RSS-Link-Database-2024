Sorry if anyone else asked this already, I always meet only dead end with this topic. I am searching a way, where on an android phone i can emulate amiga software with the screen on the upper half of the phone screen, and on the bottom half i can have a full amiga keyboard. I tried retroarch, since it has onscreen keyboard, but it never worked. The other method i tried is to use the Hackers keyboard app, but this also not working and there is no function keys. Is there any already made app or workaround for this issue?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ch1llbl4ck\"> /u/ch1llbl4ck </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dqjhua/emulator_with_onscreen_keyboard/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dqjhua/emulator_with_onscreen_keyboard/\">[comments]</a></", "id": 784187, "language": null, "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dqjhua/emulator_with_onscreen_keyboard", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 85, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/.rss", "source_obj__id": 458, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Emulator with onscreen keyboard", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-28T05:34:39+00:00", "description": "<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dqc7xw/ep43_unboxing_playing_first_samurai_amiga_game/\"> <img alt=\"Ep.43 Unboxing &amp; playing First Samurai Amiga game [\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac]\" src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/7KzTJKdej9i9VNJ7xkS3Uo8QE4-EQEqfxr2zAFz0H-g.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e26c19e24c579c395e868b9f61a182fb7f7021c2\" title=\"Ep.43 Unboxing &amp; playing First Samurai Amiga game [\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac]\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>First Samurai, alternatively titled The First Samurai, is a 1991 beat 'em up platform game developed by Vivid Image and published by Image Works.
