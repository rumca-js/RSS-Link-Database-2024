A function that has at least one syntactically valid combination of state and input for which the behavior is undefined has a precondition and is therefore said to have a narrow contract. The Lakos Rule effectively prohibits placing the `noexcept` specifier (introduced in C++11) on any function that would otherwise have a narrow contract.\n\nThis talk begins with a reprise of contracts, essential behavior, and preconditions. We\u2019ll then go on to contrast two classic software design principles, Design by Contract and Liskov Substitutability, and then use the latter to explain how both backward compatibility and wide implementations benefit from scrupulously adhering to The Lakos Rule.
