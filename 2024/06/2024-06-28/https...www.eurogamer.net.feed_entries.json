Does doing every distinct, individual part of a game as well as it can be done lead to a good game in itself? We're a step away from \"what makes a good game?\" here, a mountain-sized can of worms. A worm volcano. Not going near that one - but Concord does make me wonder.</p><p>A 5v5 hero shooter that is online and multiplayer-only, Concord's initial reveal was awkward. Its true nature became apparent only after a lengthy, lavish Guardians of the Galaxy-style narrative cinematic, that had all these interesting new characters galloping about an interesting new universe.
