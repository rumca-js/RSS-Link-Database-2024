The boys played on the boys' team and the girls played on the girls' team. Somewhere down the line, liberals decided that fighting the patriarchy was no longer much of a concern and thus, women's rights are a thing of the past. But not everyone is insane, including Nassau County. </p><p>There used to be no reason to ban males from female sports because that was never a thing. But one day, failing male athletes started stealing titles
