<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi People of Amiga!</p> <p>I have a question about emulation. Sorry if anyone else asked this already, I always meet only dead end with this topic. I am searching a way, where on an android phone i can emulate amiga software with the screen on the upper half of the phone screen, and on the bottom half i can have a full amiga keyboard. I tried retroarch, since it has onscreen keyboard, but it never worked. The other method i tried is to use the Hackers keyboard app, but this also not working and there is no function keys. Is there any already made app or workaround for this issue?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ch1llbl4ck"> /u/ch1llbl4ck </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dqjhua/emulator_with_onscreen_keyboard/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dqjhua/emulator_with_onscreen_keyboard/">[comments]</a></
