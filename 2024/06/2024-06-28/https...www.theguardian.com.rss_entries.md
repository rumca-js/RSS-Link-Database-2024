## Could Cole Palmer’s off-the-cuff talent prove to be the answer for England?

<p>After a fine debut season with Chelsea the winger is unfazed by his late miss on his tournament debut against Slovenia</p><p>By the time our 20 minutes with Cole Palmer are up, the England winger has managed to rave about Riyad Mahrez’s first touch, reveal that Austria have been one of his favourite teams at Euro 2024, claim Londoners are way moodier than northerners, talk about getting on for 20 minutes against Slovenia, praise Mauricio Pochettino’s time at Chelsea, elaborate on his relationship with Enzo Maresca and, most importantly of all, correct erroneous reports that he has an obsession with baked beans.</p><p>The answers are short, sweet and often pretty illuminating. Palmer does not skip a beat before revealing that his first position was left-back. It was a throwaway comment, but he suddenly looks horrified. He glances at the press officer sitting to his left and wonders if he has put his foot in it. Is Gareth Southgate about to stumble upon the answer to England’s proble

<p>Winger is strong believer in mental preparation and will not let bike accident affect him if picked against Slovakia</p><p>There is, frankly, only one place to start with Anthony Gordon and it is not only because he is handed a pair of stabilisers as a present when he walks in to address the media – a reference to his much talked-about and laughed-about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/27/anthony-gordon-injures-chin-and-hands-falling-off-bike-england-euro-2024">bike crash on Wednesday</a> during England’s recovery day.</p><p>It is hard to ignore the cuts and grazes, especially the deep red one in the middle of his chin. There are some on the Newcastle winger’s nose and arms, while they are also all over his hands. When somebody goes to shake with him, he pulls away defensively, which does not suggest he is battle-ready for Sunday’s last-16 tie against Slovakia. It turns out to be wrong. He says he is completely fine. So what happened?</p> <a href="http

<p>England lost to the tournament’s best team in the semi-final and India’s display makes them favourites to win the trophy</p><p>A washout in Guyana on Thursday, for the semi-final between England and India, would have been disastrous for this T20 World Cup. It really isn’t ideal that one semi-final, played between South Africa and Afghanistan, had a reserve day and the other didn’t. The ruling that the side that topped their Super Eight group advanced to the final in case of an abandonment is also unconvincing. It must also seem strange to people that India knew before the tournament where their semi-final would be held if they got that far. I’m just glad the match got played.</p><p>The conditions on offer were probably the most difficult this England side could have faced. The pitch didn’t suit their natural style of cricket and was more like one you would find in India as opposed to England. Given that India got a score that was 15, possibly 20, runs above par, England were right

John Stones overhits a relatively straightforward crossfield pass to Kieran Trippier.

But this quickly became one of those games where you start wondering if you floss enough, or if your pension is invested ethically.

He remains the only player in the Open era to win two singles gold medals, which is more than Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer combined.</p><p>During his press conference that day, Murray was asked about his success in the Olympics and what his medals have meant to his career.

<p>A gloriously vibrant gramiller should be just the ticket for when you’re cooking over coals, though when it comes to rosé, darker, stronger styles work best</p><p>One of the things that pops up like clockwork every summer is the focus on barbecues as we approach the Fourth of July. I don’t get it myself. How many of you host a flag-waving all-American barbecue with a stars and stripes cake? Any self-respecting griller has been at it since April, at least – well, maybe not this sodden spring, but on the odd occasion the rains have let up – and will carry on doing so well into the autumn.</p><p>As those of you who are enthusiasts will know, cooking over coals lends itself to all sorts of flavours and techniques, far beyond burgers and bangers. It might be a fishy feast with prawns, squid and scallops. It might be cauliflower steaks with a spicy dressing and all manner of grilled veg. It might be Middle Eastern, it might be Thai …</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https:

<p>Amitabh Bachchan plays a mythological warrior in a withered dystopian city where desert car chases, CGI magic and a semi-divine dictator rule</p><p>This fizzy Telugu-language mashup of Indian mythology, martial arts and Bollywood-style dance-romance-and-melodrama plot mechanics, all filtered through a fine sci-fi sieve, is mostly a hoot.

But everyone will just have to wait until further instalments from what the film calls the Kalki Cinematic Universe to drop to find out what happens to the teeming cast of characters. Such is the price of living in an age when films are episodic like television or comic books, and everything is part of a franchise, a universe or even multiverse.

Their main aim has been to do as little as possible. To not rock the boat and to let the Tory party self-destruct.

## Megan Thee Stallion: Megan review – rap skill showcase is a sour sermon on superiority

<p><strong>(Hot Girl)<br /></strong>The feelgood fun of Hot Girl Summer and WAP has been replaced by icy tales of false friends, adultery and incessant betrayal in a broadly humourless, navel-gazing album</p><p>When Megan Pete found fame at the turn of the decade, it was as the bringer of fierce, frisky, feelgood fun. Though always preoccupied with spreading word of her own sex appeal and appetites, there was a light-heartedness and communality to the rapper’s early hits, whether she was teaming up with Beyoncé for the double Grammy-winning Savage Remix, or joining forces with Nicki Minaj and Cardi B for the earwormy, meme-worthy Hot Girl Summer and hilariously outrageous WAP respectively.</p><p>A few years on, the mood has soured substantially. The 29-year-old may have secured a spot in the rap firmament – recent single Hiss debuted at No 1 on the Billboard charts – but judging by Megan, the self-titled third album from which it was taken, it’s never been lonelier at the top.

<p>The superheroes will be arriving in 60s New York in their MCU debut, but where they go next should lead to a multiversal mystery tour</p><p>Once upon a time, every new superhero movie seemed to exist in (not-so) splendid isolation. Michael Keaton’s Batman never met Christopher Reeve’s Superman, despite the cities of Gotham and Metropolis being situated less than 300 miles apart in many DC comic book tales. When Sony’s Spider-Man found himself under threat from the likes of the Green Goblin, Doc Ock and even a nefarious Symbiote in the early to mid-noughties Tobey Maguire films, he did not dial up Iron Man or send an email into space for the attention of one Thor Odinson of Asgard – because those characters were inconveniently owned by someone else. Only in the comics was Ant-Man likely to bump into the Hulk, or Mister Fantastic make the acquaintance of Captain America. Until more than a decade into the 21st-century, big screen superheroes existed like spandex-sporting Robinson Crus

A founding member of the Skatalites the year before – the reggae band who celebrate <a href="https://skatalites.com/tour">their 60th anniversary</a> at Glastonbury this weekend – Drummond’s jazz-inflected melancholy can be heard on hundreds of tracks that were coming out of the studios such as Studio One proliferating in Jamaica at the time, backing the Wailers, Jimmy Cliff and Toots and the Maytals among others.

<p><strong>(54 London/BMG)</strong><br />This long-awaited debut uses dancehall as a springboard into global styles, from electropop to South African amapiano</p><p>It may have been a dreary summer in the UK so far, but not on <em>Island 54</em>: the mythical setting for Birmingham-born rapper/singer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/29/stefflon-don">Stefflon Don’s long-awaited debut album</a> seems to perpetually exist at a balmy 30 degrees. It is a quintessential summer record that uses dancehall as a base from which to explore all manner of global sounds, from grime to the South African dance style amapiano – an inescapable sound at summer parties for the past few years – to electropop to Punjabi rap.<br /><br />
 A stylistic grab-bag? Sure, but <em>Island 54</em> benefits from crisp, stylish production and the knowledge that all anyone wants to listen to in the dog days of summer is a seamless, varied playlist that you can slap on repeat. Introspective cuts like

It’s six conservative justices are mired in infighting over both the pace of their shared ideological project of remaking American law and life according to rightwing preferences, and over their preferred methodological course for doing so. Their squabbling is not helped by the fact that two of them, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, keep embarrassing the court with gauche public scandals, which draw attention to the court’s legitimacy crises like a vulgar flag waving above One First Street. For their part, the liberals are exhausted, impotent, and at times apparently publicly despairing. Their dissents have sometimes taken on tones of exasperation and peeved sarcasm, as if they’re turning to the country and asking: “Can you believe this?” Their most senior member, Sonia Sotomayor, recently told an interviewer that over the past s

Here’s how to make the most of them</p><p>I wasn’t one of those kids who had their own plot in the garden. I count myself fortunate to have had access to a garden and a feeling of comfort in roaming the nearby fields, but I was so bookish that I preferred rainy- day indoor play to playing outside. Nevertheless, it’s interesting which plants we carry from our childhoods into our adult gardens: for me, a key one is <em>Papaver cambricum</em>, or Welsh poppy (AKA Notpoppies in our house, named by my Yorkshire grandfather, with according accent, after he – wrongly – identified them as such).</p><p>Tiny, yellow, rebellious: for so long I resisted such things in my own garden, preferring the grand structure and swag of Icelandic poppies (heaven in a&nbsp;vase) or flashier summer flowers.

<p>From one of the best television series of all time to rushed, unfocused and half-baked, the cooking drama’s third season is a big letdown. Is it a victim of its own success?</p><p>Before we begin, it’s important to point out that The Bear is one of my favourite shows of all time. If you ever need to look for a perfect season of television, I will always point you to The Bear’s first eight episodes. That season was incredibly stylish, overwhelmingly propulsive and filled with characters you found yourself rooting for. More than anything, though, it was about something. The first season of The Bear was about leaving home, returning changed and trying to fit back in. This thumped through every scene of every episode. It was stunning.</p><p>While season two allowed itself to unspool a little, it was still driven by an unbeatably strong engine, in the countdown to the opening of a new restaurant.

The exiled activist and journalist explains the “love” in the title as being like the love she has for her leg or arm: she has to care about it and react when it hurts, whether she wants to or not. And so the book, now the winner of this year’s Pushkin House book prize, collects Kostyuchenko’s reporting from around Russia in the years of its leadership’s dark and merciless commitment to retaining power at every cost, via media domination, disregard for rule of law, exploitative ultrapatriotism and territorial aggression.

<p>Revival69 glimpses into starry Toronto Rock and Roll Revival, which gave Beatles fans a new look at John Lennon</p><p>In the summer of 1969, promoter John Brower thought he had a foolproof plan for a classic concert. Though just 22, he had already promoted successful shows by some seminal rock bands of the day, leading to his creation of the first full-scale pop festival in his native city of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/toronto--news-">Toronto</a>. That two-day event, held in June, starred acts as hot as Sly and the Family Stone, The Band, and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears. But the artist who wound up stealing the show that day was none other than Chuck Berry, who hadn’t had a hit in years and who was then in his early 40s, a virtual fossil by hippie rock fan standards. None of that mattered, according to Brower. “Chuck was so brilliant that everyone loved him,” he said. “His performance gave me the idea to get all the pioneering acts from the 50s back together to create

<p><strong>(Quality Control Music/Motown &amp; Republic)</strong><br />The rapper and singer are both unafraid to confound fans by taking stylistic chances, but here their soulful ambition doesn’t quite gel</p><p>Lil Yachty and James Blake have each strayed a fair distance from their artistic beginnings. On last year’s Let’s Start Here, the 26-year-old Atlanta rapper left fans baffled or delighted by his unexpected pivot to Pink Floyd-tinged psychedelia, having made his name on a string of oddly avant garde trap ditties. Meanwhile Blake, once the auteur crooner of the post-dubstep scene, is these days the go-to producer for rap A-listers looking for an injection of sad-robot soul.</p><p>So their collaboration makes perfect sense on paper, but in reality, Bad Cameo sounds like it’s got stuck in the planning stages, with handfuls of promising ideas stuffed awkwardly into ambient song shapes.

But it is so disconcerting. His performance in What Remains, as a battle-scarred police officer, trying to keep hold of his family, his bearings and his scepticism in the face of a criminological modernity that puzzles him, joins a body of knotty work that UK audiences would probably date back to Breaking the Waves, Lars von Trier’s 1996 classic. His smallest facial gesture speaks fathomless emotion.

<p>A breezy guide to grammar sides with the ordinary Joe against the nitpickers</p><p>Relax: you’re probably not making as many mistakes as you think you are. So says eminent linguist Geoffrey Pullum’s breezy guide to grammar – or, at least, to his own version of it, as previously laid down in mammoth academic treatises.</p><p>Literally everything else written about English grammar in the past two centuries, you see, is “hopeless” and a “muddle”. Our re-education requires some renaming of parts of speech and reshuffling of items between them, ensuring a tension between the book’s hope to be a popular guide and the unfamiliarity of its terminology and taxonomy. Pullum even hates the term “parts of speech” itself, insisting that they have nothing to do with speech, which is, at best, an idiosyncratic view and, at worst, an example of how it might be impossible to write about grammar without becoming a little bit crankish.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/2

<p>Trump lied while Biden struggled to mount a coherent response. Our panelists weigh in on the first presidential debate</p><p>What a catastrophe. From the moment the debate started, Joe Biden was meandering, confused and charmless. It never improved. Donald Trump, however, was relatively restrained, at least for Trump. Of course, he resorted to lies, insults and exaggerations throughout the 90 minutes. By citing things called “Black jobs” and “Hispanic jobs” and by calling Biden a “bad Palestinian”, Trump managed to hit all his usual racist notes.</p><p>Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnist</p><p>Jill Filipovic is the author of the The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness</p><p>Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York and served in the US Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992</p><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist and the author of Strong Female Lead</p><p>Osita Nwanevu is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/
