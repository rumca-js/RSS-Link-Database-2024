A collection of songs that he’d written over the preceding 30 years, the demos lay forgotten until his son, John Carter Cash, found them in 2023. Aware that the arrangements sounded dated, he stripped back the tracks until all that was left was his father’s unmistakable voice, and then assembled a crack band – some of whom had previously backed Cash – to complement it.</p><p>Given the record’s tortuous gestation, the results are surprisingly

What we know on day 856</p><p><strong>Russia is considering a possible downgrading of relations with the west due to the deeper involvement of the US and its allies in the Ukraine war, but no decision had yet been taken, the Kremlin said on Thursday</strong>.
