The Legend of Heroes: Trails series has been going on for a long time, and as well-regarded as the Sky and Crossbell arcs are, a sense of fatigue set in after Cold Steel. Trails into Reverie provided the epilogue that Cold Steel 4 lacked, but fans were beyond wanting to move past Class VII and Erebonia.

Enter The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, boasting a new cast of characters, a fresh setting in Calvard, a different narrative approach and revamped combat. Players control Van Arkride, a Spriggan who assists Agnes Claudel in retrieving a mysterious orbment.

With more morally grey situations and solutions (which govern the new LGC Alignment system), real-time and command-based combat options, and highly improved visuals over previous titles, Trails through Daybreak is what fans of the series need. Some quibbles remain, of course, but it's still a compelling RPG experience.
