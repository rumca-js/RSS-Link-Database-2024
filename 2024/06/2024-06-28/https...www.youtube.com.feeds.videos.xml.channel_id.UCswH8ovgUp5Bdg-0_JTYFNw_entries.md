Could this be the end for Biden’s presidential campaign? How can we analyse the debate last night and what did it REALLY highlight? I also talk to star of ‘The Chosen’ and previously my body double on ‘Ballers’, Jonathan Roumie, about the difficulty of playing Jesus, the way in which ‘The Chosen’ was crowdfunded, and the huge success of the show. As well as reminiscing about our times together on the set of Ballers.
