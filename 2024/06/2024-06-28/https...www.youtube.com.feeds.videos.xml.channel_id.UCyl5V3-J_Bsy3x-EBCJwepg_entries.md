The Babylon Bee reacts to all of the key moments of the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. They’re also hanging out with Joshua Weigel, director of the new Sound of Hope movie. There’s other news this week like Louisiana requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in public classrooms, Julian Assange being released from prison after a plea deal, and Snopes finally fact checking the “fine people” hoax 7 years late. Travis’ Game Korner is back where Kyle and Travis check out High Fructose!
