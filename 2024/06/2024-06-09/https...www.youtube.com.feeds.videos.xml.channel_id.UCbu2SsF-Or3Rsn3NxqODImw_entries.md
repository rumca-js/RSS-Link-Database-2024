Metaphor: ReFantazio comes from the team who worked on Persona 5, full of hyper-stylized UI. ReFantazio takes us to a world where the monsters are human, and our real-world is their fantasy world. Interestingly, Metaphor switches between action RPG combat and turn-based combat, perhaps opening up the game to players who aren't turn-based fans to finally get that Persona experience.

Metaphor ReFantazio is currently set to release October 11, 2024

We played the upcoming body cam horror, meets zookeeper simulator game, Zoochosis.

Zoochosis features terrifying mutant giraffes, penguin abominations, horrific kangaroos, and many more animals that you must care for as you fight to survive the night.

Preparing meat for the animals, treating sickness, and ensuring each creature is locked up tight are just a few of the tasks you must accomplish as you work to uncover the secrets of this terrifying sanctuary in the game's 21 different endings.

Zoochosis takes inspiration from other first-person horror games like Five Nights at Freddy's and Poppy's Playtime, but with it's own zookeeper twists, varied player choices, and some of the grossest animals we've ever seen.

After comparisons to Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and Sekiro, Phantom Blade Zero is finally playable - and seems far more inspired by the likes of Ninja Gaiden, with no noticeable stamina meter, and a focus on performing cool combos. GameSpot's Jess Howard found Phantom Blade Zero to be a blast to play, and much more approachable than Soulslike titles.
