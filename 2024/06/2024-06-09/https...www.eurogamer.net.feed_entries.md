Tonight, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">Microsoft announced a trio of new Xbox Series X/S consoles</a>, including a digital-only Xbox Series X.
</p><p>
In part, these seemed similar to the consoles seen in leaked plans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-xbox-series-xs-consoles-detailed-in-enormous-microsoft-leak">released into the public domain in error last year</a> that awkwardly trumpeted an "adorably all-digital" future for Xbox - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-a-good-thing-microsoft-now-says-its-adorably-all-digital-future-plans-are-outdated">Microsoft's Phil Spencer later said was outdated</a>. 
</p><p>
But how much has changed? The new digital-only Series X is white, as expected, with are no major performance upgrades under the hood. It's no longer c

We've known for a while that Citizen Sleeper 2 is going to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-update-reveals-first-new-location-game-pass-release">much bigger game</a> than the original, but tonight's trailer gave us a taste of just how large the Belt actually is, as it will have its own navigable map screen, along

A detective murder mystery like no other, its 12 strange deaths (or more if you count its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-case-of-the-golden-idol-the-spider-of-lanka-expansion-arrives-next-month">equally</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-puzzler-the-case-of-the-golden-gets-second-expansion-the-lemurian-vampire">exceptional</a> DLC) all centred around a mythical golden statue whose supposed life-giving properties put it at the heart of a decades-long conspiracy. As we unravelled the tangled history of the double-crossing Cloudsley family, we poked around stuffy country manors, dingy, candlelit inns, blood-stained beaches, and hallowed cult chamb

## Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 always online, including campaign, due to "continuous" texture streaming

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will require a "continuous internet connection" - even when you're playing its campaign mode. 
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://support.activision.com/black-ops-6/articles/black-ops-6-editions">blog post</a> published by Activision today, the publisher advises that the Cold War-set shooter uses "texture streaming across all game modes".
</p><p>
"This means you'll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign," Activision wrote.

Tonight's Xbox Showcase brought us a first glance at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> gameplay, and a better look at its feudal Japanese world. 
</p><p>
A fresh trailer for Ubisoft Quebec's upcoming action RPG began with quick scenes showing the changing of the seasons - the ubiquitous Japanese blossom of spring, snow in winter, torrential rain on a muddy battlefield full of corpses.
</p><p>
Next we saw shinobi protagonist Naoe yanking enemies down into the long grass like raptors picking off tourists in Jurassic Park, then quick shots of her performing the Assassin's Creed series' trademark rooftop parkour, aided by a grapple rope. You also now appear to be able to peer around corners.

Singing roses, warbling willows, trumpeting daffodills. From rearranging furniture to creating a musical garden, here's a first proper look at Tempopo - the next project from Australian indie developer Witch Beam, studio behind the brilliant Unpacking.
</p><p>
A melody-infused puzzle game, it sees you collecting a garden of musical flowers across 60 whimsical floating 3D levels that look a little similar to Nintendo's own Captain Toad. 
</p><p>
Tempopo is set to launch later this year for PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S (yes, curiously there's no mention of a PlayStation release for now).

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 - the latest instalment in Microsoft's long-running aviation sim - launches for PC and Xbox Series X/S on 19th November, introducing aerial firefighting, cargo hauling, hot air balloon trips, and more.
</p><p>
Flight Simulator 2024 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-features-an-incredible-list-of-new-flight-activities">announced last June</a>, amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-continue-to-support-flight-simulator-2020-after-launch-of-2024-sequel">some controversy</a> given developer Asobo had previously pledged to provide 10 years' worth of support for the 2020 iteration of the game. Since then, the studio has rather nebulously said it'll "continue to support" the current version after Flight Simulator 2024's release,

There is a British Fallout-like game on the horizon from Sniper Elite studio, Rebellion.</p><p>It's called Atomfall, and it was revealed at this evening's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-xbox-games-showcase-right-here-with-us">Xbox showcase</a>. The team describes Atomfall as a single-player survival action game which will see players exploring a post-nuclear environment, and then scavenging, crafting, bartering and - of course - fighting to survive.</p><p>While Atomfall's story is fictional, it has been inspired by a real-world nuclear disaster that occurred in northern England in 1957. Players will experience Britain five years after this event, and find that "everything has changed" after that fateful day. You can check out the trailer - complete with British hymns, bunting and phone boxes - below.</p> <p><a hre

Gears of War 6's development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gears-of-war-game-in-the-works-according-to-new-job-listings">hasn't been much of a secret</a>, but it's now finally official - with tonight's Xbox Games Showcase revealing it to be a prequel titled Gears of War: E-Day.
</p><p>
Set 14 years before the events of the original Gears of War, E-Day tells the story of the first Locust emergence on Sera, and the world's response to that threat.
</p><p>
It promises a return of the series' trademark third-person, cover-based shooting action, all within an "explosive" campaign combining "satisfying gameplay and emotive, character-led storytelling".

Have a watch below.</p><p>As per previous Avowed trailers, you play as an envoy of Aedyr sent to investigate a mysterious plague known as 'The Dream Scourge' that's spreading through the wild frontier of The Living Lands - an all-new region of the Pillars of Eternity world we haven't seen before.

Microsoft has revealed three new Xbox console variants with increased storage capacity, available at the end of the year in select markets.
</p><p>
Two are all-digital: a 1TB Xbox Series X in "Robot White" and a 1TB Xbox Series S in the same colour. The third is a "special edition" 2TB Xbox Series X in "Galaxy Black" that features a disc drive.
</p><p>
It's clear with these new consoles, Microsoft is edging ever closer to an all-digital future. The "special edition" physical console will be available in "limited quantities", but critically there is at least still an option for physical media.

Just as Battlefield 4 had Levolution and Driveclub had its Drivatars, Black Ops 6 is reviving the once-popular trend of making up silly words for neat, new, though not exactly groundbreaking ideas.</p><p>In COD's case, it's 'omnimovement', Black Ops 6's headline new feature that means instead of only being able to sprint when moving forwards, you can now sprint backwards, side to side, and any other direction in 360 degrees, with admittedly very nice animations to match. In a presentation given ahead of the big Call of Duty showcase on Xbox's stage this weekend, developers from Treyarch explained this was based on a combination of real "elite" military experts' abilitie

I am very sorry to report that, no, you cannot play as former UK Prime Minister, Conservative party leader and unanimously beloved human being Margaret Thatcher in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.
</p><p>
Despite promising signs in the initial reveal trailer from developer Treyarch, where big Maggie features alongside the similarly well-liked Saddam Hussein, George Bush Senior, and Bill Clinton - and the fact that Ronald Reagan was playable in the previous entry, Black Ops Cold War - Treyarch confirmed to Eurogamer during an interview earlier this week that she won't be playable, ever.
</p><p>
"No," said Yale Miller, senior director of production at Treyarch on Black Ops 6, when Eurogamer asked.

Four years after its initial announcement, Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot has finally resurfaced, offering a first gameplay reveal for this reimagining of developer Rare's classic spy-flavoured first-person shooter.
</p><p>
Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-announced">back in December 2020</a>, Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot was initially being developed exclusively by The Initiative, a studio specifically set up to handle its creation. However, the project has been hit by numerous set-backs since then and Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics was eventually bought in to help get it over the finish line.
</p><p>
Reports of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-in-a-very-rough-state-and-a-big-protracted-mess">troubled development</a> have continued to

Today's first trailer, shown during the Xbox Showcase, sees Max return to using her powers when her best friend (no, not that one) turns up dead. 
</p><p>
But this isn't quite the same power Max had in Life is Strange 1. This time, it sounds like she has the ability to peer into an alternate dimension - one where her friend is still alive.

Microsoft's Fable reboot will launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S in 2025, it was confirmed tonight in a new trailer. We previously hadn't been given a release window for the upcoming fantasy role-player, despite seeing it a year ago at the last Xbox Showcase. 
</p><p>
And, just like last year, Fable's latest trailer confirmed another legend of British comedy will be featured. Yes, Super Hans from Peep Show, AKA Matt King, is in the game and plays retired hero Humphrey, who looks set to be one of your allies. 
</p><p>
Last year's trailer accompanied IT Crowd's Richard Ayoade, if you recall.

Developer Undead Labs' State of Decay 3 - the reportedly troubled latest entry in its zombie survival series - has resurfaced after four years, courtesy of a moody cinematic trailer.
</p><p>
State of Decay 3 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-decay-3-announced">initially announced</a> during Microsoft's 2020 Xbox showcase. Two years later, with the game still nowhere to be seen, reports began circulating alleging <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-decay-3-report-details-troubled-development">sexism and mismanagement</a> at Undead Labs, with staff claiming the game had been announced too early, and at a time the studio "didn't even know what it was".
</p><p>
Now, however, State of Decay 3 has resurfaced, appropriately enough, during Microsoft's latest Xbox Games Showcase, albeit with not a second of gameplay in s

Compulsion Games, developer of We Happy Few, showed more of its upcoming adventure game South of Midnight during the Xbox Showcase this evening - and let us know the project will arrive for PC and Xbox Series X/S at some point next year, in 2025. 
</p><p>
A meaty trailer showed off stylish action as well as a bit of gameplay, as its heroine scampered around the bayou, rode a big talking fish, dodged a titan-sized alligator and clambered up a church tower to ring a ruddy large bell. </p><p>
Throughout, South of Midnight looked visually stunning - especially impressive as the environment magically changed from tangled toxic branches to lush surroundings.

Kicking off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-xbox-games-showcase-right-here-with-us">this evening's Xbox showcase</a>, we got a look at Doom: The Dark Ages, and oh my days, it looks awesome.
</p><p>
"Before he became a hero," the video begins, "he was the super weapon of gods and kings." And what a super weapon he was. But, don't let me tell you. You can check out Doom: The Dark Ages' reveal trailer for yourself below. 
</p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages will serve as a prequel to 2016's Doom and Doom Eternal. It is described as a single-player action FPS that "tells the epic cinematic origin story of the Doom Slayer's rage", and of course, it is being developed by id Software.

Dragon Age: The Veilguard got a first trailer today during the Xbox Showcase, and it looked very good indeed. 
</p><p>
BioWare's RPG has a slightly stylised artstyle - in this trailer, at least - and a cool-looking roster of new companion characters... except not all of them are new. 
</p><p>
In amongst the roster are a couple of familiar faces. Varric we knew would be back in this next installment. But also joining the party... Dragon Age Inquisition fan-favourite Harding! This news makes this particular Dragon Age fan extremely happy indeed.
