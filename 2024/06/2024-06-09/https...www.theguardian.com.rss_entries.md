Or, as they like to call it in the sports punditocracy, another game in which Jayson Tatum must score 87 points on 80% shooting while getting 20 rebounds and 25 assists to lead the Celtics to a 187-84 win, or else his legacy is shot to pieces.</p><p>Seriously – we haven’t seen anyone put under this much pressure to win a championship since Charles Barkley roamed the NBA’s courts.

<ul><li>Asher-Smith takes first place in time of 10.99sec</li><li>Britain’s Georgia Bell wins 1500m silver</li></ul><p>Lightning in the sky, thunder on the track. And, on a wild night in Rome, the welcome sight of Dina Asher-Smith powering to a 100m gold medal again at these European Athletics Championships.<br /><br />
 But Britain’s greatest sprinter was forced to recover from one of the worst starts of her career, which left her several metres down on her rivals. But she refused to panic, and showed considerable grit as well as class to come through in 10.99 sec.</p><p>That put her just 0.03 clear of Poland’s Ewa Swoboda, who claimed silver, with Italy’s Zaynab Dosso taking bronze. No wonder Asher-Smith whispered the words “Fuck me” as she crossed the line and gave a look that suggested she couldn’t quite believe she had pulled off this Italian job.<br /><br />
 Incredibly, this was also the 28-year-old’s first major title since winning 200m at the world championships in 2019 – due

<p>Marine Le Pen’s far-right party see unprecedented result as stepping stone to presidential elections in 2027</p><p>At a smart party venue overlooking the woodland of the Bois de Vincennes, east of Paris, members of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (<em>Rassemblement National</em>, or RN) clinked glasses to the sound of jazz piano. Savouring their historic result in the European elections, they were also looking forward with excitement to the sudden, shock parliamentary election in France.</p><p>“We’re ready for power if French people put their trust in us,” said Le Pen to cheers and applause from senior party officials in suits and cocktail dresses, after the president, Emmanuel Macron, made the dramatic and unexpected announcement that he was dissolving the French parliament in the wake of the results. The election, called for three weeks’ time, saw Le Pen’s anti-immigration party, with around 31% of the vote, come first – and more than double the score of the president’s

<p><strong>Soho theatre, London</strong><br />Half musical comedy, half party, Archie Henderson’s show ranges far and wide over the travails of his slinky singer vying for a knighthood</p><p>It’s the Royal Variety Performance – or at least, a pre-show rehearsal in the dingy room downstairs. Jazz Emu is prepping for the night of his life, a chance to perform for the King and vie for a knighthood. The prospects are good: Jazz’s services to electro-funk parody cannot be gainsaid. But he has rivals for the honour, and accusations mounting that may deny him the regal recognition he craves.</p><p>That’s the premise for Knight Fever, the new show from Archie Henderson’s much-loved alter ego, a slinky synth-pop purveyor in shades with a beanpole frame, delusions of grandeur, and one of those foghorny, self-serious voices that plunge you right back to the new-romantic 1980s.

<p>Manager aiming to be first to lead Scotland to a knockout stage isn’t fazed by starting against Euro 2024 hosts</p><p>There is a twinkle in Steve Clarke’s eye as he poses a rhetorical question. “If you asked every Tartan Army member: ‘Come out of the group in Germany, or qualify for the next World Cup?’ what are they going to want?” There follows a pause and a smile. “I know what my bosses would rather have.”</p><p>Finding an appropriate answer is complex. Clarke’s work with Scotland is such that supporters believe the class of 2024 can break the mould by becoming the country’s first to emerge from the group phase at a major tournament. There are subplots: the expansion of the European Championship, the modern-day depth in international football and the added belief that Clarke’s men could very well party in the European Championship finals this month and the 2026 World Cup. The point he is trying to make relates to a bigger picture; landmarks will be reached if Scotland’s players

During five messy but increasingly dramatic sets the Spaniard kept his head, and he recovered from an inexplicable third-set collapse to defeat Alexander Zverev 6-3, 2-6, 5-7, 6-1, 6-2 to win his first French Open title.

Politicians need a plan for victims </p><p>Mark Rowley, head of the Metropolitan police, described the extent of violent crime committed by men against women as “eye-watering”. In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/04/met-chief-says-millions-of-men-are-danger-to-women-and-girls-in-england-and-wales">report last week</a> for the London policing board, he said that with up to 4 million mostly male perpetrators of violence against women and children in England and Wales, the scale of the problem is “beyond policing and justice system capacity”. The <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/moderngovmb/documents/s79712/05a%20Commissioners%20Report%20MPS%20final.pdf">Met’s figures</a> show that 50% of violence suffered by women in London relates to domestic abuse, with 1m reports to police in England and Wales annually.

<p>Enthusiasm for Paris 2024 has yet to ignite, but Emmanuel Macron needs a successful Games to revive his flagging presidency</p><p>Emmanuel Macron has sometimes been criticised over a tendency to hector and lecture his fellow citizens, when a demonstration of empathy might have worked better. It was not, for example, a good look when, in 2018, the French president <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45541697">told</a> a young jobseeker: “I can find you a job just by crossing the road.”</p><p>In the lead-up to the Paris Olympics – now less than 50 days away – Mr Macron has again been adopting a dubious tough love strategy, this time in relation to France’s athletes.

There have also been books, this latest of which strives to explain why, when so many of her contemporaries went on to become household names, Lederer herself still requires an introduction.</p><p>A hectic, now-and-again hair-raising survey of her life and career, it begins with a mother who worked at Bletchley during the war only to become trapped by 1950s domesticity, and a Czech-Jewish father who arrived in the UK as a refugee and continually felt the need to earn his place in British society.</p> <a href="https://www.

<p><strong>Playhouse, Leeds</strong><br />Katie Bird is an irresistible Eliza Doolittle in this inspired show, which takes its interrogation of social mobility seriously but with a sparkling lightness of touch</p><p>The Lord above gave man an arm of iron: so says Alfred Doolittle, England’s most original moralist. By design rather than luck, James Brining’s new My Fair Lady<em> </em>(a co-production by Opera North and Leeds Playhouse) gives its Prof Higgins just the opposite. Loose-limbed, soft-edged and chaotic, his vulnerable model of masculinity – set against an Eliza of unwavering wit and self-possession – offsets the book’s occasional misogyny, in a production that takes its interrogation of social mobility seriously but still conjures up plenty of comedy and chemistry along the way.</p><p>Casting opera singers in musical theatre can go very well or very badly; in the case of soprano Katie Bird – like much of the cast, a member of Opera North’s chorus – it’s pure inspiration.

Better still, give him a day pass to Michael Gove’s favourite crack den. Anything to blot out the memories of the last few hours.

Even close friends don’t always recognise him in the street.

<p>The warm winter and wet spring spawned a mollusc army. Now they’ve invaded my brassicas, I’m at war with my conscience</p><p>It’s the beginning of summer, yet as I type these words, I’m watching sheets of rain coming down at an angle as my chickens cower under their hen house. Aside from a few gloriously sunny days, it feels like the rain hasn’t stopped since the middle of last autumn. While most of my plants appreciate the moisture, the wetter than usual weather has led to some issues in my veg patch.</p><p>Our heavy clay soil is more compacted than ever and the slugs and snails now reign, busily mowing down the young plants I raised from seed and entrusted to the veg beds. They came for the lettuces first, which didn’t survive their first night in the soil. Then they came for the brassicas – the radishes, the kohlrabi and the red Russian kale – stripping their leaves back to the scrawny mid-rib, destroying the centre so there was no chance of them growing back.

<p>Such is the grace and talent of the Dutch hurdler and sprinter that she appears to have the ability to bend time to her will - as well as a rare beauty in her technique</p><p>In the lead-up to every Olympics a handful of athletes become the focus of expectant attention. From this handful one emerges or is selected as the “face” of the Games. In London in 2012 it was Jessica Ennis, who as a heptathlete embodied all-round Olympian excellence. This visibility is not solely a question of athletic ability; Ennis fulfilled the host nation’s hopes by winning gold and by being incredibly nice, all the time. Usain Bolt’s face and long limbs dominated multiple championships because he was the fastest, one of the most likable and – as a result – the most heavily sponsored track athlete in the world. Every time his image appeared somewhere – ie everywhere – it promoted an associative bundle comprising his running shoes (Puma), Visa, Gatorade, Jamaica, the Olympic ideal and, by a kind of meta e

If the role of snappers’ stuntman is an unusual addition to the job description of an architecture critic, that’s because Minsuk Cho, the South Korean architect of the 23rd edition of the pavilion, sited outside the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens, London, is the first one to include what he calls a Play Tower in the project.</p><p>There’s also a small Library of Unread Books assembled by the artist Heman Chong and the archivist Renée Stall, and a sound installation, by the musician an

The carnage makes his memories of a springbok hunt with his uncle look like scenes from Doctor Dolittle. But there’s another conflict which the SADF is prosecuting: the war against homosexuality.</p><p>Moffie, adapted by Philip Rademeyer from André Carl van der Merwe’s 2006 novel, takes its title from a homophobic slur that is as ubiquitous here as the throb of chopper blades. Alone on stage before a mound of military kit bags, to which he tellingly adds his own baggage, Nicholas describes the years spent concealing his desires. The baroque punishments of the psych ward await those who fail.</p> <a href="https://www.thegua

<p>Spatchcock tandoori chicken with coriander chutney, served with easy grilled garlic naan and a zingy salad</p><p>Much like a Sunday roast, tandoori food was a weekend ritual when I was growing up. Tender nubs of meat marinaded in a spicy yoghurt marinade, charred to perfection and swiped through a herbal chutney, still taste like a good time to me. Strictly speaking, tandoori chicken is cooked in a tandoor, a clay oven that is also used to bake bread, but it is also perfect for throwing on the barbecue, assuming the weather permits; if not, this can be cooked in an oven or under a hot grill. The versatile marinade also works well with meat, poultry, seafood, paneer and vegetables.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jun/09/ravinder-bhogal-tandoori-chicken-with-sides-recipes-naan-kachumber">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor on starring in a new play about sexual harassment, Mr Bates vs the Post Office, and the playwright closest to her heart</p><p>Lia Williams, 59, is an exceptional actor of questing intelligence and warmth whose award-winning performances on stage and screen have a way of staying in the mind. Her 1993 interpretation of a student accusing her professor of harassment, in David Mamet’s <em>Oleanna</em>, was one such role. Now, 30 years on, she is about to play a professor, in <em>Alma Mater</em> at the Almeida by Kendall Feaver, a tremendous new play that returns to the subject of sexual misconduct.</p><p><strong>It seems you’ve always been drawn to political drama.<br /></strong>I’ve worked with Harold Pinter – who directed <em>Oleanna</em> – and he used to say, about his own work, that he was never consciously political yet a political strain ran through everything he wrote. I’m now beginning to wonder – I’ve been doing this job for 40 years – if there might be something sim

<p>Labour’s reaction to Kemi Badenoch’s plan to define sex is not only a hapless fudge, it’s legally illiterate</p><p>A friend of mine runs a residential writing retreat attended by women with experience of trauma and abuse. It is vital to those who take part that it is female only: past attenders have told her it enables them to talk about their experiences in a way they couldn’t if men were present. But she has begun to worry whether excluding all men – regardless of how they identify – might put her at risk of legal action.</p><p>I put her in touch with an expert to explain the law in this area. The upshot: it isn’t clear exactly when it is lawful to operate female-only services, and that ambiguity means she is right to consider the risk of being sued. For a freelancer it could ultimately be catastrophic. She has been agonising about this since and may stop running the retreat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/09/the-law-on-single-sex-spaces-i

John Sturges’s <em>The Magnificent Seven</em>, Sam Peckinpah’s <em>The Wild Bunch</em> and <em>Pat Garrett </em><em>and Billy the Kid</em> and Sergio Leone’s <em>The Good, </em><em>the Bad </em><em>and </em><em>the Ugly</em> all made use of the wide open sky, sweeping vistas and photogenically phallic geological formations.

<p>With rolling hills, golden villages, listed gardens and historic homes, the south of the county offers some of England’s most glorious sights</p><p>The delightful manor house, dating back to the 1300s, was owned for generations by the Lyte family. The garden was cultivated by Elizabeth I’s botanist, Henry Lyte, but the house fell into disrepair and the garden was ploughed up. In 1909, after a century and a half of neglect, a new family took over. They restored the interior (removing a cider press and farming equipment dumped inside) and created the charming Arts &amp; Crafts garden you can still enjoy today.

It is generally accepted that it was born on 11 August 1973, when 18-year-old DJ Kool Herc first cut up breakbeats at a party in the Bronx and his friend Coke La Rock rapped along, but this DJ-driven art form, which evolved parallel to disco, took another six years to spawn its first hit single, the Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight. The star MCs emerged in its second decade, each one redrawing the bounds of the possible. Run-DMC stripped it down, then Public Enemy blew it up. De La Soul made it friendly, Kool Keith made it freaky, NWA made it outrageous, and so on. Always changing, always expanding.</p><p>Nobody knows more about hip-hop, and perhaps popular music in general, than Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson.

This isn’t, I’m afraid, entirely a good thing for Cape wine producers, since pinotage doesn’t have the best of reputations – or, to put it another way, a lot of it really isn’t very good. That’s a little harsh on exemplary producers such as Kanonkop in Stellenbosch, who have shown how good pinotage can be in their glorious Black Label Pinotage, a collector’s item that sits very close to the top of South African wine’s hierarchy of fine reds. But a handful of exceptions aside, I’m always happier when I see the name of one of pinotage’s parent grape varieties, cinsault (pinot noir is the other half of the heritage of a crossing created in 1924) on the label.

It’s simply about wanting to make a fairer society</a>”). The NHS is essentially a system of mutual medical aid with state funding, paid for by income tax – the more you earn, the more you contribute – which means it is firmly rooted in the socialist principle “from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”. It has been the most popular institution in the country for almost 80 years. People may complain about its performance (largely caused by Tory attempts to dismantle it), but how many of them criticise it for being socialist?</p><p>I’d like Labour politi
