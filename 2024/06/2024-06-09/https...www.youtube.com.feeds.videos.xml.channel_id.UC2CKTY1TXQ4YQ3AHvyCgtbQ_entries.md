Summer is here, and that means long, warm, lazy days of outdoor activities - or perhaps days painting and playing down in the basement! It all depends on what you like, I suppose. I'll tell you my wargaming plans for summer, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made a game! Check out Deth Wizards at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
