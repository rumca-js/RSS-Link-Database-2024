Phanteks is releasing its new G400A and G400N cases soon, which aim to be (at cheapest) $100 airflow PC cases succeeding the P400A case. The company also has its new Evolv X2 concept case, a prototype, which is intended to compete in the full glass market. We're most interested in the P400A successor, as the P400A with its full fan configuration was one of the most competitive airflow cases for a long time, but has aged out of direct relevance.
