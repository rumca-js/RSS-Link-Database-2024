The manner in which the trailer swings between these two settings is both confusing and captivating, giving little sense of how they might relate to one another but certainly making a strong case for the action that's unfolding in both.</p><div>          </div><p>According to the game's trailer description, Atomfall takes inspiration from a real-world nuclear scare in England in 1957, with the game taking place in a future that i

It seems you'll control a party of four in combat too, presumably with different abilities to let you tackle a variety of challenges on your journey. There's a strong fantasy aesthetic on display, rooted within French inspirations with the Eiffel Tower seemingly destroyed in the trailer's opening moments.</p><div>          </div><p>The trailer references an evil entity known as the Painter, who annually "repaints" the world, stealing innocent lives in the process.

In fact, you even benefit from radiation in a lot of different ways," Bethesda told GameSpot in an interview. "So that on its own will open up a number of different play styles.
