  <p id="fseTAs">Microsoft is officially putting a release window on <em>Fable</em>, which is now set to arrive at some point in 2025. After an initial trailer at last year’s Xbox summer showcase, today, we got to see some early gameplay, though the new footage was mostly focused on the characters and story of the fantasy game. <em>Fable </em>will be centered on a hero named Humphry, who “will be forced out of retirement when a mysterious figure from his past threatens Albion’s very existence.” It appears that choice will once again play a big part in the experience, though not a lot of hard details have been revealed about the game just yet.</p>

It’s called <em>Skyline Valley</em>, and for the first time, it will actually expand the game’s map, introducing a new Shenandoah region in the south.

At Xbox’s big June showcase event, id Software officially unveiled the next entry in the demonic shooter series, which is called <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. As the name implies, it takes the franchise back to a medieval-like era, with the slayer killing enemies in a more fantasy realm. In that way, it seems to serve as a prequel of sorts. It still looks as gruesome and gory as ever, though. Also, you can fly on some kind of cyberpunk dragon.</p>
