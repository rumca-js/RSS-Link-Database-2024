<p>Andrea Baroni’s <em>Halfway to Dawn</em> is unbelievably bleak for a game you can play from start to finish in about 10 minutes. I mean that as a compliment; it’s the best horror experience I’ve had on the Playdate yet.</p>
<p>As someone who tends to gravitate towards all things spooky, one of the things I’ve been most interested in as I explore what’s out there for Playdate is seeing how developers will make horror work for the weird little handheld. <em>Halfway to Dawn </em>takes a blended approach: in the first half, it’s a text-based narrative game where you’re scavenging for resources and readying yourself for the long night ahead; in the second, it’s an all-out fight for your life against an onslaught of eldritch creatures.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Halfway to Dawn</em> wastes no time in setting a mood of desolation and impending doom, beginning with dialogue from our protagonist about feeling “as lifeless as these scattered remains of humanity” in a ci

<p>Xbox’s Summer Games Showcase on Sunday brought a nice little surprise amidst all the expected news: the announcement of a new Life is Strange game,<em> Life is Strange: Double Exposure. </em>The game, which sees the return of its original protagonist Max Caulfield, will be released on October 29 for Xbox Series X/S, PC and PlayStation 5. Anyone dying to get their hands on it a little earlier, though, can pre-order the Ultimate Edition, which will grant them access to Chapters 1 and 2 on October 15. A Nintendo Switch release appears to be coming later, as well.</p>
<p><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> picks up years after the events of the first game. Now, Max has found her friend Safi murdered and tries to use her powers of time manipulation to go back and save her — but things go awry. It’s a “full-on murder-mystery, with a supernatural twist” in which Max will have to bounce between parallel timelines to stop the killer.</p>

<p>As the grand finale of Xbox’s Summer Game Fest showcase, after the new consoles, we were treated to the exclusive premiere of the latest addition to the <em>Gears</em> series, <em>Gears of War: E-Day.</em></p>
<p>The trailer kicks off with a one-on-one brawl between the Gears guy and a grunt, ending in a headshot. Immediately after, however,  the floor collapses between them. Fortunately, Gears’ Guy #2 is there to grab your hand. And the sad <em>Mad World</em> melody plays in the background. Because <em>Gears</em>. Called <em>E-Day,</em> and ending on an apocalyptic view of a city, it looks like this game will center on an invasion. Apparently, this is the origin story centered on the Locust invasion on Emergence Day, through the eyes of Marcus Fenix — AKA Gears guy. Get the big guns. There’s no release window just yet, but it will, of course, be landing on Game Pass when it does arrive.</p>

<p>It's been a long, long time since we learned that a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/perfect-dark-initiative-xbox-announcement-005705713.html"><em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot was in the works</a>, and there are finally some fresh signs of life. A gameplay trailer was shown during the Xbox Games Showcase, though there's no release date or window as yet.</p>
<p>Xbox is billing the reboot as a "first-person secret agent thriller in a near-future world" that includes immersive sim and stealth-action elements. Based on this first look, co-developers The Initiative and may have nailed the brief.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>South of Midnight</em>, first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/south-of-midnight-is-a-southern-gothic-monster-adventure-from-compulsion-games-173100633.html">revealed</a> at last year’s Summer Game Fest, will launch on Xbox and PC sometime next year. During today's Xbox showcase, we got a first look at how the third-person action-adventure will play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right off the bat, it reminds me of Square Enix’s fun-but-flawed <em>Forspoken</em>. In <em>South of Midnight, </em>protagonist Hazel is apparently pulled into a “Southern Gothic world” where reality and fantasy are blurred. Hazel is able to move around the environment fluidly, with the new trailer showing off gliding skills, double jumps, and some sort of magical grapple hook to speed up level navigation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's a new Doom in town. <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is heading to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC, day one on Game Pass, in 2025. The game's first trailer showcases a world of hulking monsters in blood-soaked environments, badass new weapons and what looks to be a player-controlled dragon. At one point, the Doom Slayer steps inside a giant mech suit in order to battle a huge demon, buildings crumbling beneath their feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weapons and creatures in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>have a distinct medieval flare, as is expected, with lots of sharpened blades, at least one flail and heavy armor all around. One new weapon that stands out in the game's reveal trailer is an automatic shotgun with a skull in the center of it, menacing and slightly silly at the same time. As is custom in Doom games, the level of gory, gruesome detail on display in <em>The Dark Ages</em> is exceptional, and it looks like the game is lea
