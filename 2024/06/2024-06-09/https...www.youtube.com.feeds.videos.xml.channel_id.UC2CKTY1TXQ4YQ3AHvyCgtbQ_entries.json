It all depends on what you like, I suppose. I'll tell you my wargaming plans for summer, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made a game! Check out Deth Wizards at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com\n\nI'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly).
