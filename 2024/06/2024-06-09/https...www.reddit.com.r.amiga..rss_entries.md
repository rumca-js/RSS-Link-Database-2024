<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to play this game on an AMIGA computer in the early-mid ‘80s. I distinct like flash memories of it, but can’t remember much. I do remember that I had no idea what to do….</p> <p>It was set on an alien planet way in the future and I specifically remember like spray painted griffiti on the walls that said something like ‘Kane is Dead’ or, ‘Something…’Is Keen’ ? </p> <p>You start off entering a compound type of facility and there are some sort of guards or something, that if something happened, they might attack you? I’m positive, but it feels like that was a feature in the game.</p> <p>Your character was red, or possibly in a black space suit, he / she had a helmet (there was something strange about the helmet, like it was bigger than normal or it had a strange shape) and it was definitely a side scroller, but almost like a Metroidvania type game.

Thanks to the great advice, I've now completed the project and thought I'd report back.</p> <p>I started with my original A1200HD that I'd hacked about and shoehorned various 2.5&quot; and 3.5&quot; HDDs into in the past. Sadly those drives are now dead, but everything else including my Blizzard A1260 with 16MB RAM was still working fine.</p> <p>I opted to make the following mods to bring it into the present (some weren't strictly necessary, but were the right thing to do to best preserve the hardware).

## How amazing was IK+?! This fighting game blew me away as a kid. The fact that 3 karate fighters were all on one screen seemed so revolutionary. Plus, the gameplay and humour were top notch. Enjoy the story of Archer McLean's classic with this fun video.

Before even starting, I just want to clarify that I have never dealt with electronics in my life before in any way, so don't be surprised if I did something stupid. So, my Amiga 500's PSU's (series 312503-03)internals stopped working a couple of months ago (it didn't send enough power to the Amiga) and I decided to change the internals with the Meanwell RT-50B PSU. Before replacing it, I tested the original Amiga PSU itself and I didn't get enough power. For reference, I did the i
