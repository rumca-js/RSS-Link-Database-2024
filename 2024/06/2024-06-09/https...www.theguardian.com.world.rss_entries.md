Gone are the days when the combined might of the <em>Sun</em>’s front page and the leader columns of the <em>Times</em>, <em>Daily Mail</em> and <em>Daily Telegraph</em> could claim to sway floating voters, such as the stereotyped Mondeo Man or Worcester Woman, to put an X by the name of a Tory candidate.
