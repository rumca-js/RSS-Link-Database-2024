I’ve invited my family, not necessarily given them a tutorial of the service just mentioned its use, and otherwise have stated this is where they can backup their photos. I then take backups using NextCloud’s built in borg module (in the AIO panel). From which I also backup these and the docker containers data folder for my users data.</p> <p>However I’ve seen in the past that ente was self open source.

The college has absolutely no budget to set up this system and thus we are looking into something open source to host on Oracle Cloud free tier. We thought that we had found a gem with <a href="https://github.com/leihs/leihs">Leihs</a> however, we cannot for the life of us figure out to deploy it. The documentation is very much geared towards those with a deep pre-existing technical knowledge and whilst I have been working on web hosted projects for a while I have never seen anything quite like this. I then had a look at setting up a Wordpress site with various plugins however, none of the free ones offer anything close to what we need.</p> <p>Essentially: We need a web interface which allows students to log in, find equipment through categories and search, add equipment to a cart, select a booking date, ad

It’s effectively my old desktop that was repurposed and a new GPU bought since that was used elsewhere. </p> <p>It’s used for the usual arr* stack and Plex, file hosting for family use, and the occasional video game server such as Project Zomboid. </p> <p>My main question falls with the CPU: what is the right train of thought when buying one for this type of use? Core count over clock speed? Specific brand favored by software? Does it even matter or should I seek the best deals on good hardware rather than specific types?</p> <p>Secondly what use do GPU’s get in an environment like this?

I had a look at on-premises S3 storage, Minio turned up in a lot of searches, as did Garage and SeaweedFS. But my idea for the initial PoC was to use a single large-capacity storage server platform we already have, a SuperMicro 36 x 3.5” bay server. I see that Minio has the concept of “single-node, multiple drives” and I think I can get 100’s of TB into this one server, but — it this a good/workable idea?

I've looked at borg, rclone, mountain duck, kopia, veeam, freefilesync, duplicity, plus some more. Out of all these, I like Kopia due to their GUI and the ability to see the files mounted locally (and it's free).</p> <p>However, I cannot find a way to continually add to a snapshot. Say I have a large directory pictures for a snapshot `pictures`. If the local directory of `pictures` gets too big, I would like the ability to delete and add new files locally and have both the old and new files collectively show up in the same snapshot version. I know that you can go to the old snapshots of the backups to access the old files, but those are not together.</p> <p>A good example would be Google Photos application. I can take many photos, upload them to Google Photos, then
