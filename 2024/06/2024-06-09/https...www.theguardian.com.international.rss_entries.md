<p>Once part of a paper mill, this flat on the banks of Lake Zug has turned over a new leaf</p><p>It all started with paper. In 1657, when many people could neither read nor write, the foundations for the Papieri area, on the shores of Lake Zug in Cham, Switzerland, were laid. This first paper mill became a huge paper factory, which operated for 360 years until it was closed down in 2015 and the remaining Papieri buildings were classified as historical monuments. Now a bustling new quarter with apartments, lofts, studios and workplaces has been created.</p><p>The Papieri site has been designed to be fully energy-efficient, climate-neutral and sustainable. All power for the site comes from renewable sources. An estimated 40% of its electricity needs is produced onsite using photovoltaic systems and its own hydro power plant on the nearby river. It has a site-wide linked energy network, which provides heating, cooling and electricity directly to each property.</p> <a href="https://www.t

<ul><li>Colombia score three times in an 11-minute span</li><li>US open Copa América campaign on 23 June</li></ul><p>Matt Turner kept falling to the field, the American goalkeeper punching the ground in frustration.<br /><br />
 A defensive lapse by Antonee Robinson and aimless defensive play by Johnny Cardoso, Tim Weah and Cameron Carter-Vickers led to four goals in an embarrassing 5-1 defeat to Colombia in a Copa América warmup match on Saturday.<br /><br />
 “I’m going to apologize to the fans,” Turner said. “That’s not what we’re about. And, yeah, we need to bounce back in a big way.”<br /><br />
 It was the Americans’ first four-goal loss since a 4-0 defeat in a 2016 World Cup qualifier at Costa Rica that caused US Soccer to fire coach Jürgen Klinsmann. It’s the first time since 2009 the USMNT have conceded five goals in a single match on home soil.</p><p>“From the 75th minute on, it was I think a lack of respect for our opponent [and] the game of soccer, what we were doing,” coa

Their weekend ritual involved cleaning the house, and for Mykhed, that often meant being pleasurably distracted by one of their many books. Life was full of things to look forward to: tickets for a Nick Cave concert; his new book, on classic Ukrainian authors, nearly finished. On weekend evenings they’d cook something delicious.

Brexit is the most consequential thing the Conservatives have done since the last election. More, it is the most impactful legacy of their 14-year stretch in power. When the histories are written, every other failure of this Tory era will be a footnote compared with that epic folly.</p><p>With Partygate and all the other scandals on his watch, Boris Johnson recklessly tested Britain’s tolerance for being governed by a prime minster who flagrantly debased standards in public life. With the maxi-disaster of her mini-budget, Liz Truss conducted a deranged experiment that exploded not just in her face, but blew the doors off the country. Ruinous to the Tory party’s reputation as those episodes were, nothing has <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/new-report-reveals-uk-economy-alm

<p>I’m tempted by the ‘Ultimate Mystery Holiday’, if only so I don’t have to make the final decision…</p><p>Once again summer is here and I have forgotten to book a holiday. I don’t know how you lot do it, with your diaries and your dates, and your savings, and your organising the cat, and your knowing what you want, before you want it. It’s not that I don’t want it enough. I want it more than enough. My internal holiday clock begins ticking in the barren dead of winter, a fantasy of beaches and freshly caught fish, but as the clock continues, the rest of me remains static, frozen in indecision and lack of imagination.</p><p>This, I realise now, must be when the rest of you are booking your time off work, scrolling your houses to rent near the sea, negotiating which group of your friends you can live with for a week without upturning the table of ancient relationships, negotiating which of your friends’ children you can live with for a week without… best not say. Good for you. Good fo

<p>With nationalists set for EU election gains, now is not the time for Hungary’s pro-Putin Europhobic leader to take the helm</p><p>Viktor Orbán was his usual poisonous self, spouting toxic twaddle in true Boris Johnson/Nigel Farage style. Hungary’s hard-right prime minister and Europe’s saboteur-in-chief warned supporters at a Budapest rally that, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/hungarys-orban-under-pressure-before-eu-elections/a-69263936">without him, their country would be overrun</a> by millions of illegal migrants and cease to exist as a nation.</p><p>The EU was to blame, he said. The commission was under the spell of his liberal nemesis, the Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros. It was secretly preparing to go to war with Russia over Ukraine. A vote for his ruling party, Fidesz, in this weekend’s European parliamentary polls was the only way to keep the peace.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/09/viktor-orban-hard-right-europe-elec
