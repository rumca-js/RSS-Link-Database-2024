I'm on the road again this week on my Shirtless Season Festival Tour of Europe with The Darkness. I'll be reviewing some of the bands featured on the lineups. PAIN's 'Go With The Flow' is taken from their latest album 'I am'. Apologies for confusing the name of the album with the single right at the start. I blame my Producer......
