Gears of War is returning HUGE with E-day, a prequel to the original Gears of War series. Not only was the reveal trailer looking dark and gritty like many Gears fans requested, but it also featured a much younger Marcus and Dom together in a prequal centered around E-Day, also known as Emergence Day. This isn't a Gears 6 with Kait and the new COG...this is the Gears of War we deserve and have been wanting for years. And Xbox finally listened!
