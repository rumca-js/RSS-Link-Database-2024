It's been a bloodbath for left-wing smear merchants in recent weeks. This is obviously cause for celebration. But why is this happening? And why now? We'll discuss.

We'll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:31 Opening\n01:59 - 16:14 The Nation Rejoices As Another Left-Wing Smear Factory Suffers Mass Layoffs\n17:24 - 23:37 Milwaukee Lovers Go On Defense After Trump 'Attacks' Their City\n23:28 - 29:53 Chicago Mayor Spends Over 30K Of His Campaign Fund", "id": 714675, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3nnHLuzqHk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCO01ytfzgXYy4glnPJm4PPQ", "source_obj__id": 212, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/c3nnHLuzqHk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Nation Rejoices As Another Left-Wing Smear Factory Suffers Mass Layoffs | Ep. 1387", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-14T17:00:23+00:00", "description": "", "id": 714676, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9OJhh-FDWw", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCO01ytfzgXYy4glnPJm4PPQ", "source_obj__id": 212, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/N9OJhh-FDWw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Fatherlessness is the problem", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-14T11:00:07+00:00", "description": "Maybe no one else at the Daily Wire will tell you about it, but I wanted to let you know what is really going on with this story. \n\nBecome a DailyWire+ member and watch the full show: https://bit.ly/4bEQDy6\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos every day. https://www.youtube.com/c/MattWalsh?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch the full episode here: Ep.1386 - https://bit.ly/3KIJz87\n\nStop giving your money to woke corporations that hate you.
