<p>There will be tougher tests ahead, but the Euro 2024 hosts looked brutally efficient in their demolition of Scotland</p><p>That’s the thing about fairytales: they don’t have to make sense in advance. They just start, and implicitly we accept the premise, however far-fetched. A cruel prince is turned into a grotesque beast by a beggar woman bearing an enchanted rose: fine, fine. That pumpkin is actually a carriage: OK, fair enough. Anxious host nation on a run of horrific tournament failures wrap up their opening game within 20 minutes while playing football from the spheres: we’re listening.</p><p>And as the fireworks went off in cities across Germany, as the fan&nbsp;zones rumbled and erupted, as pilsners and radlers were spilled in pub gardens across the land, you could sense a nation slowly and happily coming to terms with its new reality. A reality in which the indignities of the past were buried under fresh flurries of fresh memories. The time for angst and introspection is ov

At the Munich Football Stadium the hosts kicked off Euro 2024 with a kind of pomp-metal power surge, a first half display that produced three goals, a red card for Ryan Porteous, a series of lovely supple passing moves fed through the rhythm section Toni Kroos, and evidence of just how well Nagelsmann has balanced this talented team.</p><p>The opener ended in a 5-1 defeat for a game and persevering Scotland, but it was packed away in those 10 first-half minutes that brought goals from Florian Wirtz and the impressive Jamal Musiala.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/14/germany-scotland-euro-2024-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

From downtempo, guitar-strummed folk to programmed synths on 2015’s <em>Grey Tickles, Black Pressure</em> and the eerie electronic textures of 2021’s <em>Boy from Michigan</em>, a new Grant album typically heralds a sound few expect.</p><p>His sixth album, <em>The Art of the Lie, </em>follows suit. Supplanting folk for funk and cloaking his silky voice in layers of vocoder, these 11 tracks present a glorious new direction. Opener <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IjCTCEp8MM">All That School for Nothing</a> sets an infectiously grooving tone, pairing an earthy bass line with Grant’s synthesised voice, invoking P-funk master George Clinton.

<p>Co-founded before photo work was taken seriously as art, this Berlin venue is marking its half-century by celebrating the history of its collection – and the medium itself</p><p>When Annette Kicken’s late husband, Rudolf, founded a photo gallery in Aachen, Germany, in 1974, appreciation of photography as an art&nbsp;form was rare. Major German photographic museums, such as Museum Ludwig in Cologne or C/O&nbsp;Berlin, were years away from opening. In the UK, the National Portrait Gallery had only just appointed its first curator of photography. In the US, the Metropolitan Museum of Art would not establish a department of photographs until 1992. The number of&nbsp;galleries and collectors devoted to the medium was so small that they referred to themselves as an international “photo family”.</p><p>“It was a very, very small scene,” says Kicken, who joined the gallery in 1999. “There were very few institutional exhibitions. There was no market. Artists were forgotten, and their work wa

<p>Who could resist lemony beans, garlicky chorizo and fried breaded cheese? </p><p>Broad beans, or <em>habas</em>, are one of the highlights of the vegetable calendar. The season is short, though, so make the most of them, especially when they’re young, small and tender.
