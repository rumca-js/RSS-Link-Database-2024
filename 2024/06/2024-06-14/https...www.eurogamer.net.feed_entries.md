Sure, everyone's excited about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>'s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but do you what's <em>more</em> exciting than Elden Ring's Shadow of the Ertree DLC? New hairdos, that's what! And FromSoftware is adding a bunch of them in a free update arriving next Thursday, 20th June.
</p><p>
It sounds like a bit of a biggie too, combining a day-one patch for Shadow of the Erdtree alongside various improvements for the base game. As detailed on Elden Ring's <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1801616168299499599">social media feed</a>, it brings bug fixes, balance adjustments, plus a number of new features.

With the update installed, for instance, it'll finally be possible to see all your recently acquired items at a glance (previously, new items just vanished into pile, making it a

After flinging itself around the Scottish hills in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-highland-song-review">A Highland Song</a> and doing a spot of linguistic archaeology in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavens-vault-review-a-rich-web-of-possibility">Heaven's Vault</a>, developer Inkle has announced it'll soon be catapulting back to 1922 where a mystery is waiting to be solved at Miss Mulligatawney's School for Promising Girls.
</p><p>
Inkle hasn't exactly explained what Miss Mulligatawney's School for Promising Girls is just yet, but there are clues to be found over on Steam, where the developer has tagged the game's<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2963890/Miss_Mulligatawneys_School_for_Promising_Girls/"> newly surfaced store listing</a> with the labels, "Investigation", "Interactive Fiction", "Comic Book", and "2D".

More details have come to light on the cancelled standalone spin-off for acclaimed RPG Disco Elysium. 
</p><p>
Back in February, it was revealed that work on this expansion, codenamed X7, had been stopped, along with news of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">layoffs at developer ZA/UM</a>. At this time, it was claimed the expansion was only "one to two years away from completion".

As well being a game with fascinating technology in its own right, with so many developers jumping on the UE5 bandwagon it seems inevitable that Hellblade 2 will be instructive for future developers. There's a lot that the game gets right which ought to be copied wholesale, while other elements might be best avoided. </p><p>Let's start with a strongly positive element, and that's the user experience you'll notice when first starting up Hellblade 2. Before the game starts, you have the chance to change important presentation options, including sound and display settings. It can be frustrating when a game starts with incorrect default

Square Enix has released a launch trailer for Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail, giving a new look at the MMORPG expansion's story.
</p><p>
Until now, we've only been given details of the story at the Fan Fest events from director and producer Naoki Yoshida, along with a CGI trailer of the expansion's new setting and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrails-adorable-new-job-revealed">Jobs</a>.

This launch trailer provides an in-game look at what players can expect from the world of Tural: from stormy seas, to cyberpunk cities. Check it out below.

## Demonschool is Persona meets Buffy and I love its 90s vibes

Buffy and her friends were off slaying vampires and demons and investigating strange happenings that mysteriously occurred repeatedly in this one school, but her peers remained seemingly oblivious. At least, until that prom episode where they finally bothered to thank her.
</p><p>There's a similar occurrence in Demonschool, except here it's baked into the narrative. There are demons at school - surprise(!), unless the name gave it away - but none of the students are aware, their minds wiped of any and all knowledge. It's up to a crack team of demon slaying students with special powers to thwart their teachers and find out why.
</p><p>Demonschool is a blend of 90s vibes and Buffy-esque storytelling with Persona-inspir

During my three quarters of an hour or so with Astro Bot I just about cleared all of its demo. I say "just about" because, while the main missions accessed from its galaxy-style menu were a family-friendly breeze, a couple of other hidden, bonus missions were far from it, offering a challenge to rival some PlayStation platformers of old (looking at you, Crash Bandicoot).</p><p>"This level in particular," explains Nicolas Doucet, Asobi studio founder and creative director of Astro Bot, while noodling around in an early, flamingo-themed world, "we want it to be enjoyable for everyone - but potentially, for a very, very young child, we almost wanted i

The rumoured Final Fantasy Tactics remaster is reportedly real, according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier.
</p><p>
Rumours of a remaster of the cult PS1 classic began back in 2021 after an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidia-acknowledges-leaked-pc-game-list-including-god-of-war-and-final-fantasy-7-remake">infamous Nvidia leak</a> included a list of datamined yet-to-be-announced games - including Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy 9 alongside the now-released Chrono Cross remaster, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, and more.
</p><p>
The likelihood of a Tactics remaster, however, was pulled into question earlier this week when renowned leaker <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1801044892300267796">Midori revealed themselves to be a fraud</a>. They had recently been posting about Tactics, but fans have since been considering thei

After the reveal of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-announces-new-astrobot-game">Astro Bot on PlayStation 5</a> at the recent State of Play, Astro's Playroom received an update adding iconic Bloodborne boss Lady Maria and an associated trophy.

</p><p>
Of course, this led to speculation from Bloodborne fans that something was afoot. Alas, it appears that's not the case.

"There's no secret meaning," Team Asobi studio head and creative director Nicolas Doucet told Eurogamer. "It's just a celebration of the whole PlayStation history."
