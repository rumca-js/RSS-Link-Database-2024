<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone</p> <p>Today i have setup vaultwarden and Nginx Proxy Manager (npm) in docker containers and i also configured fail2ban on the docker host. For my vaultwarden docker container i did not expose any port to the docker host instead the Vaultwarden and npm are on the same docker network, meaning i just pointed port 80 of Vaultwarden to the desired domain name in npm. To access Vaultwarden via <a href="https://vault.domain.com">https://vault.domain.com</a> i have exposed port 443 on my router which is mapped to port 443 on the docker host which is pointing to npm. My fail2ban configuration for npm is for every port meaning 3 failed attemps within 1h for any port will result in a 24h IP-address ban from all services. The problem i have is that fail2ban keeps banning my default gatway for my local lan. It bans the ipv4 private gateway for the docker host meaning i can not access Vaultwarden from my home network.</p> <p>I could exclude the gateway

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey there.</p> <p>As the title states, I was wondering how y'all manage CPU/memory usage when using docker-compose. I'm self-hosting a bunch of services on a RPI 4 (4 GB RAM) on an SSD and it's quite a frequent occurrence that when Immich is running machine learning, it maxes out all of the CPU, therefore AdGuard Home and not even SSH works anymore.</p> <p>How can I prevent this? Ideally I'd want all the containers to have as much CPU as they want, except for maybe reserving some for the host machine itself and then also whenever another container wants some CPU, it should be distributed among them somehow.</p> <p>I'm quite a newbie in self-hosting and I've tried searching for solutions, but nothing seems to fit exactly what I need (either soft limit, reservations don't really resolve this issue, can't limit CPU usage for Docker in general, ...).</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sque

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have a 2 nas and my main server, there are plenty of small and large file transfers. Small being 10s of MB and larger being 10-20GB in size. Speed isn't the most important thing, i just don't like the idea of maxing it to the point where anything else would be of a hindrance to the transfer. Because it could be multiple files moving back and forth simultaneously, would I be better off with 4x1Gbe per nas, or would I be better off having a 10Gbe connection? Obviously 10Gbe would be faster than the 1Gbe but I didn't want any type of congestion on the port. I am not sure exactly how that operates. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/natethegreat141990"> /u/natethegreat141990 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dfuwbc/lag_or_better_gbe/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dfuwbc/lag_or_better_gbe/">[comments]</a><

My intent was to have different libraries for different media- ie a Books, Graphic Novels, Comics, Manga, etc. I uploaded my Comic Omnibus collection, and it automatically states that it's all in a series and has given it a series order. Obviously, that's not the case for these.
