<p>European banking executives are increasingly concerned about the growing dependence of big U.S. tech firms on integrated artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services. Substantial computing power is needed for AI, and many banks believe they will struggle to operate AI independently. They fear a shift towards “Big Tech” and “Big Cloud” due to AI adoption requirements.</p><p>These concerns were widely discussed at a <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91137645/ai-banking-requires-computing-power-that-only-big-tech-can-provide-this-worries-fintech-execs" rel="nofollow">recent fintech conference in Amsterdam</a>. I wish I had been there to remind them that they have direct control of the technology they deploy, and large companies and cloud providers don’t have a monopoly on AI.

<p>What's new this (half-)month in Python and elsewhere? First up is Monkeytype, an Instagram-created library with a somewhat silly name. What's not silly is using it to add type hints automatically to untyped Python code. We also have five lesser-known tools for data science, a chance to go feet-first into Django 5 without getting swamped, and another look at Python 3.13, whose second beta has arrived. Sadly, you still gotta compile it from source to try out the bleeding-edge goodies.</p><h2>Top picks for Python readers on InfoWorld</h2>
