<p>&ldquo;The desktop PC is dying.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve been hearing for decades&mdash;hell, at this point there might even be writers covering desktop PCs who&rsquo;ve heard it their entire lives.</p>



<p>But Qualcomm&rsquo;s push for Arm hardware and Intel&rsquo;s somewhat frantic defense of the x86 has lots of people repeating it again. At Computex, Adam picked the brain of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@GamersNexus&amp;xcust=2-1-2368291-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Steve from GamersNexus</a> on this topic.</p>



<p>In the consumer market, standalone desktop PCs are going to remain a small slice of the pie compared to laptops. But what&rsquo;s prompted this speculation is Qualcomm&rsquo;s latest generation of Snapdragon chips and <a href="https://www.pc

<p>Microsoft has decided to pull its controversial Recall feature from the initial wave of Copilot+ PCs and fully test it via the Windows Insider program before it lands on customer PCs.</p>



<p>According to a June 13th update to a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/&amp;xcust=2-1-2367480-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> Microsoft originally published on June 7th, Recall will now be released as a preview to the Insider program &ldquo;in the coming weeks.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Everyone knows the CAPCHA tests on websites where you either have to click on numerous pictures of cars, traffic lights, or bicycles, enter confusing combinations of numbers and letters or simply click to confirm that you&rsquo;re not a robot. There used to be so many of these tests that it was downright annoying, especially if you needed several attempts.</p>



<p>But have you ever asked yourself whether a robot or an AI could also pass these tests? How does the CAPTCHA know that it was filled in by a human? And what does the term even stand for? Let&rsquo;s clear up this mystery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-does-captcha-stand-for">What does CAPTCHA stand for?</h2>
