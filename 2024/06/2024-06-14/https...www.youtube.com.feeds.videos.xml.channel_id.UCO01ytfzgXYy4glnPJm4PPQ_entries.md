Today on the Matt Walsh Show, first Media Matters had mass layoffs and now the Southern Poverty Law Center has followed suit. It's been a bloodbath for left-wing smear merchants in recent weeks. This is obviously cause for celebration. But why is this happening? And why now? We'll discuss. Also, Donald Trump is accused of saying unkind things about Milwaukee. The story is total nonsense, but it has forced the Left to pretend that they love Milwaukee, which has been funny to watch. Plus, a major scandal in the world of professional sports. And, an alleged "trad wife" becomes a viral sensation after saying the n-word. This is an important story, we're told. We'll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show
