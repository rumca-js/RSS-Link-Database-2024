Such was its impact that it helped to change the law around what juries are allowed to consider when deliberating on rape cases.</p><p>The writer Suzie Miller, who spent 15 years as a lawyer, has since expanded the play into a novel, in which she fills in the gaps in protagonist Tessa Ensler’s life before she became a junior barrister specialising in sexual assault cases.

For so long, merely the phrase “Milton Keynes” was a punchline; this “new town’, established in 1967, was inhabited only by the spiritually adrift, depressed newlyweds and some cows made of concrete. Those days of mega-LOLs about the mighty MK may have passed, but there’s still something oddly futuristic about Unity Place, a new “destination for dining, work and leisure” just two minutes across a pedestrianised square from Milton Keynes station, and where Anand has set up shop selling her delicious Punjabi and south Indian menu with a smattering of modern British-Indian favourites.

<p>With warmer weather comes an explosion of growth – so make sure your plants get the ingredients they need to sustain it</p><p>One of my earliest gardening memories is of tomato feed: the dark brown potion that left a&nbsp;sticky residue, the ritual of pouring it into the watering can and diluting it like squash. Most of all, it’s an olfactory memory: there’s something Proustian about tomato feed, of hot greenhouse stuffiness and being small. It’s one of the key smells of summer for me.</p><p>This is partially down to my grandad, who was a Percy Thrower type, growing tomatoes in his greenhouse and trails of sweet peas for&nbsp;my grandmother. Photographic evidence attests that he merrily let my siblings and me run around with beanpoles without a care in the world. But it’s also because even fair-weather gardeners, like my mother was when we were children, can be persuaded to feed plants in the warmer months.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jun/14/i

<p>A sense of dread hangs over this gripping short-story collection, the author’s first collection in English</p><p>María Bastarós likes to bring her short stories to a moment of crisis then leave them hanging in mid-air: a shotgun-wielding husband confronts his wife and her lover; a father discovers his twin teenage daughters having sex with his boss; an encounter between a&nbsp;girl and a gang of boys teeters on the&nbsp;edge of assault. These are endings that might, in other hands, leave a reader feeling cheated and wanting three more pages, but Bastarós is so good, her stories so darkly compelling, that personal predilections evaporate in the heat of her talent.</p><p>Bastarós has published four books&nbsp;in Spain, but this is her first appearance in English (translated by Kevin Gerry Dunn). Set mostly in the lonely, arid landscapes of northern Spain, where the desert “plays games that no one understands”, and swallows the careless whole, the presiding mood of&nbsp;these tales is

<p>Young people abandoned mainstream parties in last weekend’s European elections – a sign that their anxieties are not being heard</p><p>That far-right parties fared well in the European elections came as no surprise – surveys had consistently foretold their triumph. The populist right has been on the rise in Europe – through democratic elections – for the past two decades. Thus, 2024’s vote is a natural culmination of a long trend. The combined vote for far-right parties secured them a fourth of the seats in the European parliament – on par with the largest group, the centre-right European People’s party.</p><p>But we are nonetheless witnessing something new: the first signs of a populist insurrection of the young.

<p>Audiences at the time had to deal with the shock of seeing the actors’ old faces in this weighty but fun threequel that dealt with the mysteries of matter, death and eternal life</p><p>Forty years ago, the Star Trek movie franchise reached its Solaris stage with this mystic and melodramatic threequel, written and produced by TV veteran Harve Bennett and directed by Leonard Nimoy himself. The Search for Spock (and how that title must have startled everyone still getting over the shock of his demise) dealt with the mysteries of matter, organisms, death and eternal life. The last two of these were especially piquant considering that the audiences at the time had to deal with something that is forgotten now: the unease and even shock at seeing the characters’ faces, so youthful in the concurrently running TV show, looking suddenly older, blown up to big-screen size.</p><p>This is a film about the passionate bromance between Kirk and Spock – and above all about sacrifice.

<p>The true story of one Jewish family’s attempt to evade the Nazis, and a South Korean reality show that’s like a supernatural Crystal Maze – and looks set to become a cult hit</p><p>It is late 1930s Poland and the Kurc family are drinking “to future adventures”. But the next decade will be more traumatic than they can possibly imagine. This drama, based on Georgia Hunter’s novel, tells the true story of one Jewish family’s attempts to evade the Nazis and stay together while they cross continents in search of safety. It feels a touch too glossy to capture the desperation of the situation as it was really experienced, but it does a good job of tracing the gradually escalating climate of fear as the horrors faced by both the family and the wider Jewish community become clear. Joey King and Logan Lerman star as the siblings at the heart of the story. <em><br />
