Substantial computing power is needed for AI, and many banks believe they will struggle to operate AI independently. They fear a shift towards \u201cBig Tech\u201d and \u201cBig Cloud\u201d due to AI adoption requirements.</p><p>These concerns were widely discussed at a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91137645/ai-banking-requires-computing-power-that-only-big-tech-can-provide-this-worries-fintech-execs\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent fintech conference in Amsterdam</a>. I wish I had been there to remind them that they have direct control of the technology they deploy, and large companies and cloud providers don\u2019t have a monopoly on AI. My best advice would be to calm down and remain objective enough to recognize there\u2019s a reasonable path forward.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3715509/does-ai-", "id": 711239, "language": "en-us", "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715509/does-ai-make-us-dependent-on-big-tech.html#tk.rss_all", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "http://www.infoworld.com/index.rss", "source_obj__id": 151, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2024/04/shutterstock_1620742195-100963077-small.jpg", "title": "Does AI make us dependent on Big Tech?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-14T09:00:00+00:00", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>What's new this (half-)month in Python and elsewhere? First up is Monkeytype, an Instagram-created library with a somewhat silly name. What's not silly is using it to add type hints automatically to untyped Python code. We also have five lesser-known tools for data science, a chance to go feet-first into Django 5 without getting swamped, and another look at Python 3.13, whose second beta has arrived. Sadly, you still gotta compile it from source to try out the bleeding-edge goodies.</p><h2>Top picks for Python readers on InfoWorld</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/video/117954/how-to-auto-generate-python-type-hints-with-monkeytype\">Auto-generate Python type hints with Monkeytype</a></strong><br />Sick of those no-type-hinted-Python-code blues?
