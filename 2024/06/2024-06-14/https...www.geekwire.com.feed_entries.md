As this year&#8217;s presidential race unfolds — with heightened concerns around disinformation — the watchdog group is no longer active and the Stanford program that participated in it is &#8220;dismantling,&#8221; according to a report this week from tech news site Platformer. But researchers with the UW&#8217;s Center for an Informed Public (CIP) say they&#8217;re committed to continuing their efforts. &#8220;Our UW team&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/uw-disinformation-researchers-will-continue-work-amid-reports

A court document filed on June 13 stated that Zillow Group and the defendants — Arizona Regional Multiple Listing Service, Wisconsin&#8217;s Metro Multiple Listing Service, and MLS Aligned, an MLS collaboration which developed Aligned Showings — have reached an agreement in principle that will result in the dismissal of claims once finalized. In December,&#160;Zillow filed a lawsuit&#160;alleging that plans to remove ShowingTime from ARMLS and Metro MLS — and replace it&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/zillow-group-and-multiple-listing-firms-reach-settlement-in-showingtime-lawsuit/">Read

When they return, their EV battery is topped off. The technology that could make this vision a reality includes autonomous robots being developed by the Autev team that charge electric vehicles without human assistance. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a gas can on wheels,&#8221; said Syd Manna, co-founder and chief operations officer at Autev. The device is essentially a giant, mobile battery outfitted with navigational sensors to help it independently maneuver to a vehicle, and it has&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-entrepreneurs-are-building-autonomous-robots-to-deliver-hassle-free-ev-charging/">Read More</a>
