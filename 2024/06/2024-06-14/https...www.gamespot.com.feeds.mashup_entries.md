<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fear-the-spotlight/">Fear The Spotlight</a> starts like many good horror stories. A couple of friends--nerdy goody-goody Vivian and her goth pal Amy--sneak into school after-hours to perform a séance. The school has a creepy history, after all, thanks to a fire a few years earlier that claimed the lives of several students. It's a bit morbid and disrespectful to try to contact the spirits of a bunch of kids in the school library, but hey, teenagers are morbid and disrespectful.</p><p dir="ltr">I played a short demo of Fear The Spotlight at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/summer-game-fest-2024/">Summer Game Fest 2024's Play Days event</a>, and at first, that was the thing that stuck with me most--at least, at first. Sneaking through the halls of the school and listening to conversations between protagonist Vivian and Amy, the whole thing felt pretty natural and realistic.

<p dir="ltr">The 2024 Formula One season is finally heating up. Max Verstappen will probably still win a fourth successive driver's championship after the final race in December, but at least the rest of the field is making life more taxing for the dominant Dutchman and his Red Bull team. Recent races have been more competitive and unpredictable, with multiple teams battling for first place in any given race weekend. It should be the perfect time for F1 24 to launch, but the same excitement generated by the real-life product doesn't quite apply to Codemaster's latest. It's still an excellent racing game, especially when you factor in an overhauled Driver Career mode, but its overt familiarity means there are fewer reasons than ever to upgrade if you own F1 23.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4319697-ss_54eaf8552dc23a87b7e66c97b319a6c201a7b3a9.1920x1080.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/u

<p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blue-beetle-review-spared-lots-of-expense/1900-6418104/">Blue Beetle</a> movie had a very modest $130.8 million worldwide take when it hit theaters last year.

Rhaenyra was announced as heir by her father, the deceased King Viserys Targaryen (Paddy Considine), when she was a teenager. His wife Alicent believes that he changed his mind on his deathbed and had her son Aegon take the throne instead. In Season 1, the two sides were readying resources to go to battle until Rhaenyra'

<p>A great movie trailer can single handedly turn a movie into a success story--like <a href="https://youtu.be/IvNkGm8mxiM?si=Y1tC_nsTh6BmbodC">that genius Cloverfield trailer</a> in 2007 that didn't say what the title of the movie was. But it's more common these days, I'd argue, for a trailer to have the opposite impact. A generic trailer can so thoroughly dampen hype for a film that something like Furiosa, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga-review-a-whole-new-gear/1900-6418226/">a great movie </a>everybody likes that's a sequel to a great movie everybody likes, could become a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-director-weighs-in-on-furiosas-box-office-miss/1100-6523750/">major box office disappointment</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Furiosa was the second big financial letdown in May after The Fall Guy kicked the month off with a similarly low-key box office take, and both will end up coming in well below the numbers that summer blockbusters are sup

<p>Artificial intelligence, or AI, is one of the most-discussed news topics in recent years. Seemingly everyone is weighing in with their thoughts on how AI might change the world--from video games and movies to politics and more. Now, the Pope has shared his thoughts during the G7 Summit in Italy.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2024-06/pope-g7-artifical-intelligence-objective-neutral.html">Vatican News</a>, the Pope said AI is a "true cognitive-industrial revolution" that he believes will lead to "complex epochal transformations."</p><p>He said AI could lead to transformations that are both good and bad.
