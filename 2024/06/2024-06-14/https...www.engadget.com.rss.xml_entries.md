<p>If you regularly stare at the Steam charts to see if there’s anything new and exciting to play, you may have noticed an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/">odd little “game” called <em>Banana</em></a>. It has quickly become a huge success and, as of this writing, sits at the number three spot with over 400,000 concurrent players. It’s a simple idle clicker game, like many before it, so what’s making players flock to what amounts to a static screen of a huge banana?</p>
<p>The promise of sweet, sweet cash, that’s what. It’s an extremely bare-bones title that has you repeatedly clicking on a banana. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0OSfbPJFa4">That’s pretty much it</a>, though there’s a twist. As you click and click on the tropical fruit, there’s a chance of a banana sticker dropping into your Steam inventory. These bananas come in all different designs, from silver-encrusted variants to one that looks like it's glitching out from a hack.</p>

## Metaphor: ReFantazio feels like a JRPG free from restraint and sanity

<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazi</em>o has been a long time in the making. It was announced in 2017 as<em> Project re Fantas</em>y through a weird long video that said very little. Since then, Atlus has swapped the Project for Metaphor and scoured Google Translate to find a cool way to say ‘fantasy.’ It’s also made a giant fantasy JRPG — and after rolling through a demo at Summer Game Fest last weekend, I’m dying to play it.</p>
<p><em>ReFantazio </em>is the first original title by Studio Zero, a relatively new Atlus division headed up by Katsura Hashino. As the director of the third, fourth and fifth Persona game, Hashino is responsible for the Persona series’ pivot towards social simulation elements. After finishing up <em>Persona 5</em>, Hashino left P-Studio to work on all-new titles unrelated to Atlus’ Shin Megami Tensei and Persona series.</p>

## Neva hands-on: A grand achievement in emotional game design

<p><em>Neva </em>is going to make me cry. It very nearly did at Summer Game Fest, as the game’s introductory cinematics faded to black, literally just one minute into my time with the demo. I won’t divulge what happens in those initial frames, but it shattered my soul. It also perfectly primed me for the heart-pounding danger and devastating beauty that I would get lost in for the next 45 minutes, alongside my new best friend, Neva the wolf.</p>
<figure><img alt="Neva" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/4ea25130-2a77-11ef-bf50-dd24875eb351" style="height: 2160px; width: 3840px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nomada Studio</div></figure>
<p>Every aspect of <em>Neva </em>is breathtaking. It plays like a living watercolor illustration: Alba, the protagonist, has long, slender limbs, a cloud of silver hair and a flowing red cloak that drapes behind her elegantly with each leap and fall. Neva is a young white wolf, fluffy and energetic, and the

<p>For years, the iPhone’s two-tiered texting system has been a hot topic. iPhone-to-iPhone texts in the Messages app are blue, and enjoy full encryption and more robust media features, like animations. But messages to and from Android devices are merely standard SMS texts, and marked with a green tint. Apple’s segregated messaging platform has been the subject of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-takes-a-snarky-shot-at-apple-over-rcs-in-its-latest-ad-181313519.html"><ins>Google-funded shaming campaign</ins></a>, and even sparked chatter of regulatory intervention. But with Apple’s recent confirmation that it will begin supporting the newer RCS texting standard in iOS 18, is the iPhone messaging playing field about to be leveled? Or are we just exchanging one acronym for another?</p>
<p>Confused? Don’t worry. We’re about to lay out what could change with Apple’s adoption of the GSMA’s next-generation messaging protocol.</p>
