I saw this model and some suggestions so I replicated it. SUNLU Marble PLA Filament for the sculpture and SUNLU White Matte PLA for the skull. Use Grecian Gold Rub-n-Buff to color the skull using Q-tips etc. so that it looks like it was cast in metal. Then glue together making sure to start from the bottom up holding each piece in the proper position until the glue sets.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ashaneharris"> /u/ashaneharris </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just got a Bambu Lab A1 mini with the AMS for my first 3d printer. I‚Äôm absolutely LOVING this thing and can‚Äôt wait to get into making my own 3d models.</p> <p>Whenever the printer purges old filament to switch to a new color (or for whatever other reasons that I don‚Äôt know yet), I get this glob of filament. Over time, I can tell this is really gonna build up. My question is: what do y‚Äôall do with your globs of filament? It feels kind of wasteful to just throw it away. Is there a company that takes it for recycling?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I just seen they have gone down in price to ¬£169 which is crazy considering I paid nearly that for a ender 2 pro.

And any accessories I should get with it like a .6 nozzle?</p> <p>I sell models and lately my main printer EN4 has been going full steam with abs and CF pla but I want something thats better than any old printer and quick for my own prototyping or even to print other soldstuff when the EN4 is running as I'm starting to get backed up and I can only manage 3-4 prints a day with the abs prints. </p> <p>I'd love the ams lite but I don't have space for it really so is that easy to upgrade in the future or should I bite the bullet now and get it with it to save money? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/XxST4RxREAPERxX"> /u/X
