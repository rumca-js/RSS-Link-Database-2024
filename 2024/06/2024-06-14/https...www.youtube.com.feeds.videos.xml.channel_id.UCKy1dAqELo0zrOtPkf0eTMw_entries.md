Destiny 2: The Final Shape reviewed by Travis Northup on PC and Xbox Series X|S, also available on Xbox One and PlayStation.

Destiny 2’s potential was clear from the first time I blasted my way through The Red War seven years ago, but Bungie never actually realized much of that potential until The Final Shape. This finale expansion’s story largely succeeds at delivering a satisfying ending, the raid is brutal and epic, the Prismatic subclasses breathe fresh life into combat, and the new enemy faction adds some much-needed variety to the things you’ll spend hours shooting in the face. None of that makes Destiny’s avalanche of confusing RPG systems, currencies, and storylines any easier to digest – but for the first time in a long while, I can wholeheartedly recommend pushing through that darkness, because there’s now a bright and beaming light at the end of the tunnel.

Path of Exile 2 recently gave us some hands-on time with the Witch class. The Path of Exile 2 Witch gameplay is a bit different than in the original as there are two variations to the character. There's the Sorceress and the Witch. This time, we jumped in as the Witch to try out the corpse-reviving menace and we are hooked. Path of Exile 2 can't come fast enough.

The Boys Season 4 premiere, reviewed by Matt Donato. Narrated by Ronny Barrier.

The Boys Season 4 slinks back to basics in a less-than-impressive but still substantial three-part premiere that hinges on dilemmas that have been part of the show from the very beginning. Butcher’s motivations have always been narcissistically bleak, and his Boys have often paid the consequences, but Season 4 heaps the heartache on even heavier. It’s back to the drawing board, but no one erased the original formulas. Season 4 is off to a stable start under Nice Guy Butcher’s shot-calling; I just wish the show didn’t taste like microwaved leftovers from a bomb-as-hell dinner.
