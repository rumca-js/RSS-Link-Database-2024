<p>Researchers have introduced a novel approach called natural language embedded programs (NLEPs) to improve the numerical and symbolic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The technique involves prompting LLMs to generate and execute Python programs to solve user queries, then output solutions in natural language. While LLMs like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive performance on<a class="excerpt-read-more" href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/2024/06/14/nleps-bridging-the-gap-between-llms-symbolic-reasoning/" title="ReadNLEPs: Bridging the gap between LLMs and symbolic reasoning">...

<p>The European Union recently introduced the AI Act, a new governance framework compelling organisations to enhance transparency regarding their AI systems&#8217; training data. Should this legislation come into force, it could penetrate the defences that many in Silicon Valley have built against such detailed scrutiny of AI development and deployment processes.
