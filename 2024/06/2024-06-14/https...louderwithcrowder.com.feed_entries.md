Socrates is most famous for his line of questioning, known as the Socratic method. This format is meant to reach the truth through questions and answers, and the left does not have truth on their side and they also hate it when people question their insanity. </p><p>These two philosophers are responsible for the underlying philosophy that created the greatest civilizations in history, but the left also hates that. </p><p>And when you combine that with the current state of the higher education sy

They try to scare anyone they can throw a label on to make them believe they are personally under attack by the other side. They can’t just label people as “human” and be done with it, they must throw them into a box so they can play their victim game. </p><p>Oh, you're fat? Victim. You're a woman? Victim. Immigrant? Victim. Fast food employee? VICTIM. </p><p>There are quite a few who fall for this, namely naive voters. </p><p>You only have to have the least bit

If someone replaced the nougat-filled clusters with laxatives as a prank. Sadly, no one is being punk'd. This is our actual president, wandering off from the other world leaders and having old man meltdowns. Though, in defense of the old man meltdown, it was at the press. </p><p>Biden held a joint press conference with DNC Chairman Volodymyr Zelenskyy to announce a deal to give Ukraine MOAR of our tax dollars over the next ten years. It would have been nice if there had been some pushback from the pre

And if someone even thinks about flying a flag unrelated to sexual preferences, the left goes insane. </p><p>Lately, progressives have been crying over Justice Samuel Alito and his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, flying flags they disapprove of. Unclear if the people upset over this have anything better to do, but here we are, talking ab
