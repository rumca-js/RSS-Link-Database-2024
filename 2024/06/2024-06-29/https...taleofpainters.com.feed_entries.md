<p>Skaventide is finally here, heralding the looming Vermindoom that will shape the narrative of the 4th Edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar. In this review, we're unboxing what might be the "most complete" launch box of all time and taking a closer look at the models of the Stormcast Eternals and Skaven. What options can be found on the sprues? Which models share sprues and are likely exclusive to Skaventide? How do the Clanrats and Liberators compare to their older incarnations? All this and much more in part 1 of our unboxing.</p>
