<p><strong>Pyramid stage</strong> <br />The Mercury prize-winning north London rapper aces the sweet-spot slot before headliners Coldplay</p><p>Last time Little Simz played at Glastonbury, she told a packed-out West Holts crowd that she’d see them next time at the Pyramid stage. It wasn’t an empty threat – over the last decade or so, she’s consistently outdone herself, releasing a string of acclaimed records, including the Mercury prize-winning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/18/mercury-prize-little-simz-wins-for-sometimes-i-might-be-introvert">Sometimes I Might Be Introvert</a>, touring all over the world and staking herself as one of the UK’s strongest rappers both on home turf and further afield. Though she’s not at the top of the bill tonight, she has indeed made it to the Pyramid, in the sweet spot before headliners Coldplay.</p><p>Despite the scatters of Coldplay T-shirts at the barrier, the packed-out crowd feels absolutely hers.

<p>Serb roars back to competition after a knee injury in Paris to do battle with young bucks vying for slam silverware</p><p>As Novak Djokovic cleared out his locker room and made his sad departure from the French Open 25 days ago, weeks of uncertainty seemed to lay ahead. Early in his dramatic fourth round-match against Francisco Cerundolo, Djokovic slipped on the clay and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/04/novak-djokovic-withdraws-french-open-knee-injury-tennis">tore his medial meniscus in his knee</a>. Considering he had deliberated over his previous elbow surgery for months, his decision to immediately commit to knee surgery underlined that time was not on his side.</p><p>Instead, he is back.

<p>(Blue Note)<br />This three-movement album from pianist and shaman Nduduzo Makhathini’s trio combines blues, bop and folk song to transcendental effect</p><p>The title of this third Blue Note release from South African pianist Nduduzo Makhathini is the name of a Zulu goddess, “a regulator of nature, light and fertility”. It’s a name that isn’t evoked lightly – Makhathini, aside from being a startlingly original pianist, is a fully initiated <em>sangoma</em><em>, </em>a shaman and healer, and his quest is spiritual.</p><p>His previous two albums, since landing on Blue Note in 2020, have been horn-heavy, suffused with the ecstatic spirit of 1960s Coltrane. Here he brings a lighter touch, playing as a trio alongside Cuban-born drummer Francisco Mela and bassist Zwelakhe-Duma Bell le Pere, an American of South African descent. The album is no less entrancing than its predecessors, its 11 tracks arranged as a three-part movement, moving from Libations to Water Spirits to Inner Attainmen

<p>Two all-time Canadian favourites to celebrate Canada Day: a proper, weighty pie of ham hock and spiced mince, and traditional tarts with a buttery, caramelised currant filling</p><p>Canada is a vast country with a diverse population, both indigenous and immigrant. That makes it hard to come up with a definitive answer to the question: what is a typical Canadian dish? However, butter tarts and <em>tourtière</em> will both be recognisable to most Canadians, and are a great way to celebrate the country’s food on Canada Day on July 1. The celebrations usually revolve around the barbecue, with burgers, ribs and hotdogs always winners and bright yellow mustard always present, but there’s no reason a big meat pie and butter tarts can’t also feature, not least because they’re always a good idea at any time of year. At Labombe, the wine bar at <a href="https://trivetrestaurant.co.uk/">my restaurant Trivet</a> in London, we’ll be celebrating Canada Day with lobster rolls, poutine and bloody

According to Trump, Russia’s president discussed the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. “When Putin saw that, he said, you know what, I think we’re going to go in and maybe take my – this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream.” That dream, of course, is the conquest of Ukraine as the restoration of the major piece of the collapsed Soviet Union after the cold war.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/a

<p>Each government has been a challenge, each leader sillier and more ruinous than the last. But even cartoonists crave a bit of boring earnestness sometimes</p><p>For the past five weeks people have repeatedly said to me, “You must be really busy!” I’ve had to explain that elections aren’t like that; in fact, from the point of view of cartoonists, they’re boring. The only real fun comes when the wheels fall off the party machines and their careful choreography collapses into farce. But in this election even the Tories’ serial <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/17/d-day-leaflets-tory-troops-conservatives">weapons-grade balls-ups</a> are becoming a bore, serving merely to remind me of the universal truth that reality will always, always be weirder than anything satire could think up in a million years.</p><p>That said, in the empty hours of this interminable death watch while we’ve waited for the Tory tumbril finally to trundle to the guillotine, I’ve b

<p>It’s got billionaires, world champions and director Ridley Scott on board. But would an athletics competition where taking drugs is encouraged put the honesty back in sport – or cause rifts, risks and addictions?</p><p>It’s summer 2025. A large athletics stadium somewhere in Europe buzzes with crowds of people. Down on the track, eight men line up for the 100m final. Eight men pumped full of performance-enhancing drugs. Up in the control room, director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/ridley-scott">Ridley Scott</a> is asking for closeups on their faces. One of these men is about to obliterate Usain Bolt’s 100m world record, which has stood for over 15 years. Perhaps they all are. It’s certainly possible: just the day before, a host of men ran the marathon in under two hours. The world record for the mile, which has stood for over a quarter of a century, has just been beaten by a guy with bionic implants in his legs. Out in the centre field, a javelin thrower wearing AI gla

<p>President’s decision to drop finance bill after deadly violence leaves protesters divided over how to achieve broader goals</p><p>Kenya’s youth-driven, leaderless protest movement finds itself at a crossroads this weekend, buoyed up by President William Ruto’s surprise decision on Wednesday to abandon a finance bill containing planned tax rises even as it mourns those killed in deadly violence the day before.</p><p>The movement that brought thousands of people out on to the streets in recent weeks, against the backdrop of a cost of a living crisis that has left many young people feeling hopeless, has little precedence in Kenya where protests are traditionally elite-led.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/29/kenyas-youth-driven-protest-movement-at-crossroads-as-it-considers-future">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If rain stops play in the T20 World Cup final, a fair result will depend on Professor Steve Stern, the Australian data analyst charged with cricket’s complex and controversial DLS system</p><p>It has taken 32 years for South Africa to vanquish the demons of a rain-affected semi-final defeat to England and finally secure a spot in the decider at a men’s World Cup. Six more doses of semi-final suffering followed that initial heartbreak at the 1992 ODI tournament , when heavy showers and a quickly discredited rain rule ended South Africa’s hopes of a triumphant return to the global stage.</p><p>Chasing England’s target of 253, South Africa needed 22 runs from 13 balls when rain interrupted play at the SCG. After the skies cleared and play was set to resume, England’s two lowest-scoring overs were wiped from their total and the recalculations reduced South Africa’s target to 21… from one delivery.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/29/a-fair-result-in-foul-

<p>Dr Hilary Caldwell’s new book Slutdom looks at how women navigate sex and shame, and at all ages. She shares what she’s learned as both a sex worker and as an academic</p><p>At 7.12am on the day we talk, Dr Hilary Caldwell runs naked into Canberra’s Lake Burley Griffin for the annual winter solstice swim. It’s a bracing start to a momentous day. By 11am, she is back at her desk to take another plunge: speaking publicly about being a sex worker for the first time.</p><p>Caldwell has never spoken about her sex work to a journalist, and barely to anyone outside her close sphere, with whom she practised what to say. Even her adult children didn’t know until recently, in the lead up to the release of her new book, Slutdom: Reclaiming Shame-Free Sexuality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/29/guess-what-mummy-is-a-sex-worker-the-sexologist-who-wants-to-build-a-slutopia-for-women">Continue reading...</a>
