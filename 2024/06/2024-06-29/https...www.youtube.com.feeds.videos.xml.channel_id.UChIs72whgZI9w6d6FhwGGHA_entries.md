In this review, we analyze the Antec C8 ARGB tower ATX gaming PC case. The Antec C8 comes in a variation with fans, including 2x unique 160mm bottom-mounted solutions, and a fanless model that is frequently on sale. The Antec C8 is now becoming an alternative to the Lian Li O11D series (like the EVO RGB) and directly competes vs. the Montech King 95 (and King 95 Pro). This is a dual-chamber, "fishtank" style PC case that is trying to compete more affordably than options
