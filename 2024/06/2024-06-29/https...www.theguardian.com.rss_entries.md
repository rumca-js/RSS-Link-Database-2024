<ul><li>‘We cannot require defenders to run with arms like this’</li><li>Nagelsmann accuses Michael Oliver of being petty</li></ul><p>The Denmark manager, Kasper Hjulmand, took aim at football’s “ridiculous” handball rules after they were beaten 2-0 by Germany in a controversial, storm-ravaged last-16 tie.</p><p>Denmark had been well in the game against Germany and thought they had taken the lead when Joachim Andersen converted three minutes after half-time. But the goal was disallowed by VAR for a fractional offside against Thomas Delaney and, almost immediately afterwards, Andersen was penalised for a harsh handball picked up by the video officials. They could not find a way back after Kai Havertz scored the penalty, Jamal Musiala confirming Germany’s progress.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/30/denmarks-hjulmand-attacks-ridiculous-handball-rules-after-defeat-by-germany">Continue reading...</a>

But land someone truly major, especially at a massive festival, and you have all manner of logistical problems to navigate: crowd crushes, staffing and so forth. Then there’s the small task of keeping the secret, erm, secret, festivals being the leakiest, most gossipy places on earth.</p><p>Certainly that is the case with Kasabian’s unannounced early evening set at Woodsies, which seemingly everyone and their cat has known about for weeks.

<p>A loose, hectic, sometimes thrilling match was disrupted first by the elements and then by the deadening technocracy that is smothering elite football. At the end of it all Germany could dream of a new summer fairytale having come through the most unseasonable of hindrances. A storm of dramatic proportions that erupted after the half-hour brought Michael Oliver to stop the game and bring the teams inside for 25 minutes. At one stage it seemed the game was at risk of being curtailed altogether.</p><p>After it resumed, Oliver and his VAR team were central to a sequence that devastated Denmark. Joachim Andersen’s goal was chalked off for a wafer-thin offside and he almost immediately conceded a penalty through their interpretation of a ridiculous handball law. Kai Havertz converted and Jamal Musiala turned the screw. Germany, riotous fun but often ragged, face Spain or Georgia next.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/29/germany-denmark-euro-2024-match-r

<p>The incoherence and panic that gripped lethargic players against Denmark shows their problems are deep-rooted</p><p>Italy won the World Cup in 1982 and Portugal the Euros in 2016 after drawing all three games in the initial group. Spain in 2010 and Argentina in 2022 both began their World Cup-winning campaigns with defeat. This year, Ivory Coast lost group games 1-0 to Nigeria and 4-0 to Equatorial Guinea, qualified for the last 16 only because Ghana conceded twice in injury time against Mozambique and still went on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/11/nigeria-ivory-coast-african-cup-nations-afcon-final-match-report">to win the Africa Cup of Nations</a>.</p><p>Only Brazil, in 2002, have won seven games out of seven at a major tournament. It is possible for a team that has begun poorly to win it. But just because something is possible, doesn’t mean that’s how you should do things.

<p>Scarcely can a crown have weighed more heavily. Italy, the defending champions, are out, and perhaps the most crushing disappointment of all was that they barely seemed to throw a punch in the process. Remo Freuler and Ruben Vargas scored the goals either side of half-time for Murat Yakin’s magnificent Swiss team, and perhaps the most damning indictment of Italy was that by the end, it didn’t even feel like a shock.</p><p>For the first hour of this game they were overwhelmed, and for the last half-hour, who cared? There will be fingers pointed and searching questions asked. Perhaps Luciano Spalletti will get a little more time, perhaps not. But in a way this was a campaign that deserved to end because it never really began, a title defence that felt off right from the start, that no amount of quirky tinkering and impassioned arm-waving could salvage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/29/switzerland-italy-euro-2024-match-report">Continue reading...</

From there it’s on to She Bop, one of Lauper’s better-known songs, though outside the handful of classics most of the audience are baking in the mid-afternoon heat to hear.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/29/cyndi-lauper-glastonbury-reviewed-pyramid-stage-girls-just-wanna-have-fun-time-after-time">

<ul><li>Sprinter hit by heatstroke and suffered from first climb</li><li>Bardet wins stage but host of big names also struggling</li></ul><p>Mark Cavendish is fighting for survival in the Tour de France after suffering from apparent heatstroke and vomiting during the brutal opening stage of the race, from Florence to Rimini. The British sprinter, riding his last Tour, somehow made it through the stage, aided by four of his teammates, but finished nearly 40 minutes down on stage winner, Romain Bardet, of France.</p><p>The highly-regarded Bardet took the stage win and yellow jersey after attacking with dsm-firmenich PostNL team mate, Frank van den Broek, 40 kilometres from Rimini, on the climb of the Cote de Montemaggio. The duo entered the final 20km of racing with a 1min 30sec lead on the chasing peloton, but as the kilometres clicked down, their lead dwindled to a mere handful of seconds as they entered the final 1,000 metres.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/20

<p>Rishi Sunak goes soggy and Keir Starmer is short of change, but at least Steve Baker and Ed Davey are having fun</p><p><br />
 It may have ended with a row over betting, but the Conservative campaign would actually have made a lot more sense had ­someone at HQ been attempting to throw the contest. From the moment a sodden Rishi Sunak traipsed back into Downing&nbsp;Street having killed political metaphors for at least a generation, it’s not been the smoothest. Scarpering early from D-day commemorations wasn’t the best core vote strategy, either. Sunak also seems to have spent much&nbsp;of the campaign ­apologising – we probably don’t need <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/14/elections-guru-john-curtice-exit-polls">Professor John Curtice</a> on hand to guess this isn’t a great sign.

And the storm of white-hot criticism that rained down on his head from friends and foes alike after the 2024 election’s embarrassing and disastrous first presidential TV debate with Donald Trump was blistering. It was sad and painful to watch.</p><p>Republicans were jubilant. They think it’s all over bar the voting. They claimed Biden had only one objective: to prove, at 81, that he was fit to lead as president for a second term – and he failed. Many Americans will agree.

<p>It wasn’t until <a href="https://www.davidfletcherphoto.com/">David Fletcher</a> left his native Stoke-on-Trent that he realised Staffordshire oatcakes are not widely known outside of the area. Unlike the biscuit-like Scottish oatcakes, the version he grew up with is a savoury pancake served with fillings such as bacon and cheese. “Every shop has its own secret recipe,” he says. “The variations must be very slight, but you still get quite fierce opinions about which are the best oatcakes.” Now based in the New Forest, the photographer has spent the past two years documenting oatcake shops. “If this was a French food it would probably have some kind of protected status of origin, but we don’t do that much in England. For me it represents a cultural and culinary heritage.”  </p><p>See more at <a href="https://www.davidfletcherphoto.com/">davidfletcherphoto.com</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/davidfletcherphoto">Instagram</a></p><p></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/

Since their 2019 bow, when they squeezed four energetic sets into one festival weekend, the Dublin post-punkers (though that description grows less accurate with every new album) have managed a well-received Other stage set in 2022 and are now here playing their first headliner slot. They seem to be on the glide path to superstardom, and have the swagger to match, particularly in the form of Grian Chatten, channelling Korn singer Jonathan Davis with a leather skirt, and stalking the stage like a third, even surlier Gallagher brother.</p><p>It’s up for debate whether Fontaines yet quite have the songs to match the marked upturn in exposure.

<p>Paddy ‘The Baddy’ Pimblett and Molly ‘Meatball’ McCann are best friends and brilliant personalities. So how has this fly-on-the-wall series ended up so deeply awkward?</p><p>The ancient question, asked for millennia, the one our ancestors used to ask the gods at the top of great mountains: are athletes actually interesting when they are not throwing or catching a ball? There is a lot of evidence to suggest that the answer is “well: <em>no</em>. But does it really matter?” Look at the Sports Personality of the Year award. Look at basically any post-game interview in any sport.

Whereas English men rarely attempt it, and when they do, she wishes they would stop.</p><p>Does where you are born determine how you will have sex? Perhaps this seems like a stupid question. We tend to see sex as being unlearned and instinctive; something humans around the world do in a relatively similar way – with slight adjustments according to taste and sexuality.

When roasted very simply and without any additional ingredients, the strawberry flavour alone is quite remarkable. However, you can include a sweetener and some aromatics, such as cinnamon, citrus zest and vanilla, to create a more nuanced depth of flavour. Serve warm or cold with ice-cream, porridge or pancakes, or get inventive and serve the fruit in a savoury dish, tossed with balsamic, basil, burrata and black pepper – a wicked flavour combination.</p><p>To save energy, consider roasting the strawberries when the oven is already hot, or alongside other ingredients that won’t impart an undesirable flavour, such as a dessert or vegetables (other than alliums, of course).</p><p>Discover this recipe an
