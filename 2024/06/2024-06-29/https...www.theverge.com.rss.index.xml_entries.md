  <p id="D7mZMq">I’m stuck in a weird spot when it comes to movies and TV, these days. On one hand, the constant churn of remakes, reboots, franchise movies, and sequels often feels like it comes at the expense of original storytelling. But on the other, I am unabashedly looking forward to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24108114/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-trailer-tim-burton-jenna-ortega"><em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em></a><em>, </em>I’m really enjoying <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172264/the-acolyte-high-republic-star-wars-design-interview"><em>The Acolyte</em></a>, and I’m sorry, but I’m the reason <a

  <p id="YwLA2c">Rideshare drivers in Massachusetts will soon get company-provided benefits, as well as a minimum pay of $32.50 per hour, starting on August 15th.

  <p id="2rgiOY">Redbox’s owner, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, filed for bankruptcy protection overnight. This comes at the tail end of a month in which the DVD rental company defaulted on loans, saw an order for its cars to be repossessed, and missed payroll for employees.</p>
<p id="rbcjPD">Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment informed employees of the filing late Friday, writing in an email seen by <em>The Verge</em> that it had filed for a debtor-in-possession loan — a way for companies that are reorganizing after filing for bankruptcy to secure additional working capital to meet payroll. </p>

  <p id="0PtDaF">Last weekend, Metallica graced the virtual stage in <em>Fortnite</em>, but the event was more than just a heavy metal concert. It was one piece in a weeks-long rollout of modes and content, which really drove home just how large and complex the game has become. The battle royale has steadily morphed into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">an entire ecosystem of games and experiences</a>, and the Metallica crossover might’ve been the most complex to date.</p>
