The series, for those unfamiliar, a sequel to the immensely popular Game of Thrones series and deals with the events of &#8220;The Dance of the Dragons&#8221; that was a civil war between the Targaryen household of dragon-riders over who would be king of Westeros: Rhaenyra the King&#8217;s beloved daughter or his disliked male heir, Aegon. While a big supporter of this series and a believer that it has done a lot to wipe the sour taste of Game of Thrones&#8216; season eight from viewers&#8217; mouths, I have a lot of criticisms of season one. Simply put, the ten episodes jumped around one way too much and at least two seasons of story were crammed into one season in hopes of getting to the &#8220;good stuff&#8221; faster. Unfortunately, this severely impacted the pacing of the show as well as its characterization, which are the things that GOT fans love mos", "id": 788078, "language": "en-AU", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-1", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 137, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "REVIEW: House of the Dragon Season 2 Episode 1", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
