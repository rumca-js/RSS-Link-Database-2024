Itâ€™s not an all-out ban on the technology, though, and the courtâ€™s jurisdiction to enforce the agreement only extends four years. Under the new restrictions, which the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.aclumich.org/en/press-releases/civil-rights-advocates-achieve-nations-strongest-police-department-policy-facial"><ins>ACLU</ins></a> is calling the strongest such policies for law enforcement in the country, police cannot make arrests based solely on facial recognition results or conduct a lineup based only on facial recognition leads.</p>
