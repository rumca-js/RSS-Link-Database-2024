In this review, we're unboxing what might be the \"most complete\" launch box of all time and taking a closer look at the models of the Stormcast Eternals and Skaven. What options can be found on the sprues? Which models share sprues and are likely exclusive to Skaventide? How do the Clanrats and Liberators compare to their older incarnations? All this and much more in part 1 of our unboxing.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2024/06/review-skaventide-part-1-the-models/\">Review: Skaventide Part 1 &#8211; The Models</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>", "id": 788806, "language": "en-GB", "link": "https://taleofpainters.com/2024/06/review-skaventide-part-1-the-models", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 29, "page_rating_contents": 91, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://taleofpainters.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 323, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://taleofpainters.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Skaventide_Age_of_Sigmar_models_review_featured.jpg", "title": "Review: Skaventide Part 1 \u2013 The Models", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
