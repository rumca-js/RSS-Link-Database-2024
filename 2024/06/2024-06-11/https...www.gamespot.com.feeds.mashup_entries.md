As the names suggest, each of these modes accommodate very different playstyles. As detailed by a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-v30-10-adds-cozy-mode-and-expert-mode">Fortnite blog post</a>, Cozy mode is primarily meant for those who are new to survival games and aren't looking for too much of a challenge.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Expert mode will be catered to those looking for more of a challenge.

<p dir="ltr">After 10 years, BioWare is finally letting you kiss Lace Harding, the dwarven scout who acts as your initial eyes and ears whenever your character uncovers a new area in Dragon Age: Inquisition. Though you can flirt with her numerous times and establish a strong rapport with Harding, she is not a romantic option in Inquisition--she's not even an official companion. That all changes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>--previously titled Dreadwolf--as Harding is not only one of the seven recruitable companions in the game, but she's a romance option, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Harding is, without a doubt, one of the best parts about Inquisition. Sarcastic and playful, she's willing to trade a few verbal barbs with the Inquisitor if the two establish a bond, and she's a bright and shining spot even during Inquisition's darkest moments, sticking with you and the Inquisition no matter where you choose to go.

<p>Modern game remakes typically replace the cast voices for a new generation, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is bucking that trend by maintaining the original voiceover recordings, including David Hayter as Naked Snake. However, there will be a handful of new lines that were recorded for the remake according to series producer Noriaki Okamura.</p><p>"We're using all the original voice performances, but there are some lines where characters teach you the controls that really don't match anymore," said Okamura through an interpreter while appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDCppzRLwpw">Xbox Games Showcase Deep Dive podcast</a>. "So we actually did get the original actors to re-record just those. Plus, back then, twenty years ago, we actually had to compress the voice acting down a lot to fill all that audio. Today, we aren't as limited. We don't have to compromise as much on formats and compression, so we can actually have those performances in even high

<p>Video games should be upfront and honest with the player, but sometimes they have to mislead you a little bit. Case in point: according to a recent <a href="https://x.com/EbengerJohn/status/1799810812347117772">social media post</a> from designer John Ebenger, if you tried to sprint in the Citadel in Mass Effect 1, you weren't actually moving any faster: the camera field of view (FOV) simply changed to give you a sense of speed rather than the real thing.</p><p dir="ltr">Ebenger served as a designer at BioWare on both Dragon Age and Mass Effect, and now currently works as a cinematic director at Firewalk Studios, which is working on the recently-revealed hero shooter Concord. Ebenger says Shepherd's turtle-like gait was due to technical limitations: the game simply couldn't stream in assets fast enough on the older consoles. Given how the original Mass Effect famously used elevators to hide its load times, this makes sense. The more you know.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pc
