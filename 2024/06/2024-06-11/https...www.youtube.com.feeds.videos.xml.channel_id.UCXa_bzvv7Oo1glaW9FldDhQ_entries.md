The Destiny franchise has had its ups and downs, but the past year has been particularly rough. The failure of Lightfall, the middling seasonal approach - the looter shooter began to feel stale and ultimately inconsequential despite hurtling towards a ten-year story conclusion.

To say The Final Shape had to deliver is an understatement. Whether that will apply to sales remains to be seen, but in terms of narrative, characterization and story-telling, it's some of the best in the franchise. The sprint to defeat The Witness and prevent the reshaping of humanity is epic but makes enough time for emotional catharsis.

Of course, between well-designed campaign missions, a new region bustling with activities, post-story quests and the raid, there is a lot of quality content to tide over fans of the gameplay. Whether The Final Shape saves the franchise or not, it's peak Destiny content that fans shouldn't miss.
