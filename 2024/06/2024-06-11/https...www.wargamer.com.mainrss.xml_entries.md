								<p>What are all the <strong>MTG color combination names</strong>, and what do they mean? There are technically 26 different Magic: The Gathering color combinations that you could use when building a deck, and 25 of them have obscure lore-based names attached, which experienced players tend to use freely, but can be confusing for newcomers. This guide lists all the MTG color combo names, and explains what they all mean.</p>

								<p>Not all tanks in <strong>World of Tanks</strong> are created equal. Sure, they’re regularly split into classes and divided by roles - the reconnaissance function of light tanks versus the raw firepower of their heavier brethren - but, even accounting for differences in functionality, some have a tendency to dominate others. This guide profiles the <strong>best WOT tanks </strong>listed by their in-game tier group, from one up to nine.</p>

								<p>The <strong>DnD Barbarian 5e</strong> class is a dedicated front-line melee fighter. When making a Barbarian you have the flexibility to choose between a damage dealer; a protective ‘tank’; or simply a wild killing machine – but you’ll always be in the thick of the action. This guide explains everything you need to know to create a Barbarian character, and how to get the most out of them when you’re playing.</p>

								<p>Sometimes the theme for a custom Warhammer 40k army is complex, and sometimes it&rsquo;s as simple as giving all your robots a 3D-printed cowboy hat.
