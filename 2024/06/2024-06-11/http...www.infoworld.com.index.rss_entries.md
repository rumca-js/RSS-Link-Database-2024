<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to write expressions for your Java programs. In many cases, you'll use operators to write your Java expressions, and there are many <em>operator types </em>to know how to use. I'll briefly introduce Java's operator types, including the additive, bitwise, logical, conditional, shift, and equality types and their operands. You'll also learn about operator overloading and operator precedence, and you'll see a demonstration of primitive-type conversion. I'll conclude with a small Java program that you can use to practice primitive-type conversions on your own.</p><h2>What you'll learn in this Java tutorial</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is a Java expression?</li>
<li>How to write simple expressions</li>
<li>How to write compound expressions</li>
<li>About Java operators and operands</li>
<li>All the operator types in Java, with examples</li>
<li>About operator precedence and associativity</li>
<li>How to work with primitive-typ

<p>As businesses increasingly migrate to the cloud, chief information security officers (CISOs) face numerous critical challenges in ensuring robust cloud security. Don’t believe me? Experts highlighted this at the recent <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/security-risk-management-us" rel="nofollow">Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit.</a> Gartner projects a significant 24% increase in spending on cloud security, positioning it as the fastest-growing segment within the global security and risk management market.</p><h2>Adapt, adjust, execute</h2>
<p>The bottom line is that shifting to cloud computing necessitates fundamentally rethinking security. Organizations strive to integrate the cloud into standard business operations, however, this transition has more pitfalls than most CISOs understand. I’ve seen this in my research and my experience as a consultant for 20 years, cloud and prior.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/articl

<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715348/social-media-is-a-rip-off.html">In a past column</a>, I talked about how the fat cats of social media profit from all of the value that normal folks like you and I provide. Social media sites have complete control over the attention-creating value that we provide for them, and give us little to no say over how that content is managed. They can even take away access to our profiles. All the money generated by our work ends up in their coffers.</p><p>I mentioned Substack as a place with low take rates, and how content producers there are able to benefit much more directly from the value that they create because they use a common protocol—email—that is not controlled by any corporate entity.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715334/social-media-would-be-better-on-a-blockchain.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
