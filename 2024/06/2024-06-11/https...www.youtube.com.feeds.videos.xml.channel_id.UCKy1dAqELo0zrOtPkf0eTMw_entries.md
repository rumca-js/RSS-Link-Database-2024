In today's Daily Fix:
Bandai Namco is reminding players that there's less than two weeks to go until Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree drops, but that only one-third of Tarnished will actually have access to the new area. That's because two-thirds of players across all platforms have NOT met the prerequisites: beat Starscourge Radahn and Mohg. Get to it, Tarnished! In other news, BioWare confirmed that all romance options in Dragon Age: The Veilguard can be romanced by players of ANY race. Sexy times ahead regardless of your character's race. And finally, GameStop may have accidentally leaked the release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. Oops. (It's November 17th, but don't tell anyone).

## The Boys Season 4 Spoiler-Free Review

Watch our The Boys Season 4 review! The show premieres on Prime Video on June 13, 2024. The Boys Season 4 reviewed by Matt Donato. 

The Boys Season 4 is a solid crash back to earth for Prime Videoâ€™s anti-superhero satire. With so much ground to cover â€“ both ongoing stories and new plotlines â€“ Season 4 could have benefited from being a couple episodes longer. Everyone in Butcherâ€™s crew is dealing with some messed-up issues while Homelanderâ€™s co-conspirators tiptoe around Vought Tower, trying to keep their bodies in one piece. Season 4 feels like a fuse slowly fizzling toward the last episode, but the fireworks it ignites are relatively dinky compared to what The Boys has done in the past. Maybe that sounds harsher than it should because thereâ€™s still plenty of what I love about The Boys packed into a season scarred by sorrow, heartbreak, and so much angst. Itâ€™s just hard to be as excited about Season 4 after the back-to-back bangers of Season 3 and Gen V Season 1.

Revealed in a short but loud Doom The Dark Ages trailer as part of the Xbox Games Showcase 2024, the new Doom game features dragon riding, mech battles, and a much darker, more â€˜metalâ€™ visual palette. But those grimdark ideas aren't the only new elements, nor are they the most significant. For in the Doom Slayerâ€™s left hand is a shield to protect him from demons. And in his right hand is a flail, the bludgeoning chain weapon of the middle ages. Yes, Doomâ€™s going melee, and we've pored over the Doom The Dark Ages gameplay to find out what's new.
