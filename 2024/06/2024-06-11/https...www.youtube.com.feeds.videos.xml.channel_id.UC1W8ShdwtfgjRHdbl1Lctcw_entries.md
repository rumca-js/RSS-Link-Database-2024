I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of London 1945 Post World War II, you can see the city under construction and the soldier still in the street with the civilians walking and life returning to normal. you can also see the city bustling day and night, big ben and views of the London waterfront and the beautiful old architetor of london. the scene that struck me was the family inside the house.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
