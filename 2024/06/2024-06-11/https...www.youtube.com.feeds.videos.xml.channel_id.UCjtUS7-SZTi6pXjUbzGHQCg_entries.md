Why This Window Heat Pump Is Genius. Enter the CCAN Action Fund EV raffle: https://bit.ly/ferrelEVraffle I talk a lot about heat pumps. It’s a fantastic technology that uses a little physics exploit to get more heat energy out than energy you put in. The problem is that most of the time, the devices I’m talking about are for homeowners that can easily retrofit new installations into place. That’s definitely out of reach for most. So where does this leave renters?

Well, there’s a new type of heat pump hitting the market that’s a little more accessible: easy to install heat pumps that sit on your window just like an AC unit. It seems so obvious when you look at it that I can’t help but wonder…why didn’t we do this earlier?  And how well do they actually work and at what cost?
