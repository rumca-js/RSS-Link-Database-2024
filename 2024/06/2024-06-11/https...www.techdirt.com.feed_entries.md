This week, we&#8217;re joined by UNC&#8217;s Alice Marwick, one of [&#8230;]

Last week we posted a letter by a NY-based parent to [&#8230;]

Retailers have increased their reliance on cameras over the years to cut down on retail theft. In more recent years, they&#8217;ve been adding more tech to their surveillance arsenal, including automatic plate readers in their parking lots and facial recognition capabilities to their existing CCTV networks.
