A current Country Coordinator for the U.S. State Department stated in a Project Veritas undercover recording that in the rush to send billions to Ukraine 'mistakes' have been made and money is now 'unaccounted for.' He admits that the ‘stupid amounts of money’ flowing from U.S. taxpayers to Ukraine are used to prop up the 'entire Ukrainian Government and half their electrical grid' and pay handsome salaries. Dan Fitzgerald, who spends his days coordinating U.S. foreign aid, isn’t convinced this influx for Ukraine is an effective use of tax-payer funds. “We’re talking stupid amounts of money and what are we getting for it? I couldn’t really tell you.”
