Nonetheless, today’s speech is just another attempt by Sleepy Joe to infringe on your God-given right to protect yourself and the best part about that was that he lectured the masses on the same day his son, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-gun-trial-federal-charges-delaware-5dd8a9380235c6360a1ddb691ef24a06" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hunter</u></a>, was convicted on three felony gun charges. </p><p>Firstly, Biden claimed he had attended “too many mass shootin

This is why a 12-year-old boy was sent home after the administration claimed he made people feel “unsafe” for wearing a factually correct shirt. Their defense for censoring a student was that this promoted hate speech even though hate speech is not a thing and I am having trouble finding the part in the constitution where the school should regulate feelings. Nonetheless, the side of sanity will continue with its fight to keep things sane. </p><p>The student, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-12-years-shirt" target="_self"><u>Liam Morrison</u></a>, sued the school because of this blatant infringement of his rights. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

However, no one informed progressives that roads tend to get tire marks because cars drive on them.

And they do that by essentially telling half of their consumer base that their opinions are invalid and you must glorify everyone's feelings, no matter how reprehensible they are. And by affirming everyone's feelings that only goes for the feelings that align with their <em>truth</em>. </p><p>I am sure none of that made sense, that’s because you can’t make sense out of
