He admits that the \u2018stupid amounts of money\u2019 flowing from U.S. taxpayers to Ukraine are used to prop up the 'entire Ukrainian Government and half their electrical grid' and pay handsome salaries. Dan Fitzgerald, who spends his days coordinating U.S. foreign aid, isn\u2019t convinced this influx for Ukraine is an effective use of tax-payer funds. \u201cWe\u2019re talking stupid amounts of money and what are we getting for it?
