Do you recognize this sword?
In Viggo Mortensen’s latest film #TheDeadDontHurt, there is a dream sequence in which the actor wears full medieval armor, and the costume needed a sword. After looking through a few props, Viggo thought that none seemed as fitting as the sword he owns from the Lord of the Rings movie set. He got in touch with Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema to get approval for the use and now, Andúril - the Flame of the West, the sword of Aragorn - is being used in his new film.

The Dead Don’t Hurt is out in theaters now. Viggo Mortensen wrote, directed, produced and co-starred in the film. He also composed the original soundtrack – now available on streaming platforms worldwide.
