<p>One of the reasons for consumers to buy into Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot Pro, Custom GPT Builder, is quietly being killed off.</p>



<p>Microsoft said that GPT Builder is being retired, and if you <em>have</em> bought into it, you&rsquo;ll have to remove all of your data by July 14. Unfortunately, Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t consider the ability to build GPT models a consumer priority, the company wrote in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/d1de6c3a-4c7a-4bcd-98ff-2f65f3d23cd1&amp;xcust=2-1-2364236-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">support document.</a> </p>



<p>Microsoft Copilot is a &ldquo;neutral,&rdquo; Microsoft-specific version of Copilot. Essentially, it&rsquo;s the same experience for all users. You can think of GPT Builder as a way to personalize Copilot in m

<p>Are screensavers art? If they are, one of the most iconic Windows screensavers, 3D Pipes, only existed because of an internal Windows contest to show off OpenGL support to Windows NT.</p>

<p>Computex 2024 was all about AI, AI, Arm, and AI. But there were some more subtle trends on the show floor, and Adam Patrick Murray spotted one: CAMM2 memory modules being used with desktop motherboards. After talking with the three vendors showing off concept designs, he&rsquo;s ready to break down why this idea is catching on.</p>



<p>First of all, a slight clarification on terms. Compression Aided Memory Modules in the second standard revision (hence CAMM2) come in two formats: the rectangular, full-fat version that&rsquo;s designed for use in data centers and other fixed hardware, and the low-powered, angular, hat-shaped LPCAMM2 modules for use in laptops. We&rsquo;re talking about the larger CAMM2 version in this article.</p>

<p>Adobe, the maker of Photoshop, Premiere, and other industry-standard tools in the Creative Suite package, has its foot in its mouth. Last week an update to the Creative Cloud terms of service set off alarms across the web as users interpreted the new wording to mean that the company was using their cloud storage files to train its generative AI systems. Not true, says Adobe in a non-apology post. </p>

<p>Online security used to be simple. All you needed was a good password, and in the early days, you didn&rsquo;t need a ton of numbers, letters, and special characters to achieve that goal. No need for antivirus software to verify you were logging into legitimate sites, either. Privacy also wasn&rsquo;t quite as fragile as it is today. Your email wasn&rsquo;t constantly being lost to yet another data breach.</p>



<p>But as hackers and criminals get more sophisticated, so have recommendations for best security practices. Currently experts recommend the use of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">unique, random passwords</a> (and the more characters, the better), plus two-factor authentication as a strong baseline.

<p>Walk into an electronics store and you&rsquo;ll find it almost impossible to find a TV that isn&rsquo;t sporting a 4K display. While the TV market will practically beat you over the head with its 4K marketing, the laptop industry has been slower to adopt 4K displays, with a good many laptops &mdash; including high-end models &mdash; sticking to lower resolutions. But if 4K is so good for TVs, it stands to reason that it should be great for laptop displays too, right? Let&rsquo;s dig in and explore what benefit a 4K display might provide on a laptop and what realities might keep it from being the wisest choice.</p>
