After looking through a few props, Viggo thought that none seemed as fitting as the sword he owns from the Lord of the Rings movie set. He got in touch with Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema to get approval for the use and now, And\u00faril - the Flame of the West, the sword of Aragorn - is being used in his new film.\n\nThe Dead Don\u2019t Hurt is out in theaters now. Viggo Mortensen wrote, directed, produced and co-starred in the film. He also composed the original soundtrack \u2013 now available on streaming platforms worldwide.\n\n#thedeaddonthurt #viggomortensen #clips", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INcQgvZ-umY", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCW0gH2G-cMKAEjEkI4YhnPA", "source_obj__id": 234, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/INcQgvZ-umY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Dead Don't Hurt Exclusive Movie Clip - Aragorn's sword And\u00faril Cameo", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
