She had suffered a very public emotional breakdown (as worded by her team at the time) and I sought to reassure her that her legion of fans, known by the collective noun “Lambily”, had her back. I impressed upon her that the only reason her debut movie, Glitter, had engendered such censorious critical and public wrath was bad timing: it was slated for release the same week as the 9/11 attacks. One day, I insisted, the culture would catch up to her genius. I told her she could call me on my parent’s landline anytime outside school hours and, smearing on some Coca-Cola lip smacker, sealed the letter with a kiss.</p><p>Fast forward through the requisite adolescent rejection of girlhood and all its infantile associations, including Carey and her five-octave range, an

Swimmers with pure speed focus on the one-lap 50m dash, or the two-lap 100m race. Middle distance swimmers prefer the 400m, the 800m or even the endurance epic, the 1500m. The 200m is too long for unbridled sprinting, and too short for a more measured show of stamina.</p><p>In other words, it is the goldilocks event – swimmers must not go too fast so as to blow up, and not too slow so as to lose touch with the field.

<p>João Rosas’s film, depicting the lives of immigrant construction workers busily gentrifying the Portuguese capital, asks important questions</p><p>First conceived in the weeks leading up to the birth of film-maker João Rosas’s first child, this documentary portrait of Lisbon was initially intended to be a memento between father and daughter. What began as a record of private memories, however, soon expanded and metamorphosed, as the film takes in the unsung labour that undergirds a rapidly changing urban landscape. Here is an elegy to a vanishing city, whose history is being erased, brick by brick.</p><p>Diaristic in form, Rosas’s camera takes in the day-to-day of a construction site; here nearly all of the workers are immigrants, mostly from Africa and South Asia. Once home to a printing workshop, the building is now being torn down to make way for luxury condos. Flourishing in the aftermath of the financial crisis and the tourist boom, the condo-isation of Lisbon purports to sign

<p>Reality of the crisis is making its mark on our game but a rise in awareness can spark environmentally conscious change</p><p>The topic of the climate crisis is not one we often associate with football, especially not with women’s football. However, as a professional player who has had the privilege of engaging with my fellow colleagues on this pressing issue, I’ve come to realise the deep concern and untapped potential within our community.</p><p>I joined <a href="https://www.planetleague.co.uk/">Planet League</a>, the football climate action platform for fans, as an ambassador last year and wanted to focus my efforts on leadership in the women’s game.

So why does this problem just keep on growing?</p><p>Isobel Chetwood moved to her dream home on her birthday just over a decade ago.

When she moved in, she found a gardener (“I don’t do dirt down me fingernails,” she says, laughing). He made her a raised bed for growing strawberries, alongside a fence that divided her garden from her neighbour’s. “It was beautiful out there,” she says.</p><p>In one case tackled by Environet, all the flooring on the ground level had to be ripped up.

<p>With no number or email to contact, I was left fearing the loss of my account and wondering: how has social media come to this?</p><p>A month ago my Facebook profile was hacked. First, a message popped up on my business page, asserting that there was an issue with copyright infringement and that the page would be immediately suspended. As a writer, editor and coach, breaking copyright laws would put a swift end to my credibility, and I therefore make sure that all written content on the page is original or properly attributed. Copyright infringement? Highly unlikely.</p><p>Within a few hours, my personal profile was also suspended. Ostensibly, this was because my “linked Instagram account doesn’t follow our rules”, but as I don’t have an Instagram account, this was also bogus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/11/my-facebook-profile-was-hacked-but-all-the-platform-offered-was-a-faceless-void">Continue reading...</a>
