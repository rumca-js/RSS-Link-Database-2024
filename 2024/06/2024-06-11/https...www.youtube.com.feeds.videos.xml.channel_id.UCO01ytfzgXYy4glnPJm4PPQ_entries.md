Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Hunter Biden has been found guilty in federal court. This is supposed to be evidence that Joe Biden is playing it fair, but it actually shows the opposite. I'll explain. Also, new polls show that a majority of Americans favor mass deportations of illegal immigrants. A manager at Big Lots is fired after committing the sin of trying to stop someone from stealing. A Hollywood actor takes out a poorly written full-page ad calling on awards voters to give awards to non-whites. And, the desperate campaign to find some sort of scandal for Justice Samuel Alito continues, and is more desperate than ever. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.
