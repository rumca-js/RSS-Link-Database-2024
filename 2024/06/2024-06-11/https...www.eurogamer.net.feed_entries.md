## A date with Path of Exile 2: a new class, smoother onboarding, and the reason why this had to be a sequel

As a newcomer to what will soon be the Path of Exile series, I was already daunted by its famous complexity. Compounded with stress and sleeplessness, I was starting to worry that I might not be able to get a footing at all, and find myself completely adrift.</p><p>But within a few minutes of picking up the controller, I realised I was relaxed. I had been deftly onboarded, and, despite the chaos of the day, figuring out what loot and passives I wanted to use to pick my way through rotted wolves, crawling forest imps, and fleshy underground sl

Sumo Group, the parent company of Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Texas Chain Saw Massacre developer Sumo Digital, has announced plans to reduce its workforce by up to 15 percent, putting nearly 270 employees across the UK, Canada, Poland, Czech Republic, and India at risk.
</p><p>
"Whilst Sumo has been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced," the company <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2024/sumo-group-update/">wrote</a>, "we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward."
</p><p>
To that end, Sumo has made "the difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways", which "unfortunately

Despite some misgivings over the future of the Xbox brand and an underwhelming reveal of new hardware, the games themselves were enough to carry the day - and the Digital Foundry crew has convened to discuss the highlights and lowlights in a DF Direct special. </p><p>I won't go into every game discussed by John, Alex and Oliver in the 102-minute episode - which included the likes of Doom: The Dark Ages, Perfect Dark, Gears of War: E-Day and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - so instead I'll pick out some of my own personal highlights, starting with Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. The original Stalker PC game from 2007 was janky, weird and completely captivati

You wait years for a new season of your favourite show, and then find out it's ending. In what looks like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">classic Netflix fashion</a>, today's action-packed trailer for Arcane season two describes the show's long-awaited second run of episodes as "The Final Chapter". 
</p><p>
Which, for possibly the best video game adaptation of all time, and just an incredible TV show in general, is pretty bad news. 
</p><p>
Spoilers abound for the show's first season here, as the trailer appears to answer what happened next after the first season's explosive cliffhanger ending.

</p><p>
Now is not the time to procrastinate, Tarnished! The Land of Shadow awaits, but it seems some players still haven't completed the necessary requirements.
</p><p>
Indeed, a social post on X has gone viral for noting only 37.8 percent of Steam players have the achievement for defeating Mohg, a boss that must be beaten to access Shadow of the Erdtree.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> features a far more fleshed out romance and relationship system than in previous BioWare games, the developer has told Eurogamer - including the ability for party members to go off and find their own love interests, should you not be interested yourself. 
</p><p>
Speaking to Eurogamer's deputy editor Chris Tapsell at an event in LA this week, The Veilguard's creative director John Epler revealed more of the game's relationship system.
</p><p>
"In Dragon Age games, BioWare games, romance is a core part," Epler said. "We wanted to give each character their own flavour, or their own style, of romance. So some characters may be a little more steamy while some characters maybe a little bit more innocent. But for each one, you c

Now we've got all those negatives out of the way, on to the positive. After an extended hands-off demonstration of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's first hour I can say, with some confidence, this video game looks <em>fantastic</em>. The combat looks like a blast. The writing is cheesy, but deliciously cheesy - there is a place for this very specific, "I'm voicing my own D&amp;D character out loud" flavour of high fantasy cheese. The character creator is vast. There are dialogue wheels and skill trees and waves of "we hear you" responses to fan requests. And it

Atlus has provided new details on the battle system of its forthcoming RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio, which includes over 40 archetypes to play as.
</p><p>
As shown in the recent Atlus showcase for the game, archetypes are essentially a job system for characters to switch between, divided between 14 lineages. 
</p><p>
These archetypes can be managed in the Akademeia, a library-esque facility that works comparably to The Velvet Room from the Persona games. It's here the protagonist will awaken new archetypes, which are first discovered by forming relationships with NPCs associated with that type.

It's the post-apocalypse, but it's also gentle and dreamy and kind of lovely. You're looking for your missing sister, but in an unhurried, holidaying sort of way. The game's futuristic landscape is based on Provence, and maybe it's hard to get too serious about things in Provence. The rocks and mountains are the colour of milky coffee. The sky is endless blue. There's a jouncy little van to take you from one mission spot to the next. Hey, even "mission" is too weighty a word.</p><p>This is not a game based around urgency, in other words, and so I spent the current Steam demo dawdling cheerily and poking around in the corners of the map. The demo gives you a good chunk of coastline to play in. Alongside a little town there are cliffs and strange water process

Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater's release date appears to have been leaked by GameStop.

In a now-deleted social post, the US retailer listed the release date as 17th November, alongside a pre-order option.

## Mass Effect's sprinting was an illusion too, just like Dragon Age's horse boost

Last year, we discovered that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-inquisitions-horse-sprinting-was-actually-an-illusion">Dragon Age Inquisition's ability to make your horse "sprint" was just an illusion</a>, a fact that surprised many fans of the near-decade old game. 
</p><p>
Now, there's perhaps even more surprising news: this wasn't even the first time BioWare had pulled off this same trick, and no one noticed. 
</p><p>
Believe it or not, Mass Effect 1 has the same faux-sprint effect in play - where your speed is exactly the same when "sprinting", though it looks faster due to camera effects. Mind blown.

There's something reassuringly old-school about the meaty punchups of OutRage: Fight Fest, a straightforward but satisfying beat 'em-up that also manages to blend in some smart new ideas. 
</p><p>
The more hits you land amidst OutRage's constant flurry of action - using melee weapons, pieces of scenery or just your good ol' fashioned fists - the bigger your on-screen character becomes, and the closer you get to unleashing an Over Rage ability (more on those in a moment). But growing large also makes you more of a target - in my experience at least.
</p><p>
OutRage's current <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2307870/OutRage_Fight_Fest/">Steam Next Fest demo</a> offers two match types to try - and there's a mix of old and new. A classic Domination mode features zone control, where two teams of four battle it out a
