Learn High Level System Design by coding a YouTube clone. Starting with a basic flow, you'll gradually add three key services: upload, watch, and transcoder. This course covers the actual high-level design (HLD) concepts in practice, including chunking, transcoding with FFmpeg, and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming using HLS. You will use JavaScirpt, React, Node.js, Next.js, Prisma, Express, and more.
