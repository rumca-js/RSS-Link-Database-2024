CEO Andy Jassy announced the news at an event held today at Seattle&#8217;s Pacific Medical Tower, an early headquarters for Amazon. &#8220;We&#8217;re here to talk about the importance of affordable housing, especially in communities like ours, where rents have outpaced salaries and may have made it harder for people like teachers and nurses and first responders to live close to their jobs and remain part of the&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazon-adding-1-4b-to-its-affordable-housing-fund-in-seattle-and-other-regions/">Read More</a>

More founders investing in each other. And making the city a better place to live. Those are some of the ingredients that could boost Seattle&#8217;s startup scene, according to four early stage venture capitalists who spoke on a panel at the Seattle AI Investor Summit + Showcase, hosted by the Technology Alliance on Tuesday. Seattle often gets criticized for not having enough homegrown money to help fuel the next great tech startups. The number of firms deploying dollars pales in comparison to Silicon Valley, New York, Boston, and Los Angeles.

The firing was conducted on June 5 at Stoke&#8217;s testing site in Moses Lake, Wash., the startup said today in a news release. During the two-second test, the engine ramped up to its target starting power level, producing the equivalent of 350,000 hp in less than a second, and held that power level until shutdown. At full power, the full-flow staged combustion engine is designed to produce over 100,000 pounds of thrust.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/stoke-space-success-test-firing-rocket-engine-nova/">Read More</a>

In the wake of the tragedy, a purported transcript of communications during Titan&#8217;s final dive included increasingly desperate references to an alarm aboard the sub. But Jason Neubauer, the chairman of the Coast Guard&#8217;s Marine Board of Investigation, told The New York Times that the document &#8220;was made up.&#8221; That conclusion is based on a review of the actual messages between Titan and its mothership as the sub descended toward&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/oceangate-investigators-fake-transcript/">Read More</a>

Earlier this year, Washington state lawmakers approved $800,000 in funding to the City of Seattle to lease space that would incubate tech startups — in particular those focused on artificial intelligence. Sen. Joe Nguyen, who helped spearhead the funding, spoke about the initiative during a panel discussion at a Seattle AI Week event on Monday. Nguyen said one idea is to have the University of Washington run an office where early stage startups could rent space, which could also host&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/city-and-state-leaders-in-talks-to-create-seattle-based-ai-focused-incubator-for-startups/">Read More</a>
