## You can't mirror your iPhone while mirroring your Mac on Apple Vision Pro

<p>So close, yet so far. Ahead of WWDC 2024, I had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-features-wed-love-to-see-at-wwdc-2024-151822925.html">hoped Apple would let you mirror your iPhone inside of the Vision Pro</a>, just like how you can use your Mac on an enormous virtual display. Instead, we got iPhone Mirroring on macOS Sequoia. As the name implies, it will let you see everything on your iPhone from the comfort of your Mac.</p>
<p><em>But</em>, I wondered, what if you mirrored a Mac that was mirroring an iPhone in the Vision Pro? It seems like the ideal workaround in theory, one that would solve the headset's annoying inability to play nicely with your iPhone. But, unfortunately, it won't work. We've heard from knowledgeable sources that Apple's hardware only supports one of its Continuity mirroring features at the time. So if you're sending your Mac's screen to the Vision Pro, you won't be able to mirror your iPhone at the same time.</p>

<p>Elon Musk <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/11/elon-musk-drops-suit-against-openai-and-sam-altman.html">dropped a lawsuit</a> against OpenAI one day before a judge in California state court was set to hear OpenAI’s request for dismissal. Musk’s suit, which was filed in February, had accused OpenAI co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman of violating the company’s non-profit status and instead prioritizing profits over using AI to help humanity.</p>
<p>In the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/musk-v-altman-openai-complaint-sf.pdf">35-page suit</a>, Musk <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-sues-openai-and-sam-altman-for-allegedly-ditching-non-profit-mission-160722736.html">had alleged</a> that OpenAI had become a “closed-source de facto subsidiary” of Microsoft, which invested $13 billion in the company and owns a 49 percent stake.

<p>Yesterday, following Apple’s announcement of a partnership with OpenAI to integrate support for ChatGPT into the company’s devices, Elon Musk did what he always does: he tweeted. The owner of X wrote, on<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1800265431078551973"> X</a>, that he would ban Apple devices at his companies &quot;If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level.&quot;. And to that I say: Go right ahead. And while you’re at it, remove your company's software from Apple’s App Store too.</p>
<p>Musk’s companies (at least the major ones) currently include Tesla, SpaceX, X, X AI and Neuralink. Even if we’re just talking about phones — which according to <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/us-smartphone-market-share/">Counterpoint Research</a> Apple currently has a 52 percent market share in the US — around 80,000 of Musk’s 155,000 employees would be subject to the ban, if general statistics hold true. And that’s not counting anyone who uses a Mac computer or iPad

The animated Netflix show explores the backstories behind some of the many champions in Riot Games' <em>League of Legends</em>.</p>
<p>Sisters Vi and Jinx remain at the show's core. Their conflict acts as a foil for the cities of Piltover and Zaun, which are now locked in a deadly conflict following the closing events of season one. Vi is now part of the effort to capture her sibling and destroy the dangerous substance Shimmer. Fans of the MOBA will recognize champions such as Caitlyn and Ekko returning from <em>Arcane</em>'s first season, while it appears Singed and Warwick will make their show debut when the new season drops this November.

<p>Cruise, General Motors’ beleaguered driverless taxi service, announced Tuesday that it will start picking up fares again around Houston. Cruise announced that they would start with human taxi drivers behind the wheels of its cars before moving to “supervised autonomous driving with a safety driver behind the wheel in the coming weeks.”</p>
<p>The announcement from Cruise landed around the same time that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24176206/gm-cruise-invest-850-million-operational-cost-houston"><ins>General Motors’ chief financial officer Paul Jacobson</ins></a> announced at Deutsche Bank’s Global Auto Industry Conference in New York City that the carmaker would inject <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy

<p>Bethesda announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doom-the-dark-ages-hits-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc-in-2025-172938801.html"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a> at the Xbox Games Showcase over the weekend, and easily the most exciting addition to the franchise featured in the trailer is the Shield Saw. As the name suggests it's a shield. Which is also a chainsaw. Naturally, modders have already programmed the weapon into the original <em>Doom</em>.</p>
<p>Modder Craneo shared a clip on X yesterday showing how they were able to bring the Shield Saw featured in the trailer for the upcoming <em>Doom</em> sequel into the retro computer game. They converted the old-fashioned chainsaw into an innovative weapon that both protects you from enemy damage and rips opponents to shreds, thereby providing the wielder with a brilliant balance of defense and offense. The video makes it seem you can also toss the Shield Saw, something that was surely a pain to program.</p>

<p>&quot;How do you shorten <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-first-attempt-at-ai-is-apple-intelligence-181444846.html">Apple Intelligence</a>?&quot; That’s the question I’ve asked several Apple employees at WWDC 2024, and their practiced responses have become comically absurd.</p>
<p>“We just say Apple Intelligence,” they tell me. “Yah, but do you say that every time? The AI acronym is right there!” I’d retort. The usual response is a stiff smile and clenched teeth, like a human programming error in real-time. (Yes, I'm aware it's just overly aggressive media training in action.) One person suggested they also say &quot;personal intelligence&quot; — yes, a phrase that's longer than Apple Intelligence.</p>

<p>Apple Intelligence is coming, but not to every iPhone out there. In fact, you'll need to have a device with an A17 Pro processor or M-series chip to use many of the features unveiled during the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-first-attempt-at-ai-is-apple-intelligence-181444846.html">Apple Intelligence</a> portion of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-intelligence-ai-ios-18-and-the-biggest-announcements-at-wwdc-2024-184422501.html">WWDC 2024</a>. That means only iPhone 15 Pro owners (and those with an M-series iPad) will get the iOS 18-related Apple Intelligence (AI?) updates like Genmoji, Image Playground, the redesigned Siri and Writing Tools.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-why-wont-the-iphone-14-pro-get-apple-intelligence">Why won't the iPhone 14 Pro get Apple Intelligence?</h2>
<p>It's not evident exactly why older devices using an A16 chip (like the iPhone 14 Pro) won't work with Apple Intelligence, given its neural engine seems more than capable compared to the M1. A clos

<p>Netgear is releasing more affordable versions of its flagship Orbi and Nighthawk router systems. The recently-released Orbi 970 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netgears-new-wallet-busting-orbi-router-has-just-about-every-feature-imaginable-123035066.html"><ins>starts at a jaw-dropping $1,700</ins></a>, so this is a welcome bit of news.</p>
<p>The Orbi 770, on the other hand, starts at $700. It’s still a tri-band mesh router system that supports Wi-Fi 7, with support for up to 100 simultaneous devices. The top speed gets a hit when compared to the 970, 11Gbps vs 27Gbps, but it’s still plenty fast. Remember, an internet speed of one gigabit per second is actually 1,000 megabits per second (Mbps.) Anything above 1,000 megabits is more than enough for streaming and web surfing. So, the Orbi 770 offers 11 times that.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>pits its greatest heroes against each other and it’s a lot of fun. It’s also a familiar kind of fun if you’ve ever played <em>Overwatch</em>. As <em>Overwatch 2  </em>fights<em>&nbsp;</em>to hold onto players (and attract new ones), there’s no shortage of new games with similar team PvP dynamics, modes and characters. Like Valve’s leaked <em>Deadlock</em> title, or PlayStation’s <em>Concord</em>, or <em>Star Wars: Hunters</em>. Add the now console-bound (and more strategy-heavy) <em>Valorant</em>, and yep, there are a lot of team shooters on the horizon.

<p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is lush. Set on the side of a mountain that’s been covered in a terrible black defilement, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em>’s world is an ancient, psychedelic dreamscape packed with magic and otherworldly horrors. It’s also mechanically dense, with moments of slow strategizing and rapid-fire hack-and-slash combat. After playing for nearly an hour at Summer Game Fest, it’s clear that <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> is much more than a beautiful screenshot.</p>
<p>The game is divided into day and night mechanics, but all of the action takes place in various camps along the mountainside, set under green canopies and among dense foliage. The defilement creates plants with glowing pink orbs and slathers some areas in an iridescent black goo, trapping villagers in putrid sacs and infecting the local deer population.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> was given a proper unveiling at Summer Game Fest, with an <em>Ocean’s 11</em>-style intro to the gang of heroes and fantasy character tropes that will make up your cadre. Bioware also invited me to a hands-off demo of <em>Veilguard</em>, where I got to briefly see the character creation setup and the opening chapter of the game, as you join the likes of Varric and other characters from Dragon Ages past.</p>
<p>It does look different, though. I’ve only dipped into the Dragon Age series in the past, but the character style of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>(especially in the trailer) looked, initially, like some kind of <em>League Of Legends</em>-style spin-off or even a, gasp, mobile game. There’s undoubtedly a cartoonish spin on characters, although Solas, the primary antagonist (and sadsack elf), seems to be his miserable, mournful self.</p>

<p>One of the bigger selling points of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883-160026840.html">Apple's AirPods</a> for some people is their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-03-apple-airpods-review-2019-more-of-the-same.html">unsealed design</a>, which means they rest just outside of your ear canal instead of inserting all the way in. Open-style earbuds like these aren't good at blocking out ambient noise as a result, but they tend to be more comfortable to wear for those with sensitive ears.</p>

<p>HiFi streaming is expected to arrive by the end of 2024 and it will be an add-on that costs users at least $5 more per month on top of an existing plan, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-11/spotify-to-introduce-more-expensive-subscription-tier-for-music-lovers"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>.

<p><em>Thrasher</em>, which its developers describe as a &quot;mind-melting arcade action odyssey,&quot; will be available for the Meta Quest and the Apple Vision Pro on July 25. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/thrasher-looks-like-another-nightmare-inducing-game-from-the-artist-behind-thumper-010802152.html">SteamVR version</a> will follow at a later date. <em>Thrasher</em> was first announced at The Game Awards last year as a new project by Brian Gibson, who was the artist and composer behind the nightmare-inducing rhythm game <em>Thumper</em>. For <em>Thrasher</em>, Gibson teamed up with Mike Mandel, known for working on games like <em>Rock Band VR</em> and <em>Fuser</em>, who took charge of the coding and research and development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The player takes control of a space eel in Thrasher, which they have to guide with &quot;fast-paced gesture controls&quot; through unsettling landscapes, so that it can evolve and defeat a cosmic baby god by the end of their journey. Ba

While we haven't tested it ourselves yet, Apple appears to be avoiding the pitfalls of Microsoft's Recall feature, as well as Google Bard's unfortunate early gaffes. The company isn't trying to capture everything you're doing on your computer, and it's being careful about how it's using larger AI models like ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>
