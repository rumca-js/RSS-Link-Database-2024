<p>Victoria Cilliers miraculously survived a skydive with no parachutes – because her husband had tampered with them. Now her story hits our screens, only to be blighted by bizarre, Brendan O’Carroll-esque reconstructions</p><p>The attempted murder of Victoria Cilliers is, for a true-crime programme-maker, a gift. Cilliers, an experienced skydiving instructor, miraculously survived a 4,000ft drop when, in 2015, both her main and reserve parachutes failed to open during a skydive in Netheravon, Wiltshire. As police came to suspect her husband, Emile, of having tampered with Victoria’s equipment, they learned that Victoria had also survived a gas leak at the family home a week earlier. Further investigation revealed a coercive and controlling relationship, with Emile’s treatment of his previous romantic partners displaying a similar pattern. But this made securing a conviction harder, because Victoria had been so profoundly manipulated that at Emile’s two trials, she spoke in his favour

Kylian Mbappé sounded the alarm after a 2-0 loss against Germany in March. “There are lots of warnings: technically, tactically, in terms of desire and even efficiency too,” said the captain, adding that the “leadership” was “deficient”. Not exactly the serene buildup France would have hoped for, but they have known worse. The defeat to Germany came in the absence of Antoine Griezmann; without him, Didier Deschamps’ men looked lost, and the over-reliance on individuals is a concern.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/11/form-injuries-and-mood-how-are-the-euro-2024-favourites-shaping-up">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While your noodles are cooking, mix up a <em>yakisoba</em>, <em>mentsuyu</em> or <em>goma</em>-style dressing, then drain, toss and serve</p><p><strong>What sauces can you make in the time it takes to boil noodles?<br /></strong>“You can bash together a decent <em>yakisoba</em> sauce from soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, a little mirin and oyster sauce,” says noodle connoisseur Tim Anderson, author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/microwave-meals-9781784887087">Microwave Meals</a>. “But it does beg the question: why not just buy yakisoba sauce? Most Japanese noodle sauces come ready-made and are as good as or better than anything you’d ever make at home.” Much the same goes for <em>mentsu</em>yu, a concentrated, dashi-based sauce that can be used as a dip for chilled noodles (soba, udon, somen) or diluted with hot water for a broth. “Make that from soy sauce, mirin, sugar and dashi, though the bottled versions are good, so you may as well buy one of them.”</p><p>If the goal

Starring alongside him in the series was Adrian Lukis as George Wickham, who returns here to tell us what became of him after his shenanigans at Pemberley and Longbourn. This one-act, hour-long monologue written and performed by Lukis imagines Jane Austen’s charming cad, with whom Lydia Bennet scandalously eloped, in his drawing room aged 60.</p><p>In a production directed by Guy Unsworth, Wickham sits, gets up to look out of the window and sits back down to sip wine and burble amicably in reminiscence. We learn, unsurprisingly, that he disliked Darcy as a boy and was held in awe by the sight of uber rake Lord Byr

<p>Team start Euros with fill-in left-back, barely tested centre-half pairing and questions over various players’ readiness</p><p>The senior centre-half is out. His partner has had an uneven season. There is no specialist left-back. Fitness problems are a part of the mix. And so is balance.

His team will sweep to the final in Berlin because of how blessed he is with attacking options; the variety of them, the depth, which have allowed him to omit Jack Grealish, James Maddison and Marcus Rashford; to phase out Raheem Sterling.

<p>Disenchanted with Motown, star songwriters Holland-Dozier-Holland set up a pair of bold new labels: Hot Wax and Invictus. As a new box set is released, its artists remember their personal, political songs – and exhausting battles</p><p>Motown Records famously churned out songs like cars on an assembly line, and songwriting team Holland-Dozier-Holland (HDH) – brothers Eddie and Brian Holland, and the late Lamont Dozier – built some of the company’s most gleaming, purring models, writing smashes such as Martha Reeves and the Vandellas’ Heat Wave, the Four Tops’ Reach Out I’ll Be There, and 10 of the Supremes’ 12 US chart-toppers. But while HDH’s tenure at Motown is rightly celebrated, their subsequent work has been neglected by comparison, despite being thrillingly soulful, stylistically diverse and sharply political (as captured on a new vinyl box set).</p><p>HDH’s time at Motown ended badly.

## Royal Academy Summer Exhibition review – a gasping death-rattle of conservative mediocrity

<p><strong>Royal Academy, London</strong><br />Pampered pets, polite portraits and enough wan landscapes to fill a field – this show mirrors the numbed, aimless condition of Britain after 14 years of Tory misrule</p><p>This year’s Royal Academy Summer Exhibition is best enjoyed as a mirror of the numbed, aimless condition of Britain after 14 years of Conservative government. It is a gasping death-rattle of mediocrity, a miserable garden party of vapid good taste. There are no laughs and precious few glimpses of good art. Nothing points to the future. All you will learn from it is that the small “c” conservatism of British middle-class culture has reached the end of its rope.</p><p>“Art Is in All of Us”, affirms a typically profound placard by Bob and Roberta Smith RA. If only. That radical-sounding statement might seem to promise a show that’s a wild, democratic, free-for-all romp. After all there are more than 1,200 works of art here, apparently chosen pretty much by flipping a coin.

Biographies contradict one another. His age was a mystery, with reports that he had two birth certificates, one dated 1933 and the other 1938. Living alone in Paris with a Siamese cat called Choupette, he once declared: “I don’t want to be real in other people’s lives. I want to be an apparition.”</p><p>Capturing Lagerfeld on screen might therefore seem like pinning down a ghost.

<p>Director Chris Cronin masterfully maintains a needling ambiguity about the source of evil in this haunting tale of a father searching for his long-missing son</p><p>Looking for a group of long-missing children on a patch of moorland, podcaster Claire (Sophia La Porta) thinks she has defined her search area. But when she lays down her map in front of the police chief who once led the case, he reaches for a box and arrays five more Ordnance Surveys around it. His rejoinder – “<em>That’s</em> the moor” – is the equivalent of “You’re gonna need a bigger boat” in this redoubtable folk horror debut evidently inspired by the Brady-Hindley murders. You could also call it topographical horror, with director Chris Cronin using a simple set of elements – swirling mists, neolithic stones, baleful staring rams, chairs that look like baleful staring rams – to construct a formidable ambience on his fictional Holme moor.</p><p>Claire is beholden to this search because of a guilty secret: in 1996,
