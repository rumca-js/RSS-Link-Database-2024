<p>Feel like your laptop doesn&rsquo;t have enough ports? Then the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerExpand-Adapter-Delivery-Ethernet/dp/B0874M3KW4/&amp;xcust=2-1-2364243-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Anker 553 USB-C Hub</a> is just what the doctor ordered. And since orders must be respected, you should place yours as soon as possible because this hub is down to $50 right now (from its usual $70).</p>

<ul>
<li>1 x USB-C port</li>



<li>2 x USB-A data ports</li>



<li>2 x HDMI ports</li>



<li>1 x Ethernet port</li>



<li>1 x microSD card reader</li>

<p>When it comes to gaming laptops and the hardware that powers them, the GPU and CPU are often the focal point for overall performance. Although the GPU and CPU are no doubt important, there&rsquo;s one vital component that you should consider: the system memory (AKA RAM). </p>



<p>RAM, when paired with VRAM (aka graphics card memory), can bottleneck your system. RAM often comes in the following capacities: 8GB, 16GB, and 32GB. However, it&rsquo;s not always clear which amounts are optimal for gaming, so we&rsquo;ll provide a number of practical examples below. Read on to learn more.</p>

<p>Good Lord, gaming monitors are getting cheap these days. Dell&rsquo;s selling them so cheap they&rsquo;re basically giving you money to buy one. Take this 27-inch, 1440p IPS model for example. It&rsquo;s already $100 off on Dell&rsquo;s store and you can take an extra $20 off with a coupon code for a final price of $179.99. But if you jump through some hoops, you can also get $50 off another Dell purchase. </p>



<p>Props to the deal-sniffing users of the SlickDeals forums on this one, who both found the deal on the G2724D monitor and the Dell Cash rebate offer for joining the free Dell Rewards Members program. Granted, you don&rsquo;t really need to do that if you don&rsquo;t care about a future purchase from the Dell store &mdash; sadly there&rsquo;s no way to apply that $50 rebate to the initial monitor purchase. In either case, be sure to <strong>apply the p

<p>Following the huge wave of ransomware last year, there&rsquo;s now increasing reports of completely new tricks used by hackers and cybercriminals to gain access to computer systems, devices, and networks.</p>



<p>Many of these tricks exploit existing vulnerabilities in applications and operating systems, but these perpetrators are also developing completely new approaches that combine technical procedures with social engineering to achieve their goals.</p>



<p>To recap if you&rsquo;re unaware: <strong>social engineering</strong> is when a malicious person exploits you through helpfulness, trust, fear, or respect in an attempt to manipulate you into doing something.</p>
