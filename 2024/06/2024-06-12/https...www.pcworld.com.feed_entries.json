Although the GPU and CPU are no doubt important, there&rsquo;s one vital component that you should consider: the system memory (AKA RAM). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>RAM, when paired with VRAM (aka graphics card memory), can bottleneck your system. RAM often comes in the following capacities: 8GB, 16GB, and 32GB. However, it&rsquo;s not always clear which amounts are optimal for gaming, so we&rsquo;ll provide a number of practical examples below.

Dell&rsquo;s selling them so cheap they&rsquo;re basically giving you money to buy one. Take this 27-inch, 1440p IPS model for example. It&rsquo;s already $100 off on Dell&rsquo;s store and you can take an extra $20 off with a coupon code for a final price of $179.99. But if you jump through some hoops, you can also get $50 off another Dell purchase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Props to the deal-sniffing users of the SlickDeals forums on this one, who both found the deal on the G2724D monitor and the Dell Cash rebate offer for joining the free Dell Rewards Members program. Granted, you don&rsquo;t really need to do that if you don&rsquo;t care about a future purchase from the Dell store &mdash; sadly there&rsquo;s no way to apply that $50 rebate to the initial monitor purchase.
