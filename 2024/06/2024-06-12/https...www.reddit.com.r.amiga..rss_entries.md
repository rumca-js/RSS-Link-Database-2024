<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey there. Please keep in mind, it's been decades. I only remember bits.</p> <p>Game one was a sci-fi game. 2d. Almost like Turrican. You select one of several planets and fight as a soldier, get upgrades and kill a boss at the end.</p> <p>Number 2 is a fewer dream. One level you play in a candy machine. In another level you are in a circus. One wrong step and giant wasp comes to kill you.

It made me go back and look at the original. I spent so many hours with this game in my teen years. The title screen is still one of my favorites of all the Amiga games I played.<br /> Anyway...instead of playing the game, I ended up painting the title screen, with a few modifications. What do you think? Does it do the original justice? </
