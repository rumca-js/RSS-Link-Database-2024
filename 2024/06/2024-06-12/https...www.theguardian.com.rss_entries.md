<p>Marina Abramović would flinch at the pain the prime minister is inflicting on himself in pursuit of his self-destructive project</p><p>For some time now it’s been obvious that Rishi Sunak really doesn’t want to be prime minister any more. You can see it in his body language. Defeat hangs heavy around his shoulders. Despair etched into the lines on his face. He is desperate for it all to end. Then he can be shot of the lot of us. Kiss goodbye to us miserable ingrates and take his millions off to California.</p><p>But credit where credit is due. No one can accuse Rish! of not putting the hours in. He has gone well beyond the call of duty. The efforts to ensure his self-destruction have become almost superhuman. His commitment to the cause total. He will stick at nothing until his failure is complete. All hope of recovery vanquished. In this he has almost reached the status of a performance artist. Marina Abramović is nothing on Sunak. She would have flinched long ago. The greater the

<p>Six years in the making, jaw-dropping new film The Grab shows a secret scramble by governments and private firms to buy up global resources</p><p>In 2013, the US food conglomerate Smithfield Foods – the country’s largest pork producer and maker of the famous holiday ham – was sold to a Hong Kong-based company called WH Group in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/29/smithfield-pork-shuanghui-chinese-takeover">a deal worth $7.1bn</a>. It was the largest ever Chinese acquisition of an American company; virtually overnight, WH Group, formerly called Shuanghui International, gained ownership of nearly one in four American pigs. Such a massive business deal did not go unnoticed; news coverage and an eventual congressional hearing questioned the sale with a mix of good, old-fashioned American xenophobia and reasonable concern for the nation’s food supply. But in the eyes of most people, and certainly most American consumers, the Smithfield Foods sale remained just that

<p><strong>Bristol Old Vic<br /></strong>Gareth Farr’s account of IVF’s development is briskly directed but the science feels under-dramatised</p><p>Towards the end of Gareth Farr’s A Child of Science, which explores the development of IVF, there is a remarkable scene of profound pathos and personal devastation. Huddersfield housewife Margaret (superlatively performed by Adelle Leonce), who has taken part in the trials and is otherwise known as Patient 38, is given unwelcome news. But it is received with such heroic grace that many in the audience were moved to tears. This is a play that sensitively deals with what is clearly an emotive and important subject for many.</p><p>It is therefore unfortunate that so much else feels relatively rote in this fictionalised account of the events that led to the birth of the first baby through in vitro fertilisation in 1978. The narrative is driven by the scenes between Robert Edwards, Patrick Steptoe and Jean Purdy (respectively Tom Felton, a com

What will we do against the Spanish?”</p><p>It is an understandable preoccupation given Albania, who Sylvinho led to an outstanding qualification for Euro 2024 last year, must face all three over the next fortnight in the tournament’s toughest group. They could not have been dealt a more fiendish hand and it will cause shock waves if they progress. “You have to find a way to reduce the distance between them and us,” he says. “How?

<p>Sir Jim Ratcliffe needs to get matters right on and off the pitch after deciding to stick by Erik ten Hag</p><p>If Sir Jim Ratcliffe really means, as he posits, that “two or three years” are needed to revive Manchester United, the 71-year-old now needs to stick by Erik ten Hag barring only an apocalyptic run of form. Related here is the issue of Ten Hag’s position having been in jeopardy despite a yield of a trophy in each of his two seasons in charge. When the Dutchman was essentially asked to re-interview for his post during Ratcliffe’s end of season review, he would have surely pointed to this ratio of honours, particularly in the context of the businessman’s own judgment regarding the time required to return United to the top.

<p><strong>Philadelphia Museum of Art</strong> <br />This exceptional exhibition celebrates a trailblazing impressionist – one of the original group – who took the labour of women in her time seriously</p><p>Mary Cassatt’s paintings of mothers and babies were relegated to the untouchable category of “sentiment” by 20th-century critics and art historians. They have now become better known to many people as Mother’s Day cards rather than fine art. But 19th-century critics commented on the very <em>lack </em>of sentiment in Cassatt’s work, noting its intensity and daring portrayal of intimacy. This complete volte face in critical consensus is characteristic of narratives about work by women. It reflects the way our current understanding of the history of art – particularly from impressionism onwards – is shaped by the strong opinions of a few vocal critics.</p><p>This year is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/feb/24/as-france-celebrates-it-doesnt-seem-like-150-ye

Just six years old at the time of filming (the casting director spotted her in Paris arguing with her brother in the street), she gives a performance so open and natural, it has an almost transparent quality. You feel what her character Cléo feels as her world is turned upside down over one summer. Equally brilliant is another first-time actor, Ilça Moreno Zego, a real-life nanny playing Gloria, who has taken care of Cléo since she was tiny and is now moving back to Cape Verde.</p><p>The opening scenes showing us Cléo’s life with Gloria are beautifully detailed.

No. It’s just been temporarily eclipsed by satirical politics. And honestly, has there ever been a more satirical politician than Rishi Sunak? He is a natural, and we have been fortunate witnesses indeed to this brief yet dazzling masterclass.</p><p>For decades, a slow-motion metaphysical event has been crunching politics and satire together to form a super-dense singularity.

But it’s soullessly slick, fails to properly develop female characters and all feels meaningless</p><p>When the new miniseries Presumed Innocent, based on Scott Turow’s bestselling legal whodunnit, was announced, I scoffed. They made a film of that 10 minutes ago! Harrison Ford being gravelly, Bonnie Bedelia being overlooked, Greta Scacchi being a sex bomb. Except, of course, it turns out that it was 34 years ago.

<p>Throughout his life, the great German playwright made punky montages that explored how Nazism infested the country he had to flee. Why have they taken so long to come to light?</p><p></p><p>Bertolt Brecht believed that theatre should not merely entertain its audience but make them think politically. To achieve this effect, thought the German playwright and poet, a play should not be polished – but jarring. Actors should break out of character to address their audience, plotlines should be broken up and interrupted. In one memorable phrase, he described his ideal play as one that could be “cut into individual pieces, which still remain fully capable of life”.</p><p>A new exhibition at Raven Row in London shows how literal the author of The Threepenny Opera was being when he came up with that description. Curated with the Bertolt Brecht Archive in Berlin, brecht: fragments is the most extensive display to date of the visual material the playwright collected over the course of his car

<p>Hardy shot to fame singing airy, carefree pop before she took control of her career, hung out with 60s rock aristocracy and became a sophisticated singer-songwriter of rare sensuality and melancholy</p><p>Yé-yé was France’s homegrown response to rock’n’roll: pretty young singers – almost all female – performing a lightweight Francophone adaptation of American music with lyrics about teenage concerns. And at first sight, the 18-year-old Françoise Hardy was the epitome of a yé-yé girl. She was strikingly beautiful (“I was passionately in love with her,” recalled David Bowie decades later, “every male in the world, and a number of females, also were”); she was never off the airwaves of France’s premier yé-yé radio show, Salut les Copains, and never out of the pages of its accompanying magazine. Her first hit was the suitably innocent-sounding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkYuM_r8cKQ">Tous les Garçons et les Filles</a>, a wispy take on a rock ‘n’ roll ballad.</p><p>But it t
