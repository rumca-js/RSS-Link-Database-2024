## Why The Boys Season 5 Will Be Its Last - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

Just ahead of The Boys season 4 coming to Prime Video, Eric Kripke made the announcement that the popular series will be ending in season 5. Posting to Twitter, the showrunner said, “#TheBoys Season 4 Premiere Week is a good time to announce: Season 5 will be the Final Season! Always my plan, I just had to be cagey till I got the final OK from Vought. Thrilled to bring the story to a gory, epic, moist climax. Watch Season 4 in 2 DAYS, cause the end has begun!”

So what does that mean ‘the end has begun?’ And why would a man notorious for having long running shows on television wrap this one up so soon? Supernatural, which aired on The CW, went on for 15 seasons - some might say it went on longer than it should have. But this could be Kripke learning from his previous shows and truncating the narrative he’s planned out for The Boys. Unlike Kripke’s previous hit tv series, this one is based on a comic book series which ended in 2012 after 72 published issues. So there’s already a bluepr

Star Wars: Hunters reviewed by Justin Koreis on Nintendo Switch, also available on iOS and Android.

Star Wars: Hunters is a simple but enjoyable hero shooter. The Star Wars infused presentation is well executed, striking the right over-the-top tone without tipping into obnoxious. Its amusingly chaotic casual modes find a good balance of being accessible while still allowing skilled players to rise above the pack. It’s just shallow beyond that fun, with a competitive scene that narrows the “right” choices down to just a few viable characters, and rewards that aren’t very, well… rewarding. The most intriguing things you can earn are the additional Hunters themselves, and that process eventually starts to feel like an overly aggressive monetization push. As it is, Star Wars: Hunters is like a party at the Death Star: Impressive for a bit, but probably not a place you’ll want to hang around for too long.

Alan Wake 2: Night Springs DLC reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and GeForce Now.

"Alan Wake 2: Night Springs is a compact collection of standalone stories that veer from entertainingly violent shootouts, to tense stretches of survival horror, before settling on and reveling in the utterly batshit craziness that makes Remedy’s multiverse of madness so keenly absorbing to explore. There’s admittedly not much new here from a gameplay perspective, and it feels like a bit of a tease to play as a version of Control’s heroine stripped of her special abilities in the second episode. Even so, the highs I felt during my short return to Alan Wake’s universe greatly outweighed the lows, and I’d gladly play through another collection of bite-sized side stories if Remedy ever decided to bake another batch. Could there be more Night Springs in the future? Hope springs eternal."
