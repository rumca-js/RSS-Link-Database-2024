The problems and unfairness of the copyright system are so manifest that many would like to adopt alternative approaches. But that’s a big step, and one that undoubtedly requires a certain courage. Every example that shows how the move worked for others is important, since it not only demonstrates that alternatives exist, but that they [&#8230;]

Plenty of people don&#8217;t care for all the forms of immunity the government has granted itself. And they don&#8217;t care for qualified immunity, which is a thing the Supreme Court cooked up on its own. These multiple forms of immunity have tended to become get-out-of-lawsuit-free cards for government employees, rather than the general encouragement to [&#8230;]

Maybe the real artificial intelligence was the baseless lawsuits we filed along the way. In March, we wrote about Elon’s patently ridiculous lawsuit filed against OpenAI, claiming a contract violation of a contract that didn’t actually exist. The whole thing was silly. Elon was mad about the ways in which OpenAI had changed since the [&#8230;]

While &#8220;AI&#8221; (language learning models) certainly could help journalism, the fail upward brunchlords in charge of most modern media outlets instead see the technology as a way to cut corners, undermine labor, and badly automate low-quality, ultra-low effort, SEO-chasing clickbait. As a result we&#8217;ve seen an endless number of scandals where companies use LLMs to [&#8230;]

These lawsuits don&#8217;t work. They just don&#8217;t. And yet, they&#8217;re filed seemingly all the time. When YouTube decides as a private company it would rather you take your stupid shit elsewhere, it&#8217;s allowed to do so. Its terms and conditions contain a phrase found pretty much anywhere: &#8220;or for any other reason.&#8221; That means that [&#8230;]

Back in May, Microsoft announced that it was bringing a new feature to Windows 11 dubbed &#8220;Recall.&#8221; According to Microsoft&#8217;s explanation of Recall, the &#8220;AI&#8221; powered technology was supposed to take screenshots of your activity every five seconds, giving you an &#8220;explorable timeline of your PC’s past,&#8221; that Microsoft&#8217;s AI-powered assistant, Copilot, can then help [&#8230;]

Nearly two years ago, we wrote about a trademark opposition conflict in the UK between macro-distillery Campari and a tiny, one-man beer brewery operation called Dark Sky Brewery. Steve White, the owner/operator for Dark Sky Brewery, filed to trademark the name of his business. On the very last possible day of the objection window, Campari [&#8230;]
