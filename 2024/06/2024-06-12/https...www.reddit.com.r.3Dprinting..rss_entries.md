<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I bought a roll of their PETG STARRY BLUE loved the colour and I opened the box it was not vacuum sealed I could not find a hole but I tried using it anyway. </p> <p>My first print failed it was stringy and crunchy. tried it a few more times with different settings on my Bambu P1S no luck so I e-mailed them asking for any help. that was a Friday over the weekend I learned that I should be drying petg when I get it but I did not and still don't have a dryer getting one just can't atm.</p> <p>Just got an email from them today with tips for printing but also just them sending me a new roll for 100% free and I get to keep the roll I have. No blaming me for not knowing how to use the product or having to try 30 different things before they would send a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/uwZFxMR">replacement</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kensik"> /u/Kensik </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddi
