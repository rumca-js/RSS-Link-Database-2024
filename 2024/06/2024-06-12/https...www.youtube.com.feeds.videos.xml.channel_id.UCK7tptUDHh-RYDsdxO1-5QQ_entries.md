Tesla shareholders are again being asked to approve Elon Musk’s record pay package after a Delaware judge struck it down. But there is more than compensation at stake. After the initial pay deal was shot down, Tesla’s board is hoping a second vote will help secure Musk’s compensation and keep the CEO, who also owns X and runs SpaceX and xAI, focused on Tesla. 

WSJ looks at the four ways the vote could go, and how the outcomes could affect the future of Musk and Tesla.

WSJ looks at how he turned the company from a wonky research lab to a $86 billion unicorn, while walking the thin line between commercial success and utopian ideals.
