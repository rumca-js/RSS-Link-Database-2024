<div>We&#8217;ve know that Apple planned to support WebXR for quite some time, but with VisionOS 2, the company is enabling the feature for all users. WebXR allows developers to deliver cross-platform XR experiences directly from the web, with no gatekeepers to approve or reject content.

<div>Korean media last month alleged that the Meta/LG partnership to create a high-end XR headset wasn&#8217;t going so well, suggesting either outright cancellation or a delay pushing release of a prospective Apple Vision Pro competitor to 2027. While this hasn&#8217;t been substantiated by either company, it&#8217;s clear there&#8217;s something big going on under the surface, as [&#8230;]</div>

<div>HTC has teased that some users may not even need to wear their latest Vive Ultimate Trackers soon thanks to an upcoming AI-powered body tracking update. HTC&#8217;s Vive Ultimate Trackers are capable of inside-out body tracking thanks to the inclusion of two on-board cameras that track its own position in space, requiring you to strap [&#8230;]</div>

<div>For basic Vision Pro interactions like navigating apps and scrolling web pages, the headset&#8217;s look-and-pinch input system works like magic. But if you want to go more &#8216;hands-on&#8217; with virtual content, the headset&#8217;s full hand-tracking leaves much to be desired. Compared to Quest 3, Vision Pro&#8217;s full hand-tracking has notably more latency. That means when [&#8230;]</div>
