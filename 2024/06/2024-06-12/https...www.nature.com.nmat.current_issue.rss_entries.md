<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 12 June 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01918-9">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01918-9</a></p>Biomarkers in biofluids are widely used for medical diagnosis, but their use is limited by accessibility. Here the authors present a stretchable wearable sensor allowing in situ detection of solid-state biomarkers on human skin, hence avoiding biofluid acquisition.
