<p>Want to turn your lone laptop into a full-blown workstation, complete with multiple monitors? If your laptop only has a single HDMI port, that can be a tricky limitation to get around.</p>



<p>Unless you use a docking station! A docking station is like a USB hub, except more powerful and less portable.</p>

<p>GDDR6 (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;Graphics Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory version 6&rdquo;) has been around for seven years, and now it looks like the next revision is right around the corner.</p>



<p>SK Hynix, one of the &ldquo;Big Three&rdquo; memory manufacturers alongside Samsung and Micron, says it&rsquo;ll be ready to mass produce GDDR7 modules beginning in the first quarter of 2025. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/21435/sk-hynix-to-start-mass-production-of-gddr7-in-q1-companys-rep&amp;xcust=2-1-2365111-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pc
