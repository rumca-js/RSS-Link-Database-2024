We saw a live gameplay demo of the upcoming Monster Hunter: Wilds, which showcased the game's new systems and deeper open world.

The world is bigger and filled with even more monsters to hunt, granting more opportunities to lure beasts into traps, or have them engage other monsters across the wilds, all before returning to town and enjoying some well earned, stat buffing cheese.

Your companions will also have more of a role in your hunts, meaning your pals and mounts will never be short of ways to assist you during battle or exploration.

Monster Hunter Wilds is set to release in 2025 on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S

Big storms and playable Ghouls! We played a little of Fallout 76's massive new expansion, Skyline Valley, and also learned more about the addition that so many Fallout fans have been waiting for - the ability to play as a ghoul.

Skyline Valley is Fallout 76's next big piece of content, expanding the wasteland south with a new storm-torn region to explore. Players will be able to uncover the mysteries of ghoul filled Vault 63, and fight off the new electrified "Lost" ghouls as they try to harness the storm. 
Later, in early 2025, Fallout 76 will also introduce something Fallout fans have wanted for a long time, the ability to play as a ghoul.
