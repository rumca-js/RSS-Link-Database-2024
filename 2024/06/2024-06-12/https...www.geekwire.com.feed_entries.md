It could happen, says James Burk, the executive director of the Mars Society. &#8220;One of our advisers did a really deep dive on how the Apollo astronauts interacted with each other and with the CapCom back on Earth, and he came to the insight that the Apollo 17 astronauts were using CapCom almost like an AI bot &#8212; because the CapCom knew everything,&#8221; Burk said during a panel discussion focusing on the intersection of artificial intelligence and space&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-space-week-ai/">Read More</a>

Yes, the Spokane area was where Stockdale was living at the time. However, there was also a strong pool of hardware design talent in the area, including hardware engineers with expertise in networking technology, thanks to companies including Packet Engines, HP-Agilent, and others in the region at the time.
