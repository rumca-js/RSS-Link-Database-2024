<p>WWDC’s biggest news is and was <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2140505/wwdc-apple-intelligence-makes-email-great-again.html">Apple Intelligence</a>, obviously. But beyond what might become the world’s most trusted generative AI (genAI) platform, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">WWDC 2024</a> has produced a variety of enhancements aimed at enterprise IT. </p>

<p>With a heavy focus on artificial intelligence during <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/101/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the WWDC keynote</a> on Monday, Apple executives spent just a short time outlining features coming to the company’s Vision Pro “spatial computing” headset. There was little in the visionOS 2.0 update to boost the office productivity credentials save for a larger virtual monitor. </p>



<p>There were, however, signs of how the device could become more useful for frontline workers with the addition of “enterprise APIs” for visionOS 2.0. </p>

<p>Imagine that your Windows PC took screenshots of everything you do on it, including of personal data, credit card and other financial information, passwords, web sign-ins, emails, a list of web sites that you don’t want anyone to know you’ve been visiting, business information and more. Imagine your PC creates a searchable database of it all — and imagine how valuable that information would be if accessed by someone other than you.</p>



<p>No security or privacy issues there — after all, what could go wrong? </p>

The company looks like it’s ramping up development of new Windows 10 features this summer — all while insisting it will <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1614268/microsoft-all-things-must-end-even-windows-10.html">end support for the OS in October 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a business user or a consumer, it’s natural to wonder what exactly Microsoft is doing, why it’s happening, and what it all means for Windows 10’s support timeline.</p>
