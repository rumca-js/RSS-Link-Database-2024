<p>Over the last decade or so, a slew of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3218074/what-is-rust-safe-fast-and-easy-software-development.html">Rust</a> web frameworks have appeared, each built with slightly different users and feature needs in mind. All of them benefit from Rust's type safety, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3714925/rust-memory-safety-explained.html">memory safety</a>, speed, and correctness.</p><p>This article is a quick look at five of the most popular Rust web frameworks: Actix Web, Rocket, Warp, Axum, and Poem. All of them provide common elements for web services: routing, request handling, multiple response types, and middleware. Note that these frameworks do not provide templating, which is typically handled by separate crates.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715436/5-popular-rust-web-frameworkswhich-one-is-right-for-you.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></art

<p>Java’s <code>sun.misc.Unsafe</code> class has been in use since 2002. It provides essential low-level methods that framework developers use to deliver otherwise unobtainable features and performance. Unfortunately, <code>Unsafe</code> also has long-standing problems related to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3272244/what-is-the-jvm-introducing-the-java-virtual-machine.html">JVM</a> maintainability. And, as the name implies, it isn't exactly safe to use. A newer JEP proposes to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3712663/java-proposal-would-scrap-sunmiscunsafe-memory-access.html">remove sun.misc.Unsafe's memory access methods</a> in a future Java release. But what will replace them?</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715492/whats-wrong-with-javas-sunmiscunsafe.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
