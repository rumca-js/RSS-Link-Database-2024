<p>Billie Eilish’s third is a triumph, Shabaka goes woodwind and Yunchan Lim makes<strong> </strong>the most thrilling piano debut of the decade … here are our music team’s picks of the best LPs from the first half of the year</p><p>Being called “overproduced” is generally a criticism but BMTH make it a virtue on this ridiculously high-intensity album. The glitched-up production reflects a fiendishly intricate digital world, while frontman Oli Sykes’ emotions are more histrionic – and affecting – than ever. At a time when so many bands are content with tinkering at the edges of what’s been done before, it’s bracing to hear BMTH be so relentlessly ambitious and fused to the present moment. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/24/bring-me-the-horizon-post-human-nex-gen-review-a-defining-album-of-our-digitally-overloaded-era">Read the full review</a>. <em>Ben Beaumont-Thomas</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/12/the-best-albums-of-

<p>Shakespeare was inspired by the homoerotic poetry of Richard Barnfield – so why has it taken so long to acknowledge the connection between them?</p><p>The year 1594 was a fruity one in English literature, in part thanks to the influence from beyond the grave of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a>. Two of the dramatist’s most queerly themed plays made it into print that year: Edward II, about the medieval king’s passionate desire for his favourite Piers Gaveston; and Dido, Queen of Carthage, a dramatisation of the Aeneid that opened with a remarkable scene of erotic foreplay between Jupiter and his sexual plaything, Ganymede.</p><p>Yet even Marlowe’s vivid homoeroticism paled in comparison with the work of a very young and bold new poet who arrived on the scene that autumn. Richard Barnfield was just 20, recently down from Oxford, and ready to put to use an adolescence spent reading as much queer classical and vernacular literature as he cou

That’s what his new documentary, Brats, lays out before turning into something else: an opportunity for McCarthy to catch up with the audience and embrace how the term Brat Pack embalmed them in a seismic and precious pop-cultural moment.</p><p>Brats is a personal journey, with camera in tow, for the actor who played the gentle but daft heartthrob opposite Molly Ringwald in Pretty in Pink and the forlorn one in the brattiest ensemble of them all, St Elmo’s Fire. The audience rides shotgun as McCarthy reunites with fellow Brat Packers like Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Ally Sheedy and Demi Moore. They therapize themselves and that moment (Moore
