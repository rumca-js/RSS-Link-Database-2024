<p>Last year's Dead Space remake was a shining example of a remake done right. Isaac Clarke's return trip to the USG Ishimura brilliantly captured the atmosphere of the original while offering overhauled visuals and modernized mechanics. And though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-no-longer-working-on-dead-space-2-remake-insider-claims/1100-6522552/">the future of the franchise, if it even has one, remains murky</a>, there's at least one new piece of Dead Space media to look forward to. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506742300?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">The Art of Dead Space</a></strong> is slated for a <strong>December 10</strong> release, with preorders available now at Amazon.</p><div class="norewrite" title="6524215 - The Art of Dead Space Preorders">  <div class="buylink-container">                                                                     <div class="js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container">             <h2 class="item-title">

<p dir="ltr">Extraction shooters have taken over battle royale as the PvP genre du jour. Load out, drop in, loot up, and hopefully escape with your life; it's a fun gameplay loop and has already been done in a number of different frameworks, from hardcore settings like Escape From Tarkov to the haunted bayou of Hunt Showdown. Heck, even Call of Duty tried it with its short-lived mode, DMZ. For a new game to stand out and survive in this competitive genre, it has to do something different, and Sharkmob's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/exoborne/">Exoborne</a> may have just the thing to put some distance between itself and its countless counterparts.</p><p dir="ltr">I hesitate to call Exoborne's best feature a hidden gem or a secret weapon since there's really nothing subtle about it.

Depending on the series, it could be a faithful retelling of the video game, like HBO's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-hbo-show-review-faithful-additive-and-excellent/1900-6418015/">The Last of Us</a>, or something completely original, like Paramount+'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/knuckles-tv-show-review-barely-knuckled/1900-6418214/">Knuckles</a> and Halo, or even Peacock's Twisted Metal.

And in a new interview, the actor revealed that he came up with Loki's final line in the series.</p><p>Hiddleston was paired with Shogun's Anna Sawai for <a href="https://variety.com/2024/awards/news/tom-hiddleston-anna-sawai-loki-shogun-1236021069/">Variety</a>'s annual Actors on Actors feature.

<p dir="ltr">The foundational elements of a Lego game have remained largely unchanged for 20+ years: Smash everything into bricks and studs, collect characters by the dozens, then use those characters to jump back into levels to solve puzzles that were previously gated off. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-horizon-adventures/">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> has a little bit of that DNA, and moving back to a fixed camera like the pre-Skywalker Saga games makes it look like a classic Lego game of yesteryear, but after playing 30 minutes in single-player and co-op, I came away thinking of it as the most cinematic Lego game to date. Rather than intensely focus on smashing and collecting things, it's putting the focus on Guerrilla's story--and putting that story through a kid-friendly filter.</p><p dir="ltr">"We were determined to make a Lego game unlike any other Lego game," James Windeler, narrative director at Guerrilla, told me after my hands-on session.

Lance Reddick, the late, great actor who died in 2023 previously portrayed Sylens in both Horizon games.</p><p>For this next installment of the series, the role has been recast, Guerrilla told GameSpot in a recent interview, though the actor assigned to the role is not something the studio would yet share.

The world is bigger and filled with even more monsters to hunt, granting more opportunities to lure beasts into traps, or have them engage other monsters across the wilds, all before returning to town and enjoying some well earned, stat buffing cheese.  Your companions will also have more of a role in your hunts, meaning your pals and mounts will never be short of ways to assist

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, Capcom has made a few changes to help alleviate some of the co-op headaches present in Monster Hunter World when it comes to story missions.

It was one of the biggest hits of Crowe's career, and he won Best Actor at the Oscars for his performance. Next year, Scott is returning to the franchise with Gladiator 2. But since Maximus died at the end of the first movie, Crowe has some mixed emotions about the sequel going forward without him.</p><p>"I'm slightly uncomfortable [with] the fact that they're making another one... because of course I'm dead and I have no say in what gets done," said Crowe during his appearance on Kyle Meredith's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs2PD5Sz-PI">YouTube interview show</a>.

<p>This year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> introduces, among other things, a new feature called "omnimovement," which allows players to sprint, jump, and dive in any direction. Treyarch production director Yale Miller said in an interview that he hopes this feature will become standard across Call of Duty games going forward. Miller also said it's a bigger hope for Treyarch that other studios embrace a similar kind of feature in their own games.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/interview-how-treyarch-wants-black-ops-6s-new-movement-system-to-change-the-genre/">group interview attended by VGC</a>, Miller said "time will tell" if the omnimovement system is enjoyed and embraced by players. "We think of it that way--if it's great, people are going to want it," Miller said.</p><p>He added that people might find the feature appealing in part because it's based in reality, not fict

<p dir="ltr">Last year, Atari resurrected its classic Atari 2600 home console with the all-new Atari 2600+, which features modernized touches like HDMI output and USB ports while maintaining the original's look and functionality. The refreshed retro console has been out for less than a year, but just got its first discount over <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG7LMFKY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">at Amazon</a>. You can grab it for just $115 (was $130).</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG7LMFKY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">See at Amazon</a> </div><p dir="ltr">At first glance, the Atari 2600+ looks almost identical to the original machine that first launched in the US back in 1977. Everything from the wood panel faceplate and chunky metal switches to the simple wired joystick and retro font is authentically recreated. But thanks to built-in HDMI and widescreen support, you can plug the Atari 2600+ into modern TVs and monitors.</p><figure styl

After the two-episode premiere a week ago, The Acolyte returns with a flashback episode--here, we learn about the circumstances that led to Osha training with the Jedi and Mae coming under the tutelage of a Sith.

<p>The latest Disney+ Star Wars series, The Acolyte, has drawn raves from critics (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-acolyte-review-not-messing-around/1900-6418234/">including me!</a>) and fans alike, and there's one thing that kinda binds those of us who enjoy it: That it's completely apart from the rest of the franchise because it takes place 100 years before the movies. The Star Wars franchise has so often made the galaxy feel very small, and this appears to be a nice break from that. But I'm very concerned that that's about to change, based on a key piece of info we got during this week's third episode, which told most of the story of how Mae and Osha were separated when they were kids.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: This article will discuss some major spoilers from Episode 3 of The Acolyte.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This week's episode reveals that the twins were raised in an all-female coven of Force witches who had been exiled from an unknown place and were living
