<p>We don’t know if OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is actually making any money so far. But thanks to a Wednesday <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-annualized-revenue-doubles-to-3-4-billion-since-late-2023?rc=whf0fd">report</a> in <em>The Information</em>, what we do know is that the company doubled its annualized revenue — a measure of the previous month’s revenue multiplied by 12, as the publication helpfully explained — in the last six months.</p>
<p>OpenAI’s annualized revenue was $3.4 billion, CEO Sam Altman reportedly told staff. That’s up from $1.6 billion around the end of last year, and $1 billion a year ago. Most of this revenue came from a subscription version of ChatGPT, which offers higher messaging limits to people who pay at least $20 a month, as well as from developers who pay the company to use the company’s large language models in their own apps and services. About $200 million on an annualized basis comes from Micro

<p>Sony Pictures Entertainment <a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2024/0612/sonypicturesentertainmentacquiresalamodrafthousecinema"><ins>announced</ins></a> today that it has acquired Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, a beloved independent theater business. Alamo Drafthouse won scores of loyal fans over the years for its well-enforced policy of no talking and no texting during showings, as well as its dine-in experience with food and beverage menus.</p>
<p>At least for now, the Alamo experience for viewers may not feel different under the new management. Alamo Drafthouse will continue to operate its 35 cinemas and run its Fantastic Fest film festival. And current CEO Michael Kustermann will remain at the helm and report to the head of a new Sony Pictures Experiences division.</p>

<p>There’s a whole new crop of games headed to your PlayStation console if you’re a subscriber to one of Sony’s various PlayStation Plus tiers. The additional games for the June update include 14 new titles featuring PS5-only games like the medieval RPG <em>Crusader Kings III</em>, the surreal action-adventure <em>After Us</em>, the industrial age strategy game <em>Anna 1800</em> and <em>Football Manager 2024.</em></p>
<p>The collection also includes several PS4/PS5 crossover titles starting with the critically acclaimed, fan favorite <em>Monster Hunter Rise </em>from Capcom. Others include the motocross racing game <em>Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 6</em> and the procedural police sim <em>Police Simulator: Patrol Officers</em>. A few titles originally released on the PS4 are also being added, including the first person shooter<em> Far Cry 4</em> and two LEGO games including <em>The Hobbit </em>and Disney-Pixar’s<em> The Incredibles</em>.

<div id="3698b437c8084985bb1aba9c6e181965"></div>
<p><em>Astro Bot</em> is as precise as it is ridiculous, and this is exactly what makes it so damn delightful. During my 30-minute demo at Summer Game Fest, I crashed into spiky obstacles, flew off the side of sky-high platforms, bounced into deadly projectiles and popped my little robot protagonist like an overinflated balloon — and I could not keep the smile off my face the entire time. The art style, sound effects and animations in <em>Astro Bot</em> are infused with childlike joy, taking the sting out of each failure. Simultaneously, each death felt avoidable with a little more practice, each leap landable with just one more try. Resets were quick and generous, encouraging trial-and-error while maintaining a superb platforming flow.</p>
<p>Despite its kid-friendly appearance, <em>Astro Bot </em>feels like a mature — and super tricky! — platformer.</p>

<p>Summer nights are ideal for gathering around a fire pit — but smoke in your eyes is less than fun. Solo Stove makes stainless steel numbers that minimize the smoke thanks to a double wall design that recirculates the air and reburns the particulate, resulting in less of it getting in your face and in your hair. If you've got an outdoor space that could use a little night time fire ambiance, now is a good time to get a Solo Stove as the company is hosting a sale on bundles of its more popular models.

<p>Sony takes games seriously. That’s reflected in its tentpole releases, which are overwhelmingly gritty, adult affairs like Horizon, God of War and The Last of Us. It’s surprising, then, that its Summer Game Fest demo area replaced Sad Dads and apocalypses with cutesy Astro Bot figurines and Lego. Lots of Lego.</p>
<p><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> might not have generated the Summer Game Fest headlines that the new Doom and Assassin’s Creed games did, but in many ways its legacy may be more interesting. Co-developed by Guerilla Games (known for the Horizon and Killzone series) and the AAA support team Studio Gobo, it aims to bring the world of the Horizon games to a new generation — and a new platform, the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>It’s not that news has disappeared from X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram, but the way that most users are encountering news content is vastly different from platform to platform. And much of what people say they are seeing is not coming from journalists and media organizations but influencers other unconnected accounts.</p>

<p>Elon Musk has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/musk-withdraws-his-breach-of-contract-lawsuit-against-openai-221316519.html"><ins>withdrawn his lawsuit against OpenAI, a day before a judge was set to hear a request for dismissal</ins></a>.

OpenAI said there was no such violation, and the lawsuit was likely a way for Musk to gain access to its secrets. Despite ending the suit, Musk might be nursing this grudge, tweeting if Apple integrates OpenAI’s tools into its software, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hey-elon-go-ahead-and-ban-apple-devices-211521967.html"><ins>he’ll ban iPhones from his companies</ins></a>.</p>
