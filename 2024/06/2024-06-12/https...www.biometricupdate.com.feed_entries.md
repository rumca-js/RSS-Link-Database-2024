		The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has proposed a way to fund its Biometric Entry-Exit program by changing the fee structure for applications to extend the stay of people on work visas.

DHS has been warning that it faces budget limitations that could drag out the implementation of biometric entry and exit systems across the country by its Transportation Security Administration (TSA) over the next 25 years.
