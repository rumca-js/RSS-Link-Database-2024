Also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and GeForce Now.\n\n\"Alan Wake 2: Night Springs is a compact collection of standalone stories that veer from entertainingly violent shootouts, to tense stretches of survival horror, before settling on and reveling in the utterly batshit craziness that makes Remedy\u2019s multiverse of madness so keenly absorbing to explore. There\u2019s admittedly not much new here from a gameplay perspective, and it feels like a bit of a tease to play as a version of Control\u2019s heroine stripped of her special abilities in the second episode. Even so, the highs I felt during my short return to Alan Wake\u2019s universe greatly outweighed the lows, and I\u2019d gladly play through another collection of bite-sized side stories if Remedy ever decided to bake another batch. Could there be more Night Springs in the future?
