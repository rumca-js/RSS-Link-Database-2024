<p>Azure CTO Mark Russinovich’s annual Azure infrastructure presentations at Build are always fascinating as he explores the past, present, and future of the hardware that underpins the cloud. <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/984ca69a-ffca-4729-bf72-72ea0cd8a5db" rel="nofollow">This year’s talk was no different</a>, focusing on the same AI platform touted in the rest of the event.</p><p>Over the years it’s been clear that Azure’s hardware has grown increasingly complex. At the start, it was a prime example of utility computing, using a single standard server design. Now it’s many different server types, able to support all classes of workloads. GPUs were added and now AI accelerators.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715661/inside-todays-azure-ai-cloud-data-centers.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>When designing applications, it is important to know when to use an abstract class and when to use an interface. Although abstract classes and interfaces seem similar in some ways, there are key differences that will determine which is the best choice for what you’re trying to accomplish. In this blog post I’ll discuss those differences and how to decide when to use which.</p><p>The short answer: An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override. An interface only allows you to define functionality, not implement it. And whereas a class can extend only one abstract class, it can take advantage of multiple interfaces. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2928719/when-to-use-an-abstract-class-vs-interface-in-csharp.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
