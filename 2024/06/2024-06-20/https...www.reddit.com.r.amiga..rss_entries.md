<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I can't get Dragon's Lair whdload to work on Raspberry Pi 4/Batocera. Loads to a green screen and then crashes. I tried to read some posts about this problem from years ago and it had something to do with vertical sync causing the game to crash. I can't figure out how to turn off vertical sync on Batocera or within Retroarch to get this game to work. Is there another version of Dragon's Lair whdload than 1360? Thanks.</p> <p>Edit: UAE4ARM loads the game to the &quot;Randy Linden&quot; screen then freezes.</p> <p>Edit #2: Libretro: PUAE2021 seems to work. Amiberry A500, Amiberry A500+ don't work.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/retrogamer76"> /u/retrogamer76 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dkciyq/dragons_lair_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1dkciyq/dragons_lair_help/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>About 10 years ago, I purchased a complete Amiga 500 set (including a Commodore 1080 monitor, RGB cable, power supply, 'tank' mouse, and leather dust cover) for an absurdly low price at a retro game swap meet.</p> <p>Unfortunately, due to a lack of space to set up a dedicated desk for it, the Amiga has mostly sat on a shelf since then. Now that I have moved to a bigger house, I am setting up a 'vintage computing' desk. I would like to start upgrading my &quot;new&quot; Amiga to make it into a suitable replacement for the A500 I had as a kid, which my mother tragically gave away against my wishes after we got a 386 PC.</p> <p>This Amiga 500 is a completely stock 'launch' model with a revision 3 motherboard, 512K chip RAM, Kickstart 1.2, and no upgrades whatsoever. I have ordered the following upgrades/parts so far:</p> <ul> <li>a Gotek for playing games from ADF files (for now). I hope to eventually be able to use it to write ADFs to actual floppy disk

The game is a video game adaptation of Thai kick boxing. It received high critical praise particularly for its graphics and gameplay while receiving minor criticism for its repetitiveness. A sequel with various names to distance from the Panza endorsement, including Best of the Best: Championship Karate in the United States, was released a few years later.</p> </div><!--
