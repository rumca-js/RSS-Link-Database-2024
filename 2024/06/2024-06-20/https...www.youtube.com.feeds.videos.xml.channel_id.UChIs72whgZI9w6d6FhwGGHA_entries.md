This round-up looks at the best PC cases we saw for the rest of 2024 while at Computex. Many of these haven't launched yet, but are launching over the next several months. We plan to review a lot of them with our brand new case testing methodology that we debuted a couple months ago. Mesh and airflow are dominant here, but the biggest two trends in gaming PC cases right now appear to be in the budget market (mostly $60 to $80) and in the "fishtank" PC styling. We saw a lot of reverse blade fans this year, more 140s, and some uncommon fans -- like 170s in the Lian Li 217. Wood has become more commonplace as a case paneling embellishment as well.
