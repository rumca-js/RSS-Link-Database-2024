We\u2019ll share the advice we gave YC founders to brace them for the future, and how some companies made the right move in the middle of an unusual/unsustainable moment. Join us as we look back at how it all played out.\n\nApply to Y Combinator: https://yc.link/DandM-apply\nWork at a Startup: https://yc.link/DandM-jobs", "id": 748576, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMo5-4h_XwE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCcefcZRL2oaA_uBNeo5UOWg", "source_obj__id": 404, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/iMo5-4h_XwE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "What Is ZIRP And How Did It Poison Startups?", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
