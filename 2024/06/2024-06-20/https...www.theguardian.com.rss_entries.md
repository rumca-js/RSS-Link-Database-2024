<p>Luis de la Fuente had described Spain v Italy as a <em>cl</em><em>ásico</em>, a game that could easily be a final; watching this, he might have been half right. The team he coaches beat Italy by an own goal, scored by Riccardo Calafiori, to win the Group of Death with a match to spare but that doesn’t tell the story, nor begin to express the way they took Italy apart. The surprise was not that Luciano Spalletti’s side had lost here but that they did so narrowly, somehow alive to the last.</p><p>Spain are in the next round; if they continue to play like this, they will surely go further too. Reaching the final, on this evidence, is no fantasy. The concern may be that a destruction so complete did not deliver a more comfortable victory, but what a performance this was, 20 shots fired off, 50 attacks launched, and illustrious opponents taken to pieces from the first minute to the last, when Ayoze Pérez came on and twice almost made it two.

<p>“England, England, It’s Never Coming Home.” The chant from the Denmark support – to the tune of Yellow Submarine – had been heard outside the stadium in the hours before kick-off and it would reverberate around it during a highly stressful 90 minutes.

<p>Designer features students and staff from colleges for athletic display with a sci-fi twist at the Palais de Tokyo</p><p>Olympic excellence has – understandably – been something of a theme at the menswear fashion shows in Paris this week. The latest to platform the impressive power of athletes was Rick Owens. For his spring/summer 2025 show in the grounds of the Palais de Tokyo on Thursday, he included what he called a “gymnast bouquet” – a steel structure featuring three gymnasts holding poses, carried by nine young men in shorts and vests.</p><p>Owens is a designer more usually associated with a gothy, dark aesthetic than the world of sports so this was a different take on what might be seen at the opening ceremony in a few weeks’ time. But the show also had a heartwarming story. Rather than professionals, the models here were largely students and staff from fashion colleges across Paris.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/20/rick-owens-looks-to-oly

When they talked on the phone, he was so tense that he made a list of odd, unnatural conversation topics, like how good he was at reversing in his car. When he asked her to dinner, and she wanted to do lunch instead, George had enough. He decided to break up with her<em> before </em>she could break up with him.</p><p>In nearly every episode of Seinfeld, George represented the stereotypically neurotic person: someone with a lot of anxiety who frets about everything, including romance.

<p></p><p>This result may help everyone and no one but, at the end, it had the feeling of a resounding win for Serbia. They were heading to defeat and likely elimination, the referee Istvan Kovacs checking his watch one last time, when they won a corner after desperately loading the box. Up came their goalkeeper, Predrag Rajkovic, and perhaps his presence was a crucial distraction for a hitherto tight Slovenia back line. Ivan Ilic’s delivery sailed over his head and was met by Luka Jovic, the substitute, whose header flashed past Jan Oblak.</p><p>Pandemonium ensued and there was no time for the game to restart.

<p>Concert footage, theoretically bolstered with frontman Tobias Forge’s feeble skits, seems likely to please only the diehard types</p><p>The concept of a cultural object as “Marmite” – ie you’ll either love it or hate it – is an overused one but may come into play here. Rite Here Rite Now is essentially a rock concert film, showcasing the Swedish theatrical rock band Ghost, and it’s exactly the sort of on-the-face-of-it loud and wacky business that people like to describe as a Marmite movie – but the truth is that at its core, it’s a pretty tame film, which fits the band’s goofy brand of soft metal.</p><p>Rock bands have a long history of dubious antics in their capacity as professional provocateurs, but Ghost’s major controversy is not especially rock’n’roll: it’s <a href="https://metalinjection.net/metal-crimes/former-nameless-ghoul-explains-lawsuit-against-ghosts-papa-emeritus-reveals-other-former-ghouls-identity">a legal dispute</a> as to whether the masked “Nameless Ghouls” who

Completed in 1916, when Zemlinsky had moved away from the edgier expressionism of the years before the first world war, Eine Florentinische Tragödie has a plot that could have come straight out of Italian verismo, a tale of adultery and murder set in Renaissance Italy, with a neat twist at its climax, and a suitably overheated post-Straussian score. This recording, taken from performances conducted by Marc Albrecht at the Dutch National Opera in Amsterdam seven years ago, is thoroughly competent, with John Lundgren a powerful presence as Simone, the cuckolded hu

The scene is fleeting, scary and succinct – when Dion says that life with stiff-person syndrome has been difficult, she means it.</p><p>Like her music, which has cut through the emotional defenses of millions across languages, I Am: Céline Dion is unabashedly sentimental, deeply earnest and, for a true pop diva, mostly devoid of ego, with a few exceptions.

Cage wrote Bacchanale, his first piece for the instrument that he had devised, the prepared piano, in 1940.

While he continued to sculpt, he also became a broadcaster, poet, teacher, organiser, me

## What if your ‘physician’ wasn’t actually a doctor at all? Beware this new reckless experiment | Rachel Clarke

<p>The NHS says it’s not trying to replace qualified doctors with physician associates. But we can see the terrifying truth</p><p>Something radical, precipitous and sweeping is under way in the NHS. It’s untried, untested and sorely lacking in evidence, with the potential to cause significant patient harm. I’m talking about the Department of Health and Social Care’s project to rapidly expand so-called medical associate professions (MAPs), the largest group of which are termed physician associates (PAs). None of these groups have a medical degree, nor postgraduate medical training. But their deployment in our health service is billed as “essential” workforce planning – the only way to address rising patient demand and a desperate shortage of trained medics.</p><p>Last week marked a new and depressingly low point for doctors, like me, who believe this project to be one of the most singularly dishonest, duplicitous and downright reckless political responses to the NHS workforce crisis.

<p>Clever application of the grill can turn a salad into a centrepiece: try this grilled<strong> </strong>lettuce and halloumi salad with herby sherry vinaigrette, and a colourful stone fruit salad with honey, manchego and crisp prosciutto</p><p>In summer I like to give seasonal fruits and vegetables the moment they deserve, cooking them as little as possible. Except, of course, when given the chance to grill outdoors. I am not a cook who believes in scorching food with the hardest sear or deepest grill marks, but I cannot resist a hint of the intoxicating flavour ingredients take on when they are just kissed by flames. Applied judiciously and with purpose, a basic grill is all you need to elevate even the most basic salads, making them the stars of your meal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jun/20/grilled-salad-centrepieces-grilled-stone-fruit-and-halloumi-salads-recipes-gail-simmons">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Unheard of Hope)</strong><br />The full-blooded and emotionally driven fourth solo album from the avant garde pop cellist is abundantly melodic, constantly surprising and unequivocally fantastic</p><p>A recent magazine feature described Mabe Fratti as “the best avant garde pop cellist since Arthur Russell”. It’s hard to know whether to take that as laudatory superlative or faint praise. Russell has certainly seen his star rise in recent years: an overlooked figure at the time of his death in 1992, he’s posthumously become a very hip name to drop, an influence regularly cited for his boundary-free experimentation in everything from disco to modern classical to left-field pop. Equally, the world hasn’t exactly been bursting at the seams with avant garde pop cellists since Russell’s passing: it could just as easily mean that Fratti, a 32-year-old Guatemalan based in Mexico City, is No 2 in a field of two.</p><p>But listening to her fourth solo album – after last year’s breako

<p><strong>Royal Exchange, Manchester</strong><br />Director Josh Roche’s new perspective – complete with smartphones, Instagram and Whitney Houston – breathes fresh life into a familiar classic</p><p>To update Oscar Wilde is a perilous game. He is a playwright locked in the manners and mores of his time. To change the context is to risk sacrificing the comedy. Undeterred, director Josh Roche makes a convincing stab at a 21st-century makeover of The Importance of Being Earnest, first performed in 1895, even if the concept wobbles after its initial gains.</p><p>By setting the play among today’s idle rich, Roche breathes fresh life into a familiar classic. Algernon Moncrieff (Parth Thakerar) lounges around in his smart-but-casual cottons, up-turning discarded takeaway cartons and picking out the tune of Whitney Houston’s I Wanna Dance With Somebody on his Casio keyboard.

<p>Too much of youth sport is distanced from what children need with the focus on performance rather than flair and freedom</p><p>A <a href="https://www.centreforyounglives.org.uk/play-commission">“Commission on Play”</a> has been launched this month by the social entrepreneur Paul Lindley, partnered with the Centre for Young Lives. Set up to stimulate a national conversation about how to support children to play more, it will explore the impact of technology, access to outdoor space and parental attitudes. But in the brief, other than a glancing reference to the “no ball games” culture, there’s no mention of sport as we understand it. This in itself shows how a child’s experience of play has become disconnected from sport.</p><p>Now I don’t think sport should be front and centre; this is a huge topic about the way we live our lives across society.

<p>Tales of great men dominate this otherwise sensible study of intelligence versus AI</p><p>There is, it seems, an unwritten law in the world of artificial intelligence, which I will attempt to distil here: “Any discussion of AI must include an early and robust reference to the Terminator”. Though the 1984 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamescameron">James Cameron </a>film and its 1991 sequel are quite good, here are two equally made-up but probably mostly true facts: no one under the age&nbsp;of 30 has seen either film and, in any case, neither film has anything particularly insightful to say about AI. But here we are, and the relentless analyses of the moment we are in – where we apparently stand on precipices of revolutions, ushering in utopia or the apocalypse – tend to be written by men who have seen Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Terminator failing to assassinate Sarah Connor many times over. If you can also allude to biblical creation, then you’re winning at AI bingo.</p><

<p>Opening draw with Slovenia has put Euro 2020 semi-finalists, and manager Kasper Hjulmand, under pressure</p><p>Perhaps the most striking aspect of Denmark’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/16/slovenia-denmark-euro-2024-match-report">game against Slovenia</a> on Sunday was how familiar it all felt. A side highly reliant on one outstanding creator taking the lead in a first half they controlled and then unexpectedly losing their way against physical opponents in the second half, leading to a great gnashing of teeth about what had gone wrong and why things weren’t as good as they had been at the last Euros. But for the fact that Slovenia scored an equaliser and Serbia didn’t, Denmark’s start was very similar to England’s.</p><p>To outsiders, the big story from the game was Christian Eriksen, who was brilliant in the first half, dropping deep, dictating the play and scoring the opening goal. Given he had a cardiac arrest in his previous game at the Euros,

<p>A salad can be hard to define, so why even try? Get creative with this Lao-style crispy rice salad with fried green beans and pork scratchings, or a pasta number with hard cheese and nuts – but always leave the dressing until the last moment</p><p>What makes a salad a salad? It has to feature green leaves, right? But, if so, what about pasta salad, potato salad, rice salad? And if a salad is mainly all about vegetables, what about fruit salad? There’s temperature to consider, too. If a salad has to be at room temperature, where does that leave a lovely warm salad of roast vegetables mixed with leaves and dotted with just-melting cheese? I’ve made a lot of salads in my life, and I’m still nowhere near pinning down a definition. In the absence of strict rules, though, the possibilities are almost endless. That said, there is one golden rule: always dress a salad as close to serving as possible. Do that too soon, and any leaves will wilt – and that’s definitely not within the remit.</

<p>Dysfunctional families and queer desire at the end of the world, in a compelling vision of climate breakdown</p><p>Do individual losses still matter in a&nbsp;world in its final stages? This is the&nbsp;question asked by Agnes, Isla and Irene, three queer, volatile daughters who congregate uneasily to view the corpse of their divisive, megalomaniac architect father Stephen Carmichael, while the rain pours down outside – as it has poured down for several years. Carmichael is both a contributor&nbsp;to this state of affairs – his gleaming masterpieces defied the early signs of climate crisis – and a saviour for the rich. His own house, which he now gifts provocatively to his youngest daughter alone, is a modernist folly-cum-masterpiece built high on ingeniously floating pylons.</p><p>This rainy city, where people live makeshift lives on&nbsp;the top floors of flooded tower blocks, travelling by ferry, is natural territory for Julia Armfield.

It has been Labour since 1937, with a couple of turbulent SDP years in the 80s; their canvassers have in the past been twinned with Stevenage, considered more useful there than in their own backyards.</p><p>Bookies are giving odds on Starmer’s win in his constituency of 1/250 and 1/500, making him one of the safest bets in the general election.

## I started smoking at 14 – and reached 40 a day. A single therapy session changed my life

One evening last winter, as I stood outside a pub, cigarette in hand, a friend who works in life insurance decided to calculate the chance of me dying before I hit 60 if I carried on smoking. He quizzed me about my lifestyle, plugging the answers into his death matrix. “If you give up smoking now, there’s a 6% chance you die before hitting 60. If you don’t, it’s 13%,” he concluded. Normal people will see that the chance of early death has doubled. But smokers don’t think normally. <em>Just 13%?</em> I thought.<em> I could work with those odds …</em></p><p>I love smoking. Cigarettes are the cherry on top of life’s best moments and a crutch for the worst. Is there anything better than chain-smoking in a sunlit beer garden? Or more satisfying than the victory cigarette that punctuates a completed project? Is the

<p>The Liberal Democrats began their campaign with eye-catching stunts, but it’s tactical voting that may help them breach the blue wall. Peter Walker reports</p><p>At the start of the 2024 election campaign, the Liberal Democrat strategy seemed to involve a lot of Ed Davey enacting eye-catching stunts – from paddleboarding to taking on watery obstacle courses. Then came a warm-hearted video about the leader’s life as a carer, first for his parents and then for his young son, highlighting Lib Dem social care policies. But while these moments may have cut through to voters, the party is also relying on something else to shore up its chances: tactical voting.</p><p>The Guardian’s senior political correspondent, <strong>Peter Walker</strong>, went out on the campaign trail with the party. He was struck by how it is weaponising disenchantment with the Tories to encourage voters who may prefer another party to vote for the Lib Dems as a more reliable way of keeping out Conservative MPs.</p

<p>North Korea aiding Russia’s ‘mass murder of Ukrainians’ says Zelenskiy aide; Beluga whales evacuated from Kharkiv to Madrid. What we know on day 848 </p><p>Ukraine has bid farewell to one of its fighter pilots counted among the <strong>fabled “Ghosts of Kyiv”</strong>. Lt Col Valentin Korenchuk, referred to in the military as <strong>Beekeeper, piloted a MiG-29 fighter jet</strong> in the 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade. He was lauded as Ukraine’s “best pilot” in an air force statement that this week confirmed his death in combat.</p><p>In the opening days of the Russian invasion in February 2022, social media followed the <strong>embellished exploits</strong> of the Ghost of Kyiv, a fighter pilot said to have downed six Russian warplanes. Ukrainian officialdom encouraged the myth and for a time, the title was lent to Lieutenant Colonel Vyacheslav Yerko, who went down fighting on the first day of the war, earning him the Hero of Ukraine medal.</p><p>Eventually, the military conceded
