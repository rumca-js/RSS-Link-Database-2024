## Xbox Goes Big While Sony, Nintendo Stay Silent at World's Largest Gaming Event - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
Gamescom, the world's largest gaming event (think E3 but much bigger and in Germany), will feature Xbox's largest booth they've ever had. That's impressive considering the other two major console makers won't even be there, so they're not really competing against anyone on their level. But it's a win for gamers who can make it to Cologne, Germany in August. In other news, Bluepoint Games is insisting they're still working on original IP. The Sony-owned studio is known for their next-gen ports like the PS5 remake of Demon's Souls, and the PS4 version of Shadow of the Colossus. That might be a bummer for some Bloodborne fans who were hoping Bluepoint was working on an upgraded version of that game. And speaking of soulslikes, a new Elden Ring patch is out for the base game, ahead of tomorrow's release of the highly anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree DLC.

Inside Out 2, reviewed by Siddhant Adlakha. Narrated by Tristan Ogilvie.

While its chaotic new cast serves a clear purpose, Inside Out 2 is more metaphor than meaning. It explains plenty about the confusing emotions associated with puberty, often in intelligent ways, but it rarely lets them be felt or experienced, the way its predecessor did. It also fails to live up to Pixar's own high watermarks for emotionally driven tales of adolescence – movies like Luca and Turning Red – so it feels like a step down in several regards.

During an extremely short behind-closed-doors demo for Dune Awakening, I was given my first glimpse at what the team at Funcom is expecting from this open-world survival MMO: A huge time investment from players, a compelling take on the Dune story, and several factions you can choose to learn new skills and abilities from for your journeys into Arrakis. It’s clear that the developers who gave the demo are excited about the concepts at play, boasting that the desert section of the map alone is the size of all of Conan Exiles and that they imagine you’ll spend 30-50 hours of the game leveling there. But that just seems to scratch the surface of what you’ll be able to do.
