A team of researchers has developed a gel electret capable of stably retaining a large electrostatic charge. The team then combined this gel with highly flexible electrodes to create a sensor capable of perceiving low-frequency vibrations (e.g., vibrations generated by human motion) and converting them into output voltage signals. This device may potentially be used as a wearable healthcare sensor.

## Embryo and organoid models do not threaten the definition of personhood, bioethicist says

Advances in organoids and embryonic models of human development have the potential to prompt social and existential questions --e.g., what defines human individuality? However, bioethicists say that these models have the potential to strengthen rather than weaken the concept of human individuality when considered within the philosophical frameworks of 'personhood' and sentience.

A team of scientists reports a new milestone for the sustainable production of green hydrogen through water electrolysis. Their new catalyst design harnesses so far unexplored properties of water to achieve, for the first time, an alternative to critical raw materials for water electrolysis at industrial-relevant conditions.
