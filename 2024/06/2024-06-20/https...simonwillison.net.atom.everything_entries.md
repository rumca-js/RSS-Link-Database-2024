Anthropic released a new model this morning, and I think it's likely now the single best available LLM. Claude 3 Opus was already mostly on-par with GPT-4o, and the new 3.5 Sonnet scores higher than Opus on almost all of Anthropic's internal evals.</p>
<p>It's also twice the speed and one <em>fifth</em> of the price of Opus (it's the same price as the previous Claude 3 Sonnet). To compare:</p>
<ul>
<li>gpt-4o: $5/million input tokens and $15/million output</li>
<li>Claude 3.5 Sonnet: $3/million input, $15/million output</li>
<li>Claude 3 Opus: $15/million input, $75/million output</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to Claude 3 Haiku then, which <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/13/llm-claude-3-03/">both under-cuts and out-performs</a> OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.</p>
<p>In addition to the new model, Anthropic also added a "artifacts" feature to their Claude web interface. The most exciting part of this is

It's been a while since I checked in on <a href="https://www.soundslice.com/">Soundslice</a>, Adrian Holovaty's beautiful web application focused on music education.</p>
<p>The latest feature is spectacular. The Soundslice music editor - already one of the most impressive web applications I've ever experienced - can now import notation directly from scans or photos of sheet music.</p>
<p>The attention to detail is immaculate. The custom machine learning model can handle a wide variety of notation details, and the system asks the user to verify or correct details that it couldn't perfectly determine using a neatly designed flow.</p>
<p>Free accounts can scan two single page documents a month, and paid plans get a much higher allowance. I tried it out just now on a low resolution image I found on Wikipedia and it did a fantastic job, even allowing me to listen to a simulate
