<p>This problem is apparently caused by some of the latest updates that Microsoft provided for Windows veterans in recent months. Windows 10 version 22H2 and Windows 10 version 21H2 are both affected.</p>

<p>Small form factor PC builds are as popular as they&rsquo;ve ever been, maybe more so. But it&rsquo;s become pretty rare to see a case that&rsquo;s actually designed to take advantage of the small size and let you carry it around. The new Jonsbo T6 does just that, and adds in some practicality for when it&rsquo;s sitting on your desk, too. </p>

## Good news! Most apps I’ve tried on Microsoft’s Copilot+ Surface just work

<p>Have you been burned before by Windows on Arm? Are you worried whether the apps you need will actually run on Copilot+ PCs? I was, too. But after playing around with one myself, I&rsquo;m fairly optimistic that those days are over, as Qualcomm executives promised.</p>



<p>After receiving a Surface Pro (2024) 11th Edition from Microsoft for review, I spent a good chunk of my first day just downloading various applications and seeing if they&rsquo;d run&mdash;and if they did, how well.</p>



<p>I came away with three key conclusions:</p>



<p>First, this is indeed a productivity tablet, and Microsoft and Qualcomm have done a good job making sure most common productivity application work without hassle.</p>



<p>Second, Copilot+ PCs are <em>not</em> gaming PCs, and there&rsquo;s a good chance your favorite games won&rsquo;t even run.</p>

<p>Framework has quickly become the darling of tech media and power users alike thanks to its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2004407/framework-laptop-13-review.html">completely modular and upgradeable</a> laptop systems. And, with motherboard options from Intel and AMD, to say nothing of compatibility with Windows, Linux, and Chrome, it&rsquo;s also multi-platform. Add one more to the list: the company is now offering a RISC-V motherboard for the Framework 13. </p>



<p>If RISC-V isn&rsquo;t ringing any bells, that&rsquo;s probably because it&rsquo;s not all that relevant to standard PCs. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V&amp;xcust=2-1-2373026-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Reduced Instruction Set Computer Five</a> is an open-source architecture for bo

<p>You would think that an AI PC&mdash;sorry, a Copilot+ PC&mdash;would nail down its AI experience. But Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot key on its new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop might be a little confusing to make work. If yours isn&rsquo;t working, here&rsquo;s what I did to fix it.</p>



<p>When I was testing the Surface Pro (2024) 11th Edition, the Copilot key just didn&rsquo;t work. Period. After negotiating <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2371549/surface-pro-2024-first-impressions-this-ai-tablet-needs-more-i.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s unresponsive Flex Pro keyboard and its need for a firmware update</a>, I was shaking my head. What now?</p>



<p>As it turns out, I&rsquo;m not sure if my unresponsive Copilot key was a quirk of the review process or a broader problem with Copilot+ PCs, but here&rsquo;s what happened and how I solved it. (Note that a collea

<p>My tests of the Microsoft Surface Pro (2024) 11th Edition have uncovered what appears to be the fastest browser for Copilot+ PCs, and the competition really isn&rsquo;t that close.</p>



<p>One of the questions I&rsquo;m interested in regarding Copilot+ PCs is simply how well they run conventional software: browsers, utility applications, you name it. It&rsquo;s impossible to test <em>every</em> application, but a set of top web browsers is reasonable&mdash;after all, most of us spend a considerable chunk of time just simply browsing the web.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="which-browsers-did-i-test">Which browsers did I test?</h2>



<p>As part of my testing, I downloaded Google Chrome, Opera, Mozilla Firefox, Vivaldi, and Brave, in addition to Microsoft Edge. I spent a few minutes trying out a few multimedia-heavy sites, using extensions and passwords,

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s PowerPoint is extremely popular in schools, universities, and the corporate world, but it has never been as popular with home users. Not surprising since it&rsquo;s all about creating presentations, something a private person doesn&rsquo;t have to do very often.</p>
