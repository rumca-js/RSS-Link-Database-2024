With one hand FromSoftware giveth (a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-big-new-patch-finally-lets-you-summon-torrent-to-fight-the-elden-beast">goat-horse in a more opportune location</a>, for instance) and with the other it taketh away; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s newly released 1.12 update has introduced a bug that can break things on Steam Deck - but FromSoftware says it's investigating.
</p><p>
As detailed on the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427">developer's social media feed</a>, leaving Elden Ring inactive for too long on Steam Deck renders the game unplayable in some instances - something you'll probably want to be mindful of if you need to wander off and punch something, or have a little cry.

After a bit of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-remaster-news-teased-for-showcase-tomorrow">teasing</a> and some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-delisting-prompts-speculation-of-imminent-remaster-release">original edition delisting</a>, Ubisoft has - slightly prematurely, it would seem - announced a release date for its Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition remaster. According to a now-deleted social media post, it's coming to PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch next Tuesday, 25th June - with new in-game content and more.

Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-now-playing-ubisofts-still-unannounced-beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition">confirmed</a> it was working on a remaster of its much-loved 2003 action-adventure Beyond Good and Evil last November, aft

We ran our own Digital Foundry Direct special looking at the announcements, with John Linneman and Oliver Mackenzie highlighting some of the most anticipated games - including new Metroid, Zelda and Lego titles. </p><p>While the video version of that Direct is available to watch below, I thought it might be interesting to talk about my personal highlight from the show, and perhaps more critically, how the announcements we've seen today might factor into an eventual Switch 2 launch line-up. </p><p>Starting off then, I was blown away by the Lego game: Lego Horizon Adventures. The original Horizon games - Zero Dawn and Forbidden West - have an unimpeachable setting,

With Sony having surprised precisely no-one by announcing that, once again, PlayStation won't be at this year's Gamescom, Microsoft has seized the opportunity to let everyone know that, by Jove, Xbox <em>will</em> be at this year's show.
</p><p>
Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1803774842774127085">shared the news</a> over on social media, inviting attendees to visit its "biggest booth yet" when Gamescom returns to Cologne, Germany, in August this year.
</p><p>
Microsoft will, of course, be the only major console maker to have at presence at Gamescom 2024; Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-skipping-gamescom-2024-report">confirmed it wouldn't be coming along</a> back in April, saying there would be opportunities for players to try Switch games at other events throughout the year, and PlayStation <a href="http

## Elden Ring's big new base game patch finally lets you summon Torrent to fight the Elden Beast

With Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC mere hours away from release, you might think there's not much FromSoftware could possibly do to refocus your excitement on the base game. But Elden Ring's previously promised new base game patch is now here, and it's already caused a bit of a flutter among fans - not least because it finally lets you take your trusty steed Torrent into the concluding Elden Beast boss fight.
</p><p>
Now, I'll readily admit I haven't fought the Elden Beast myself - the short explanation being my wildly misguided decision to do a purely melee-based first run through and, uh, Malenia - but even I'm aware of the boss fight's notoriety. Not due to its difficult, mind, but because it teleports itself around an arena

</p><p>
Sony, however, has skipped the event in recent years, favouring its own dedicated PlayStation showcases, and that trend continues in 2024. In a statement shared with Eurogamer, a Sony spokesperson said: "We currently have no plans to exhibit at Gamescom 2024."</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-confirms-its-skipping-gamescom-again-this-year">Read more</a></p>

The result is a surprisingly lovely experience that manages to balance the hefty demands of nostalgia, lore, and novelty.</p><p>There's a lot to get through here, as the first week-and-a-bit since release has included the main story campaign, a raid, a 12-person conclusion mission, a new subclass (Prismatic), a 2-person secret exotic activity, and the first part of a three-act episode called Echoes (episodes being the replacement for seasons &ndash; the packages which keep players going between expansions).
