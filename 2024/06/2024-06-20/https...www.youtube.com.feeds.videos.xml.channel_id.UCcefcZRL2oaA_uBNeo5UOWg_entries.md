ZIRP stands for “Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon,” and it refers to a stretch of time — most recently throughout the pandemic — in which the Federal Reserve sets interest rates around 0% and commercial banks are able to borrow money for next-to-nothing. 

In this episode of Dalton & Michael, we’ll talk about some of the downstream side effects we saw during this stretch of time: an explosion of unicorns, a surge of new investors, and the impact it had on the way founders think. We’ll share the advice we gave YC founders to brace them for the future, and how some companies made the right move in the middle of an unusual/unsustainable moment. Join us as we look back at how it all played out.
