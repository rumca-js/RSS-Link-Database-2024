I bought a new house! And I’m tearing it apart. That’s right I’m bringing this 1974 home back to the studs and completely reconfiguring the space so it makes sense for my wife’s forever home. I’ve missed renovating this way. 

This series will be a comprehensive guide for homeowners and DIYers, offering a rare, behind-the-scenes real life look at every step of the renovation processes from the initial demolition to the final reveal. 

I’m doing something different this time around. I want you all to be part of the action so for this project not only will I be filming tutorials for our channel but we will be live streaming it too.
