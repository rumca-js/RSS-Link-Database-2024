		In the latest <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/06/the-third-beta-of-android-15.html">Android 15 Beta 3</a> release, significant progress has been made in the area of biometric authentication. In addition to the enhancements to passkeys, Google has introduced security measures for sideloading APKs and addressed underperforming biometric systems.

As part of the effort to simplify the authentication process, Google has introduced single-step sign-in with passkey functionality. This feature allows users to sign into apps designed for Android 15 using passkeys in a single step, using facial recognition or fingerprint.

The updates will also address the issue of dismissed prompts. If users dismiss the prompt to use a passkey, they can still access the passkey or

		Police Scotland has commenced the distribution of an information leaflet to all individuals in police custody who have their biometric data taken due to an arrest. This new procedure stems from recommendations made in 2023 aimed at ensuring detainees are informed about the handling of their biometric data.

The Scottish Biometrics Commissioner, Dr. Brian Plastow, emphasizes the importance of this new measure, stating: “It is essential that people arrested by the police in Scotland receive their information rights when deprived of their liberty, including an explanation of why the police may take their biometric data and how it will then be used.

“With around 88,000 police custody episodes in Scotland each year, this leaflet will ensure that important information rights are

		Air travel has been getting more complicated. From security and passport checks to special documents such as COVID-19 certificates, passengers are required to carefully prepare before flying out on their vacation. The number of planes and passengers has also increased, putting airports under pressure to shorten waiting times. Upcoming travel authorization schemes such as the European Union’s Entry-Exit System (EES) are expected to bring even more complexity to our holiday getaways and business trips.

A solution that could cut through some of this complexity is Digital Travel Credentials (DTCs).

Europe and Canada have just completed the world’s first transatlantic Digital Travel Credential pilot using the DTC-1 model, allowing Belgian, Dutch and Canadian passport h

		Some beneficiaries of Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grants managed by the South African Social Security Agency (<a href="https://srd.sassa.gov.za/">SASSA</a>) must now complete a biometric identity verification (IDV) process before they are served, but the idea has not gone down well with many.
