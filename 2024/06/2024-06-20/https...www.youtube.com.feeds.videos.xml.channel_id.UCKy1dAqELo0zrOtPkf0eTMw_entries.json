But it's a win for gamers who can make it to Cologne, Germany in August. In other news, Bluepoint Games is insisting they're still working on original IP. The Sony-owned studio is known for their next-gen ports like the PS5 remake of Demon's Souls, and the PS4 version of Shadow of the Colossus. That might be a bummer for some Bloodborne fans who were hoping Bluepoint was working on an upgraded version of that game.
