In May, the National Science Foundation announced plans to add questions about sexual orientation and gender identity to its Survey of Earned Doctorates, an annual exit survey of all individuals who will receive a research doctorate from U.S. institutions. The survey's data have been used since 1957 by NSF, the NIH, Congress, and the White House to track the makeup of the U.S. research workforce, set national policies, and direct funding toward data-driven solutions.

Nearly half of the world's large lakes have lost resilience, or the ability to bounce back after an abrupt disturbance, in recent decades, according to the first global assessment of long-term changes in lake resilience. Lakes in eastern North America and northern Europe have been hit the hardest, and dense populations and pollution are largely to blame, the study suggests. However, wealthier regions had healthier lakes, suggesting costly conservation efforts may pay off.

That is, calcite is shaped like a distorted cube. One of Earth's most abundant minerals, calcite is a major component of limestone and marble. It is also the most stable of the three common, naturally occurring crystal forms of calcium carbonate; the other two forms are aragonite and vaterite.

Plant diseases caused by pathogens like Colletotrichum fructicola lead to significant agricultural losses, particularly in fruit crops such as pear, apple, and peach. Traditional control methods often fail as pathogens adapt to plant defenses. Nonhost resistance (NHR) offers a promising alternative due to its robustness and broad-spectrum effectiveness. NHR occurs when a plant species is naturally resistant to pathogens affecting other species.

Huaguang Reef, one of the expansive atolls in the Xisha Islands, is completely mature, stretching 31 kilometers from east to west and 12 kilometers from north to south. Positioned as a concealed reef in the water, only the north and south gates are connected to the sea, attracting frequent fishing activities by local fishermen. However, the ecological environment and biological communities of Huaguang Reef are susceptible to disturbance s from both natural forces and human activities. Consequently, it serves as an exemplary ecosystem for studying typical coral reef fisheries, offering insights into fish species composition and community structure.

Daya Bay is a representative semi-enclosed bay in the South China Sea, with a variety of ecosystems including mangroves, coral reefs, shelves, estuaries, salt marshes and quagmires. It is an important spawning ground, feeding ground and germplasm bank of main economic fish in the South China Sea. However, with the combined effects of multiple stressors such as human activities and climate change, especially environmental pollution, overfishing, and habitat fragmentation, fish resources in Daya Bay are in a state of decline. Long-term variation in fish community structure in this Bay remains uncertain.
