<p>Following the success of Persona 5, game director Katsura Hashino sensed he and the series were going in different directions. Rather than follow the series' trajectory to, presumably, another place of higher learning, Hashino rallied forth a team intent on venturing into a new genre: high fantasy.</p><p dir="ltr">Enter Metaphor: ReFantazio, a new IP being developed by a new branch of Atlus, Studio Zero. Yet despite working under a new name--and the desire to pivot away from Persona--my time with Metaphor: ReFantazio reassured me that the game will be familiar and every bit as stylish as the critically acclaimed RPG series. Even more importantly, however, it also proved to me that the team's new IP will usher forth a new era for Atlus--one filled with the spirit of adventure and perhaps even more focus on the human condition.</p><p dir="ltr">The portion of the game I played at Summer Game Fest 2024 was divided into three sections: one focused on the game's archetype system, one foc

<p>LucasFilm has been cagey about which actors will return for Star Wars: Andor Season 2, but it seems that Ben Mendelsohn will be among that group. According to <a href="https://theplaylist.net/andor-ben-mendehlson-will-reprise-his-orson-krennic-role-in-season-two-exclusive-20240624/">one report</a>, the actor will come back in the later episodes of the season to reprise his role of Imperial Director (and Death Star architect) Orson Krennic.</p><p dir="ltr">The Playlist reported earlier this week that Mexican filmmaker Alonso Ruizpalacios told them in an interview that he enjoyed directing Mendelsohn, along with other noted Andor actors like Stellan Skarsgård and Forest Whitaker.

<p dir="ltr">As the Switch moves into the twilight years of an especially lengthy lifespan, Nintendo has increasingly turned toward remasters of its back catalog to fill out the release calendar. This is the context for Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, a remastered version of a relatively recent 2013 release on 3DS. The sequel is a game that served as a sharpened, refined take on the ideas presented by the first Luigi's Mansion--and laid the groundwork for the even better Luigi's Mansion 3--so having access to that piece of the series' history untethered from the 3DS makes it feel that much more valuable. While the recency makes it feel less essential than some remasters of older classics like Metroid Prime or Super Mario RPG, it's still just as fun to solve puzzles, schlurp ghosts into your jerry-rigged vacuum cleaner, and enjoy some gentle scares along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Luigi's Mansion was a cute diversion-verging-on-tech-demo that helped cement Luigi's personality as Mario
