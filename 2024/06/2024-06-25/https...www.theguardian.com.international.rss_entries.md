<p>It had been universally accepted that England needed a performance to reinvigorate their fans here in Germany after the toil of their opening Euro 2024 ties against Serbia and Denmark. Well, one of the principal takeaways from a claustrophobic and emotional night was that the fans were certainly connected.</p><p>Moved to boo at the interval after a flat display, they raised the intensity in the second period, belting out their songs for almost the duration of it. There was something faintly heroic about their efforts. They willed their team to make the breakthrough and yet it did not happen for a reason. Gareth Southgate’s team lacked the penetration and the quality where it mattered the most, despite dominating for pretty much the entire occasion in terms of possession and territory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/25/england-slovenia-euro-2024-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Any thesis on why 24 teams should never have been permitted in the European Championship must feature this game. A stiflingly hot evening in Bavaria saw Denmark and Serbia do absolutely nothing to prove the expansion of this tournament has increased entertainment levels. The occasion was notable for Christian Eriksen winning his 133rd cap, a record for a male Danish player, and … that was about it.</p><p>Serbia had threatened to withdraw from the Euros last week. Two games later, they have exited anyway. This will be met with general shrugs. Denmark and Eriksen have prolonged their stay in Germany. Still, it was impossible to watch the Danes here – functional, physical, little nuance – and foresee them making impact beyond the last 16. Denmark will argue with a degree of legitimacy that it was Serbia who needed to win here but there was literally nothing from either team worth getting excited by.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/25/denmark-serbia-e

Because no one else was making the images I wanted to see.”</p><p>The images Corinne made, in part because nobody else was doing it, remain extraordinary, invigorating and quietly radical.

Honey, for example, will give “a natural stickiness that helps adhesion to your salad, while the sweetness balances the acidity of vinegar,” says Tony Rodd, head chef at <a href="https://www.pomus.co.uk/">Pomus</a> in Margate.

It’s in the way that the game is designed so perfectly around the controller that you play with, taking advantage of all the DualSense controller’s bells and whistles. The spacey aesthetic, where different planets represent different colourful worlds to jump into, recalls Super Mario Galaxy. And there’s also the sense of pure joy that you feel when you play it. On a console whose most famous hits are rather self-serious – think God of War and The Last of Us – Astro Bot prioritises playfulness.</p><p>“I think Sony has the mindset of coolness in its product design, but there is also playfulness,” says Nicolas Doucet, the studio director at Team Asobi, the Japanese studio behind Astro Bot. “They’re not mutually exclusive, or seen as antagonistic…

The Denmark fans, overlooked by the magnificent Alte Oper house that was rebuilt in the 1970s after being destroyed by Allied bombs in 1944, have clearly been working on the impressive repertoire of songs referencing previous English failures that would be repeated throughout the day.</p><p>On this occasion, they are being aimed in our direction.

## ‘He will really thrive’: Timi Max Elsnik faces England with point to prove

<p>Midfielder struggled to break through at Derby County but is now one of Slovenia’s most dangerous players</p><p>When Timi Max Elsnik takes to the field against England on Tuesday, chances are the Slovenia midfielder will have a flashback to an Under-17 European Championship qualifier between the countries in the more modest surrounds of Chesterfield nine years ago. England won 3-1, the captain Reece Oxford opening the scoring, but Elsnik was arguably the&nbsp;best player on the pitch. Elsnik,&nbsp;a tidy technician, displayed much of the ability he has showcased so far at Euro&nbsp;2024: composure under pressure, poise on the ball and an eye for a pass.</p><p>Elsnik was unattached at the time but on the radar of Derby County, whose then academy director Darren Wassall and coach Pat Lyons took in the game. “He could handle the ball, his first touch was excellent,” Wassall says. “We&nbsp;always looked for players who&nbsp;could play forward. He knew where the next pass was going, his

<p>Gareth Southgate is expected to make changes for the final Group C match in Cologne, where a win will seal top spot</p><p>The sun looks set to shine on England’s footballers on Tuesday night; literally, at least. After 10 days of downpours and hanging cloud at Euro 2024, there are clear skies expected and temperatures of about 25C (77F) when the Three Lions step on to the field to face Slovenia in Cologne.

<p>The coastline near Marsala is the perfect spot to practise your Superman moves on a residential kitesurfing course</p><p>There’s no escaping it: kitesurfing is a daunting sport for beginners. Don’t be fooled by the name – it is nothing like flying a kite in a park. On the first day of a week-long kitesurfing course in Sicily, I found myself in the sea attached to an enormous polyester wing that was powerful enough to lift me clear of the water and send me hurtling through the air.</p><p>Despite my nerves, I could see that the Stagnone Lagoon near Marsala, western Sicily, is a great place to learn. The lagoon is shallow enough to stand up in, has no waves and is protected by four islands – Isola Grande, San Pantaleo, Santa Maria and La Schola – that create a natural wind tunnel; there is a consistent breeze from spring to the end of October. The area is popular with kitesurf schools, including mine, <a href="https://www.ucpa.co.uk/holiday-types/planete-worldwide-trips">UCPA Planète<

He’d even put posters up in the Tesco&nbsp;round the corner.</p><p>The phone rang. “Yes, we have a children’s craft session at two,” said Curran’s colleague Amanda Giles, her voice warm and encouraging. “Just come along.” They’d already received an urgent request from the housing team at a nearby council, about someone who had to scan a form by 2pm if he was going to be housed before Christmas.
