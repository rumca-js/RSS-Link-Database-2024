Final Fantasy 14's latest expansion, Dawntrail, launches on July 2nd for PS4, PS5, PC and Xbox Series X/S (June 28th for pre-orders). As the first paid content drop in years, it's offering a clean slate as players embark on a journey to a vibrant new land, Tural, for a rite of succession ceremony.

There are new people to meet, characters to interact with, dungeons to explore and quests to pick up. Of course, players can engage with new raid content, whether it's the mysterious Echoes of Vana'diel raid that ties into Final Fantasy 11 or The Arcadion, where fighters and mages compete, and only the best survive.

An increased level cap, the Viper and Pictomancer Jobs, new Trials and much more await, alongside the MMO's first major graphical update. Here's everything you need to know about Dawntrail before picking it up next month.
