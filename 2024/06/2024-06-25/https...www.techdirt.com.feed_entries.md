The recent publication of Griner v. King seems to have just about everything: an iconic meme (Success Kid!), a troll-ish politician, charges of political censorship, and an application of the latest big Supreme Court opinion on fair use, Warhol v. Goldsmith. Oh my! But the most important thing for friends of fair use to know [&#8230;]

We weren&#8217;t planning to do a series, but after our last two episodes with Alice Marwick and then Candice Odgers, things have lined up nicely for a trifecta of episodes about the current moral panic around kids and social media. This week, we&#8217;re joined by Dr. Devorah Heitner, an expert on kids and technology and [&#8230;]

Certainly, there has been a lot of reporting to that effect over the years, and now that might have some legal consequences, though perhaps not the ones you’d expect. Media Matters [&#8230;]

Yet another attempt to mandate broken encryption has been disrupted. The Australian government has long held the belief that broken encryption would be a net win for citizens. Or, at the very least, it&#8217;s pretty sure it will be a huge win for law enforcement, which won&#8217;t have to deal with encrypted communications or devices. [&#8230;]

The Julian Assange saga has finally reached its absurd conclusion with a plea deal. But while Assange may be heading home to Australia, the implications for press freedom remain as dire as ever. The U.S. government has successfully criminalized a core function of journalism &#8211; working with sources to obtain and publish information in the [&#8230;]

When it comes to China, the U.S. likes to pretend its business policies are well-crafted, logic-driven decisions based on the welfare of the markets and the public, but very often that&#8217;s simply not the case. We&#8217;ve already noted how the TikTok ban is an unconstitutional mess that doesn&#8217;t have the public&#8217;s support, in large part [&#8230;]
