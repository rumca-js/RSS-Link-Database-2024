<p>Microsoft has made a questionable change in Windows 11 that takes away your freedom of choice for OneDrive backups.</p>



<p>Without prior notice or explanation, Microsoft now force activates the automatic folder backup with OneDrive feature when you set up a new computer, all without asking you for permission.</p>



<p>When you set up a new Windows computer while connected to the internet and using a Microsoft account, you usually see OneDrive on your desktop. The app synchronizes data from folders&mdash;such as images, documents, music, and videos&mdash;which can be useful in certain cases.</p>

For many, WordPad was a simple but useful alternative to Microsoft Word&mdash;but it will no longer be offered in future versions of Windows.</p>



<p>Windows 11 24H2 will mark the final end for WordPad, as the AI features of that Windows version will <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.windowslatest.com/2024/03/27/microsoft-confirms-windows-11-24h2-removes-wordpad/&amp;xcust=2-1-2376881-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">delete legacy features like the free text editors</a>.
