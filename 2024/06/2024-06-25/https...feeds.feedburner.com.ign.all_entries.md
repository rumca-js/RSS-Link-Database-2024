With only an hour or so of rounds under my belt, I still have a lot to learn about Supervive. It’s a battle royale full of ideas, and some of the inspirations are pretty easy to identify - many games like it have big maps with hotspots worth fighting over for high level loot. But when it innovates on its own, like with its roster of dynamic and expressive characters, and lots of tactical options presented by its exciting movement system and roster of active and passive items, there’s no game quite like it.

Earth Defense Force 6 is still EDF at its core, certainly: Blow through missions, tweak your weapons, find favorites, find upgrades, get chewed up by a horde of monsters, get better, roll credits, unlock a new difficulty, and start the grind over against bigger nastier enemies with your new bigger, nastier weapons. There's a story here, but it's more of a B-movie story experience about laughing at the silly characters while getting ragdolled by giant ants, and any important story stuff is going to get repeated by random NPCs six or seven times because this is not a super-high-touch, pay-attention-at-all-times prestige television story or game. This is a chase-high-scores-on-the-couch, dead-tired-with-buddies-after-work game series.
