WELCOME TO SPEARHEADZ! This casual gaming series is going to explore Warhammer's new format of fixed-list casual gaming. This wide-onramp new system for playing Games Workshop's cosmic-fantasy wargame is perfect for the kitchen-table game crowd and is perfectly suited for where I'm at with gaming. 

The Fire and Jade book in the new  Skaventide boxed set has the complete game along with all the armies for this format; so we're going to dig into that all week long!

We're back for another monthly LIVE HANG FREEPISODE. On a Monday..... like normal.  As this Monday Hang has coincided with the big summer release from GW you can come pick my brain about this latest mainstream offering, listen to me answer questions from the Patron Mailbag and generally dither-on for an hour! Let's get WEIRD. 

We're live at 6pm BST, 1pm EST and 10am PST.
