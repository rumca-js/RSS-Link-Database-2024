<p>If you’ve been dreaming about spending your summer whispering sweet nothings into the digital ears of one of the seductive ChatGPT voice assistants that OpenAI <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-claims-that-its-free-gpt-4o-model-can-talk-laugh-sing-and-see-like-a-human-184249780.html">showed off</a> last month, you’ll have to dream a little longer. On Tuesday, the company announced that its “advanced Voice Mode” feature needs more time in the oven “to reach our bar to launch.” The feature will be available to a small group of users to gather feedback, and then launch to all paying ChatGPT customers in the fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re improving the model’s ability to detect and refuse certain content,” OpenAI posted on X. “We’re also working on improving the user experience and preparing our infrastructure to scale to millions while maintaining real-time responses.”</p>

<p>Volkswagen and EV company Rivian have entered a new partnership, and the total price tag for the collaboration could reach an eye-popping $5 billion. The businesses are launching a joint venture to develop platforms for “software-defined vehicles.” According to the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240625966539/en/Rivian-and-Volkswagen-Group-Announce-Plans-for-Joint-Venture-to-Create-Industry-Leading-Vehicle-Software-Technology-and-for-Strategic-Investment-by-Volkswagen"><ins>press release</ins></a> announcing the deal, the joint venture's work will focus on Rivian's zone-based approach to electric vehicles, which significantly reduces the complexity of the wiring and electronics. Both Rivian and Volkswagen are expected to debut vehicles using their combined forces as a result of the partnership; the release notes that each of the brands will continue operating their vehicle businesses separately.</p>

<p>Samsung’s next Unpacked event will be on July 10.

<p>Samsung’s announcement teases “the next generation of Galaxy AI and the ever-expanding Galaxy ecosystem.” The invitation noted the city’s trendsetting reputation, describing it as the “perfect backdrop for the rollout of our latest cutting-edge innovations.” January’s Unpacked was in San Jose, ideal for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-and-s24-review-a-taste-of-generative-ai-in-everyday-use-160041639.html">AI features it debuted</a>; perhaps Paris could set the scene for something fashion-related.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meta just made an important update for Threads users who are sharing posts to the fediverse. The company began allowing users to opt-in to sharing their Threads posts to Mastodon and other ActivityPub-powered services back <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-threads-beta-lets-you-share-to-mastodon-and-other-fediverse-services-194732036.html"><ins>in March</ins></a>. But the integration has been fairly limited, with Threads users unable to view replies and most other interactions to their posts without switching over to a Mastodon client or other app.</p>
<p>That’s now changing. The Threads app will now be able to <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/introducing-threads-new-app-text-sharing/"><ins>show replies</ins></a> and likes from Mastodon and other services, Meta announced. The change marks the first time Threads users who have opted into fediverse sharing will be able to see content that originated in the fediverse directly on Threads.</p>

<p>There's a new Bluetooth tracking option for absent-minded Android owners: Motorola today <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/moto-tag-2024/">unveiled</a> the Moto Tag. The company didn't share the exact release date for the device, but said it would be available "in the coming months in select markets." We also don't have any price information yet.</p>
<p>Moto Tag runs on Google's Find My Device infrastructure, both for location data and privacy protections. A tracker isn't much good if it stops working, and Motorola claims the Moto Tag will last for a year on a single battery charge, assuming optimal conditions. In a tacit acknowledgement that the design of these trackers has already become standardized, Motorola's release noted that the Moto Tag fits into "most third-party accessories already on the market." So if you've been using AirTags, or one of the similarly-shaped Bluetooth trackers on the market, the Moto Tag should work with your existing case. Co

<p>The rise of artificial intelligence in our media and entertainment industries has raised a lot of concerns about programs like Open Al’s text-to-video maker Sora replacing the artistic endeavors and aspirations of humans. If those AI made movies are anything like a new brand film about the Toys 'R' Us toy store chain's origin story, the only thing we’ll have to fear is watching them.</p>
<p>Toys ‘R’ Us’s current owner WHP Global worked with the Emmy nominated creative agency Native Foreign to create a short brand film called <a href="https://toybook.com/ai-generated-toys-r-us-brand-film/"><em>The Origin of Toys ‘R’ Us</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>using OpenAI’s text-to-video creator Sora. The film premiered at the 2024 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity and can currently be viewed on <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67bc85b1-c506-4789-9bfe-bc082da218a8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;me

<p>Reddit has a warning for AI companies and other scrapers: play by our rules or get blocked. The company said in <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/robot-txt-update"><ins>an update</ins></a> that it plans to update its Robots Exclusion Protocol (robots.txt file), which allows it to block automated scraping of its platform.</p>
<p>The company said it will also continue to block and rate-limit crawlers and other bots that don’t have a prior agreement with the company. The changes, it said, shouldn’t affect “good faith actors,” like the Internet Archive and researchers.</p>

<p>OpenAI plans to block people from using ChatGPT in China, a country where its services aren’t officially available, but where users and developers access it via the company’s API anyway. <em>Securities Times</em>, a Chinese state-owned newspaper reported on Tuesday that OpenAI had started sending emails to users in China outlining its plans to block access starting July 9, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-cut-access-tools-developers-china-other-regions-chinese-state-media-says-2024-06-25/">according</a> to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>

This integration is only in Europe, for now, with North America coming soon.</p>
<p>What does this mean exactly? ChatGPT has been integrated into Volkswagen’s own voice assistant IDA to complement the service and add more features, sort of like how Apple is handling its own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-baked-into-apple-intelligence-185026662.html"><ins>partnership with OpenAI’s platform</ins></a>.

And with the launch of a new generation of its signature flip phone later this summer, it feels like Moto is trying to recapture some of that magic with the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=673991f4-9b22-4608-a813-f4cbfa1518a1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Motorola&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb3Rvcm9sYS5jb20vdXMvc21hcnRwaG9uZXMtcmF6ci1nZW4tNCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTcxMDc2OTUtZmE2MC00NTJkLTgyMjYtNjUzMzRjNDMyOWFiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAe9kPSJP05kuKDe316uNIGQwiw3UwYBgHKU0lCxmH5P_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-razr-gen-4">2024 Razr family</a>.</p>

<p>Atari pretty much started this whole home console gaming thing with the 2600, a precursor to the NES. That console is 45 years old and Atari itself was formed well over 50 years ago. To originally commemorate its 50th birthday, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/atari-50-the-anniversary-collection-announced-161306163.html">released a robust collection of games</a> called <em>Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration</em>. Now, it’s getting a hefty update with nearly 40 additional games, though Atari has yet to release a full list of the new titles.</p>
<p>This brings the total of games available with this collection to almost 130, derived from multiple home and portable consoles. <em>Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration Expanded Edition</em> also adds two new timelines to the software. Basically, these timelines are interactive history lessons about the company, complete with video segments and playable games.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Amazon Prime Day 2024</a> is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day-2024-returns-on-july-16-and-17-050559661.html">officially</a> a couple of weeks away now but we’re already starting to see early Prime Day deals pop up. This was expected: Amazon may deem July Prime Day a two-day event, but for years, the online retailer has hosted lead-up deals in order to drum up excitement for the main event. Most early Prime Day deals are exactly that — early discounts that only Prime members can access — but every once in a while there are some discounts available to all. We’ve collected the best early Prime Day deals here, along with the rest of the best discounts on our favorite gadgets that anyone can get from Amazon right now. We’ll be updating this post regularly, so check back to see the latest discounts.</p>
