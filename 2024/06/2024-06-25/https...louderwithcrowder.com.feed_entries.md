What benefit does that do for anyone, especially when the crimes were violent assaults against women? And how can we protect women when people who have committed violent assaults on them are housed with them? </p><p>A trans woman, aka a man, was sentenced to 312 days in jail for his violent crimes. This includes stalking, domestic violence, making false statements, and other reprehensible crimes. And even though he committed these very evil acts, he was somehow turned into a victim a

The fact that they are called “trans” means that they are someone who has changed, aka their sex. “Trans” is a Latin root that means “as to change”. But the only problem with changing your sex is that it’s impossible. Subsequently, allowing “as to change '' women to compete against immutable women is fraud. </p><p>But if trans athletes aren't stealing titles away from women, and if this specific trans athlete didn't vow to take “all the rec
