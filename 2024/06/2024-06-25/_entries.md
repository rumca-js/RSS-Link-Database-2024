The leading hypothesis for the origin of firefly lights has been overturned by a genomic analysis. It had been posited that the bright lights emitted by many species in the Lampyridae family of beetles—better known as fireflies—first evolved as a warning signal to predators, advertising the toxicity of fireflies, and were then repurposed as a mating signal. This explanation would account for why eggs, larvae, and pupae also glow.

The ability of "target tracking," i.e., keeping a target object in sight, is essential for various activities and has improved in animals and machines through the evolution of life and technology, respectively. Because most sensing systems are inevitably subject to a certain degree of delay caused by information processing, many studies have addressed the challenge of overcoming this delay constraint for more accurate target tracking. At this point, studying animals' sophisticated tracking behavior would bring a significant breakthrough against this fundamental problem.

Flower development in plants is a complex process influenced by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Hormones like gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) play pivotal roles in regulating this process. In many orchids, including the Chinese Cymbidium, flower bud dormancy is essential for surviving adverse conditions and ensuring timely blooming. Despite its significance, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying floral bud initiation and dormancy remain poorly understood. Based on these challenges, it is crucial to conduct in-depth studies on the hormonal regulation of flower development.

Plants face simultaneous challenges from pathogens and environmental stresses, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Pathogens trigger immune responses through specific receptors, while high temperatures activate heat tolerance mechanisms. Both responses involve common signaling elements, but their coordination remains poorly understood. Due to these issues, an in-depth investigation into the regulatory mechanisms is needed.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major organelle responsible for protein folding and trafficking. Protein folding stress in the ER can lead to the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins, known as ER stress, which activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, UPR can also be activated in the absence of ER stress. Deciphering the complex relationship between ER stress and UPR is critical to understanding cellular stress responses in physiological and pathological conditions.

Ferroptosis is a cell death mechanism that has only become known comparatively recently, being named in 2012. This so-called non-apoptotic cell death occurs when too many oxygen radicals and free iron are present in a cell. Certain molecules in the cell membrane, namely phospholipids, are then oxidized and thereby damaged. Without a corresponding counter-reaction, the cell membrane is eventually destroyed, leading to the death of the cell as a whole.
