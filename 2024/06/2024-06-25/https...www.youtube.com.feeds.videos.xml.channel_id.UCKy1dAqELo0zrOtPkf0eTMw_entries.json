If you\u2019re a newcomer to the series \u2013 or perhaps you only came onboard with Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 and are working your way backwards \u2013 then there\u2019s plenty of ghostbusting and puzzle-solving fun for you to find in Luigi\u2019s Mansion 2 HD\u2019s five haunted houses. However, if you\u2019re a fan of the original Nintendo 3DS version and you were hoping for more dramatic gameplay changes or additions, then you may well be a touch disappointed. What\u2019s more, playing this remaster in the wake of the third game may put its limitations in an unfavourable light. All told, though, Luigi\u2019s Mansion 2 HD is a great installment in Nintendo\u2019s spectre-snaring series, even if it\u2019s not the best one you can play on the Switch.\"", "id": 763074, "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Woe96F0w8Tc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 27, "page_rating_contents": 86, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "source_obj__id": 149, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/Woe96F0w8Tc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Review", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-25T12:00:08+00:00", "description": "Who's the hardest Elden Ring DLC boss?
