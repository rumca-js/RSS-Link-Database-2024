<p>The ability to index, query, and analyze large amounts of data from real-time sources remains a major headache for anyone involved in building database systems.</p><p>Data retrieval takes time and even that assumes that the nature of the queries lie within certain parameters. Overcoming the issue is possible but can be resource-intensive and involve complex engineering. </p><p>Meanwhile, the use cases for real-time data continue to multiply, not least in artificial intelligence (AI) applications connected to cybersecurity automation, fraud detection in financial services, and business analytics in sectors such as manufacturing.</p><p>These applications increasingly assume the ability to understand what is happening in data based on a view of the world as it is in the present, not as it was hours or days ago.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715564/openai-acquires-rockset-to-enhance-chatgpt-real-time-data-processing.html#jump">To read this a

<p>I’m not sure why our industry keeps falling into the trap that when a new concept emerges, there are near-immediate announcements that it runs best on one platform. Enterprises shouldn’t even think about other options.</p><p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/the-cloud-wins-the-ai-infrastructure-debate-by-default/" rel="nofollow">This VentureBeat article</a> is an example, although it is more balanced than most. While many pundits present cloud computing as the only rational choice for AI, many hardware vendors declare that traditional hardware is the best option. Who’s right?</p><h2>The nuances of platform selection</h2>
<p>The questions I get at AI speaking events used to be some version of “what’s the best cloud?” Now it’s “where should I run AI?” Neither question has a black-and-white answer. A lot of planning must go into the selection process to define the best clouds and best AI platforms to solve specific problems.</p><p c

<p>Developers make assumptions about how our code will behave when executed, but we're not always right. Without certainty, it is challenging to write programs that work correctly at runtime. Java assertions provide a relatively easy way to verify your programming logic is correct.</p><h2>What you'll learn in this Java tutorial</h2>
<p>In this article, you'll learn what assertions are, how to write them, and how to use them in your Java programs:</p><ul>
<li>What are Java assertions?</li>
<li>How to write an assertion in Java</li>
<li>Assertions with preconditions and postconditions</li>
<li>The difference between Java assertions and Java exceptions</li>

<p>You will find a lot of articles on the web about what it takes to become a senior developer. Many of these articles focus on soft skills. They often advise staying current with technology, learning to communicate well, mentoring junior developers, and other things along those lines. These recommendations are all fine and good, but, well, let’s be honest. They are also pretty much pabulum. </p><p>I’d like to add a little depth to the discussion. The essential difference between senior developers and junior developers is time in the software development trenches, and what they’ve learned from it. With that in mind, I’ve come up with a far-from-exhaustive list of four things the senior developers know, usually through hard-earned experience.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715601/what-senior-developers-know.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
