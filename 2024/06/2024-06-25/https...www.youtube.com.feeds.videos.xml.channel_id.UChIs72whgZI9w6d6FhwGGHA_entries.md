Wendell from Level1 Techs got up with us to talk about the decay of Google's Search behavior and results, especially with the advent of "AI" search assistants. Google, probably unexpected to them, ended up facing its first real competition in years primarily from ChatGPT. Now, Google is scrambling to add its own assistant search results. We talk with Wendell in a meandering discussion about what that means for Google.
