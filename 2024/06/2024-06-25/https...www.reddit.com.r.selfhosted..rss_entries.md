<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm choosing between two hosts. One is much closer to the users than the other. The closer one has a 20ms average ping (17 router hops) and the farther has a 40ms average ping (also 17 router hops). They are used to accessing the app on a host that has 13ms average ping (10 router hops.) They do not do large data transfers, just a web CRM app. The CRM page loads from the backend side take 0.2 seconds to generate and they are on a 250mbit connection and the page loads appear instantaneous at 13ms. Is the 20ms difference between the two new hosts I'm considering even worth considering compared to price/reliability/support speed factors? I suppose one could argue there are are several more router hops so more points of network failure. But wouldn't any decent hosting company have network peering so if a router in the middle went down typically another router will be used or would the router issue need to be at or right next to the datacenter for that to

This is a friendly reminder to update the version of the container you’re using, because it was patched a month ago in <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/releases/tag/v0.1.34">version 0.1.34</a>.</p> <p>More detail in <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/24/rce_ollama_wiz/">this article on The Register</a>, but the crux of it seems to be this:</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;What we found is that when pulling a model from a private registry (by querying the http://[victim]:11434/api/pull API endpoint), it is possible to supply a malicious manifest file that contains a path traversal payload in the dige

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been on an endless quest to find a simple replacement for Apple Notes with the following criteria:</p> <ol> <li>iOS app is a must with offline ability. </li> <li>Self hosted or at least syncing, maybe. </li> <li>Free and preferably open sourced.</li> <li>Windows app would be nice.</li> </ol> <p>Above all, not looking for anything fancy, just something like Apple Notes with simple formatting and an option to customize with plugins perhaps. </p> <p>Hope someone with far more experience can point me in the right direction. I’m actually surprised how many note taking apps there are but some are either too complicated for what I’m looking for or don’t have an iOS app. Appreciate any help! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Timely_Anteater_9330"> /u/Timely_Anteater_9330 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dnx38z/apple_notes_replacement/">[link]</a></span> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I went looking for a self-hosted way to do a gift registry for weddings / baby showers and I couldn't find anything that worked easily in docker or that wasn't a very old project.</p> <p>I happened to find <a href="https://github.com/Wingysam/Christmas-Community">Christmas-Community</a> and despite the misleading name, it works really well for gift registries if you set it up in single mode (with the environment variable <code>SINGLE_LIST=true</code>).</p> <p>Pros: </p> <ul> <li>Dead simple interface: You can suggest items and pledge to buy. There isn't much more to it and it's great.</li> <li>If you submit a link to a product it will do a good job at detecting the name, price and other product metadata.</li> <li>Multi user setup with links to set passwords</li> <li>Admins can log in as test users to see what they would see</li> <li>Good deal of customization</li> </ul> <p>Cons/areas for improvement:</p> <ul> <li>I would have found the project faster
