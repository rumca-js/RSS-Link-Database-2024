## Bad Press review – Native American journalists’ thrilling battle for free speech

<p>This documentary’s plunge into the fight to regain editorial independence for Oklahoma’s Muscogee Nation is a murky, twisty tale </p><p>It can take decades to win a free press, but only a moment to lose it. Bad Press, a woolly but instructive documentary in the Storyville strand, begins by showing us one such moment. A group of casually dressed people are hunched round a long table in a room cluttered with filing cabinets and spare chairs. This is the legislative council of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, sitting in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. After a brief debate, the motion in front of them is carried by seven votes to six. With that, the Nation’s government‑funded newspaper and radio station lose editorial independence.</p><p>This is 2018. Three years earlier, the Muscogee Nation had enshrined the freedom of its press in law. Native American tribes are not bound by the US constitution – which includes that protection – because they govern themselves independently. Almost none of them have

## Robert Lewandowski’s penalty pegs back France to earn point for Poland

<p></p><p>There was the moment of unbridled joy Kylian Mbappé had presumably visualised in recent days: whipping off his black mask and celebrating before thousands of France supporters in the imposing, iconic steep Sudtribune. He struck a second-half penalty to relieve France’s goalscoring frustrations but by the end of a stodgy team performance he cut a contrasting figure, fidgeting with the mechanics of his mask in sticky heat. Mbappé was easily France’s best player but the bad news for France was there was another returning forward in the shape of Robert Lewandowski, who earned an unlikely point, also scoring from the spot.</p><p>It was a damaging goal with ramifications in Group D, Austria beating France to top spot. Lewandowski, Poland’s all-time record goalscorer and captain who scored 74 goals for Borussia Dortmund, had to retake his penalty after the France goalkeeper Mike Maignan jumped off his line prematurely to save his effort from 12 yards. Lewandowski kept his cool to r

<p>Should Austria be taken seriously as European Championship-winning material? They emerged from one of the group stage’s most entertaining games with three points and, firmly against the odds, top spot in a fiendish Group D. They were handed a head start by Donyell Malen’s own goal but perhaps the most impressive aspect of another high-octane performance was the way Ralf Rangnick’s team just kept coming.</p><p>They were pegged back by Cody Gakpo and then, after Romano Schmid’s response, again by Memphis Delay. But Marcel Sabitzer’s winner, which could change the shape of this competition, means they will probably face Turkey or Czech Republic in Leipzig on Saturday. For the third-placed Netherlands, creative but wide open in defence, a meeting with England is not out of the question.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/25/netherlands-austria-euro-2024-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Veteran midfielder Taras Stepanenko knows his team carry a responsibility beyond the pitch as they face Belgium</p><p>Taras Stepanenko used to be the great hope of Ukrainian football. Perhaps he lacked a little pace, but he read the game superbly and was a fine passer of the ball. Most of all, he had an assurance, an aura of quality that made him stand out. When he joined Shakhtar Donetsk from ­Metalurh Zaporizhzhya shortly before his 21st birthday, the route to a major ­western European club seemed clear. ­Fourteen years later, a lot has happened, but he is still there.</p><p>He has won 11 Ukrainian league titles and eight cups, but he has only ever played 262 minutes in the knockout stage of the Champions League. There used to be a sense of Stepanenko as an unfulfilled ­talent, but loyalty has an additional value in Ukraine these days. It may be his achievements with Ukraine at this Euros have a significance that ­reverberate far beyond anything he has achieved at club level.</p>

As though the Tories and Labour are terrified of the voters and have gone into hiding. Coming out only to do the barest of bare minimums.

Shellfish comes from a local, Mary, who coordinates a few small boats, all of which use traditional creel methods, and hand-dive for scallops, while oysters are bought from Judith at Caledonian Oysters on Loch Creran. Pam’s innovative food is served with a view of the loch outside – in summer, diners may even spot the mackerel for the next day’s menu being caught by a neighbour.<br /><em>Strathlachlan PA27 8BU; <a href="https://inv

<p>On a journey along the Thames – where fury at pollution has spawned a wave of local activism – it is clear that the decline of rivers is among this government’s worst legacies</p><p>Red kites swoop above Fawley Meadows as Dave Wallace dips a sampling beaker into the deep green water of the River Thames on a late spring day. A sharp wind blows droplets upstream towards the arches of Henley Bridge, while the might of the river, its path here straight and wide, pulls downstream towards Windsor, on its 215-mile odyssey to the North Sea.</p><p>Today, the water meadows along its banks host blue and white striped marquees, lined up in uniform rows for the Henley regatta. After the rowers depart, the river bears the swimmers who follow. They dip, jump and dive its depths at an annual festival of open water races, echoing the galas that took place in Victorian days.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2024/jun/25/how-tory-neglect-flooded-britains-rivers-with-sew

<p>Rishi Sunak was meant to clean up the Tory party. Instead he will leave it morally and ideologically exhausted</p><p>In the dying days of Donald Trump’s presidency, the log fire in his chief of staff’s office was lit daily.</p><p>The outgoing team were frantically burning documents, or so the White House aide <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/25/trump-mark-meadows-cassidy-hutchison-book">Cassidy Hutchinson writes in her memoir</a>, to the point that her own boss’s wife reportedly complained that his suits smelled of smoke. Many alarming things happened in those final days, but the fall-of-Rome atmosphere is somehow captured in that whiff of bonfire. The paranoia; the panic; the queasy feeling of something very wrong at the heart of public life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/25/betting-scandal-tawdry-tory-government-partygate-sleaze-rishi-sunak">Continue reading...</a>
