Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire joins the giant monsters on the same team to fight against alternate versions of themselves. And although the fight and the movie itself may look cool, it's feels pretty plastic. It doesn't make you think or feel or anything. Just like movies like Red Notice and the new Ghostbusters. The era of consumerism has decreased the wonderment value of even giant monsters like Kong and Godzilla. So today, let's try to see why that is and how it can be improved.
