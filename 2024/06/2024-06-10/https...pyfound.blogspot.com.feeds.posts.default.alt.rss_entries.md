<p>This year’s Board Election Nomination period opens tomorrow and closes on June 25th. Who runs for the board? People who care about the Python community, who want to see it flourish and grow, and also have a few hours a month to attend regular meetings, serve on committees, participate in conversations, and promote the Python community.
