In today's Daily Fix:
The latest Dragon Age got a new trailer—and a new title—but fans still had questions as to how customizable their characters can be. According to developer BioWare's Michael Gamble, you'll be able to play as an Elf, Dwarf, or Qunari (and of course a human). In other news, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's single-player character will need a constant internet connection. Activision explains that this is to help stream the game's high-quality textures, instead of installing them to your hard drive (this is done to preserve storage space). You will also not need a premium subscription service like Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, just a high-speed internet connection. And finally, Obsidian accidentally revealed the release date for their highly-anticipated RPG, Avowed, then deleted the webpage (but not before we managed to screen capture it!).
