<p>Although C++ is an old programming language, its Standard Library misses a few basic things. Features that Java or .NET had for years were/are not available in STL. With C++17 thereâ€™s a nice improvement: for example, we now have the standard filesystem!</p>
<p>Traversing a path, even recursively, is so simple now!</p>
