ID Software's Marty Stratton and Hugo Martin join us to share more details on the upcoming DOOM: The Dark Ages, which was revealed as part of the 2024 Xbox Games Showcase.

DOOM: The Dark Ages wants to fill your screen with more than three times the enemies, and massively opens up the world to exploration, all while letting you ride giant dragons and pilot enormous mechs.

Featuring classic weapons like the Super Shotgun, and introducing new ones like the Skullcrusher, DOOM: The Dark Ages' combat is much more grounded and tankier than other DOOM games, and not just because the Doomslayer is wielding a brutal chainsaw shield.

During Sumer Game Fest 2024, we got to play the first 40 minutes of the upcoming post-apocalyptic survival FPS, S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2: Heart of Chornobyl. 

S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 impressed us with its sense of scale, intricate details, gameplay mechanics and the overall vibe of Chornobyl's harsh and irradiated world. However the brutal difficulty for which the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games are known made our short journey exploring The Zone a perilous one. 

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl releases on Xbox Series X|S and PC on September 5, 2024.
