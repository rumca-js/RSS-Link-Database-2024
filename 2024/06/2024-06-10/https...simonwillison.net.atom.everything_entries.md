<p>Today's WWDC keynote finally revealed Apple's new set of AI features. The AI section (Apple are calling it Apple Intelligence) started over an hour into the keynote - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RXeOiIDNNek?t=3870s">this link</a> jumps straight to that point in the archived YouTube livestream, or you can watch it embedded here:</p>

 

<p>There's also a detailed Apple newsroom post: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Introducing Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that puts powerful generative models at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac</a>.</p>

<p>There are a lot of interesting things here. Apple have a strong focus on privacy, finally taking advantage of the Neural Engine accelerator chips in the A17 Pro chip on iPhone 15 Pro and higher and the M1/M2/M3 Apple Silicon chips in Macs. They're using these to run on-device models - I've not yet seen any information on which models they ar

<p><a href="https://github.com/fixie-ai/ultravox">Ultravox</a></p>
Ultravox is "a multimodal Speech LLM built around a pretrained Whisper and Llama 3 backbone". It's effectively an openly licensed version of half of the GPT-4o model <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">OpenAI demoed</a> (but did not fully release) a few weeks ago: Ultravox is multimodal for audio input, but still relies on a separate text-to-speech engine for audio output.</p>
<p>You can try it out directly in your browser through <a href="https://www.ai.town/characters/a90fcca3-53c0-4111-b30a-4984883a23ef">this page on AI.TOWN</a> - hit the "Call" button to start an in-browser voice conversation with the model.</p>
<p>I found the demo extremely impressive - really low latency and it was fun and engaging to talk to. Try saying "pretend to be a wise and sarcastic old fox" to kick it into a different personality.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/fixie-ai/ultravox">GitHub repo</a> includes code for both
