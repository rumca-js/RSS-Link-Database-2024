<p>Based on what we’ve been told, these enhancements will really help any enterprise professional, knowledge worker, or frankly anybody who uses Mail. </p>



<p>I ask you, who doesn’t struggle with over-full email boxes and important responses we don’t make because “life” gets in the way? It is also interesting that those improvements mean Apple devices will now offer the tools we

<p>It looks like artificial intelligence (AI) will be the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2139629/wwdc-and-apple-intelligence-what-to-expect.html">heart of Apple’s announcements at WWDC this week</a>. Now, we think we also know what devices will be needed to support the new — beta —  features if you’re a developer given the right to install the new operating systems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is expected</strong></h2>



<p>Apple is preparing to shake a little of its reality distortion dust. That magic powder will be used to show how the company has already placed AI inside its devices, and to show how with the addition of generative AI (its own and from partne

<p>Microsoft will make its Windows Recall feature opt-in by default after criticism by security and privacy experts. </p>



<p>With Recall, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2117741/windows-recall-lets-you-rewind-actions-on-a-pc.html">currently in preview</a>, Microsoft wants to let Copilot+ PC users find and retrieve information across any app they’ve accessed. It does so by taking screenshots every few seconds, creating a searchable timeline of everything a user has interacted with on their computer. </p>



<p>Microsoft Executive Vice President Yusuf Mehdi likened Recall to “photographic memory,” when the feature was unveiled in May.   </p>

<p>Trust. It’s the critical word when talking about artificial intelligence in just about all of its forms. Do end-users or executives trust what generative AI (genAI) says? Presumably they do or they would never bother using it. </p>



<p>But is AI indeed trustworthy? (I’ll give you the Cliff Notes version now: No, it’s not.)</p>



<p>But before we even need to consider how trustworthy genAI results are, let’s start with how trustworthy the executives running the companies that create AI algorithms are. This is a serious issue because if enterprise IT executives can’t trust the people who make AI products, how can they trust the products? How can you trust what AI tells your people, trust what i

## Why Nvidia’s $3 trillion valuation might be too low

<p>Nvidia last week became the third company ever to exceed a $3 trillion market capitalization. The company’s valuation increased by a trillion dollars in just the last three months. </p>



<p>As the top chipmaker fueling the generative AI (genAI) boom, Nvidia’s over-the-top success feels like a fluke, a blip — a surge based on a bubble.</p>



<p>But I think that’s wrong. In fact, I think the company might be wildly undervalued.</p>



<p>Let’s compare. At the time I wrote this, Apple’s market capitalization was around $3.003 trillion and Nvidia’s was even higher: $3.012 trillion. </p>



<p>The valuation of a company is based on its share price, which itself is based in large measure on the per
