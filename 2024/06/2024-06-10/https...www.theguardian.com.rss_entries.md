So it was perhaps no great surprise that he reverted to the oldest sporting ­cliche in the book by declaring himself “over the moon” after winning his first major medal, a 400m silver, at these European championships.</p><p>But the fourth night of these championships was not the golden double act for which the British team had hoped. Dobson had been a warm favourite to win gold but found ­Belgium’s Alexander Doom too good – while the world indoor champion Molly Caudery could manage only a bronze medal. Still, that is the unpredictability of sport. And both of these 24-year-olds will have bigger and brighter days ahead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/10/charlie-dobson-claims-400m-silver-as-molly-c

<p>Evil mummies, evil cities, evil scrolls … this programme has got them all. Just don’t expect much actual history</p><p>History buffs, be warned: Cursed Histories is heavy on the curses but light on the history, and if I didn’t know better, I would suspect that at least one of the historians offering their expertise here is struggling to keep a straight face.</p><p>The programme purportedly sets out to examine whether curses are real or not by looking at historical events that have been linked to supernatural harm. But it doesn’t try very hard to be neutral. It kicks off with a voiceover explaining that a stone age mummy “unleashes a spell of death for those who dare to get too close”, which makes it pretty clear which horse it has chosen to back: one called Sticking Two Fingers Up At Perfectly Rational Explanations For Loosely Connected Events. Odds are at least 25-to-one that you’ll get a sensible story here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jun/1

<p>Sarah Snook and Kodi Smit-McPhee lend their voice talents to Adam Elliott’s ambitious animation that has a strong personal touch</p><p>Like Britain’s Nick Park at Aardman, Australian stop-motion film-maker Adam Elliott has shown a natural talent for screenwriting comedy – and for fusing that with the simplicity and directness of his animation style itself, creating a distinctive kind of lovability and pathos and importantly an instinct for the underdog and the outsider. He makes mainstream animation look a bit neurotypical. His 2003 short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZnKNm9HelA&amp;ab_channel=MadmanFilms">Harvie Krumpet</a> was an Oscar winner, and Elliot has come to the Annecy animation film festival for the premiere of what’s probably his most ambitious feature-length work yet. It is charming and beguiling, with a strong new personal and even autobiographical strain and, as in the past, he has persuaded A-list voice talent to get involved.</p><p>Sarah Snook voices Gr

<p>Based on the experiences of the Smallbone family who travelled to Tennesse in the 90s, this is so sugary it should come with a warning for diabetics</p><p>Given the current attitudes in what is now largely Republican Tennessee where this film is set, it’s somewhat surprising to see such a sympathetic depiction of the travails of a family of economic migrants from the southern hemisphere who come to America seeking their fortune. Gullibly believing that the offer of a job is real and facing economic hardship in his homeland, the somewhat deluded father hauls his wife and six children (seven if you count the one the wife is carrying), across the border where they only just escape scrutiny from suspicious border guards. When the promised job falls through, the parents are compelled to put the underage children to menial yard work and cleaning jobs so that they have enough to pay for basics such as food, beds and – eventually – petrol for a car given to them by a member of their church

  and she enrolled at a photography school in Haifa. Working as a photographer for El-Hakawati theater in Jerusalem was her first step towards acting professionally. “Build a career is not even really the right term,” she says. “What it meant was just to exist, to be what you want to be, without having to give answers at every second of the day to hundreds and hundreds of people.”</p><p>Today, Abbass is arguably the world’s most celebrated Palestinian actor.

Sohee (Kim Si-Eun) is a free-spirited high schooler with a fiercely independent streak and a love of dance. At school, her teacher pulls her aside and shares the good news: he’s found her an internship at a call centre. But the signs that she will hate the job are there on day one: during training, managers advise staff – all young, all female, all considered expendable – what lipstick to wear.</p><p>The film was inspired by a news story about a student who killed themselves while on a work placement, and one can sense Jung (who also wrote the script) has an interest in identifying institutions that fail young people in the real world.

<p><strong>Grange festival, Hampshire<br /></strong>Director Walter Sutcliffe’s modern-day production of Monteverdi’s take on Emperor Nero scores some hits but as many misses. Musically, though, it is outstanding<strong><br /></strong></p><p>A surfeit of sex, skulduggery and self-interest makes Monteverdi’s L’Incoronazione di Poppea the most deliciously amoral of operas. Laced with acid wit, it also happens to be very funny, a fact not always realised by director Walter Sutcliffe in this serviceable modern-dress production for the Grange festival.</p><p>Emperor Nero’s machinations to replace his obdurate wife, Octavia, with the coolly calculating Poppea are highly entertaining. Of course, there’s nothing new about politicians behaving badly, and Sutcliffe pulls off a couple of scenic updates brilliantly. Nero and Poppea have some of the most erotic language in all opera. Watching them sexting each other, their steamy words complete with mischievous emoticons projected overhead, is hil

But its modesty is deliberate, as the economist and <em>Observer</em> columnist Torsten Bell’s surprisingly hopeful new guide to halting this country’s crumbling decline explains.

BT had informed us that the contract was about to finish, and asked me to contact them about renewing. I duly called and was, at no time, advised to contact the panic button provider, or told of the possible need for adaptors to connect analogue phones to the new service. After four hours on the phone to BT when the service failed, I was informed that digital adaptors were required to ensure our phones worked. Four days later, these had still not arrived and BT said it was unable to expedite the delivery.
