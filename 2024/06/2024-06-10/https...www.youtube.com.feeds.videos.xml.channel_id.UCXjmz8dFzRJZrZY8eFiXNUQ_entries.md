For all the wild and outlandish things we have seen on Amazon's The Boys, one person has made us believe in more than what we see on screen, Hughie.  Superheroes are supposed to give us hope, they open our minds to the possibilities of what we could accomplish if we were given superpowers.   But what if those heroes started to use those powers for evil? Though its story is told through several superhuman perspectives, The Boys is perhaps most powerful when seen through the eyes of someone just like us.  If it weren't for Hughie, The Boys may not have made it very far into their vengeful mission, and the audience wouldn't be along for the ride.
