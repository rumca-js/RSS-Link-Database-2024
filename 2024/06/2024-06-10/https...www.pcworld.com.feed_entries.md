Adam has his literal hands all over them on the Computex show floor.</p>

They&rsquo;re either augmenting existing designs (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2302123/what-is-an-ai-pc-we-cut-through-the-hype.html">like &ldquo;AI PCs&rdquo;</a>) or they&rsquo;ve flopped hard.</p>



<p>Take the Rabbit R1, which was such an instant failure that it made its way into mainstream news. But one modder is determined to make the thing useful&mdash;with a bit of old-fashioned Android ROM power.</p>
