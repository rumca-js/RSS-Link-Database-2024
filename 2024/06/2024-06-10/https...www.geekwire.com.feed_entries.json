The company\u2019s Natrium reactor could become the first sodium-cooled, power-generating reactor in the U.S. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is backing the project and spoke at the groundbreaking, as did TerraPower CEO and President Chris Levesque, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordeon and PacifiCorp CEO Cindy Crane. On his blog, Gates called the start of construction &#8220;a huge milestone for the local economy, America\u2019s energy independence, and the fight against climate change.&#8221; TerraPower is erecting what&#8217;s known as a small modular nuclear&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/nuclear-power-company-backed-by-bill-gates-breaks-ground-in-wyoming-on-first-fac", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/nuclear-power-company-backed-by-bill-gates-breaks-ground-in-wyoming-on-first-facility", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Nuclear power company backed by Bill Gates breaks ground in Wyoming on first facility", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-10T20:38:57+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"1035\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JoelReady030-1260x1035.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Seattle chef Joel Gamoran is raising more money to fuel his passions in the kitchen, including his dream of creating a product around &#8220;culinary medicine&#8221; to help people stay healthy through his cooking classes.

But the city is still rich in tech talent and considered a &#8220;top-tier hub for innovation.&#8221; The report measures factors including performance, funding, talent and experience, market reach, and knowledge in an analysis of 4.5 million startups across 300 ecosystems and 55 countries. Silicon Valley is still No. 1, followed by London and New York which tied for second. Seattle&#8217;s fall was the largest among the top 40 ecosystems.

Yet options there are often limited: leave a message that&#8217;s flagged for your provider for a later response, or call 911 for emergencies. But what about gray areas where you need help soon, but don&#8217;t require an aid car and flashing lights?
