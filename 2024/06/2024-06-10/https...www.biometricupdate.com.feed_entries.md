		Significant time at <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202406/wallet-to-wallet-coverage-digital-identity-opportunity-arrives-with-eidas-2-0">EIC 2024</a> has been devoted to cracking open the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202406/digital-identity-industry-needs-to-communicate-better-with-relying-parties">language of digital identity</a>, and decentralized identity (DID) is central to many of those discussions. In several panels, experts explore the dueling narratives underlying decentralized ID, as well as the opportunities it presents for government, financial services and border control.

		In a session about interoperability of identity data and systems at this year’s <a href="https://id4africa.com/">ID4Africa</a> conference, Dr. Victor Amadi, a research fellow at the Center for Comparative Law in Africa within the University of Cape Town, South Africa, pins Africa’s challenges with infrastructure, unreliable electricity and high energy costs as a key factor that can hinder the deployment and maintenance of digital systems.

Amadi, who has been studying cross-border issues and migration, said at <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/id4africa-2024">ID4Africa 2024</a> that integrating new digital identity systems with existing frameworks at the regional level presents another layer of complexity. For instance, within the Economic Community of West African State

		Chinese CCTV firm Hikvision could soon be banned from selling its products as former conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has urged the UK government to impose a comprehensive trading ban, following an increase in the company's UK sales last year.

Recent financial filings revealed that Hikvision’s direct sales to UK and Irish customers increased to £32.6 million (roughly $41.4 million) in 2023, up from £14.8 million (around $18.8 million) the previous year, <a href="https://www.cityam.com/boom-in-hikvision-uk-sales-sparks-calls-for-full-ban-on-chinese-cctv-giant/">CityA.M. reports</a>.

		A real-time facial recognition system used by German police to track criminals has reportedly been deployed without the knowledge of the local data protection agency and could be against the country’s constitution.

The police in the German state of Saxony have been using a surveillance system called Personal Identification System (PerIS), created by <a href="https://www.optoprecision.de/">Opto Precision</a>. The system was first introduced as a pilot project in 2019 to combat serious cross-border crime. Details of the system, however, have been kept under wraps until March when a parliamentary inquiry <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202405/police-in-germany-using-live-facial-recognition">uncovered</a> its deployment.

		Members of some women groups in border communities between Senegal and Guinea Bissau (the sene-Gambia zone) have received biometric national ID cards as part of a socio-economic empowerment drive.

The women received the ECOWAS Biometric National Identity Card (ENBIC) in a move that is fronted by the ECOWAS Commission and supported by the German Agency for International Cooperation (<a href="https://www.giz.de/">GIZ</a>).

According to a news release, the exercise which is in its pilot phase, seeks to facilitate movement and business transactions among women and other vulnerable persons in that border zone.
