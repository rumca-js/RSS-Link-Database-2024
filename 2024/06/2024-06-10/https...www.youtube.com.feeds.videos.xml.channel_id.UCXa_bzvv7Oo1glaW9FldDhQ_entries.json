The movement is really smooth, providing instantaneous spinning and precise aiming. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re a prequel or original trilogy fan, you\u2019re in luck because the games provide lots of references and gimmicks from those Star Wars eras. There are bright store banners across every menu in Star Wars: Hunters, and the push to buy exclusive items is overkill. \n\nDespite the live-service monetization, the game\u2019s progression is entirely accessible without paying anything. Characters are unlocked in a linear and drip-fed manner, but it doesn\u2019t take too long to unlock them if you\u2019re winning matches. The core gunplay, personality of the characters, and wonderful aesthetic provide an experience worth checking out as long as you can ignore the live- service stuff.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCUqixMdMPE", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/pCUqixMdMPE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Star Wars Hunters Review - The Final Verdict", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-06-10T13:30:28+00:00", "description": "With Gears 5 now five years old, demand for a new instalment in Microsoft\u2019s beloved third-person shooter franchise has been growing ever louder, and going into the Xbox Games Showcase, leaks had claimed that a new entry would indeed be unveiled. \n\nAnd sure enough, it was- though not quite the way many would have expected.
