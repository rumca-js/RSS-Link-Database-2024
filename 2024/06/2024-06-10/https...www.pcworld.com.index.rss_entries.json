But it certainly isn&rsquo;t without risks. Not only are there security risks involved in downloading files from unknown sources, but there is a privacy risk as well. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s imperative that you use a VPN while doing any torrenting or P2P file sharing. A VPN can help keep you safe by keeping your connection private and encrypting your data so that unwanted prying eyes&mdash;cybercriminals, overbearing ISPs, or nosy government watchdogs&mdash;can&rsquo;t keep tabs on your activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many VPNs on the market nowadays that finding a trustworthy service can seem like a herculean task.
