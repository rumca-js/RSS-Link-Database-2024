Star Wars: Hunters is a surprisingly fun hero shooter wrapped around a somewhat aggressive live-service model. The movement is really smooth, providing instantaneous spinning and precise aiming. 

And if you’re a prequel or original trilogy fan, you’re in luck because the games provide lots of references and gimmicks from those Star Wars eras. There are bright store banners across every menu in Star Wars: Hunters, and the push to buy exclusive items is overkill. 

Despite the live-service monetization, the game’s progression is entirely accessible without paying anything. Characters are unlocked in a linear and drip-fed manner, but it doesn’t take too long to unlock them if you’re winning matches. The core gunplay, personality of the characters, and wonderful aesthetic provide an experience worth checking out as long as you can ignore the live- service stuff.

With Gears 5 now five years old, demand for a new instalment in Microsoft’s beloved third-person shooter franchise has been growing ever louder, and going into the Xbox Games Showcase, leaks had claimed that a new entry would indeed be unveiled. 

And sure enough, it was- though not quite the way many would have expected. Rather than announcing Gears 6, at the recent Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft and The Coalition unveiled Gears of War: E-Day, the next mainline instalment in the series that, surprisingly enough, is a prequel to the original trilogy, set fourteen years before the events of the first game. 

With that, with Marcus and Dom returning, with the vibes looking very much horror- adjacent, and with the Locust looking scary again, there’s every reason for series fans to be excited.
