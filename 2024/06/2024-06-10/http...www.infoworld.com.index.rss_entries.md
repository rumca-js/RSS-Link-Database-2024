<p>The term “inflection point” is overused, but it certainly applies to the current state of artificial intelligence. Technology providers—and the companies that depend on them—can choose one of two roads to AI development: proprietary or open source. This dichotomy has existed for decades, with both sides achieving great levels of success. However, I would argue that the stakes for AI are higher than we’ve ever seen, and that the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3429076/what-is-open-source-software-open-source-and-foss-explained.html">open source model</a> is critical for the productive, economically feasible, and safe productization and consumption of AI.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715459/kubernetes-shows-the-way-forward-for-ai.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

In other words, they’re building AI on sand.</p><p>To be successful, we need to move beyond the confusing hype and help enterprises make sense of AI. In other words, we need more trust (open models) and fewer moving parts (opinionated platforms that require guesswork to choose and apply models).</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3715358/we-need-a-red-hat-for-ai.html#jump">To
