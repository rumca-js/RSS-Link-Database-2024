<p>For years, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-apple-facebook-ces-privacy-panel.html">Apple has touted privacy as its major advantage</a> over rivals like Google and Microsoft. Instead of relying on cloud processing to improve or organize your images, which requires sending your photos to Google's servers, Apple handles  those tasks directly on your device. But with the advent of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-first-attempt-at-ai-is-apple-intelligence-181444846.html">Apple Intelligence</a>, the company's take on artificial intelligence, the company is stepping out of its comfort zone  with &quot;Private Cloud Compute.&quot; It says &quot;private&quot; right in the name, so it has to be secure, <em>right</em>?</p>
<p>While Apple AI will run some models locally, it will occasionally have to send data to Apple's servers for complex requests. So how is the company squaring this with its previous security stance?&nbsp;</p>

But shortly after the keynote ended, Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering said that the company might also bake in Gemini, Google’s family of large language model, into its operating systems.</p>
<p>“We want to enable users ultimately to choose the models they want, maybe Google Gemini in the future,” Federighi said in a conversation with reporters after the keynote. “Nothing to announce right now.”</p>

<p>On a day when there were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wwdc-2024-everything-apple-announced-today-including-ios-18-ai-with-apple-intelligence-and-more-184422477.html">a few other Apple-related announcements</a>, Capcom snuck in one of its own.

<p>The long-running Assassin’s Creed video game industrial complex has finally reached Japan – and I’ve been waiting. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is set in feudal Japan, in the late 16th century, to be precise, at a time of political upheaval that birthed the ninja. While I didn’t get to play <em>Shadows</em>, at Summer Game Fest 2024, Ubisoft offered a hands-off gameplay demo, revealing how the game will play with two different but equal protagonists.</p>
<p>If you missed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/assassins-creed-shadows-brings-stealthy-mayhem-to-feudal-japan-on-november-15-180139119.html">initial reveal</a>, <em>Shadows'</em> protagonists are Yasuke, a powerful outsider samurai who can strike the armor off enemies, and Naoe, an assassin/ninja with a killer “sickle on-chain” kusarigama and those traditional AC killing methods — she has a wrist blade.</p>

<p>Currently, Unicode 15.1 supports just shy of 3,800 various emoji. But for everyone out there that for some reason thinks that's not nearly enough, today at WWDC 2024, Apple announced the ability to use AI to generate unique emoji based on your prompts.</p>
<p>Called Genmoji, which looks to be an awful portmanteu of the words &quot;generate&quot; and &quot;emoji,&quot; these new creations are powered by Apple Intelligence, which is a new collection of AI features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac sometime later this year. Similar to creating images with services like Midjourney and Dall-E, users will be able to whip up custom emoji by inputting specific prompts. Once made, they can be shared with others as stickers, reactions in a Tapback or simply embedded in-line in messages.&nbsp;</p>

We're not really getting any more details yet, but it's confirmation that the project is still underway. It's just years away, still.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ubisoft Montreal, which worked on the initial Sands of Time. took over the project from Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai, scrubbing the launch date of January 2021 in the process. Back then, Ubisoft Montreal was apparently &quot;building upon the work achieved&quot; by its studios in India. Last year however, producer Jean-Francois Naud revealed that the project was still &quot;in conception&quot; — so what exactly did those Ubisoft studios <em>make</em>? It sounds like a mes

<p>As expected, Apple’s assistant is about to get much more helpful thanks to a load of new <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">AI-powered</a> capabilities. During WWDC, the company previewed a new version of Siri that can take actions on your behalf and understand a wide range of new queries.</p>
<p>The new version of Siri has a better understanding of the apps on your phone and will be able to take more than 100 actions based on your activity and device. For example, you could ask Siri to show you specific photos or memories in your Photos app or to find tracking details for an expected delivery from an email in the Mail app.</p>

<p>The rumors are true. Apple is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-will-reportedly-build-a-dedicated-passwords-app-for-the-iphone-and-mac-211812245.html"><ins>adding a dedicated passwords manager app</ins></a> to many of its operating systems. This includes macOS, iPadOS, visionOS and iOS. It’ll even work on Windows by accessing the Windows app via iCloud. That’s pretty neat. There are way too many passwords out there.</p>
<p>The first-party service is powered by iCloud Keychain and will compete with some heavy hitters in the space, like LastPass and 1Password. The simply-named Passwords app will be able to list various user logins and categorize them based on service type. For instance, banking passwords would be grouped differently than social media passwords. The app will also allow users to bypass manual password input by leveraging Face ID, Touch ID and autofill.</p>

<p><em>Empire of the Ants</em>, a real-time strategy game with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/this-gorgeous-looking-game-lets-you-control-a-colony-of-photorealistic-ants-191034408.html">dazzlingly photorealistic insects</a> and other critters, arrives on November 7. Although the game doesn’t sound like it’s exactly a remake, it comes from the same publisher (and draws from the same source material) as the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/empire_of_the_ants_2000">2000 RTS game</a> of the same name. The new version will be available on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Publisher Microids and developer Tower Five describe the new <em>Empire of the Ants</em> as “a 3D real-time strategy game with progressive difficulty.” Set in Fontainebleau forest, you’ll play as 103,683e, “a determined ant on a mission to protect its colony.” You’ll gather resources, secure outposts, fortify your armies and execute the queen’s plans.</p>
