<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think I've about given up with CRTs, they are great, but their time is drawing to a close, parts, repairs , cost etc.</p> <p>LCD TVs are plentiful on the used market, I'm after something that can handle most Amiga screen-modes (I know there's a load of whacky screen-modes out there, so I don't expect full coverage) with some decent de-interlacing, I'm not adverse to some flicker, decent motion adaptive support would be great. Any recommendations? Tips?</p> <p>For context, I already have a GBS-C, it has a lot of limitations unfortunately and it's lacking a lot of fine-control, it also does not support motion adaptive via VGA which is rather bizarre. The aim is to not spend mega-bucks on this, I'm also based in the UK (I'm aware of Retrotink, OSSC, Indivision etc).</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zaspath"> /u/Zaspath </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments
