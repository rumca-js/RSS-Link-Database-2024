<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi All,</p> <p>New member here, I have come into some hardware including an amiga 2000 and some commodore 1084s displays. Looking into feasibility of how someone might sell within Australia hopefully. I have a few questions:</p> <p>What is the best platform to sell and get these to the right collectors hands? EBay seems obvious but perhaps some forums or other websites?</p> <p>Has anyone had any issues with shipping heavy displays like that? Opt for the fragile option/signed for delivery and shipping with plenty of polystyrene and packaging the key?</p> <p>They all seem to turn on but I’d need to get hold of a video cable to test the output. I suspect this would help with selling but how far do I go? I don’t have a mouse or keyboard currently, only power cables.</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/peeling_veneer"> /u/peeling_veneer </a> <br /> <span><a href="htt
