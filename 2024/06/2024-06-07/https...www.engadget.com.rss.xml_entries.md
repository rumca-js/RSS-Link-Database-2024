<p><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em> is due to hit PC, Switch, PlayStation 5 and mobile devices on July 25.</p>
<p><em>Arranger</em> is an adventure game with a simple and disruptive conceit: The world exists on a grid of sliding tiles. Moving the main character, Jemma, slides the connected row or column of tiles with her, shifting the landscape as she travels. This mechanic turns walking into a puzzle and it forms the basis of the game’s spatial riddles.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Jemma is a misfit who’s venturing outside of her cozy home for the first time, discovering all of the amazing and terrifying things the wider world has to offer. The land is ruled by a strange, static force, and Jemma’s mission is to make the place loosen up (quite literally, it would seem).</p>

<p>And now for a game that’s actually 50 games — at least.</p>
<p><em>UFO 50</em>, the latest project from <em>Spelunky </em>studio Mossmouth, is due to hit Steam on September 18, about six years after it was originally expected to launch. That’s merely an observation, not a criticism — <em>UFO 50</em> is an ambitious project that offers 50 full, retro-styled games in a single package, and it’s all coming from a team of just six people.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In <em>UFO 50</em> lore, UFO Soft was a game developer who was active between 1982 and 1990, peak NES and Genesis years. The games collected in <em>UFO 50</em> feature recurring characters and sequels from UFO Soft’s fictional past, and they’re restricted in terms of color and audio, as if they had actually been developed for bygone hardware. Mossmouth is manifesting an alternate timeline of video game history here, and it looks like a ton of fun.</p>

<p>The next title out of Capybara Games — the studio behind <em>Super Time Force</em>, <em>Below</em> and <em>Grindstone </em>— is a competitive, online puzzler with real-time strategy and color-matching mechanics, live updates and a seasonal narrative shaped by players. It’s called <em>Battle Vision Network</em>, and it’s heading to PC and mobile devices in 2025.</p>
<p><em>Battle Vision Network</em> feels like an encapsulation of Capy’s sensibilities over 20 years as an independent game studio. It’s adorable in a Saturday-morning-cartoon kind of way, kind of like <em>OK K.O.! Let's Play Heroes</em>. It relies on color-matching tactics, much like <em>Grindstone</em>. It has music from longtime Capy collaborator Jim Guthrie (<em>Sword &amp; Sworcery</em>, <em>Below</em>) and <em>Grindstone</em> composer Sam Webster. And finally, it’s a one-on-one puzzle fight, similar to <em>Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes</em>. In the announcement video for <em>BVN</em>, director Dan Vader describ

<p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, the stunning action and strategy RPG from Capcom, is set to come out on July 19 for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PS5 and PC. It'll be a day-one Xbox Game Pass title.</p>
<p>We've had our eyes on <em>Path of the Goddess</em> for a while now. Even just in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/capcoms-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-is-an-action-game-with-traditional-japanese-aesthetics-054801136.html">early trailers</a>, it seems to offer a beautiful exploration of Japanese folklore, featuring lush settings packed with reactive details and dangerous creatures to battle. In <em>Path of the Goddess</em>, the land is fighting back against the people who have defiled it, spreading blight and spawning monsters called the Seethe. Players have to recruit villagers to their side during the day, and at night, they fight the Seethe, st

<p><em>Simpler Times</em>, the game that’s sweet like honey on a summer’s day, is out right now. <em>Simpler Times </em>is a soft and slow exploration game set in a supremely cozy bedroom, featuring a lifetime of memories to uncover and a soundtrack of soothing lo-fi music. <em>Simpler Times </em>is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812210/Simpler_Times/">on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>The game takes place over four seasons, as the protagonist, Tania, clears out her childhood bedroom and looks back on her life. Her room is compact, with a wide bay window, a desk, a bed and a record player, which controls the game’s soundtrack. Players have to physically swap out the vinyl to keep the lo-fi beats going: remove the record, select a new one, slide the arm back and forth, drop the needle down. The process is meditative and rewarding, just like the rest of the game.</p>

<p>There are some caveats. You have to <a href="http://beta.playvalorant.com">sign up for the beta right here</a> and it will initially only be available in the US, Canada, Europe, the UK and Japan, with more regions to follow. Riot has also stated that there will be no crossplay between PC and console players, so as “to maintain <em>Valorant’s</em> renowned standard for competitive integrity.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/slitterhead-keiichiro-toyama-annoucement-023238163.html"><em>Slitterhead</em></a>, the new, twisted title from Silent Hill series director Keiichiro Toyama, is due to hit PC and consoles on November 8. A new trailer debuted today during the Summer Game Fest kickoff event, showcasing slightly more information (and blood) than the original teaser we saw in December 2021.</p>
<p><em>Slitterhead </em>is a third-person action and horror experience with possession mechanics and a cast of giant, bug-like enemies to hack and slash. There seem to be hints of a detective storyline here, but most of the new trailer is concerned with punching, kicking, slicing, clawing and shooting a bunch of hulking monsters on dense city streets. It looks strange, spooky and incredibly satisfying.</p>

It’s a rock-climbing simulator set on the face of a lethally steep mountain, starring an alpinist who’s determined to be the first person to reach its summit. Players can climb literally everywhere in <em>Cairn</em>, and the challenge lies in maintaining balance and stamina moment-to-moment. If you don’t, the climber falls and dangles on their tether, expelling a scream of frustration. It’s kind of like <em>GIRP</em>, but incredibly elegant and super hardcore.</p>

<p><em>Civilization VII</em>  was officially revealed (well, teased) at the Summer Game Fest live showcase, although we didn't learn much more about what direction the series is going. The legend that is Sid Meier briefly appeared at the end of the trailer, adding that a full reveal, gameplay and all, will happen sometime in August. It's coming to Steam, PlayStation, Xbox and, apparently, <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/seven/">the Switch</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Qualcomm’s new commercial that revives Justin Long as a frustrated Mac user who decides to spend hundreds of dollars on a new computer rather than manage his notifications <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/06/now_qualcomm_went_long">is objectively terrible</a>. (The mocking has been so brutal that Qualcomm deleted the commercial from its YouTube channel!) But, it does raise one fair point: notifications, regardless of what OS or device you’re using, are a complete mess. The tools you’ll find on your computer or phone for managing them are overly complicated and hard to explain to someone who isn’t intimately familiar with the settings menu. I’ve been covering and using iOS for years, so for some stupid reason I do understand how Apple’s various notification options work, but wish me luck if I have to explain it to someone else.</p>

<p>A year since Apple unveiled the Vision Pro, and about four months since its muted launch, the spatial computing headset still feels surprisingly undercooked. Simple features, like the ability to organize icons in the visionOS home screen, are nowhere to be found. Content that truly shows off the Vision Pro's immersive capabilities is still rare (the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvels-what-if-for-apple-vision-pro-looks-incredible-but-plays-terribly-143028639.html"><ins>recent Marvel experience</ins></a> was just a glimpse of what's possible).</p>

<p>Apple has been holding its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) for over 30 years and frankly — other than no one calling them out for abbreviating it with two Ws in that span of time — I don't have strong feelings about them. Launch a new thing. Shovel AI bloatware into whatever. It's big tech's world and I'm just as trapped in it as anyone else. Imagine thinking iterative updates to a goddamn computer are a core part of your identity. Couldn't be me!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just a few days before Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference (WWDC 2024) kicks off, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/apple-wwdc-2024-what-to-expect-ai-ipados-18-macos-15-siri-updates-more?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg's Mark Gurman </em></a>has delivered his final round of party-spoiling details. The biggest takeaway: Apple will call its long-rumored artificial intelligence play &quot;Apple Intelligence.&quot; (Leave it up to Apple to find some way to redefine the term &quot;AI.&quot;) Don't expect the company to lean into generative AI features as much as competitors. According to Gurman, Apple's AI capabilities will focus on features with &quot;broad appeal&quot; — something I read as being more practical than creating psychedelic images on demand.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence will be powered by a combination of the company's technology, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-has-reportedly-resumed-talks-with-openai-to-build-a-chatbot-for-the-iphone-002

<p>The classic movie <em>12 Angry Men</em> is titled as such because, well, it's about a jury comprised of 12 men. But viewers have noticed recently that the image Amazon uses for the movie has more than 12 characters in it. Further, their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/1cbyggg/i_was_on_prime_the_other_day_and_saw_12_angry_men/">melting, inhuman faces</a> look like they could be somebody's sleep paralysis monsters. The terrifying quality to the characters' faces is just one of the elements indicating the use of AI to generate the image. Their deformed and claw-like hands are another, along with the other obvious AI artifacts in the photo.&nbsp;</p>
