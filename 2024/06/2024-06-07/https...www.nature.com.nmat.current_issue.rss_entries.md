<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 07 June 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01911-2">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01911-2</a></p>MXenes with borate polyanion terminations are synthesized using a flux-assisted eutectic molten etching approach. These triatomic-layer terminations empower MXenes with considerably improved charge transport and charge storage capabilities.
