		<a href="https://www.easydynamics.com/">Easy Dynamics</a> and <a href="https://beruku.com/">Beruku</a> Identity have joined forces in a strategic partnership aimed at improving identity verification processes for foreigners interacting with the U.S. government.

According to both companies, the collaboration comes in response to the challenges faced by federal agencies in providing services to individuals without U.S.-issued ID documents, which often leads to hindered collaboration, reduced customer experience, and increased identity fraud risks.

With a focus on adapting to the evolving digital landscape and meeting changing customer expectations, the partnership aims to provide federal agencies with the necessary expertise and tools to address these challen

		Online age checks are threatening Americans’ constitutional rights, according to a free speech advocacy group and a team of academics.

Their position is being put to the test in courts of law and public opinion. A group of researchers from Princeton University, UNC Chapel Hill and Duke University, in particular, have received criticism for their dismissal of the availability of effective and privacy-preserving age assurance methods.

The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) is <a href="https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/hz-v-hass-amended-complaint">suing the state</a> of Utah in federal court to have its second attempt at regulating age restrictions for social media tossed.

		“Data and AI are fantastic tools for the aviation sector.m Julie Pozzi, the head of data science and AI at Air France-KLM, told <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240603-airlines-eye-new-frontier-of-ai-ahead-of-global-summit">France24</a>, ahead of the 80th annual general meeting of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) this week in Dubai.

There are many examples of AI being deployed to improve airport experiences. Groupe ADP, an airport operator, is deploying voice biometrics from <a href="https://www.allobrain.com/">AlloBrain</a> to handle incoming airport calls. Alban Negret, the head of ADP's innovation division, reports a reduction in unanswered calls from 50 percent to 10 percent.

		A German regulator has endorsed biometric facial age estimation from IDVerse for restricting minors’ online access. The company says this is particularly important for the internet gambling industry, and the announcement coincides with a move to require age verification for online gambling in Argentina’s Mendoza Province.

Casinos have traditionally relied on physical security measures to control access to restricted areas. However, due to the large sums of money involved, they are now exploring biometric technology as a way to prevent theft and fraud.

The potential impact of biometrics on online gambling is particularly noteworthy. Since the United States Supreme Court's 2018 decision allowing states to regulate online gambling individually, there has bee

		The market for biometric identification technology has grown rapidly in the past several years with buyers increasingly forced to choose among a plethora of different options.

To pick the right vendor, biometric technology buyers now have to be aware of the latest regulatory moves but also hot-button issues such as bias, especially in facial recognition which can misidentify members of minority groups. Risks are present whether the buyer is a bank verifying customers, a private company using biometric tech to give office access to employees, or a law enforcement agency looking to speed up suspect identification.

According to surveys on consumer opinions conducted by the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/fido-alliance">FIDO Alliance</a>, more than half

		<em>By David J. Oberly, Biometric Privacy &amp; Data Privacy Attorney</em>

On May 31, 2024, Colorado Governor Jared Polis signed into law <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=HB+1130">HB 1130</a>, an amendment to the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) that directly regulates the use of biometric technologies in the Centennial State, while also adding an entirely new layer of complexity to the already fragmented patchwork of laws and regulations governing biometrics in the U.S.

HB 1130 is a noteworthy development in the biometrics space. First, it not only sets forth a number of traditional compliance obligations similar to the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), but also additional, unique requirements and restrictions that

		Machine learning has paved the way for voice and facial recognition but researchers are still struggling to quantify the elusive and sometimes vague sense of smell.

Machine olfaction, the automated simulation of the sense of smell, is an emerging field that uses robots or other automated systems to analyze air-borne molecules. Just like with sight and sound, machine learning is the key to digitizing smells because machines can learn to map molecular structures that create odors and translate them into a textual description, according to Ambuj Tewari, machine learning expert and Professor of Statistics at the University of Michigan.

“The machine learning model learns the words humans tend to use – for example, “sweet” and “dessert” – to describe what they exper
