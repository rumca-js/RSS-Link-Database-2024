<p>There were no knock-out blows, but some refreshing arguments that don’t get aired when the two heavyweights dominate the ring</p><p>It is called a general election, but Friday night’s multiparty debate was a reminder that it is also a messy array of specific elections.</p><p>Over on one side of the stage, Penny Mordaunt and Angela Rayner traded blows in the prize fight between incumbent power and the only challenger that can supply a replacement government. First on defence, then on tax and the cost of living, the Tory leader of the house piled into the deputy Labour leader in full Westminster pugilism mode.

That was no easy feat, for wildflower seasons are unpredictable. When he trekked to find the spectacular alpine gardens of Washington state in the spring, he found them covered by 10 feet of snow. His journeys took him from the Mojave desert of California to the “painted deserts” of Namaqualand, South Africa, and on, via the Italian Dolomites, to the Stirling range in Australia.</p><p>The result, Wildflower Wonders: The 50 Best Wildflower Sites in the World (2011), was a bestseller at home and in North America.

<p>Emotions swirl around Saturday’s Challenge Cup final and a classic between two old rugby league rivals could ensue</p><p>Given the incredible scale of fundraising efforts in his name, it has been easy to forget that Rob Burrow achieved plenty as a rugby league player. On the pitch arguably his greatest feat was being an integral part of the Leeds Rhinos side who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/10/leeds-wigan-super-league-grand-final-match-report">won the domestic treble in 2015</a>, only the third team to do so this century.</p><p>Perhaps, therefore, it is fitting that on the day rugby league comes together to celebrate the life of Burrow at Saturday’s Challenge Cup final, the two teams vying for Wembley glory will consider themselves genuine contenders to emulate the heroics of that Leeds side in which Burrow featured so prominently nine years ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/07/warrington-wigan-wembley-tribute-rob-burrow-cha

Reviews were lukewarm to woeful. “Eminem loses the magic,” ran the headline in the New York Times, while website Stereogum went for the more straightforward “Eminem’s New Song ‘Houdini’ Is Really, Really Bad”, criticising everything from the “stilted” rapping to a lyrical joke about the incident when Megan Thee Stallion was shot in the foot by her fellow rapper Tory Lanez.</p><p>The public’s response was quite the opposite. A week on, it is the most-streamed song in the UK and guaranteed to become Eminem’s 11th UK No 1.

<p>The Green party has backtracked on its ‘natural birth’ policy. Demonising C-sections harks back to the bad old days of ‘too posh to push’</p><p>Sometimes, when I’m reflecting on how far we’ve come since the 1990s, I think about the phrase “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/29/british-women-right-caesarean-too-posh-to-push">too posh to push</a>”. How disgustingly, physiologically misogynistic that phrase is, and how cavalierly people just … said it, as though how a woman decides to give birth – through her vagina or from an incision in her abdomen – was a matter of public debate. Back then, it really was. The tabloids were full of speculation about whether female celebrities gave birth vaginally or not, and the general public adopted the catchphrase, feeding the (false) impression that many women were choosing to have caesarean sections simply for the sake of convenience.</p><p>I’d be shocked, these days, to hear someone roll that out.

The division of that quality across the league is so much better and as a result the competition – Newcastle notwithstanding – is much better.

<p>As Fiona Harvey sues the streaming giant over its hit show, what does it mean for TV? Brace for plenty of fudging of the facts and a lot more carefully worded disclaimers</p><p>At the start of the year, nobody could have predicted that Baby Reindeer – a British drama from a creator nobody had heard of – would end up being the most significant television programme of our age. And yet, it increasingly looks like that will be the case.</p><p>Ever since a small band of online sleuths watched the show, noted that it was billed as “a true story” and attempted to track down the real-life inspiration of one of its characters, Baby Reindeer has gone supernova. In Fiona Harvey, they found a woman who not only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/may/09/inspiration-for-baby-reindeer-stalker-character-says-she-received-death-threats">matched the physical description of Martha</a>, the character who stalks the lead, but whose social media output strongly resembled the charact

It’s a bureaucratic tool of governance for an arbitrarily defined landmass; an artifice made convincing through emotive storytelling. Although many countries have their “long, long ago” symbolic foundation story, in truth the vast majority of them have only existed as independent constitutions for a matter of decades. We, the nationals, are the result of millennia of migrations of ancestral hunter-gatherers, herders, farmers, merchants, students, industrialists; of colonists and colonisers; of people invading, fleeing, crusading, exploring, roaming, slave-trading; uprooted for war, work, fortune and love. The dense interconnectedness of the human family, our genetic similarity, means that in terms of our biology, there are no different races.

A summer dress is more than a frock: it is a flag of cheer, a totem of good times. It is the next best thing to bottled sunshine.

There is something even better than a summer dress. Let me introduce you to this summer’s hero: the summer two-piece. It is a dress, but it is also – as a bonus ball – a top and a skirt which can be worn separately. This makes it more versatile than a summer dress, and versatility is key if you want a leaner, harder-working wardrobe. So it is more than a dress – but it is also a better kind of dress, because a dress that divides at the waist is more amenable to sitting right on

<p>The Room author on adoring Alan Garner, inspirational Sylvia Plath and the wisdom of Terry Pratchett</p><p><strong>My earliest reading&nbsp;memory</strong><br />
 We had a big crack-spined hardback of&nbsp;Hilda Boswell’s illustrated Treasury of&nbsp;Children’s Stories that&nbsp;had survived my seven siblings to come down to me. For years, whenever my mother asked which bedtime story I’d like out of the Treasury, I demanded Pinkel and the Witch, a&nbsp;folk tale recorded in the 1850s. My mother was so bored of it she would groan and beg me to pick something else, but she&nbsp;always caved. I don’t know why this tale about a risk-loving boy thief and the scary/seductive witch whose island he repeatedly sneaks on to gripped me like nothing else. But the reason I remember it so vividly is the implicit lesson I learned from my mother: give those you love what they crave, rather than what you think they should want. I try to treat my readers the same way.</p><p><strong>My favourite book

We’re 97 concerts in, and Taylor Swift’s Eras tour has already grossed well over a billion dollars, generated nearly as many friendship bracelets, caused a series of massively viral fits of weeping and screaming and now the UK finally gets to experience it, as Eras opens at Edinburgh’s Murrayfield Stadium on Friday night.

Even if it is a fairly slight portrait</p><p>A common criticism of those attending the Met gala is their failure to adhere to the theme. The internet was appalled by many interpretations of 2019’s theme of “camp”, and this year Anna Wintour apologised for making it too confusing with “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion”. But 2023’s Karl Lagerfeld theme was adhered to with aplomb. Lagerfeld was such a distinctive figure that from the fingerless gloves, pearls, sunglasses and black and white tailoring to his beloved Birman cat Choupette, there was ample inspiration for attendees to make themselves unmistakably Lagerfeldian. And while Daniel Brühl, the star of Disney+’s Becoming Karl Lagerfeld, bears little resemblance to the German designer, he too compellingly embodies one of fashion’s most distinctive icons.</p><p>As the title suggests, this
