<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I've recently upgraded my 3D Printer, a Geeetech i3 Pro B using a GT2560A+. I've done a few mods, replaced the threaded rod with lead screws, added a probe, added bearings to the Z Axis. My most recent upgrade is to change the main board to a SKR E3 V3.</p> <p>To start, I managed to get a print that I was very happy with off, by far and away a huge improvement. I then went to print another but the printer started turning off when the heated was turned on. I don't understand when it was working flawlessly a moment ago.</p> <p>I have 2x 12v connectors going to the SKR from the PSU just like on the old GT2560A+ as I wasn't sure if I needed both or not.</p> <p>Any ideas?</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Calm_Yogurt7215"> /u/Calm_Yogurt7215 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1dah24m/printer_turns_off_when_heating_bed/">[link]</a></span> &#
