The Crow is a franchise beloved by countless fans across the globe.  When the first installation of The Crow came out after the tragic on-set accident involving Brandon Lee, the character took on a cult like status.  Adapted from the comic series by Frank Miller, the Crow was not a film fans saw being sequalized to the degree it has been. With each itteration being worse than the last, fans everywhere are wondering if the new 2024 reboot of The Crow will break the streak, or prove once and for all that you can not recast The Crow.
