I look through a bunch of older models I painted that I found as I was setting up the studio again (the windows are FINISHED) and they look pretty decent in comparison to my most recent models. Why aren't I getting any better?

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
