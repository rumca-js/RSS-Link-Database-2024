Thermalright has taken an extremely aggressive approach to CPU coolers and seems to be going for a high volume, low cost model that also includes a never-ending supply of new cooler models. There are so many models that Thermalright's own reps got mixed-up explaining the differences, so we do our best running through what's most interesting for this year. We'll be benchmarking many of these as they launch, including the new Thermalright Royal Pretor 130, the Peerless Assassin 140, the Burst Assassin, and more.

Corsair's #Computex 2024 showing includes its new 9000D mega case, the cheaper $100 3500X (that we're a bit critical on), and the Titan closed-loop liquid coolers for CPUs. The liquid coolers have had a major engineering rework that we'll have to test once we're back, but we at least got some initial detail on the changes that were made.
