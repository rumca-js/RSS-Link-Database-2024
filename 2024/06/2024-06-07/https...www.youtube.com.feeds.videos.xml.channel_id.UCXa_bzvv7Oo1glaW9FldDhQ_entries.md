Even with all the titles coming out this year and the next, Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto 6 remains at the top of many wishlists. After the first reveal trailer, fans are desperate for any morsel of new information that the developer could provide.

Set in modern-day Vice City and featuring two new protagonists, Lucia and Jason, Grand Theft Auto 6 seemingly pushes the boundaries of realism further than ever. 

However, given some concerns about realism in previous titles and how the attention to detail may be too excessive, will that hamper the sequel? Is it possible to deliver an experience that's too realistic?

Furthermore, can it apply to such a scale in the long term? Time will tell, but for now, let's discuss why an even more realistic approach is perhaps the best way that Rockstar can go about things - and one of the charms of its titles overall.

Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring's first paid expansion, inches closer to its June 21st launch date. As we ponder The Land of Shadow and all the challenges it could hold, several new details are available courtesy of recent hands-on previews.

On top of learning more about the size of the world and the different characters within, there are updates on the new bosses, enemies, 100 weapons, Weapon Arts, and Spirit Ashes contained in the new map. Furthermore, the "level-up" element that the developer teased as exclusive to the region has finally been revealed.

If that wasn't enough, there may be even more bosses than the original +10 figure indicated to go with some much-needed quality-of-life changes. Check out 15 new things you should know about Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree before its launch for Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and PC.
