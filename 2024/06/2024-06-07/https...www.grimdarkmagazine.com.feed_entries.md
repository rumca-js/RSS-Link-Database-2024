The previous books established that Metatron, simultaneously villain and love interest of Nephilim, has been plotting to overthrow the Olympias Board of Directors for some time. Having successfully defeated the invasion of Europe&#8217;s Rosprom corporation, Olympias has never been more vulnerable while Metatron has never been more powerful. However, to successfully pull off his coup, he needs the other corporation to stand down. The leader of TogbuaXiang, the so-called Tigress, wants to meet with Nephilim and Metatron suspe
