Recall, which is rolling out as part of Microsoft&#8217;s new Copilot+ PCs initiative, takes regular screenshots of user activity on the machine, creating an index that can be queried using AI. The feature received pushback from security and privacy leaders. Signal President Meredith Whittaker said the feature was a &#8220;dangerous honeypot for hackers.&#8221; &#8220;We are updating the set-up experience of Copilot+ PCs to&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-updates-recall-feature-after-security-and-privacy-backlash/">Read More</a>

French Gates, who announced in May that she would be resigning from the foundation, shared a letter (below) on social media in which she said she was feeling a complicated mix of emotions — from sadness over the goodbye to pride and excitement over what&#8217;s been accomplished and what&#8217;s next. &#8220;Most people never in their lives get to work with a group&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/in-farewell-letter-melinda-french-gates-calls-nearly-25-years-at-the-gates-foundation-a-gift/">Read More</a>

And good luck finding anything resembling peace and quiet. A fledgling Seattle-based startup wants to give solo travelers a sanctuary instead. The company, Sanctum, is developing pods with doors that provide fully enclosed, private spaces, with a cocoon-like spherical shape. They feature seats&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-startup-sanctum-is-developing-private-pods-where-solo-travelers-can-work-rest-or-relax/">Read More</a>

Five of the 28 thrusters initially malfunctioned &#8212; which forced NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to put&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/boeing-starliner-docking-s
