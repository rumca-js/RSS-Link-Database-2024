This feels like a very good call to me: in response to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/1/stealing-everything-youve-ever-typed/">widespread criticism</a> Microsoft are making Recall an opt-in feature (during system onboarding), adding encryption to the database and search index beyond just disk encryption and requiring Windows Hello face scanning to access the search feature.

<blockquote cite="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-has-lost-trust-with-its-users-windows-recall-is-the-last-straw"><p>In fact, Microsoft goes so far as to promise that it cannot see the data collected by Windows Recall, that it can&#x27;t train any of its AI models on your data, and that it definitely can&#x27;t sell that data to advertisers. All of this is true, but that doesn&#x27;t mean people believe Microsoft when it says these things. In fact, many have jumped to the conclusion that even if it&#x27;s true today, it won&#x27;t be true in the future.</p></blockquote><p class="cite">&mdash; <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-has-lost-trust-with-its-users-windows-recall-is-the-last-straw">Zac Bowden</a>
