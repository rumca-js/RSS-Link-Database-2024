As a programmer (or engineer), if something takes up more than 90 seconds of my time, I'll automate it. That's the beauty of knowing how to code. You can write scripts for just about anything, whether it's something that takes up too much time, something you just don't like doing, or you run a telnet session to your coffee machine (which runs Linux and a TCP socket) to start brewing you a half-caf latte so that it's done after the exact time it takes you to walk there. Or... you don't have the time or know-how to do that so you whip up anything from simple to complex automation workflows using make.com.
