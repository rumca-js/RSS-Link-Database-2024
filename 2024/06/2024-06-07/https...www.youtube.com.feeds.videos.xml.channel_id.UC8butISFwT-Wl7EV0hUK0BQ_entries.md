On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Dr. Chuck. He's a software engineer and Computer Science professor at University of Michigan, which has one of the top-ranked CS programs in the world. 

Dr. Charles "Chuck" Severance is also creator of many popular free learning resources like his Python for Everyone and C for Everyone, which millions of students have taken over the past decade.

We talk about:
- What separates a Master Programmer from an average developer, and how to become one
- Dr. Chuck's mission to make programming knowledge freely available
- The fundamental shortcomings of how Computer Science is currently taught at universities â€“ even elite universities like the one he's a professor at
- Dr. Chuck's theories on recent tech layoffs and what he thinks the near future holds
- Dr. Chuck's love of racing $500 cars that he revives from the junk yard, and flying planes
