ShotSpotter hasn&#8217;t been doing all that well lately. While it&#8217;s the market leader in acoustic detection tech for law enforcement, it has seen several large contracts slip through its re-branded fingers in recent months. While ShotSpotter executives and press releases tout the accuracy of its sensors, real-life experience hasn&#8217;t been quite as stellar. Even if [&#8230;]

The central question was whether the judges considered that copyright was more important than privacy. The bad news is that the CJEU has just decided that it is: The Court, [&#8230;]

As the country most famous for enshrining civil rights, it sure seems like we spend a lot of time and money reminding the government of this fact. And it shouldn&#8217;t need to be reminded! These rights were defined by the government and considered inherent to American life. They weren&#8217;t granted. They were recognized as natural [&#8230;]

You probably already know the benefits of learning a language, so let&#8217;s focus on the app. Right off the bat, let&#8217;s be clear about one thing: When we say &#8220;app&#8221; we don&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re limited to using Babbel on your phone. You can use Babbel on desktop, too, and your progress is synchronized across [&#8230;]

What if banning social media from schools actually put kids at even greater risk? One of the more annoying things in talking about tech policy is how many people refuse to think one step ahead about how the world reacts to their policy proposals. We’ve talked about this in many contexts, but one that keeps [&#8230;]

Now that streaming subscriber growth has slowed, we&#8217;ve noted repeatedly how the streaming TV sector is falling into all of the bad habits that ultimately doomed traditional cable TV.
