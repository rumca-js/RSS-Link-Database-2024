Is AI a bubble? Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and everybody in between doesn’t seem to think so. But I kinda do.

I’ve been skeptical of a lot of tech in the past few years, and while AI certainly has shown promise over the past…uh, few decades its been around, its this current iteration of the technology that I have some doubts about.

Today I’ll be discussing why I feel this way, and hoping that this video doesn’t age like cottage cheese.

That is to say, stinky.
