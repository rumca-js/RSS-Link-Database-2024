Ten years ago, ISIS was gaining strength and seizing territory in Iraq — including the city of Mosul, home to more than a million Iraqis. In this excerpt from FRONTLINE’s 2020 documentary “Once Upon a Time in Iraq,” Iraqis recall what it was like when ISIS took over Iraq’s second largest city in June 2014.

The full documentary tells the story of the Iraq War from the perspective of the Iraqis who lived through it. They share their personal accounts and lasting memories of life under Saddam Hussein, the U.S.-led invasion of their country and the 17 years of chaos that followed — from sectarian violence to the rise and brutal reign of ISIS.
