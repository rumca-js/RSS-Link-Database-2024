  <p id="8kDvzc">Riot’s tactical shooter <em>Valorant</em> has been a PC-exclusive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21265402/valorant-riot-shooter-launch-date">since it launched in 2020</a> — but that’s changing very soon.

  <p id="ydLyW3">It’s been a long wait, but the next <em>Civilization</em> has finally been revealed. At the main Summer Game Fest keynote, publisher 2K officially announced <em>Civilization 7</em>, the first new entry in the strategy series since 2016. We didn’t get any real details or actual gameplay, but instead a very brief teaser trailer that looked a lot like, well, <em>Civilization</em>. But there’s one thing we do know: the game won’t be launching until 2025. And it’s coming to a number of platforms, with the launch planned for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.</p>
<p id="cdPlml">More details will be coming in August, according to 2K, with a “full gameplay showcase.”<

  <p id="4pAYlO">One of the cuter reveals at Summer Game Fest was the Lego-ified version of <em>Horizon</em>’s postapocalyptic future. The game is called <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, and it looks like a playful action-adventure game set (obviously) in the<em> Horizon </em>universe. Naturally, there’s lots of building as well. And co-op play. And some very goofy jokes fitting Lego’s many video game spinoffs.</p>
