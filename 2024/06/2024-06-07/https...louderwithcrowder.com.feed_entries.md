However, many agencies have yet to get the memo and have been pandering to Progressives in some of the most pathetic ways.

Is Miss Maryland is a dude? Yes but Miss USA is NOT the same as Miss America. Is Miss Alabama is a house? Yes but that was “National American Miss” not Miss America. It’s very confusing. Ukraine confirmed this week that US-made weapons have struck targets inside Russia, all but assuring we’re gearing up for WW3. Former Vice President Joe Biden is pandering hard after Donald Trump’s bogus guilty charge did not hurt him in the polls. Mexico just elected its first female president for some reason. We’re all getting hyped for Alien: Romulus so we’re peeping the trailer today, and so much more! </p><p><em>Subscribe to Louder with Crowder on Rumble!

The more famous the white liberal is, the more intolerant they seem to be. I wasn't surprised that one of them was 50 Cent's ex-girlfriend and former comedian Chelsea Handler (though I was kinda shocked 50 apparently hit that in the first place).</p><p>I also wasn't surprised that this clip FROM 2020 is going viral again.
