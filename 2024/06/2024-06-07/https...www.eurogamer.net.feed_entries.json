It will last two.</p><p>As for what to expect, Keighley has tempered expectations by saying this year's show will focus more on updates to existing games rather than new releases, which isn't terribly exciting. But Capcom will be there to show Monster Hunter Wilds, we'll probably get a look at Star Wars Outlaws, and Remedy's Sam Lake seems to be there so there's a suggestion of something for Alan Wake 2.

The holistic worldbuilding of System Shock. The playful interactivity of Duke Nukem 3D. The crisp set-piece design of Half-Life. Selaco blends them all into a smooth, unctuous action experience.

It mashed together two things I'm fond of: Roguelike deck-builders and badass secret agents. FITS gave me a turn-based experience that made me feel like Jason Bourne, punching and kicking and weaving my way around enemies on cramped battlefields. I stepped around their punches and redirected them back at them. I slammed their heads into walls and tables. I dodged bullets - <em>whoa. </em>I even booted people off the wings of aeroplanes. I survived insurmountable odds. FITS did what it promised and fulfilled my hand-to-hand spy-fight fantasy. But where does the series go from here?
