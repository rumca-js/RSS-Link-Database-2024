  <p id="0JJtkN">Bollywood music label T-Series had the most-subscribed YouTube channel for years after Felix Kjellberg, aka PewDiePie, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/31/18289617/pewdiepie-tseries-congratulations-subscribe-youtube-diss-track-100-million">conceded</a> his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18270905/subscribe-to-pewdiepie-youtube-new-zealand-attack-meme">protracted and problematic fight</a> for the top spot to it.

  <p id="TVMx0u">Nvidia and AMD are gearing up to launch gaming laptops that include the AI Copilot Plus features that Microsoft just announced for Qualcomm-powered laptops. At Computex today, Nvidia briefly teased that “RTX AI PC” laptops are on the way from Asus and MSI that will eventually include Copilot Plus PC features.</p>
<p id="8dyIn7">“Newly announced RTX AI PC laptops from ASUS and MSI feature up to GeForce RTX 4070 GPUs and power-efficient systems-on-a-chip with Windows 11 AI PC capabilities,” says Nvidia in a <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-brings-ai-assistants-to-life-with-geforce-rtx-ai-pcs">blog post</a>.

  <p id="fA0iO3">When Nvidia first announced G-Assist it was an <a href="https://x.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/848151745964392449">April Fools’ prank in 2017</a> that joked about an AI assistant being able to help you play a game while you ran to the door for your pizza delivery. Now, seven years later, G-Assist is back as a real demo of a powerful GeForce AI assistant that Nvidia might eventually bring to life for game developers and RTX GPU owners.</p>
<p id="AugFHB">Project G-Assist is only a tech demonstration right now, but it’s a brief look at how an AI assistant could guide you through PC games and even configure optimal settings for

  <p id="ief0S1">Nvidia just gave the PC gaming industry a reason to shrink its biggest graphics cards and produce smallish cases. It’s not what I expected, but I think it might actually help. Read before you judge, friends — I was definitely ready to call out some Nvidia BS, but I’ve mostly come around.</p>
