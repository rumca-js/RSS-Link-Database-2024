<p>Sometimes it’s the simplest games that end up leaving you all teary-eyed and emotional.</p>
<p>When I first downloaded Cool Lemon Club’s <em>The Keyper </em>for Playdate, I didn’t have much in the way of expectations beyond a general sense that it should be pretty good, since lots of people online seemed to be recommending it. The adventure game, which is available on <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://cool-lemon-club.itch.io/the-keyper"><ins>itch.io</ins></a> and the official <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://play.date/games/the-keyper/"><ins>Playdate Catalog</ins></a>, sees the player searching for the many different keys needed to unlock areas of the mysterious Winchester 21 building after taking over the role of caretaker. The person who formerly held the job is gone, leaving only some cryptic notes behind, and the residents are varying degrees of weird.</p>

<p>After yesterday’s launch of the first crewed <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/starliners-first-crewed-flight-gets-scrubbed-just-before-launch-171045016.html">Starliner mission was scrubbed</a>, NASA, Boeing and ULA made the decision to wait a few days before making another attempt. Starliner was scheduled to finally lift off on Saturday afternoon after a series of delays, but this attempt was aborted due to a last-minute issue with a ground computer system that plays a key role in launching the rocket. While NASA and partners discussed possibly flying today following their assessment of the issue, they’ve decided to hold off until the next opportunities, either on June 5 or 6.</p>
<p>Saturday’s launch wasn’t scrubbed due to a problem with the Starliner craft itself, but because an automatic hold was issued by the ground launch sequencer for a then-unknown reason. In a press conference later on Saturday, Tory Bruno, president and CEO of ULA explained that
