<p>This commemoration of the Normandy landings uses actors lip-syncing over period interviews to stunning effect. It poignantly keeps these soldiers’ memories alive </p><p>Eighty years ago this month a young bloke from south London called Wally Parr was floating through the night in a flimsy wooden glider a few thousand feet over the Channel. He wasn’t alone. Jammed alongside him in one of six such craft were his mates from the British army’s 6th Airborne Division. On the night before the D-day landings, they were heading behind enemy lines to capture a bridge from the Germans. Some wouldn’t see the dawn.</p><p>If the 181 men on these gliders were afraid, adrenaline and delusion may have helped still their nerves. “The thing that keeps most men going in battle,” reflects one, “is despite seeing people die left right and centre, they always get this idea that it’s not going to be them.” These were words of the late Pte Parr, who died in 2005, recorded during an interview after the seco

With certain third-round matches to be finished, the French Open organisers opted to move the uncompleted contest between Zizou Bergs and Grigor Dimitrov to Court Philippe-Chatrier before Novak Djokovic’s night session match, which was scheduled to begin at 8.15pm.

The cops initially accused two local leaders connected to the Hindu right of inciting the upper-caste residents of the area against Dalits (who occupy the lowest rung of the caste order), but a few months later the investigation changed tack. By May, the police were linking the incident to an anti-caste interfaith public meeting that took place 20 miles away a day before and claiming that the organisers were part of a “chilling Maoist conspiracy” to ass

<p>Clever hacks to make a property really feel like a place you can call home</p><p>Medina Grillo’s hands-on experience of renovating her rented three-bedroom semi spurred the creation of a <a href="https://grillo-designs.com/">blog</a> to help like-minded home-improvers.

<p>Forget the sports car and affair with a personal trainer. My generation of women are reaching this life stage messily, sensually and full of rage </p><p>I’m not having a midlife crisis. Any actuary would tell you I’m well over halfway, plus the years 30-40 were one long, undignified, slightly premature MLC (I won’t apologise for abbreviating; time is short – see first point) that I refuse to revisit. But I’m interested in that moment when mortality ceases to be a vague, polite murmur and becomes a screaming alarm. My cohort is now traversing <a href="https://x.com/RobGMacfarlane/status/950260846306918401?lang=fr">Dante’s dark wood</a>, so I feel surrounded if not by midlife crises (I’m experiencing disappointingly few vicarious ones), then by culture exploring them.</p><p>Of course, each generation rediscovers and makes a fuss about universal experiences, but it feels like the MLC is in the midst of a makeover. First, it’s female. The new MLC queen is Miranda July, whose new novel

<p>This freewheeling, semi-improvised feature from the Ross brothers follows a group of friends as they head for the coast for a final pre-adulthood blowout</p><p>The Ross brothers – American directing duo Bill Ross IV and Turner Ross – have made a career out of telling stories from the margins of US society and doing so using a film-making approach that is similarly disengaged from the mainstream. And as <em>Gasoline Rainbow</em>, their follow-up to <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/23/bloody-nose-empty-pockets-review">Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets</a></em>, demonstrates, the results can be thrillingly freewheeling and creatively invigorating, if a little confounding for audience members who prefer a neat delineation between documentary and fiction.</p><p>The brothers’ technique involves casting non-professional actors as loose versions of themselves, and then placing them in a series of planned but unscripted scenarios and shooting on the fly.

The city in which sisters Isla, Irene and Agnes live has been transformed by endless rain – and in turn its inhabitants have had to transform their existence, living in houses higher and higher up, and travelling via ferry where train lines once ran.</p><p>The world is “in its final stages”, Armfield tells us near the start of the book. Yet her characters do not live as though in an emergency. The siblings moan about their jobs, delayed commutes and relationships that are on the rocks. No matter the circumstances, we will always be anchored by life’s mundanities, Armfield seems to say.

So can the rewards of elite sport ever justify the sacrifices?</p><p>There’s a version of her story that Rebecca Achieng Ajulu-Bushell has learned to tell.

I’m used, therefore, to telling a light version of my history. One for inspiration, or whatever. How I’ve had a lot of experience of being the outsider: the only one, the first. I was the first Black woman to swim for Great Britain; the only Black person in my year doing my degree at Oxford University. I’m often the sole Black woman in the corporate rooms that I’m in today.

The dad with his household order on a scrappy sliver of paper. The girl of 11 or 12 quietly reciting her own family’s demands, lips miming through lyrics of Mum’s mushy peas and little brother’s Vimto. Teenagers documenting the seconds that passed on mobile phones. They argued over whether gravy on chips was disgusting or not without looking up from their screens. A man of 60 or so joined us, rubbed his hands together and addressed my mum: “You can’t beat Chippy Night can you, love?” For a few splendid minutes, the democracy of the chip-shop queue made everything seem all right.</p><p>Mum agreed with the man.

<p>Bertrand Bonello’s head-spinning Henry James adaptation set in 1910 Paris, 2014 LA and an AI-controlled 2044 casts a dreamlike spell</p><p>The choking grip of artificial intelligence on humanity is the starting point for Bertrand Bonello’s wildly ambitious, century-spanning, French and English-language story of doomed romance, subconscious fears and pigeon-based symbolism. It’s a theme – AI, that is, not the pigeons – that has been thoroughly mined in cinema of late, perhaps not surprisingly. After all, AI poses one of the more significant threats to the future of humankind. It’s the dystopian sci-fi premise that – literally – writes itself, given half the chance. But the eponymous beast in this story is not AI, and Bonello’s approach to the subject is rather more eccentric and original. It’s certainly the most ambitious of his films, which include the fashion biopic <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/29/house-of-tolerance-review-apollonide">Saint Laurent</a></e

<p>How to achieve that natural, sunkissed finish – without baking in the sun</p><p>I’m sure bronzers have been explained to everyone – including myself – a million times. What they are, what they do, how to use them and yet… people still haven’t quite grasped exactly how to use them. Or perhaps they just haven’t found one that works for them. So let’s go back to basics. Sometimes it’s easier to start with what something is not as opposed to what it is. The purpose of a bronzer is not to make you bronze. If you are already using a bronzer that is doing this, you have the wrong product (but, of course, if your whole point is to actually look bronze, then good luck with that). A bronzer is essentially a bit of makeup that is supposed to give your skin a boost so it looks less pallid, more alive, happier and healthier.

<p>Labour and the Tories are avoiding talking about how to fund the overhaul of a system that is failing the elderly and people with disabilities</p><p>There is one pressing issue affecting millions of people that has been conspicuous in its absence from the general election campaign so far. The parlous state of social care in England – a system that has been described as being in crisis for well over a decade – is leaving too many older people and those with disabilities without the personal care they need to lead a full and dignified life, with their relatives struggling to fill in as much&nbsp;as they can.</p><p>Yet neither of the main political parties seems willing to have an honest conversation with voters about the cost of a care system that caters for an ageing society, and on whose shoulders it should fall.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/02/the-observer-view-on-the-social-care-crisis-whoever-wins-the-election-it-needs-addressing-urgent

A visibly tricky encounter with some cones during a football training session may have resulted in him being mocked mercilessly on TikTok, but one loyal newspaper described his troubling manoeuvre as a Cruyff turn, a move named after the beguiling Dutch great. Not since Kim Jong-il scored 11 holes in one in his first ever round of golf has a leader’s sporting prowess had such an unlikely upgrade.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/02/election-diary-dismal-dribbles-and-poor-paddleboarding-fail-to-elevate-the-debate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Light reds, rosés and orange wines made by both romantics and pragmatists</p><p><strong>Theopetra Estate Xinonmavro Rosé, Meteora, Greece 2022 (£21.75, <a href="http://corkingwines.co.uk/">corkingwines.co.uk</a>) </strong>Wine producers tend to divide into two temperamental camps. The first, cussedly idealistic type doesn’t think very much about who’s going to buy their wine until it’s time to sell it – they make what they damn well please and only then hope to find customers who share their enthusiasm. The second group is rather more pragmatic: they research potential customers in fine detail before they so much as plant a vine, and everything they do in the vineyard and cellar is in service to what they think the market demands. When it comes to most rosé wine, it looks very much like the second camp is in charge: retailer wine ranges are increasingly filled with dozens of very pale pinks either from, or copying the wildly successful model perfected in, Provence.
