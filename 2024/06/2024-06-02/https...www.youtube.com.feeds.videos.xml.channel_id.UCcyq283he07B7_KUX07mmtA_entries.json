But the wood used to make the highest-quality bats needs to be shipped halfway across the globe from England. JS Wright & Sons, an English willow tree supplier that has been in the industry since the 1800s, supplies 75% of the willow for the world's cricket bats. English willow bats are durable, yet lightweight and sell for up to 10 times as much as cheaper, lower-end Kashmir willow bats. Growing these trees and using them to create a perfect bat is a more than 15-year-long process that requires a careful eye and years of experience. The trees need to be regularly inspected and maintained so they grow slowly and produce a clean, tight-grained cleft. But the best trees could be in short supply as the sport spreads into more countries, like the United States.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:58 - $1,000 Cricket Bat\n01:30 - The Perfect Tree\n02:14 - English Willow Forest\n03:11 - Sawmill Process\n04:22 - Sawing An", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5k2ewUwInc", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 32, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCcyq283he07B7_KUX07mmtA", "source_obj__id": 152, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/b5k2ewUwInc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why English Willow Cricket Bats Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
