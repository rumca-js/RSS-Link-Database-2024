As the party descends into the chasm, Conan flashes back to his conversation with Yag-Kosha (in Conan the Barbarian issue #9), a pachyderm-headed alien god who he slayed a decade ago in his own life (during the events of the 1933 Robert E. Howard story \u201cThe Tower of the Elephant\u201d), yet encountered alive and well just days ago in Valusia. Yag-Kosha emphasizes that Conan\u2019s soul has been \u201cset adrift\u201d in time, but that his fate is entwined with Brissa, a Pictish warrior woman from his own era (missing and presumed dead as of the conclusion of Conan the Barbarian issue #4) and her distant ancestor Brule.
