<p>New York’s governor backs a plan to remove smartphones from the classroom. Here are some suggestions for how it might work</p><p>On Thursday, Kathy Hochul, the New York governor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/30/new-york-smartphone-school-ban-bill">announced plans</a> to sponsor legislation that would ban smartphones in schools as part of her broader effort to protect children from technology’s negative effects. She intends to introduce the bill later this year so that it can be considered during New York’s next legislative session, which begins in January.</p><p>Hochul’s announcement should come as welcome news to anyone concerned about the effects of smartphones and social media on students’ attention spans, relationships, learning and mental health. However, given that it could be more than a year before the bill goes into effect – provided it’s passed to begin with – caregivers and school administrators may be wondering what they can do to shield

<p>Korea’s bestselling and relentlessly upbeat guide to getting old</p><p>Some people age well. Alan Bennett, for instance, has gradually but inexorably ascended to national treasure status. Others age badly. Take Rudy Giuliani, whose meltdown on live television a&nbsp;couple of years ago took on an unedifyingly literal form, as hair dye trickled down his face. Still others don’t age at all. Arnold Schwarzenegger still looks like, in the words of Clive James, “a brown condom full of walnuts”.</p><p>More generally, ageing clearly has&nbsp;its challenges. But now there is a Korean runaway bestseller, ably and idiomatically translated into English, to help us make sense of it all. Rhee Kun Hoo, 89 and battling seven different health conditions, evidently&nbsp;knows a&nbsp;thing or two about&nbsp;his subject. And he writes with considerable empathy. A&nbsp;psychiatrist, he is “considered a visionary” at home for introducing open wards, doing away with straitjackets and solitary confinemen
