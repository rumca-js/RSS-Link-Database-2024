India is home to a number of the top cricket-bat manufacturers, including Sareen Sports, SS. But the wood used to make the highest-quality bats needs to be shipped halfway across the globe from England. JS Wright & Sons, an English willow tree supplier that has been in the industry since the 1800s, supplies 75% of the willow for the world's cricket bats. English willow bats are durable, yet lightweight and sell for up to 10 times as much as cheaper, lower-end Kashmir willow bats. Growing these trees and using them to create a perfect bat is a more than 15-year-long process that requires a careful eye and years of experience. The trees need to be regularly inspected and maintained so they grow slowly and produce a clean, tight-grained cleft. But the best trees could be in short supply as the sport spreads into more countries, like the United States.
