In today's Daily Fix:
The Xbox exclusive Hi-Fi Rush, which was released to great acclaim last year, might be headed to a competitor's console. Rumor has it that the game, developed by Tango Gameworks, which is owned by Bethesda, who are owned by Microsoft, may land on the Nintendo Switch in the very near future. Xbox executives have previously stated their desire to put more Xbox first-party games on other consoles, so this could be a step in that direction. In other news, Nvidia has announced their new lineup of graphics cards, including the return of the "Super" series. Start saving your pennies. And finally, Half-Life 2 RTX just got a new trailer, so hopefully a release date is soon to follow.
