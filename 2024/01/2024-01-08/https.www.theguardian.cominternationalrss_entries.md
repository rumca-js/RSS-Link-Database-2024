## How Jonathan Majors used his post-conviction interview to ‘attack the victim’

<p>Domestic violence expert says Majors turned to ‘classic defense’ to seek sympathy</p><p>Just weeks after receiving a guilty verdict in the misdemeanor assault and harassment trial involving his ex-girlfriend, Jonathan Majors is still denying the charges. Asked whether he accepted the conviction for third-degree reckless assault, which carries a penalty of up to a year behind bars, Majors told Good Morning America: “I was reckless with her heart, not with her body.”</p><p>In the 34-year-old former Marvel actor’s first interview since his physical altercation with the British dancer Grace Jabbari last March, he wiped away tears and choked back emotion. Nicole Bedera, a sociologist who studies sexual violence, said the conversation featured hallmark tactics of Darvo, an acronym for deny, attack, and reverse victim and offender. “He’s denying the reality that’s being put in front of him and attacking the victim by suggesting that she’s the one who’s actually mistreating him,” says Bed

<p>There was moaning when the league was slimmed down but stronger sides are being fielded in various competitions</p><p>When France made the decision to go down to 18 teams in Ligue 1 for this season, there was no small amount of hand-wringing. Already, the league was missing stalwarts such as Bordeaux and Saint-Étienne. Toulouse and Lens, who had experienced European football with some consistency this century, had also recently been in the second tier, as had Monaco, prior to their takeover by Dimtry Ryblovlev.</p><p>Were more big names to go down (see Lyon’s struggles this season and Lens’ poor domestic form to kick off the campaign), the French top flight could be in jeopardy of losing some of its international appeal. However, while there may be some merit to those worries, the benefits to the quality of the league in terms of tighter competition and less fixture congestion have been manifest this season, particularly in Europe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football

<p>Making goods cheaper isn’t going to fix the fact that income has shifted to the top 10%</p><p>The policy debate about the cost of living is among the most confused and confusing in recent memory. All sorts of measures to reduce the cost of living are proposed, then criticised as being potentially inflationary. The argument implies, absurdly, that reducing the cost of living will increase the cost of living.</p><p>The issue here is that the “cost of living” is an essentially meaningless concept, rather like the sound of one hand clapping. The problem isn’t the cost of buying goods, but whether our income is sufficient to pay for those goods. For most of us, that means the real (inflation-adjusted) value of our wages, after paying tax and (for homebuyers) mortgage interest.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/08/australias-cost-of-living-crisis-isnt-about-the-price-of-groceries-its-about-the-distribution-of-wealth">Continue reading...</a>
