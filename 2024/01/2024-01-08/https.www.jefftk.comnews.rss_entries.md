cards on your pile, and so when someone takes your top card you're
still displaying matching symbols.  Then either they name something
from your now-revealed card's category, or you name something for the
card they just took and steal it back.  You continue until you no
longer match.  I've played games where we ended up with a stack
of 10+ matching cards,
