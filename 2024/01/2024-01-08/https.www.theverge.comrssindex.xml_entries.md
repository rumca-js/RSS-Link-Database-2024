  <p id="WPAnox">Asus’ ROG phones have always been targeted squarely at gamers, but with the ROG Phone 8, the company could broaden the lineup’s appeal. The ROG Phone 8, ROG Phone 8 Pro, and ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition are thinner (8.9mm versus 10.49mm for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/13/23681738/asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-price-release-date-specs-features-gaming-cooling">ROG Phone 7</a>), lighter (225g compared to 239g), have better dust and water resistance (IP68 versus IP54), and also now include wireless charging at up to 15W — desirable features regardless of whether you’re a smartphone gamer.</

  <p id="2DnSaU">Asus’ ROG Zephyrus have been some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop">our most recommended gaming laptops</a> for years — and now, for CES 2024, the Zephyrus G14 and G16 are getting thinner, faster, and even more versatile for non-gaming tasks.

  <p id="4M1id7">Gaming laptops generate a lot of heat, and Dell’s Alienware brand long ago settled on giving its gaming laptops big butts in order to exhaust it. But the problem with a large rear end on a laptop is it looks kind of goofy and makes packing it up a little more troublesome, so the Alienware M16 R2 has gotten a little booty reduction.</p>
