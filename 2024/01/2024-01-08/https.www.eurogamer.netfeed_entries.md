Microsoft has confirmed reports it's issuing bans to Baldur's Gate 3 players on Xbox when their consoles have automatically uploaded video captures featuring in-game nudity, but says it's willing to reverse suspensions "if actions are deemed to have been taken in error" and suggests users turn the auto-upload feature off to avoid further bans.

Following speculation Microsoft may be considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-release-acclaimed-first-party-game-on-another-platform-report-suggests">bringing its acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush to Switch</a>, new reports have claimed the company has also been looking into a PlayStation and Switch release for developer Rare's acclaimed multiplayer pirate adventure Sea of Thieves.

Journalist and prolific leaker Jeff Grubb initially claimed Microsoft had been eyeing up a potential PlayStation and Switch release for Sea of Thieves on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/EPC1iVlBH9M?si=MMKhEGeSyzHTUHdo&amp;t=640">Game Mess podcast earlier today</a>.

With Baldur's Gate 3 scooping up accolades all over the place last year, anticipation for developer Larian's next game is already sky high; but while the studio has made it clear an official reveal is still some way off, progress is apparently being made behind the scenes: studio boss Swen Vincke says he now "figured out" the first act of Larian's new project.

Vincke confirmed the studio's next game was in the works last November, saying he "very excited about it", and that Baldur's Gate 3's critical and commercial success was "really encouraging us to ensure it pushes many boundaries".

</p><p>
Here's what we can say for certain. The brief clip begins with a look at crazed scientist Singed, experimenting on a large body. The final shot shows this body - suspended unconscious from the ceiling - to be enormous, and wolf-like.
