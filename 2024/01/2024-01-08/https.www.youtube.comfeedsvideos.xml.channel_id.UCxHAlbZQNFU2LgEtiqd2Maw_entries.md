Besides yourself, who knows your project best? Your IDE! This is what makes AI Assistant in CLion, a C++ IDE by JetBrains, so context-aware and helpful.

* Wondering how to adopt C++ modules into your project or link to a selected library in CMake? Send your question to the AI chat. Its answer will take into account the technology you use and your project context.
* Need to research an error? AI Assistant in CLion can explain a runtime error, a CMake execution failure, or a selected piece of code.
* Want to improve your code? AI Assistant will suggest a refactoring and generate documentation for you.

JetBrains AI Assistant is now generally available. Use AI Assistant in CLion as an add-on with a JetBrains AI service subscription.
