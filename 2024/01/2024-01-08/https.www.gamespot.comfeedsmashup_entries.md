<p>Last Sunday, on January 7, a Twitter user posted that they found an iPhone in a bush that had fallen from Alaska Airlines Flight 1282. On top of that, the iPhone appeared to be undamaged.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24029806/boeing-737-max-9-iphone-found-working">The Verge</a>, we know the phone flew off the plane shortly after taking off. This had happened because a section of the fuselage broke off of the aircraft, which led the pilot to make an emergency landing at Portland International Airport. When the fuselage broke off, two phones flew out of the plane. The first phone was found in a yard.</p><p dir="ltr">The user found the second one, and they posted a series of pictures on <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanSafyre/status/1744138937239822685">X/Twitter</a> documenting what they found.

"Quote me when it's revealed to see how much of today's draft survives. I suspect a lot."</p><p>Vincke mentioned that even if the first draft doesn't hold up in the final product, sometimes the work will recycle itself when the right story is found for it. Additionally, he said that his thoughts shouldn't be taken as Larian revealing its next game just yet and it'll be a while until then.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-director-figures-out-act-1-of-next-game/1100-6520162/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>If you're a PlayStation fan, you can thank Nintendo for its decision to ditch Sony and partner up with Phillips for its first CD-based console, ultimately leading to the greatest revenge flex of all time when Sony entered the gaming market with the PlayStation console. But before Nintendo's great betrayal, a prototype of a Sony-powered SNES console did exist. If you had enough cash, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-playstation-hybrid-has-sold-for-a-lot-of-/1100-6474518/">that device could have been yours for a little over $300,000</a>.</p><p>That price tag might be a tad too high for most people, and fortunately, there is a more affordable alternative as demonstrated by YouTuber James Channel. All you need are old SNES and PlayStation consoles, knowledge on how to safely work with electricity, and a <em>lot </em>of hot glue to create your very own Nintendo-branded Sony CD-ROM console. A word of warning: If you're s[...]
