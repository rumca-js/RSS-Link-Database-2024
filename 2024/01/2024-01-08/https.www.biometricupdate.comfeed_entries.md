		Police in the UK have been using the country’s passport holder database to conduct facial recognition searches without public disclosure, a new investigation has revealed, sparking fears over privacy.

The secretive practice has been going on since 2019, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/01/05/police-facial-recognition-searches-passport-database-mps/">according</a> to records obtained by The Telegraph and Liberty Investigates. The facial recognition searches were conducted even though policing minister Chris Philp did not mention the possibility of using the passport database <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/uk-minister-wants-police-biometric-passport-database-searches-to-catch-shoplifters">until October 2023</a>.

		Synthetic data – probably including biometric identifiers -- has become a must-have for U.S. security officials.

The Department of Homeland Security is <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2024/01/05/st-announces-new-solicitation-synthetic-data-generator-solutions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">looking</a> for private sector products for generating synthetic data to model and simulate databases of real information.

		<a href="https://www.ces.tech/">CES 2024</a> takes over the Las Vegas Convention Center and Venetian Hotel this week until January 12, and AI is making the rounds, with biometric firms showcasing machine learning-driven tools across industries. According to coverage from <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/motoring/news/2024-01-05-ai-to-dominate-cars-at-this-years-ces/">TimesLive</a>, funding for generative AI projects increased fivefold to $23.78 billion from 2022 to 2023. The overall sentiment at this year’s CES is reflected in a quote from one tech analyst: “It’s the year of AI in everything; if you don’t have AI in your product, don’t show up.”

		Fewer than half of facial recognition searches requested by police in Massachusetts returned a match, according to a report by the U.S. state.

A mere fourteen requests made between September 1, 2022, and October 1, 2023 yielded one potential match each for six searches. The mandated <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/fy23-eopss-facial-recognition-annual-report/download">report</a> was compiled by the Massachusetts Public Safety and Security Office.

It's not the kind of record likely to assuage skeptics of face biometrics for identification of criminal suspects.

The report didn't say what results, if any, came of the potential matches against the Massachusetts State Police's Issuance 360 database, apparently referring to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia

		Some security personnel and private staff at airports in India have been capturing air travelers’ face biometrics to enroll them in the Digi Yatra program without first getting their consent, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/passengers-say-cisf-and-airport-staff-are-collecting-biometric-data-without-consent/article67710134.ece" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Hindu</a> reports.

Digi Yatra is supposed to be a voluntary program for faster clearance at various airport checkpoints, utilizing biometrics instead of passports.

A passenger at Delhi airport, Tavish Pattanayak, recounted security personnel checked the documents of  people in the same line as him on Christmas Eve, and then asked them to look at a screen for their photo to be taken. Pattanay

		The biometric voter registration drive for 2024 in <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/cameroon">Cameroon</a> has gone underway, with officials of the elections managing agency (ELECAM) hoping to take the voter registration figure to 7.5 million in total. The body says it registered 368, 119 new potential voters in 2023.

This is the last full-cycle voter registration exercise before the central African nation holds general elections constitutionally scheduled for 2025. In principle, the country is set to have four elections next year. They are Municipal Council, National Assembly, Presidential and Regional Council polls.

		Information has emerged that the collection of DNA samples from over 200 Uyghurs and Kazakh people – a group of marginalized ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region of China – for a genetic sequencing technology research, was done without respect for ethical standards.

<a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/biometric_data-01052024175746.html">Radio Free Asia</a> (RFA) quotes some witnesses as attesting that the concerned data subjects submitted their biometric data to the researchers under duress from the Chinese government. One of the witnesses, Qelbinur Sidiq, quoted by RFA said people had no choice but to accept instructions for the collection of their blood and saliva samples, fingerprints and retina scans.

		After years of work by the government, Barbadians could have a digital ID anytime this year, following assurances from the country’s Minister of Industry, Innovation, Science and Technology Davidson Ishmael.

As <a href="https://nationnews.com/2024/01/05/digital-id-coming-this-year/">reported</a> by Nation News, the announcement of the digital ID rollout means the government will go ahead with its plans of phasing out the old ID cards, which are to be replaced by another ID dubbed Trident ID.

Last year, the government had said the process to replace the laminated IDs with Trident IDs will continue until January 31. Early last year, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/barbados-minister-begs-people-t[...]

		Online fraud through the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS), a platform that allows merchants to accept payment from customers through Aadhaar authentication, accounted for 11 percent of online financial scams during 2023, a new analysis from India’s cybercrime watchdog has shown.

The Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) revealed that most of the AePS fraud cases were committed in the Indian states of Bihar and Jharkhand. Overall, the cybercrime helpline initiated by the agency received 1.3 million complaints related to online financial fraud in 2023, the Hindu Business Line <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/npci-swings-into-action-to-prevent-aeps-frauds/article67672192.ece[...]
