Donald Trump’s civil-fraud trial is expected to come to a close in a Manhattan court this week. The former president’s reputation as a New Yorker, businessman and socialite is at the center of the trial, where he and his adult children face allegations that they falsified the value of their assets for millions in ill-gotten gains.
