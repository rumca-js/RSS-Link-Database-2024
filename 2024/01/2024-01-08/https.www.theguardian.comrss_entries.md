<p>A casserole of tomatoes melted into rosemary-scented beans and kale, and topped with minty cheddar pesto</p><p>This is a proper winter warmer; even better, it’s a 30-minute dinner. The tomatoes break down into a wonderful sauce for the rosemary-spiked beans and kale, and the thing that elevates it from nice to something special is the quick homemade pesto, which you can whip up while the cassoulet is cooking. Purists, look away – I use cheddar instead of parmesan, and the results are spectacular, with a real hit of umami. Use whatever nuts you have to hand, but the basil and mint are a must.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/08/quick-and-easy-cassoulet-recipe-pesto-topped-white-bean-kale-and-tomato-rukmini-iyer">Continue reading...</a>

One of six kids born to his parents in Barra, a suburb of Naples, he could easily have gone down a dangerous path. “In some neighbourhoods on the edge of the city, when you struggle to make it to the end of the month [financially], with a big family, unfortunately you might do the wrong thing,” the defender told La Repubblica in 2022. “Young people tend to go this way.”</p><p>Football offered him a different direction, a road that would take him far from home. By nine years old, he had started working for a fruit stand after school to save up for boots. At 11, he joined Benevento’s academy system, moving an hour’s drive from home and seeing his parents just once a month. His next club was Hellas Verona, 440 miles away to the north.</p> <a hr[...]

Now I’ve cut ties – and it’s liberating </p><p>When my mother died in my early 20s, I hoped my estranged father might become the parent I so badly needed. Our relationship was never the stuff of John Lewis Christmas adverts. In fact, for most of my life we had been strangers to each other. We only began to be in contact regularly after my mother’s death and a DNA test officially confirmed I was his.</p><p>If this sounds like a promising premise for a fairytale happy ending, I have yet to read that particular story – but at the time, I convinced myself I could live it. Now I’m in my 40s, I’ve come to realise I don’t need him in my life. I haven’t seen him for seven years, and we last spoke a year ago. I wish I had known earlier how liberating it would feel to cut off contact.</p><p>Jennifer Barton is a freelance writer working on her first novel.[...]

Ask some audience members that question in the afterglow of a movie sex scene, and there will be complaints that the earth didn’t move for them. The sceptics include directors – for every master of sensuality such as Claire Denis or Pedro Almodóvar, there is a famously reticent Spielberg, or a Tarantino, who admits that “sex is not part of my vision of cinema”. Gen Z viewers, too, recoil from carnality on screen, even questioning the legitimacy of sex as a storytelling tool.

<p>So far the risks of the horrific Gaza crisis escalating to a wider war remain low – but they can’t be ruled out entirely</p><p>Soon after Hamas’s 7 October attack and Israel’s retaliatory bombing campaign in Gaza, pundits began debating the odds of escalation. For its part, the Biden administration has tried to prevent the fighting between Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from spreading to other areas of the Middle East, if only to spare the roughly 45,000 US troops based there from another ill-fated war.</p><p>“Escalation” lacks a singular meaning. For some, it connotes a vast increase in death and destruction after at least one warring party starts using weapons that are far more powerful than it had employed previously.

It was a great dinner, but it was also during a year of hellish ear infections and I was dosed up on painkillers. Which is why I remember so little about the evening, beyond a steep modern staircase with no railing and that broth, which had stuffed pasta bobbing around in it. Not that I can remember the pasta shape or what it was stuffed with. Only the orange, savoury-sweet butternut liquor, and how it was full of flavour and also how, when eaten with my head tilted to one side, it felt like a warm, internal compress. An odd compliment, I know, but also the highest one.</[...]

<p>She shared a birthday with Madonna and, like the Material Girl, loved being photographed. But her cuteness concealed a real toughness</p><p>One Sunday morning in 2004, my then partner and I found ourselves driving to a terrace house in Southall, London, where a dog breeder led us into his back yard. There, two jack russell puppies quivered, the last of the litter. A smooth-haired white one with a brown head and big button eyes cautiously wandered out, while her sister, the runt, held back shyly. We chose the former, naming her Pepper after the dark spot on her back.</p><p>I was in my 20s and unused to responsibility. Freaking out at this tiny furry bundle, I quickly bought every canine behavioural book I could find.

This mashup of magical realism, gratuitous violence and sentimentality is an atrocity in filmic form. It’s only a bit offensive for its appropriation of the Holocaust as a dramatic engine.

<p>The anthropology professor’s account of her conversations with two men living in Regent’s Park brings insights to her own life as well as theirs</p><p>Early in the first lockdown of 2020, Emma Tarlo, then a professor of anthropology at Goldsmiths, is introduced by a friend to two men who lived in a wild corner of Regent’s Park. Nick, a white man of 64, and Pascal, a Parisian of Algerian Berber heritage, who have been companions on the streets for 16 years and shared their pastoral nook under the hornbeams for the past five, do not consider themselves homeless. “I’ve never identified with the term ‘homeless’,” Nick tells her, “except as a category that the police might put on you.” As others welcome the policy of providing accommodation to rough sleepers during the pandemic, he and Pascal quietly resist any efforts to move them on, remaining in the home they have made with the tacit agreement of a sympathetic park manager. As Tarlo’s [...]

<p>Jacksonville looked like they were cruising to a postseason berth until their campaign crumbled.

Instead they made it a disaster, culminating with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401547652">their 28-20 loss at the Tennessee Titans</a> on Sunday afternoon.

<p>Mikel Arteta nears crisis point, Nuno rails at replays and there will be no break for the Blades</p><p>Every Premier League manager is under pressure and every Arsenal manager is under pressure but if results don’t improve and quickly, Mikel Arteta will soon be experiencing an intensified version of pressure. Though he has done a decent job over the last few seasons, he has been afforded money and now has a player he likes in every position along with various alternatives, making success no longer a bonus but a necessity. However, opponents now have a better handle on how to stop his team, shutting down their wide attackers to force play infield where only Martin Ødegaard can reliably create, and they also lack the kind of reliable goalscorer able to redeem poor performances – or, as happened against Liverpool, ensure good ones do not go unrewarded. A new striker might help, but Arteta must also tweak his side’s style, and fast, to p[...]

<p>Hopefuls for the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague face a probing from their professors in a documentary that looks for answers about art, institutions and ourselves</p><p>Shot over the course of a week-long entrance examination held by the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, this rigorous yet witty documentary brings to mind the observational, accumulative style of Frederick Wiseman; film-makers Adéla Komrzý and Tomáš Bojar are interested not only in the individual subjects, but also the hidden machinations of cultural institutions.</p><p>Designed to weed out the less qualified entrants, the first stage of the exam involves drawing portraits of live subjects. The second round, however, is when things get more interesting. In addition to a written test on art history, the applicants are asked to respond to prompts such as climate change. The film only affords us glimpses of the resulting artworks, but much more screen time is devoted to the professors’ probing questions on the taboos and

<p>Frances Harper had never used a video camera before. But at the age of 60, lying in the bath, she heard a story that changed her life</p><p>One morning in 2007, Frances Harper was taking a bath and listening to the local news on BBC Radio Suffolk when one story caught her attention. A young woman, Louise, was being interviewed about her life as a sex worker in Ipswich. “I couldn’t see how this interview was helping her situation at all,” says Harper, who was 60 at the time. “I got out of the bath and made some notes. I realised she needed a documentary to tell her story properly and I thought perhaps I could try to make it.”</p><p>Harper had never owned a video camera and had no idea how to shoot a film. She had spent the past four decades working in secretarial jobs, as well as raising her son and supporting her husband in his construction business. “I was busy but something was always missing,” she says. “Something I could do for myself.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com
