<p>For Apple-using <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3622356/the-future-of-work-is-hybrid-and-remote.html">workers on the go</a>, especially if you frequent shared co-working spaces or public places, don't assume you're as secure as you think you are.  </p><p>Co-working spaces are particularly under threat, in part because criminals have already figured out that the people using them are good targets for data theft, ransomware, and more.</p><p>They’ve also realized that at least some of those working from such spaces might well be part of, or connected with, larger corporate entities — meaning a successful data heist could unlock the gates to greater and more profitable kingdoms. There are useful resources from government and industry aimed at helping workers lock down their devices and data. In the US, for instance, the National Institute of Standards and Technology has published a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/

<p>Installing and repairing Windows operating systems requires access to known, good, working, and virus-free installation, image, and supporting files. Typically, such collections can run into the tens or even hundreds of thousands of items, all organized within a complex hierarchy of file directories (folders, in Windows-speak).</p><p>That probably explains why the ISO format, originally developed to capture the contents of an entire optical disc (such as a CD, DVD, or even Blu-ray platter), makes a great container for something as big and complicated as Windows. When you go looking for a Windows download for installation or <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3262979/how-to-fix-windows-10-with-an-in-place-upgrade-install.html">repair</a> nowadays, it’s quite likely that what you’ll find is best described as either a “Windows 10 ISO” or a “Windows 11 ISO.” Readily available downloads now run from 4.6GB to over 6GB in size (4.557GB for Wi

<p>I'm typically not one for sweeping tech predictions.</p><p>This year, though, it seems safe to put one particularly bold premonition out into the virtual wild. It's less of a <em>prediction</em>, mind you, and more of a certainty we're already seeing play out:</p><p>This year, we're gonna be hearing an awful lot about AI — in an awful lot of our existing platforms, products, and Android-associated services.</p><p>A daring prediction to make, I know — right? But it's one worth discussing, 'cause while most of the tech-watching world is going gaga over the endless AI hype oozing out of every digital corner right now, I'm finding myself growing weary of the buzzword-chasing sensationalism those two luscious letters are creating. And I'm growing increasingly skeptical about the practical, real-world value most of this stuff is actually poised to bring us.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712122/google-android-ai-artificial-intelligence.html#ju
