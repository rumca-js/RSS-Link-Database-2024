Supernormal reviewed by Vikki Blake on PC.

Despite an uneven start and a woefully predictable story, this spiritual successor to Allison Road and Silent Hills can offer some sincerely spooky encounters. The creepy house you'll explore is a tense treat to look at, though that atmosphere can get undercut in the first half by truly terrible writing. It's a shame such a brief game offers so little replayability, but while it's far from a PT killer, Supernormal is at least a decent way for a horror fan to kill a little time.

Victors? Without each other, are they even alive -- or will they find that they, too, are the Walking Dead?

As of right now, PlayStation Studios’ 2024 lineup is looking pretty thin, borderline non-existent, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t a bunch of huge third-party PS5 console exclusives and multi-platform games on the way. In fact, between Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, The Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Rise of the Ronin and Dragon’s Dogma 2 (just to name a few) this year is already pretty packed with big games to play on PS5. Best of all, Sony seems to be hinting that a couple highly-anticipated remakes are releasing sooner than we were expecting, namely Metal Gear Solid Delta Triangle 3: Snake Eater or however you’re supposed to say it, and Bloober Team’s Silent Hill 2 redo.

Echo, reviewed by Hanna Ines Flint. Narrated by Stella Chung.

Echo is a refreshingly gritty, grounded, and unflinchingly violent superhero story – though its connections to the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe continuity may run deeper than advertised. Amid nods to vintage Westerns and premium crime dramas, Alacqua Cox delivers a culturally authentic and captivating antihero worth rooting for.
