Researchers have developed a blood test that can reliably detect neuroendocrine prostate cancer and differentiate it from castration-resistant prostate cancer-adenocarcinoma (CRPC-adeno).

Peatlands are affected more by drought than expected. This is concerning, as these ecosystems are an important ally in the fight against climate change. Following long periods of drought, peat is able to absorb little to no extra carbon (CO2). Increasing biodiversity also does little to make peat more drought-resilient.

## A beating biorobotic heart aims to better simulate valves

Combining a biological heart and a silicone robotic pump, researchers created a biorobotic heart that beats like a real one, with a focus on a valve on the left side of the heart. The heart valve simulator can mimic the structure, function, and motion of a healthy or diseased heart, allowing surgeons and researchers to demonstrate various interventions while collecting real-time data.

## Climate change behind sharp drop in snowpack since 1980s

A new study confirms that spring snowpacks across the Northern Hemisphere have shrunk significantly over the past 40 years due to human-driven climate change, putting hundreds of millions of people worldwide at risk of a water crisis. The Southwestern and Northeastern U.S. saw among the steepest declines, with more than 10% of the spring snowpack lost per decade, which the researchers expect will accelerate with further warming. Many heavily populated snow-dependent watersheds are dangerously near what they call a 'snow-loss cliff,' wherein once average winter temperatures exceed 17 degrees Fahrenheit, snow loss accelerates even with only modest increases in temperature.

## Iron influences plant immunity and may promote resiliency against climate change

Researchers discovered that plants manage iron deficiency without helping 'bad' bacteria thrive by eliminating the molecular signal for iron deficiency, and that the iron deficiency signaling pathway and the plant immune system are deeply intertwined. Their findings provide a new target for boosting plant resilience in the face of climate change, and offer new insight into plant and animal microbiomes.

## The extinction of the giant ape: Long-standing mystery solved

The largest ever primate Gigantopithecus blacki went extinct when other Asian great apes were thriving, and its demise has long been a mystery. A massive regional study of 22 caves in southern China explores a species on the brink of extinction between 295,000 and 215,000 years ago. As the environment became more seasonal, forest plant communities changed Primates such as orangutans adapted their eating habits and behaviors in response but G. blacki showed signs of stress, struggled to adapt and their numbers dwindled.

## The reaction mechanism for catalytic ammonia production experimentally determined

Researchers have now been able to study the surface of iron and ruthenium catalysts when ammonia is formed from nitrogen and hydrogen. A better knowledge of the catalytic process and the possibility of finding even more efficient materials opens the door for a green transition in the currently very CO2-intensive chemical industry.

## Ancient DNA reveals reason for high multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's rates in Europe

Researchers have created the world's largest ancient human gene bank by analyzing the bones and teeth of almost 5,000 humans who lived across western Europe and Asia up to 34,000 years ago. By sequencing ancient human DNA and comparing it to modern-day samples, the international team of experts mapped the historical spread of genes -- and diseases -- over time as populations migrated. They found: The startling origins of neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis; why northern Europeans today are taller than people from southern Europe; and how major migration around 5,000 years ago introduced risk genes into the population in north-western Europe -- leaving a legacy of higher rates of MS today.

Be fast, avoid light, and roll through a curvy ramp: This is the recipe for a pioneering experiment proposed by theoretical physicists. An object evolving in a potential created through electrostatic or magnetic forces is expected to rapidly and reliably generate a macroscopic quantum superposition state.
