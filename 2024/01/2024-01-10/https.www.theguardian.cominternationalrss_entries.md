<p>This seven-part series based on the bestseller is impressive, following a young boy who must navigate 1980s Brisbane’s criminal world</p><p></p><p>Netflix’s seven-part adaptation of Trent Dalton’s acclaimed novel Boy Swallows Universe has a wonderful kind of tonal elasticity, stretching from despair to happiness in a heartbeat. Its directors Bharat Nalluri, Jocelyn Moorhouse and Kim Mordaunt expand a sprawling storyline with the kind of worldbuilding I associate more with video games and fantasy narratives, infusing scuzzy settings with a heightened, almost magical realism, a transcendental energy niggling at the show’s edges.</p><p>Like the book, Boy Swallows Universe is set in lower-class Brisbane circa 1985, a city filled with lowlifes and troublemakers who orbit the life of 13-year-old protagonist Eli (Felix Cameron and then Zac Burgess). They include his mentor, Slim (Bryan Brown), his dad, Robert (Simon Baker), his mother, Frances (Phoebe Tonkin) and her boyfriend, Lyle (Tra

Watching for the first time one assumes, much like the Bills defenders and the entire refereeing crew, that the laws of physics simply do not allow Sutton to make the catch while still in play.
