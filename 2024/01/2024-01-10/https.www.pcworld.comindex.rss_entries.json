The simplest is to set up a shared workgroup, a kind of team of computers with equal rights. The workgroup in Windows 11 connects the participating devices so that the computers within the network can see each other. This is based on file and printer sharing, which enables the PCs in the workgroup to exchange Office documents, images, music, videos and so on at file level. To make the basic settings and set up a workgroup in Windows 11, follow these instructions. Once the workgroup network is set up, use network shares to share individual documents or entire folders on the hard drive with the other computers in the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"adding-windows-11-to-the-network\">Adding Windows 11 to the network</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Windows 11 network based on a workgroup requires", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2191054/windows-11-how-to-set-up-a-network.html", "date_published": "2024-01-10T10:30:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
