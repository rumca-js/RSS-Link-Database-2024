<p>For the past eight years, Will Ospreay has performed with New Japan Pro Wrestling, becoming one of its biggest stars and even one of its former World Champions. Early in his New Japan tenure, the performer appeared under the moniker the "Aerial Assassin," complete with gear inspired by Assassin's Creed protagonist Ezio. Now, as he wraps up his time in NJPW, Ospreay revisited his former personality recently with a new elaborate costume inspired by Assassin's Creed Syndicate's Jacob Frye during his marquee match at Wrestle Kingdom.</p><p>The outfit was complete with a top hat and hidden blade on display. It was more than that, though, as even the game's theme music blasted through Japan's iconic Tokyo Dome, before switching to Ospreay's traditional theme "Elevate."</p><p>Talking to GameSpot, Ospreay--soon to be an AEW wrestler once his contract ends in New Japan--revealed that the collaboration was the work of New Japan publicist Farbod Esnaashari and Ubisoft's Chris Navalta.

For the first time in the series, the game launched with cross-play last August, but the team at EA Tiburon noted that the feature wouldn't be there at launch for Franchise mode, though players in other modes like Head to Head and Ultimate Team were able to use it. After some internal testing, the feature launches for all players on those aforementioned platforms today. But there's a catch.</p><p>Franchise cross-play launches in beta, so EA has warned players that they may want to make a new league to use with cross-play, even though existing leagues do work with it right away. That's because, should EA later need to pull the feature temporarily while it's still being optimized, leagues already utilizing cross-play would be unavailable for that time, as noted on the <a href="https://www.ea.c

Developers will be required to disclose how AI is being used in them.</p><p>Steam updated its Content Survey that developers fill out when submitting their games to Steam. In a newly added AI disclosure section, developers are required to describe how AI is being used in both the development and execution of their games.</p><p>The use is separated into two categories: pre-generated and live-generated. Pre-generated AI use refers to content such as art, code, and sound, created with AI tools during development.

Since all developers are beholden to Steam's Distribution Agreement, Valve will also check their games for illegal or infringing content,
