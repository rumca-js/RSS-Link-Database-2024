Well, one paw-som pooch who made a jailbreak may know who the culprit is. </p><p><a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2024/01/08/dog-breaks-loose-kennel-tries-setting-others-free-tempe-rescue/" target="_blank">According to Arizona's Family: </a></p><blockquote>"On a recent night in Tempe, a dog decided to make a daring escape from his kennel at an animal shelter. That is, before the police intervened.<br /><br />It was just after midnight on Nov. 16, 2023, when a dog named King yearned to be free and fill his tummy. Video cameras captured King getting out of the kennel by opening the door with his paw and simply walking out to the office. But not before trying to free up some of his friends (unfortunately, we don’t have a video of King attempting a facility-wide jailbreak.)<br /><br

After watching this video of Vivek, once again owning more reporters, all we know is that someone “is providing the media” with information that reporters then produce for the masses. It is unclear who that “someone” is or how they get said information. </p><p>A State rep named Eddie asked Vivek if he thinks any reporter or national media organization believes the nonsense that has been reported over the past four years. </p><p>“Who here will admit that the Trump-Russia collusion hoax was incorrectly reported?” Vivek asked. </p><p>Reporters had not much of anything to say except that basically “we reported on the facts that were given to us”. </p><p>She meant, “<em>We were just following orders</em>”. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
