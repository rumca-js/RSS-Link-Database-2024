Not content with facing each other three times in three competitions and three weeks, Atlético and Real decided to play half an hour more just for the fun of it, scoring three goals each to take a sixth successive derby knockout tie into extra time. There, a wild, wonderful game was finally finished off when Jan Oblak, the Atlético goalkeeper, up for one last throw of the dice trailing 4-3, instead found himself desperately chasing as Brahim Díaz broke clear and bent the ball into an empty net in the 121st minute to send his teammates streaming on to the pitch and into the final of the Spanish Super Cup.</p><p>It was a fitting finale for a frantic occasion: a game with lots of entertainment and eight goals, two of which were real

ITV drama is a hit-and-miss affair – increasingly the former, but not yet often enough that you can approach an evening’s viewing with unassailable confidence in the investment you are about to make – and the publicity made this one sound like a standard police procedural, with added water.</p><p>My hopes do not noticeably rise in the opening scenes, which does indeed contain a lot of added water as a river bursts its banks and floods the nearby town. The local police leap into action. “Let’s do all we can to help,” says their sergeant (Nicholas Gleaves), which makes you fear for the script and the townspeople’s chances of survival.

<p>Eintracht Frankfurt forward hopes to deliver for the Pharaohs, who have  struggled for goals at the Africa Cup of Nations</p><p>Egypt’s period of success during the late 2000s at the Africa Cup of Nations can be defined by forward-thinking attackers who seemed to only have one instruction on their mind when taking the pitch: go for goal. In 2006, the duo of Ahmed Hassan and Emad Moteab scored eight of Egypt’s 12 goals. Two years later the triumvirate of Hosny Abd Rabo, Mohamed Aboutrika and Amr Zaki netted four each. In 2010, it was Hassan again, alongside super-sub Gedo, who averaged a goal every 35 minutes.</p><p>The country now boasts their best-ever goalscorer in Mohamed Salah. But the mentality has changed somewhat and he has scored only six goals in three Afcon editions, two in each.

The analysis, which looks at positions taken during the war’s first six weeks, does not prove any particular member changed their position because they received pro-Israel campaign donations.

<p>Famous club will hopefully kick on with Riquelme as new president but the women’s game needs much more investment</p><p>Boca Juniors is undoubtably one of the most iconic clubs in South American football, whether on the men’s or the women’s side. Based in Buenos Aires, the women’s team have dominated domestically in the semi-professional era and won their fourth consecutive Argentinian end-of-year title in December.</p><p>However, all is not rosy. There are many challenges for women’s football in Argentina and that ends up having an effect on Boca’s results internationally. “Boca have made history, especially recently,” the Argentinian journalist Sofia Jaimez Bertazzo points out. “The level they have achieved individually and collectively is incredible and is not only reflected in the titles won but also in the players that go abroad from them.” One such example is Yamila Rodríguez, who was signed by the Brazilian side Palmeiras after the two clubs had played in the Libertadores f

Formerly an adviser to John McDonnell when he was Labour shadow chancellor, Meadway has plenty to say about what mainstream economics gets wrong. But one of his central gripes is the way it treats the environment. “We cannot simply pretend that … the entire ecological crisis is a separate and distinct thing from what’s happening in the economy,” says Meadway, who now works on climate finance. And yet that is precisely what happens.</p><p>This critique informs the podcast, Macrodose, which Meadway presents and which has recently turned one year old. Its tagline is “Your weekly fix of climate economics”. Every Wednesday, in 15 minutes or so, Meadway analyses the key economic stories of the week.

<p>An aspiring Dutch writer discusses love, loss and philosophy in this sweetly questioning coming-of-age novel</p><p>“When you travel <em>as a girl, </em>you don’t learn anything about the world. All you learn is that there’s a way of looking at the world that doesn’t belong to you,” says&nbsp;twentysomething protagonist Sofie Lakmaker, who shares a surname and major biographical details with her author. She is recalling a trip around Europe she made at 18, with the possibility of danger at every corner: “At every hostel I stayed in I&nbsp;made sure to get a top bunk just so I&nbsp;could keep a lookout.” There’s the abjection that comes with having less power. “There were a lot of men who tried to kiss me on that trip. It was nuts.” As for the prospect of finding deliverance? Forget it. “You can race around the world searching for meaning and look for words that capture that meaning. But you won’t find anything.”</p><p>For Sofie, such passivity is a constant feature of being alive.

Sources at the organisation insist Slumbers always intended to stay in post for between five and 10 years but there had been no indication the Englishman was about to depart St Andrews.

That’s how close the Detroit Pistons were to a championship in Game 6 of the 1988 NBA finals. Leading by one point over the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, Detroit had possession. Then momentum shifted: A referee made a much-discussed foul call on the Pistons’ controversial center, Bill Laimbeer. The decision put Lakers star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at the line; he made both free throws. LA went on to win, then prevailed in a similarly dramatic Game 7 for the title.</p><p>This is a pivotal moment from a new book by Rich Cohen called When the Game Was War: The NBA’s Greatest Season.

He has seemingly been at the top of the game for decades, an elite Swiss-army knife of a player that has been operating at either full-back, central midfield or any of the inverted libero, withdrawn raumdeuter positions that seem to be in vogue these days. He’s just a very, very good footballer, and Bayern would be mad to lose him, but lose him they might. It all feels a little bit Toni Kroos.</p><p>Kimmich’s contract expires in 2025, and could be available for a cut-price deal either this January or in the summer. Pep Guardiola is a long admirer of the German, having managed him at Bayern 2015-2016 and the feeling is mutual: Kimmich called playing under Pep “an incredible experience”. So Manchester City are keen but so are PSG, who could do with the maturity, talent, poise and pausa of Kimmich in their midfield. It should be an almighty scramble to get his

<p>Shere Hite was a trailblazing sex educator who was pilloried for her work in the 1970s. This vivid documentary gives her the recognition she deserves</p><p>Here’s a documentary about a vanished woman that is not true crime (unless crimes against feminism count). It is about trailblazing American sex researcher Shere Hite, exploring how she disappeared from the who’s who of 20th-century feminists. In 1976, Hite became famous almost overnight with the publication of her groundbreaking book The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality. Based on an anonymous survey of 3,000 women about their sex lives, it sold 48m copies. Hite’s big finding was that 70% of women didn’t orgasm from penetrative sex – breaking news in the late 1970s.</p><p>Hite had been working as a model to pay her way as a PhD student when she joined New York’s feminist movement. The tipping point came when she appeared in a sexist typewriter advert (caption: “The typewriter so smart she doesn’t have to be”)

<p>A pandemic of Marvel fatigue is sweeping the globe. But this gnarly series about a young, deaf amputee assassin has some of the best action scenes in the entire multiverse – and it may just help save the day</p><p>The line between super-heroism and super-villainy is in the eye of the beholder. Not everyone would agree with the moral imperatives of a masked billionaire tackling street crime (Batman), a Holocaust survivor fighting for equal rights (Magneto) or an alien committed to “truth, justice and the American way” (Superman). So, while Echo (Alaqua Cox) was a villain in 2021’s Hawkeye, her transition from antagonist to protagonist is wholly persuasive, particularly since dead family member(s) are the core motive in these hero/villain origin stories.</p><p>Hawkeye, based around Jeremy Renner’s bow-wielding vigilante, surpassed (admittedly rock bottom) expectations with a fun, self-contained story that saw everyone’s least favourite Avenger battle Kingpin and make it home in time

Beth Steel’s Till the Stars Come Down, at the Dorfman, makes us witnesses of working-class Sylvia’s wedding to her Polish groom: an event that reveals the rancour lurking beneath the surface of a boisterous family get-together. When one of the characters says “It wouldn’t be much of a wedding without a punch-up” it set me thinking how rarely, in the theatre, people get happily spliced. I have come up with five plays

<p>The Canadian author explores her sister’s schizophrenia and the loss of her mother in a compelling trilogy of essays</p><p>When someone you love takes their own life, guilt is unavoidable; when they hold you responsible, guilt is off the scale. The sister of Canadian novelist Martha Baillie, Christina, killed herself at 61. On the wall, in blue marker, she’d written three reasons for wanting to die: “Because of schizophrenia / Because of The Juniper Tree / Because of losing the house”. The schizophrenia went a long way back; she’d first attempted suicide in her 20s. By “The Juniper Tree” she meant a Brothers Grimm fairytale in which a child is killed by one parent and fed in a stew to the other, much as Christina felt she had been, believing herself to be a victim of domestic abuse. But it was the third reason that weighed on Martha, who’d been the one keen to sell the family house in Toronto, despite Christina telling her, in front of a psychiatrist: “If I’m forced to leave the h

In Wild Houses we see for the first time Barrett’s evident abilities playing themselves out across the wider horizons

<p>Ziad, a 35-year-old Palestinian, tells of the struggle to look after a stray cat; helping a homeless family find somewhere to stay; and seeing the tragedy behind a funny story</p><p><strong>5am</strong> A beautiful bond was created between Hope, the cat we rescued from the street, and our own little cat. But the term “little cat” does not apply any more because she has grown and looks huge compared with Hope. She became like a mother to him: she cleans him, they play together and sleep next to each other. When she sits, he looks at her tail, takes the ready position and then attacks. He loves to wrestle with her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/10/gaza-diary-part-40-i-hate-darkness-because-it-intensifies-the-despair">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It is wise to be patient in a political culture that treats even dysfunctional Conservative rule as a benchmark of credibility </p><p>Britain is a country that tends to elect Conservative governments, while trending towards Labour. There is a tension in that condition, making the political weather unpredictable. Or rather, the unfamiliar climate provokes doubts in the polling forecast: a hard anti-Tory rain, followed by a spell of Keir Starmer in Downing Street.
