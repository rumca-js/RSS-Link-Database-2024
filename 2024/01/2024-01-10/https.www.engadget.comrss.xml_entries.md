<p>Fortnite players in the US who believe they were charged for unwanted purchases during gameplay can request a refund via the Federal Trade Commission through the end of February. The claims process, which was previously set to end in January of this year, was initiated in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-starts-claims-process-for-fortnite-players-tricked-into-making-unwanted-purchases-201534338.html"><ins>September of 2023</ins></a> after the regulatory agency finalized a settlement against Epic Games.

<p>A busy, stimulating convention like CES can exacerbate hand tremors for those living with Parkinsons. For Roberta Wilson-Garrett, however, a new wearable device has been helping keep the tremors at bay. Wilson-Garrett has been using the GyroGlove, which launched here <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-live-latest-tech-debuts-weird-gadgets-and-everything-else-from-the-las-vegas-show-floor-000021384.html">at CES 2024</a>. It's a hand-stabilizing glove designed to "counteract hand tremors by utilizing advanced gyroscopic technology," giving wearers more control over their mobility.</p>
<p>In the few days she has been wearing the GyroGlove, Wilson-Garrett says she's been able to perform certain tasks more easily. Things like buttoning up a shirt, moving a cup of coffee around or writing down a note had become easier with the device. One morning, she had forgotten that she didn't have the glove on and grabbed her coffee, only for her hand to shake and and the drink to spill ove

<p>While MEMS drivers may be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/could-mems-be-the-next-big-leap-in-headphone-technology-173034402.html">the next big thing</a> in true wireless earbuds, the first models with the solid-state components still require a hybrid setup. These products pair a MEMS speaker with a dynamic driver to ensure proper bass performance. The current-gen driver from xMEMS, a California-based company that develops the audio components, is called Cowell and it's already available in earbuds from the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-first-affordable-headphones-with-mems-drivers-review-161536317.html">Creative</a> and <a href="https://nobleaudio.com/">Noble Audio</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next-gen MEMS driver <a href="https://xmems.com/news/xmems-new-silicon-speaker/">is called Cypress</a>, and while it won't arrive in new products until 2025, I got a change to hear the difference been it and Cowell at CES 2024 — and it's quite striking. With Cowell, there's  bass

What is new, however, is the car's ability to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-drove-its-afeela-ev-onto-the-ces-stage-using-a-playstation-controller-014403857.html">driven around with a PlayStation controller</a>.

<p>When I’m away from home and don’t have access to my big desktop displays, it feels like I’m missing a limb. Unfortunately, there’s a limit to how big a portable monitor can really be. After a certain point, it’s not going to fit in a reasonably sized bag. ASUS’s ZenScreen Fold solves that problem through the use of a bendy OLED panel.</p>
<p>Measuring 17.3 inches across, the ZenScreen Fold is still a far cry from the 27-inch monitors I have at home, but it’s a huge step up from typical 14 or 15-inch portable displays. And thanks to the fact that you can bend it in half, it can collapse down to something not much larger than a hardcover book and just 0.38 inches thick. Though it is a bit heavier at two and a half pounds. It also comes with a handy travel case and, because its display is protected when closed, you should be able to toss it in a bag without worrying about damaging its soft plastic panel.</p>

<p>The best part about CES 2024 has been all of the cool product announcements. Many of these products are early in development, so not available for purchase. Some, however, are already on store shelves, allowing tech-crazed consumers to see what all the fuss is about. Here are some of the niftier items displayed at this year’s CES that are ready, willing and able to empty your bank account.

<p>LG Display came to CES 2024 with something to prove. Its showroom in Las Vegas had transparent OLEDs, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-display-plans-to-debut-an-ultra-fast-480hz-oled-panel-for-gaming-at-ces-010059437.html">480Hz gaming monitor</a> and the company's most advanced OLED panels yet, featuring its META technology 2.0. While it sounds like promotional fluff (and there is some of that), LG Display is trying to address arguably OLED’s biggest weakness in the face of ever-improving LEDs, MicroLEDs and the rest. Using advanced microlens arrays (now called MLA+) and new algorithms, LG Display says it’s made an OLED 42 percent brighter than the displays that came before it.</p>

<p>There’s a fact, discovered by Scientific American and popularized by Steve Jobs, that a human on a bike is the most efficient animal on Earth. Shift Robotics, a startup spun out of Carnegie Mellon, is hoping to disrupt that wisdom with its Moonwalkers, shoes with built-in wheels that speed up human walking. The company rocked up at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-what-we-expect-in-las-vegas-this-year-140040145.html">CES 2024</a> in Las Vegas with the existing Moonwalkers and its new model, the Moonwalkers X, for us to have a play with.</p>

<p>Essentially they’re shoes that, when your foot strikes the ground, spin their wheels to push you a little further forward. Each step only offers a small extra distance but the cumulative effect can make your journey up to three times faster. The battery should give you around 7 miles of range, after which point you’ll have to grab a USB-C cable and wait 1.5 hours to recharge. And, i

<p>Hopkins didn’t give an exact number, but did note that “several hundred” employees would be given walking papers and that most American workers will know by the end of the day, with global employees following suit by the end of the week.

To start with, it's updating its content survey form for developers so that they can give the company a description of how they use artificial intelligence in their games. If they used AI tools to generate art, code, sound or any other kind of content for their title, developers must ensure that they do not include anything illegal or anything that infringes on someone else's copyright.  Valve says it will evaluate each game and check if the developer has submitted truthful information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For live-generated AI content, developers have to tell the company what kind of guardrails they've put up to prevent their games from creating anything considered illegal. And since Valve will not be able to review all content games create in real time, i

<p>Clicks’ design couldn’t be simpler. It’s a silicone case (Clicks’ website actually says it’s Liquid Silicon, but I think that’s a typo) with a physical keyboard bolted on the bottom. There’s a small vegan leather accent on the back, little bumps to accommodate buttons and switches, and a passthrough connector at the bottom (either Lightning or USB-C depe

## New Department of Labor rule could reclassify countless gig workers as employees

<p>The US Department of Labor (DOL) <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20240109-1">published</a> a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-00067.pdf">final rule</a> to the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-00067/employee-or-independent-contractor-classification-under-the-fair-labor-standards-act">Federal Register</a> on Wednesday that would increase the difficulty of classifying workers as independent contractors. If the rule survives court challenges unscathed, it will replace a business-friendly Trump-era regulation that did the opposite. It’s scheduled to go into effect on March 11.</p>
<p>The new rule, first proposed in 2022, could have profound implications for companies like Uber and DoorDash that rely heavily on gig workers. It would mandate that workers who are “economically dependent” on a company be considered employees.</p>

## We tried meat from the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker, and it was delicious

<p>My experience with smoking meat has been entirely outdoors, using a mix of grills that burn charcoal, wood or pellets. Not everyone has the space for one of those setups, but thanks to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ge-profile-smart-indoor-smoker-150044423.html">GE Appliances' latest device</a>, you can bring the barbecue indoors. Plus, you don't even have to been there while it's cooking. At the company's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-what-we-expect-in-las-vegas-this-year-140040145.html">CES 2024</a> booth in Las Vegas, I finally got a taste of that the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker is capable of cooking.</p>
<p>Lousiville-based chef and Food Network Chopped champion Dallas McGarity is with GE Appliances at CES this week. He explained that he's been using the Smart Indoor Smoker in his restaurant for infusing flavor in everything from spices to cheese and deviled eggs. Of course, when most people think of smoking foods, they think of meat. McGarity prepared a one

<p>Taylor Swift is not giving out free Le Creuset products in social media advertisements — though deepfakes of her voice would like you to believe otherwise. A series of posts have recently surfaced on TikTok and in Meta's Ad Library claiming to show Swift offering free Le Creuset cookware sets, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/technology/taylor-swift-le-creuset-ai-deepfake.html">the <em>New York Times</em> reports</a>. The ads featured clips where Swift was near <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-28-star-wars-le-creuset-cookware-hands-on.html">Le Creuset products</a> and used a synthetic version of her voice. The scammers used AI to have the cloned voice address her fans, "Swifties," and produce other little remarks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These posts led interested parties to fake versions of sites like The Food Network with made-up articles and testimonials about Le Creuset. Shoppers were then asked just to provide the $9.96 for shipping to get t

<p>The first unofficial day of CES 2024 has come and gone and it feels like we’ve been run over by a giant metaphorical eighteen-wheeler full of press conferences. From home robots to electric vehicles to AI, laptops and processors, there was news from pretty much all areas of tech. There were pleasant surprises like Samsung’s cute new Ballie robot ball and Sony’s spatial content creation headset, and intriguing concepts like Razer’s vibrating cushion for gamers. We also got exactly what we expected in the form of new processors from the likes of AMD, Intel and NVIDIA, as well as the subsequent flood of laptops carrying the just-announced chips for 2024.</p>
<p>And for everyone else, this CES also saw the launch of things like headphones, electric vehicles, gaming handhelds, grills, gaming phones, e-ink tablets, strange hybrid devices, noise-suppressing masks, standing desks and more. It’s a free for all and we’re nowhere near done. Here’s just a small selection of the biggest news o

<p>TikTok recently pulled a tool that allowed researchers and others to study the popularity of hashtags on its app. The change, first <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/08/business/media/tiktok-data-tool-israel-hamas-war.html"><ins>reported by</ins></a> <em>The New York Time</em>s, came shortly after researchers published a report using data from the tool that criticized the company.</p>
<p>As <em>The New York Times</em> points out, the tool was one of the few publicly-accessible methods of tracking details about the popularity of specific hashtags. TikTok, like other social media companies, has made it difficult for outsiders to track how content spreads in its app.</p>

<p>If there’s a problem with the world of ambient computing we’re all expected to live in, it’s that you can’t really be discreet. Most commands to your voice assistant of choice have to be spoken at a volume slightly higher than you would speak to another person. That’s the societal ill VTouch, a South Korean company, has chosen to tackle with its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231211367576/en/VTouch-to-Showcase-the-World%E2%80%99s-First-Whispering-AI-Ring-and-Holo-Button-at-CES-2024">WHSP Ring</a>. It’s a ring with a proximity sensor and microphone that activates when you raise it to your mouth. So when you want to talk to your assistant, you can simply mutter toward your knuckle and have it understand you.</p>
<div id="b20b67445af74d3aaca88408f4760f13"></div>
<p>The idea is that you’ll utilize VTouch’s own app, which will offer a number of AI assistants to aid you. This includes, in the example shown to me, an AI Art Curator or even a digital Psychiatrist, all o

<p>Yes, you probably already have a virtual assistant in your pocket on your phone. Heck, if you're reading Engadget, I'm willing to bet you've got at least one smart speaker floating around your home as well that you can ask to complete basic tasks. But a new start up called <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/">Rabbit</a> seems to think these are less than ideal implementations of AI (if you can really call Siri and Alexa that). It envisions a world where you trade apps for conversation and, rather than a distracting device shoving icons in your face, you interact with what amounts to a walkie-talkie for an AI.</p>
<p>The R1 is the first device to be launched by Rabbit and it's an objectively adorable little square in an endearingly bright shade of orange. Even if you're not sold on the necessity of a dedicated gadget for a virtual assistant, it's hard to deny the aesthetic appeal, which comes courtesy of the design gurus at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineerings-ko-ii
