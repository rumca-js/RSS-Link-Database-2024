(REVIEW)", "description": "The Metal Gear Solid series continues to be one of the most respected and revered action-adventure franchises of all time, and a lot of that could be credited to the spectacular gameplay and thought-provoking narratives found in each new entry. \n\nThe original Metal Gear Solid was an important milestone in skyrocketing stealth action to the mainstream, and Konami tried to modernize the classic with the release of Twin Snakes on the GameCube. \n\nThe game was met with a divisive critical reception for a wide array of reasons, and with this video we will be revisiting this remake to see how those criticisms have aged. Is Twin Snakes actually that bad, or is it is a misunderstood masterpiece? We break down each and every aspect of the game, see how it holds up in 2024, and finally assess it as a whole with proper scoring.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyvMIl5AP-o", "date_published": "2024-01-10T17:30:03+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/GyvMIl5AP-o/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Tekken 8 vs. Tekken 7 - 15 BIGGEST DIFFERENCES", "description": "It's been almost seven years since the launch of Tekken 7 on consoles, and Bandai Namco is finally delivering a sequel.
