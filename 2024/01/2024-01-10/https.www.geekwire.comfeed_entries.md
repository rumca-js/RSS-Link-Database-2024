But the proposed size of the group, 42 members, was perhaps the biggest conundrum to emerge from the hearing Wednesday morning before the Senate Environment, Energy &#38; Technology committee in Olympia. &#8220;We still think this is a very large task force,&#8221; testified Bob Battles of the Association of Washington Business,&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/can-a-42-member-ai-task-force-get-anything-done-hearing-raises-questions-about-wash-state-plan/">Read Mo

Twitch, the industry-leading livestreaming platform Amazon acquired in 2014, is cutting more than 500 jobs. In a memo to employees shared on the company&#8217;s blog, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy said the company has been cutting costs over the last year — including a separate round of layoffs in March — but &#8220;it has become clear that our organization is still meaningfully larger than it needs to be given the size of our business.&#8221; &#8220;As with many other companies in the tech space, we are now sizing our organization based upon the current scale of our business&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazons-twitch-prime-video-mgm-studios-units-lay-off-hundreds/">Read More</a>

The Pittsburgh-based company said there was no indication that the leak occurred as the result of the lander&#8217;s launch by United Launch Alliance. ULA&#8217;s Vulcan Centaur rocket made its first liftoff over the weekend with the aid of BE-4 engines provided by Jeff Bezos&#8217; Blue Origin space venture. The Astrobotic team&#8217;s working theory is that a valve between the propulsion system&#8217;s oxidizer and a store of helium&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/astrobotic-no-moon-landing/">Read More</a>
