Tallahassee, Fla. State Surgeon General Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo

The Surgeon General outlined concerns regarding nucleic acid contaminants

Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, 

Lipid nanoparticles ….  may therefore be an equally efficient vehicle for delivering contaminant DNA into human cells. 

The presence of SV40 promoter/enhancer DNA may also pose a unique and heightened risk of DNA integration into human cells.

2007, FDA published guidance on regulatory limits for DNA vaccines

In this Guidance for Industry, the FDA outlines important considerations for vaccines that use novel methods of delivery regarding DNA integration, specifically:

• DNA integration could theoretically impact a human’s oncogenes

• DNA integration may result in chromosomal
