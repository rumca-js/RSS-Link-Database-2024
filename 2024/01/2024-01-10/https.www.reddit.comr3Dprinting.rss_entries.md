My TV stand has had a piece sagging on the bottom for months. I remember finding the part and not knowing what it went to but by the time I realized what it was to I couldn’t find the piece. My wife tried taping it up but my puppy has eaten the tape a couple of times🤦‍♂️ so I got fed up enough that I designed this. It took about an hour with sketchup and printed it. I’m honestly a little amazed it worked, but it fits great and tightened up just like the original. </p> <p>Link to model if you ever need it: <a hr
