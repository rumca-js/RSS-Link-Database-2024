Cast your mind back to May last year and you might remember EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-players-can-now-vote-on-the-themes-for-its-next-few-kit-expansions">canvassing The Sims 4 players</a> to see if they'd prefer to see the game receive a Medieval Castle or High Tech Futurism themed building pack at some nebulous future point. Well, Medieval Castle (wrongly) won the vote, and some eight months later it looks like the DLC is ready for an imminent release.
</p><p>
That's according to a presumably premature reveal on the EA App (as <a href="https://simscommunity.info/2024/01/10/sims-4-castle-estate-leak/">spotted by Sims 4 fan site SimsCommunity</a>), which provides full details and screenshots of the The Sims 4 Castle Estate Kit, as the new DLC is officially known, alongside a release date of 15th Octob

With the launch of last year's Forza Motorsport - and an initial flurry of patches and fixes - behind it, developer Turn 10 Studios has confirmed its next steps for the racer will be to address three key community concerns over the "coming months".
</p><p>
"While we have been heads down adding cars, tracks, patches, and other improvements," the studio wrote in the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-community-update-3">first of a series of planned quarterly development updates</a> on its website, "we want to acknowledge the top three areas of feedback we haven't addressed directly".
</p><p>
Those areas, specifically, are driver AI, car progression, and race regulations, and it sounds like fixing AI issues - which, as per Turn 10's update, include "abruptly braking and slowing down; not accelerating o

Mojang and developer Blackbird Interactive have officially brought development on Minecraft Legends to a end today with one final content update, wrapping up a little under nine months of post-launch support for the real-time strategy spin-off.
</p><p>
Released back in May last year, Minecraft Legends unfortunately didn't especially impress, proving to be a decidedly average RTS that failed to do much to justify its use of the Minecraft licence. "It feels too overwhelming and poorly explained for kids," Eurogamer contributor Caelyn Ellis <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-legends-review-a-messy-spinoff-that-misses-the-point-of-minecraft">wrote in her review</a>, "too rudimentary for older players and too frustrating for both.

In the game, Jesse is a Jackson resident and a friend of Ellie's.

Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is available for both PS4 and PS5 (the PS4 version is also streamable), giving PlayStation Plus subscribers the chance to sample Gearbox's well-received tabletop RPG spin on its raucous shooter series. As for Capcom's Resident Evil 2 remake, also available for both PS4 and PS5, it gives the 1998 classic a thorough modernising with splashy new presentation and ample mechanical t

Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 to get us up to speed on what has happened in the series so far. It is a fairly standard marketing beat, with others such as Insomniac and Nintendo doing the same thing for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-story-recap-trailer-will-get-you-up-to-speed">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prepare-for-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-by-catching-up-on-breath-of-the-wilds-story-in-under-seven-minutes">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> respectively.

Actor's union SAG-AFTRA has introduced a "groundbreaking" AI voice agreement to allow voice artists to "safely explore" opportunities for their digital voice replicas, sparking concern among a number of actors.
</p><p>
The agreement is in conjunction with AI voice technology company Replica Studios, and will allow game studios to work with Replica to access SAG-AFTRA talent under a "fair, ethical agreement to safely create and licence a digital replica of their voice".
</p><p>
A press release from the union states the agreement has been approved by affected members. It establishes minimum terms and conditions, ensures performer consent and negotiation for AI usage, and requires performers have the opportunity to opt out of AI use in new works.
