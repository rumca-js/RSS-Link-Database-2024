		A team of academic researchers has <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308573">developed</a> the Dynamic Point-Pixel Feature Alignment network, known as DPPFA-Net, to address the issue of accurately detecting small objects for robots and autonomous vehicles. When compared to other existing 3D object detection methods, this model demonstrated a significant improvement in average precision, achieving a 7.18 percent increase across various noise conditions.

Auto makers have been adding face biometrics to vehicles like the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/automotive-biometrics-developers-show-work-with-many-modalities">Genesis GV60</a> for <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202401/automotive-biometrics-turned-inside-out-at-ces-with-

		Germany’s government body for assessing the suitability of age assurance technologies has approved <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idnow">IDNow</a>’s suite of automated identity check software, IDCheck.io, for compliant online age verification.

IDnow.io passed a legal and security compliance assessment by the Commission for the Protection of Minors (KJM). The German Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Minors in the Media stipulates that online videos, games, as well as gambling and pornography sites that are rated “adults only” must use age verification systems <a href="https://www.kjm-online.de/en/supervision/technical-protection-of-minors-in-the-media/offerings-impairing-development">approved by KJM</a>.

		Lawmakers in the U.S. state of Kentucky are considering a pair of bills intended to protect residents' biometric identifiers from perceived misuse by state and local agencies and businesses.

Both, now in committee, are forming in the state's lower house, which at the moment is largely controlled by politicians currying favor with anti-establishment voters.

The first, <a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/recorddocuments/bill/24RS/hb45/orig_bill.pdf">House Bill 45</a>, would restrict how agencies automatically collect and use face and other biometric identifiers as well as objects like license plate data.

		Biometric zero-knowledge proof authentication tool ZeroFace from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/zerobiometrics">ZeroBiometrics</a> has been integrated by Web3.0 insurance platform <a href="https://daybyday.io/">Day By Day</a> to protect it from fraud.

The implementation matches cryptographic hash values for registered users without storing traditional facial recognition data, according to the announcement. The result, the partners say, is privacy-preserving authentication security across all platforms that makes it practically impossible for malicious actors to compromise accounts or user data.

The mobile device-based biometric authentication process for users to register an asset or access protection is carried out wi

		A data leak from Iranian crypto exchange bit24.cash has exposed personal data from nearly 230,000 Iranian citizens, according to <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/iranian-crypto-exchange-leaks-passports/">Cybernews</a>.

Iran has taken up cryptocurrency significantly due to limited access to foreign markets. In 2023, Iranian crypto exchanges saw almost $3 billion in transactions.

Bit24.cash supports over 300 coins and tokens. Users complete a KYC process where they confirm their identity by uploading identity documents.

Cybernews researchers found a misconfigured MinIO that granted access to S3 buckets containing users' KYC data. MinIO is an S3 compatible object storage system for large scale machine learning and data workloads.

		Some U.S. states, like Maryland, have rushed to set up mobile driver license, but far from all 50 see the need to bring one out.

Indiana, in the middle of the nation, is one of the latter.

A local TV news show has <a href="https://fox59.com/indianapolitics/why-are-indiana-digital-drivers-licenses-still-not-available-after-4-years/">found</a> that although enacting legislation for a mobile license was signed in 2019, no document is expected soon.

		A report recently released by Kenya’s Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha, has unveiled extensive fraud within the country’s National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) scheme perpetrated partly by the use of biometrics.

According to the report, the fraud, which has cost the Kenyan government at least Sh20 billion (US$126.4 million) in losses, was carried out by several health facilities, some of which have now been asked to repay the money they are accused of making the government lose, Standard <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001488407/sh20b-nhif-scam-exposed-amid-medics-strike-threat">reports</a>.

		American biotech company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/thermo-fisher-scientific">Thermo Fisher</a> will no longer sell its DNA identification kits and equipment in Tibet in response to human rights concerns with China's use of biometric surveillance in the area, according to <a href="https://theworld.org/media/2024-01-08/american-dna-test-supplier-ends-sales-tibet-over-human-rights-concerns"><em>The World</em></a>. The restriction does not extend to all of China.

Over the past six years, China has collected 900,000 to 1.2 million DNA samples from Tibetan adults and children – enough to make up one third of the region's population.
