I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of london, England in 1924, You can clearly see who is passing by in daylight, Tower Bridge, Westminster Parliament, Westminster Quarter, St. Paul's Streets, Tower of London, Trafalgar Square, Picadilly Circus, Cenotaph on Whitehall, Horse Guards, Tower of London

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
