I have more of the same filament, but I have auto bed leveling enabled on this print and because of that if i try to edit the gcode and resume the print I dont think it would be properly calibrated when trying to print on top of the old model. I could split it into two and try to put it together but id rather it be one singular print. How should I go about this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MentalRock1"> /u/MentalRock1 </a> <br /> <span><a href="h
