## João Pedro hits hat-trick as Brighton beat Sheffield United in goal-fest

<p>What an all-action, thrill-a-minute contest this meeting between Sheffield United and Brighton proved. Top billing was shared by João Pedro, whose hat-trick featured two penalties and took his team into Sunday’s fifth-round draw, and the bustling handful named Will Osula, scorer of the Blades’ second and creator of Gustavo Hamer’s first.</p><p>Jayden Bogle, too, had a lead part but in conceding both of the spot-kicks not for a reason he would wish. And while the Blades are eliminated, what is evident is how, since replacing Paul Heckingbottom on 5 December, Chris Wilder has transformed them into a spirited proposition able to come back from 2-0 to 2-2 and remain in the tie even after Pedro’s third, the visitors’ fourth. Danny Welbeck’s added-time strike finally killed them off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/27/sheffield-united-brighton-fa-cup-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The distinction between art and food can be a fine one. Tokyo-based illustrator Takayo Kiyota, AKA Tama-chan, has been crafting miniature masterpieces out of rice and seaweed for 15 years. “I thought, if you could draw freely using the sushi roll technique handed down as a traditional local dish,” she says, “wouldn’t it be possible to create a new form of edible art?” Her creations take many forms, including depictions of famous paintings by Van Gogh, Picasso and Frida Kahlo. “For Japanese people, rice is something familiar and important. People from other countries can draw on paper or canvas, but drawing on rice is an expression unique to Japanese people.” </p><ul><li><em>See more at <a href="http://instagram.com/smilingsushiroll39">instagram.com/smilingsushiroll39</a></em></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2024/jan/27/takayo-kiyota-tama-chan-sushi-edible-art-van-gogh-picasso-frida-kahlo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russian has battled through with positivity but will have to dig even deeper against the man who swatted Djokovic aside</p><p>In the days before the start of Wimbledon in 2019, 256 men and women spent their week battling in the qualifying tournament held on a humble grassy field in Roehampton. Late into the evening during the opening round, a 17-year-old by the name of Jannik Sinner stepped on to the lawn for his first grand slam qualifier.</p><p>For the group of fans and players that stood on the narrow paths each side of the court, it was unforgettable. Sinner spent more than two and a half hours pulverising the ball, winners flying off his racket from all parts of the court as the purity of his ball-striking elicited gasps. But he also provoked a special performance from his journeyman opponent, Alex Bolt of Australia. It was an incredible match and Bolt barely hung on, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/27/tennis-roehampton-despised-by-players-loved-by

<p>The Canadian singer-songwriter has become a voice of his generation with his taut, melodic indie pop fuelled by a turbulent youth</p><p>Be it Joy Division, Nirvana or Phoebe Bridgers, there are certain artists who have captured adolescent melancholy for their generation. Twenty-one-year-old singer-songwriter Ekkstacy (real name Khyree Zienty; known as Stacy) makes that music for his own cohort, offering up sweet, engaging vocals and guitars drenched in heady melodrama and deep feeling.</p><p>As a kid in Vancouver, Zienty grew up on SoundCloud rappers and 2008-era surfer indie (think the Drums, Wavves, Girls etc). In high school, after his parents’ divorce, his first experimentation with drugs led to a psychotic breakdown and a fall from a second-floor window. The subsequent hospitalisation and aftermath left him depressed and anxious, so he began to channel the feelings into his music: woozy, rap-adjacent tracks, dour emo and plush indie pop.</p> <a href="https://www.thegu
