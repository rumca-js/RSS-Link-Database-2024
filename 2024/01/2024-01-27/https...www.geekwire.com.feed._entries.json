Riding a wave of enthusiasm nearly four years ago for its high-performance electric speed boat, the Seattle-based company was poised to get to work filling orders for its proof-of-concept machine: the super-speedy, zero-emissions, carbon fiber Z2R. When COVID-19 hit in 2020, founder Piotr Zin and his dream were deemed non-essential and shut down, and he almost gave up. &#8216;While we may have been on hiatus, we&#8217;ve been learning, we&#8217;ve been building.&#8217; \u2014\u00a0David Donovick, president and COO of Zin Boats Now, with a core team&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/zin-boats-resurfaces-after-the-pandemic-to-put-a-fresh-charge-into-seattles-electric-boating-scene/\">Read More", "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "comments": [], "title": "Zin Boats resurfaces after the pandemic to put a fresh charge into the electric boating scene", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/zin-boats-resurfaces-after-the-pandemic-to-put-a-fresh-charge-into-seattles-electric-boating-scene", "page_rating_visits": 0, "album": "", "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "date_published": "2024-01-27T17:00:00+00:00", "source_obj__id": 338, "bookmarked": false, "page_rating": 0, "dead": false}, {"page_rating_votes": 0, "tags": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "user": null, "artist": null, "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kevin-leneway-1260x945.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Over the holidays, my daughter and I experimented with creating custom nametag stickers for the family members we were traveling with using a cheap portable black-and-white thermal printer and Microsoft&#8217;s Bing AI image generator. When I posted about this on LinkedIn, one of the people who commented was Kevin Leneway, a principal software engineer at the Pioneer Square Labs startup incubator in Seattle, who showed how he used DALL-E-3 (via ChatGPT) to create vivid, colorful illustrated letters to help his daughter learn to read.
