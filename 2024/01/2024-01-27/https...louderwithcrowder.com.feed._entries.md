That statement is true for your average student. But school closures are worse for those who have special needs and need extra attention. So you would think that these people would have learned their lesson and never, ever, do this again. But nope. None of that even matters to the “No Human Is Illegal” mob. </p><p>Staff from a school district in North Carolina tried to secretly close a special education school and turn it into a “resettlement” facility for migrants. It is unclear what such a facility even is, but it is clear that such a building is drastically more important to the superintendent than some of our most vulnerable members of society. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed

Before that, he failed miserably in the guy's competition.</p><p>Because the left runs with the claim that this man is somehow “brave” for being a misogynistic degenerate, he is not backing down. Now he is trying to sue his way into the Olympics as he has filed a lawsuit against World Aquatics. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
