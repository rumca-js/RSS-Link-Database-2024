Random call drops have increased significantly due to the short range of 5G networks. 5G bands, such as mmWave and sub-6GHz, have limited connectivity range compared to 4G bands. As a result, when the 5G signal strength drops, phones automatically switch to 4G networks, causing call drops or muted calls. Telecom service providers like Airtel and Reliance Jio have installed 5G towers, but the network still fluctuates when moving between regions. However, as more 5G networks and towers are installed, this temporary issue will improve. In the meantime, keeping your phone on the 4G network can help with calling and battery life.
