Back when I was a young lad, this magazine called Popular Mechanics posted a timeline for the next 20 years.

With such wacky predictions as “Halo 8” on smartphones and “anti matter” to travel to space it naturally left an impact on my soft skull, to a point where I still remember it today.


I imagine predicting the future is a difficult task, especially when it comes to technology, but at some point you gotta recognize that some predictions were simply bad.
