Riding a wave of enthusiasm nearly four years ago for its high-performance electric speed boat, the Seattle-based company was poised to get to work filling orders for its proof-of-concept machine: the super-speedy, zero-emissions, carbon fiber Z2R.

When I posted about this on LinkedIn, one of the people who commented was Kevin Leneway, a principal software engineer at the Pioneer Square Labs startup incubator in Seattle, who showed how he used DALL-E-3 (via ChatGPT) to create vivid, colorful illustrated letters to help his daughter learn to read.
