That statement is true for your average student. But school closures are worse for those who have special needs and need extra attention. So you would think that these people would have learned their lesson and never, ever, do this again. But nope. None of that even matters to the \u201cNo Human Is Illegal\u201d mob. </p><p>Staff from a school district in North Carolina tried to secretly close a special education school and turn it into a \u201cresettlement\u201d facility for migrants. It is unclear what such a facility even is, but it is clear that such a building is drastically more important to the superintendent than some of our most vulnerable members of society. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed", "permanent": false, "source": "https://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "comments": [], "title": "Superintendent Busted Trying To Secretly Close A School For Special Needs To Turn It Into A Migrant Facility", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mosley-migrant-plan", "page_rating_visits": 0, "album": "", "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=51198789&width=980", "age": null, "date_published": "2024-01-27T12:24:44+00:00", "source_obj__id": 41, "bookmarked": false, "page_rating": 0, "dead": false}, {"page_rating_votes": 0, "tags": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "user": null, "artist": null, "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.webp?id=51198449&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=97%2C0%2C98%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p><a href=\"https://reduxx.info/espn-honors-lia-thomas-in-womens-history-month-segment/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lia Thomas</a>, who used to go by Will, is still trying to be relevant even though he is probably the most disliked male swimmer in history. </p><p>We all know that Thomas put on a female swimsuit one day and stole titles away from women who have been training their whole lives.
