<p>Perhaps in knockout football, nothing ever matters apart from the result. You go through, you go out, the rest is noise. But that is especially true when the tie in question is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/26/cameroons-new-generation-aim-to-create-own-history-against-nigeria">the biggest rivalry</a> in modern sub-Saharan African football.

His debut, <em>If I Survive You</em>, about a second-generation Jamaican in Miami, where Escoffery grew up, was shortlisted for last year’s Booker and is currently on the shortlist of the Gordon Burn prize, announced on 7 March.<strong> </strong>The novelist Rumaan Alam has called it “a reminder of what fiction can do... It’s truly a feat that a book of short stories tackling such big stuff – family, love, violence, race – could be so damn funny.”</p><p><strong>What did it mean to be shortlisted for the Booker prize?</strong><br />It felt like I’d arrived in the UK for the first time, even though the book had been out for months.

<p>Cyriel Dessers again showed his growing importance to Rangers with the only goal in a narrow 1-0 win over St Mirren.</p><p>The 29-year-old striker was not initially a popular figure among the Rangers fans in his early months at Ibrox after his summer move from Cremonese. However, he has slowly worked his way into the supporters’ good books, especially since the arrival of Philippe Clement as manager in October, and he pounced after 14 minutes of the Premiership game in Paisley to score for a third successive match. The crucial strike took his tally to the season to 12 and keeps the Light Blues in pursuit of the league leaders, Celtic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/27/scottish-roundup-rangers-st-mirren-celtic-ross-county-hearts-aberdeen">Continue reading...</a>

Was it when an Indian batter was dismissed first ball? Was it when their opponents’ premier bowler was hauled off after just two overs? Was it when their own batter survived an lbw appeal, or when a misfield gifted them four runs? It was hard to tell, partly because each of these incidents was superficially good for them, causing their fans to celebrate as their team moved ever closer to what still see

<p>After being hunted to near extinction, wolves have returned to Europe. But when one killed Ursula von der Leyen’s family pony, it ignited a high-stakes battle. Are the animals’ days numbered?</p><p>It was a mild, windless night, sometime before dawn on 1 September 2022, when a large grey wolf trotted out of the woods beside Beinhorn, a hamlet of old barns and graceful wooden houses in the German state of Lower Saxony. The keen nose of the male wolf almost certainly scented that Dolly, a pretty chestnut pony with a white patch on her face, was vulnerable. The 30-year-old pony, kept in a paddock close to stables and a farmhouse, was not protected by high-voltage electric fencing designed to deter wolves. It was an easy kill. In the morning, Dolly’s body was found in the long grass; her owners spoke of their “horrible distress”.</p><p>Unluckily for the wolf, and perhaps for the entire wolf population of western Europe, Dolly was a cherished family pet belonging to the preside

Potentially, this is due to its ability to shapeshift and move between herbs and nuts. You can make a great pesto with basil, rocket, coriander or wild garlic, and with walnuts, almonds and even peanuts. Here, I’ve made one using cashews and sun-dried tomatoes alongside basil leaves and nutritional yeast (in place of the traditional parmesan). The butter beans, chard and leeks are merely vehicles, to aid my general pesto intake.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/27/vegan-recipe-beans-greens-tomato-cashew-pesto-butter-beans-and-greens-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>New Forest, Hampshire: </strong>We saw no signs of life today at all, but the ice turned everything into a whole new world</p><p>It was a sunny day, and the sky was blue and clear. It had frozen in the night and there was ice everywhere. My family and I decided to go to the New Forest for a walk with our dog, Jet. The New Forest is home to many animals and a few people too. But on this day, we saw none. We were alone.</p><p>There was a gentle river flowing next to the path. In the river there is normally a water hole that ponies drink from, but not today because it was solid ice, as smooth as glass. I used my foot to break the ice so the ponies, donkeys and pigs could drink. To make sure, I dropped a big sheet of ice on the water hole. The breaking ice sounded like Lego smashing in a room with no furniture. My favourite part of the day was the small puddles – each one was like a little garden frozen in time. The ice was transparent and created a window just for us.

Instead he lashed out at his opponent’s clothes. “When I watched her in the fancy dress that probably wasn’t so fancy, I said, ‘What’s she doing? We won,’” he said of rival Nikki Haley in New Hampshire on Tuesday night.</p><p>Trump had just won the first primary election of 2024 and all but clinched the Republican nomination for US president. Party leaders and campaign surrogates are now eager to banish Haley to irrelevance, move on from the primary and unify against Democrats. They want Trump to pivot to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/trump-biden-2024-election-new-hampshire-primary">an almost inevitable rematch</a> with Democrat Joe Biden in November.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/27/donald-trump-nikki-hale

<p>What happens when you can’t express yourself through speech? The writer<em> </em>on her new book and her own experience of being unable to communicate</p><p>Almost two decades ago, I went to a medical conference to learn about treatment options for my son’s ulcerative colitis. His doctor described an incident involving a non-speaking autistic teenage patient, who everyone assumed couldn’t understand anything. His parents were mystified and frustrated because his repetitive behaviours, including screaming and hitting his head against the wall, were out of control. As they were telling the doctor that his teachers were sure this was a purely behavioural issue, the boy grabbed his sister’s preschool alphabet toy and typed, <em>help&nbsp;me it hurts</em>.</p><p>I immediately teared up and couldn’t stop thinking about it. This is, of course, an emotional story that would affect any person. But it was acute for me, more personal, because of what I had gone through as an immigran

<p>The fast show: Thai-style deep-fried omelette, spicy tofu with broccoli, and sea bass and seaweed spaghetti</p><p>Twenty-nine-, 28-, 18-minute meals: it’s a bold and, in this case, slightly tongue-in-cheek move to set a stopwatch on exactly how long it takes to get dinner on the table. Whatever the precise timing, though, the key to a pretty quick meal, if we can just call it that, is threefold. One: have a few punchy ingredients to hand – sheets of seaweed, hot chilli sauces and quick pickles are all fast ways to get maximum flavour into a meal. Two: choose a main ingredient that cooks really quickly – green veg, pasta and eggs are all your friends here. And three: if you can, always double up on things and roll them into the next meal – quick pickles (again) and spicy peanut oils, for example. Before you know it, some meals are almost going to be making themselves. Meals that actually save you time in the making: now <em>that </em>would<em> </em>be a bold move!</p><p>The

The audacious attempts of Wallace Mercer, the then Heart of Midlothian chairman, to purchase a major shareholding in Hibernian met with shock, vehement opposition and outright hostility. The bid, announced casually in an Edinburgh hotel, was a leading item on the Six O’Clock News on 4&nbsp;June 1990.</p><p>Mercer’s plan was flawed on umpteen levels. Threats to his life and the necessity for 24-hour security around the businessman emphasised that not all of his detractors were rational.

<p>Domestic objects lead to intimate memories and troubled histories in this glorious, genre-bending book</p><p>Spent Light is subtitled “A Book”. It’s not a memoir, but not really autofiction either; life writing, maybe, but the lives in question are&nbsp;not human. Pawson’s writing is&nbsp;prompted by objects usually considered inanimate but made and traded by people in systems that do harm. The book is among them, a physical object, in case you hadn’t noticed. (The book is interested in things you may not have noticed, or&nbsp;may have chosen not to notice.)</p><p>In the opening pages the narrator is&nbsp;given a toaster previously belonging to&nbsp;a deceased neighbour. The toaster is&nbsp;compared to a handbag, with the lights above the controls calling to mind a dog’s nipple “or the trigger pin on an Arma-Lite semi-automatic” or “that inarticulate surge of pleasure when your finger closes in on my clitoris”.
