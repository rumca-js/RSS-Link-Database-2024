In Palworld, it won’t be long before Ingot becomes an essential crafting component. Made from smelting two ore in a furnace, Ingots aren’t necessarily complicated to make, but the amount you’ll need as you get further into Palworld will eventually become overwhelming – that is unless you follow what we’ve done here to make yourself a basic, but effective, ore farm. And in this video, we’ll show you exactly what you need to make it happen.

Production on the Mortal Kombat 2 movie has wrapped, and actor Karl Urban has some words to share with fans. Posting to Instagram with this photo, Urban said, “That’s a picture wrap for me & Johnny Cage on #MortalKombat2 ! Massive thanks to our incredible crew, cast and phenomenal stunt team . Hands down the most action packed fun I’ve ever had on a film ! Can’t wait for y’all to see it .” And looking at the photo, he definitely does resemble his video game counterpart a whole lot more. Karl Urban is set to star as famous movie star Johnny Cage, along with Hiroyuki Sanada reprising his role as Scorpion in the first movie. No word yet on when #MortalKombat 2 is coming to theaters, but we’ll keep you updated. We also have a Lego Movie based on Pharrell Williams’ life,  and we might know who’ll be cast as The Sentry in the upcoming Thunderbolts movie. All this and more in today’s fix.
