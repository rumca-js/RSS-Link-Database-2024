<p>Annapurna is delaying the release of its upcoming narrative adventure game, <em>Open Roads</em>, by a few weeks so the team can do a little more refining. It‚Äôs now scheduled for release on March 28 instead of the originally planned date of February 22. The decision was made to ‚Äúensure the most polished experience for players,‚Äù a spokesperson for Annapurna told Engadget.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Open Roads</em>, which we had a chance to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/open-roads-preview-bring-me-to-life-in-2003-170007873.html"><ins>preview earlier this month</ins></a>, is a nostalgia-heavy experience that follows 16-year-old Tess Devine (voiced by Kaitlyn Dever) and her mother, Opal (Keri Russel), on a road trip to explore their family‚Äôs past. It features hand-drawn animations and, of course, carries the promise of deep, dark family secrets to unearth. It‚Äôll be available for Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>

<p>The original <a href="https://www.embodme.com/erae-touch">Erae Touch</a> was one of the more interesting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mpe/">MPE</a> controllers to come out in the last few years. But it's been on the market for less than three years. So it was something of a surprise when Embodme showed up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/namm-2024/">NAMM 2024</a> with Erae II, the next iteration of its customizable controller with significant upgrades and one unexpected new feature.</p>
<p>Now, it's important to note that the version of the Erae II I was able to test out was very early prototype. There were a few bugs, the construction definitely had some rough edges. But the company has plenty of time to iron those out. The Kickstarter campaign opens on February 15 with an expect ship date sometime in June.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were so close to finally drifting on the cobblestone streets of Yharnam, but it looks like we‚Äôll have to wait a little longer for <em>Bloodborne Kart</em>. And, it‚Äôll be called something else when it does arrive. Lilith Walther, the developer behind the project, said the team has to ‚Äúscrub the branding‚Äù off of the game and delay its release after Sony intervened. It was supposed to be released on January 31 for PC. The outcome isn‚Äôt exactly surprising, but it means the game will take shape a bit differently than planned ‚Äî in a thread posted on <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/b0tster/status/1750995363094511920?s=20">X</a>, Walther said, ‚ÄúThis is a fan game no more!‚Äù</p>

<p>Fossil is officially getting out of the smartwatch business. Following months of speculation about the future of its Wear OS smartwatch lineup, which hasn‚Äôt seen a new model since 2021‚Äôs Gen 6, the company confirmed to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052275/fossil-quitting-smartwatches-android-wear-os"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> on Friday that it‚Äôs abandoning the category altogether. There won‚Äôt be a successor to the Gen 6, but existing Fossil smartwatches will still get updates ‚Äúfor the next few years.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, a spokesperson said Fossil Group has ‚Äúmade the strategic decision to exit the smartwatch business,‚Äù citing the industry‚Äôs evolving landscape. ‚ÄúFossil Group is redirecting resources to support our core strength and the core segments of our business that continue to provide strong growth opportunities for us: designing and distributing exciting traditional watches, jewelry, and leathe

<p>With a healthy dose of heart and whimsy, the Sundance documentary <em>Seeking Mavis Beacon</em> follows two young Black women who are devoted to finding the original model for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavis_Beacon_Teaches_Typing"><em>Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing</em></a>. If you touched a computer during the '80s or '90s, there's a good chance that Mavis helped you get comfortable with a keyboard. Or at the very least, you might remember her from the program's original 1987 cover: a smiling, elegant Black woman dressed in a cream-colored outfit. She embodied style and professional poise ‚Äî it was as if you could be just as capable as her if you bought that program.</p>
<p>It's no spoiler to say that &quot;Mavis Beacon&quot; didn't really exist ‚Äì she was a marketing idea crafted by a group of white dudes from Silicon Valley. But the program's cover star <em>was </em>real: Her name was Renee L'Esperance, a Haitian model who was discovered while working at Saks Fi

<p>In October 2023, 23andMe admitted that it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/23andme-user-data-breached-in-credential-stuffing-attack-231757254.html">suffered a data breach</a> that compromised its users' information. The company has been hit with several lawsuits since then, and according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/business/23andme-hack-data.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, one of them is accusing 23andMe of failing to notify customers that they were specifically targeted for having Chinese and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. They also weren't told that their test results with genetic information had been compiled in curated lists that were then shared on the dark web, the plaintiffs said. 23andMe recently <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-579679">released a copy</a> of the letters it sent to affected customers, and they didn't contain any reference to the users' heritage.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/elevenlabs-is-building-a-universal-ai-dubbing-machine-130053504.html">ElevenLabs</a>, an AI startup that offers voice cloning services with its tools, has banned the user that created an audio deepfake of Joe Biden used in an attempt to disrupt the elections, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-26/ai-startup-elevenlabs-bans-account-blamed-for-biden-audio-deepfake"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The audio impersonating the president was used in a robocall that went out to some voters in New Hampshire last week, telling them not to vote in their state's primary.
