Nothing has been proven yet, but it seemed compelling to me, especially given the safety and simplicity of the treatment (i.e., no drugs, no electrodes, just looking at light and hearing sounds).<p>I wanted to try it myself, but was surprised how hard it was to find something free and easy to use to generate such pulses. Which is odd because I remember some freeware DOS program I tried back in the 90s which did all this kind of stuff (anyone know what I\u2019m talking about? Google fails me\u2026).<p>So anyway, I made this tool in a couple hours and put it up as a public service so that older people can try this treatment now without waiting years for FDA trials to finish and without getting a diagnosis and expensive piece of medical equipment.

distro of your choosing on a Lenovo Chromebook device. I guess the cynic in me expects that companies want you to use whatever OS is bundled with the hardware rather than encouraging users to use the hardware the way they'd like -- or at least that they wouldn't want to make it easy to overwrite the ChromeOS install by providing a helpful how-to!<p>Can anyone think of why Lenovo would do this? I would expect that this would potentially draw the ire of Google, but surely Lenovo has thought this through and maybe knows Google doesn't care enough? Just curious if anyone can speak to Lenovo's incentive calculus here<p>https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/operating-systems/install-linux-chromebook/</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39137451\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39137451</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "page_rating_votes": 0, "language": "en", "tags": [], "page_rating": 29, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 1, "user": null, "thumbnail": null, "artist": null, "age": null, "bookmarked": false, "vote": 0, "title": "Ask HN: Lenovo encouraging Chromebook users to install Linux?", "page_rating_contents": 29, "source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "album": ""}, {"comments": [], "source_obj__id": 28, "link": "https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/20652568757399#h_01HMY6W4HH5HTCSXVCTN64R6FG", "dead": false, "date_published": "2024-01-26T00:31:21+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/20652568757399#h_01HMY6W4HH5HTCSXVCTN64R6FG\">https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/20652568757399#h_01HMY6W4HH5HTCSXVCTN64R6FG</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39137432\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39137432</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "page_rating_votes": 0, "language": null, "tags": [], "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "user": null, "thumbnail": null, "artist": null, "age": null, "bookmarked": false, "vote": 0, "title": "Figma to Start Charging Developers for View Access to Designs", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "album": ""}, {"comments": [], "source_obj__id": 28, "link": "https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/highlights/alberta-tar-sands-pollution-up-to-6300-higher-than-industry-reported-finds-study-8162834", "dead": false, "date_published": "2024-01-26T00:31:13+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/highlights/alberta-tar-sands-pollution-up-to-6300-higher-than-industry-reported-finds-study-8162834\">https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/highlights/alberta-tar-sands-pollution-up-to-6300-higher-than-industry-reported-finds-study-8162834</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39137430\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39137430</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "page_rating_votes": 50, "language": "en", "tags": ["climate change"], "page_rating": 124, "permanent": true, "page_rating_visits": 4, "user": "rumpel", "thumbnail": "https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/glaciermedia/images/climate-enviro-solutions/disinformation/oil-sands-emissions.jpg;w=960;h=640;mode=crop", "artist": null, "age": null, "bookmarked": true, "vote": 50.0, "title": "Air pollution over Alberta oil sands up to 6,300% higher than reported", "page_rating_contents": 74, "source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "album": ""}, {"comments": [], "source_obj__id": 28, "link": "https://equity.ltse.com/lp/important-updates", "dead": false, "date_published": "2024-01-26T00:22:32+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://equity.ltse.com/lp/important-updates\">https://equity.ltse.com/lp/important-updates</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39137362\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39137362</a></p>\n<p>Points: 16</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "page_rating_votes": 0, "language": null, "tags": [], "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "user": null, "thumbnail": null, "artist": null, "age": null, "bookmarked": false, "vote": 0, "title": "LTSE Equity Shutting Down", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "album": ""}]
