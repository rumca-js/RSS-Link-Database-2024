The legislation mandated a first meeting date by December 2022, a complete report a year later, and an expiration date of January 2024. Those dates came and went, but the blockchain working group never met. Now, the legislation is expired.\u00a0 According to multiple people close to the matter, the working group\u2019s failure can be chalked up to government inefficiencies, lack of political will, and a quickly changing technological innovation landscape. The working group\u2019s failure holds&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/why-the-washington-state-blockchain-working-group-never-met-and-lessons-for-future-initiatives/\">Read More<", "page_rating_votes": 0, "language": "en-US", "tags": [], "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "user": null, "thumbnail": null, "artist": null, "age": null, "bookmarked": false, "vote": 0, "title": "Why the Washington state blockchain working group never met \u2014\u00a0and lessons for future initiatives", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "album": ""}, {"comments": [], "source_obj__id": 338, "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/heres-what-startup-investors-are-thinking-about-amid-ai-boom-layoffs-funding-slowdown", "dead": false, "date_published": "2024-01-26T15:00:00+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"718\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DSC08863-1260x718.jpeg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />There&#8217;s a lot to consider for tech investors assessing potential startup investments in 2024. Many firms need to deploy capital, but last year was sluggish with shrinking valuations and a slow IPO market. This year brings potential impact from elections, geopolitical instability, and an uncertain interest rate environment. Meanwhile, many firms are betting big on the AI gold rush \u2014 that could be overhyped or underhyped, depending on who you ask. Such was the backdrop for a panel discussion hosted by TiE Seattle at Bellevue City Hall on Wednesday. Speakers included: Read on for our key takeaways.

That&#8217;s the takeaway from one of the biggest updates in the 11-year history of the GeekWire 200, our quarterly ranking of the top privately held technology startups in Seattle and the rest of the Pacific Northwest. See the full GeekWire 200 ranking for Q1 2024.

The transfer of the material from Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee benefits Zeno as well as the Department of Energy: Zeno &#8212; which has offices in Seattle and Washington, D.C. &#8212; gets the strontium-90 fuel that it needs for its next-generation RPS. At the same time, the DOE gets an opportunity to put a decades-old RPS to good use instead of putting it through a costly disposal process. &#8220;This&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/zeno-power-doe-oak-ridge-recycle-radioactive/\">Read More</a>", "page_rating_votes": 0, "language": "en-US", "tags": [], "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "user": null, "thumbnail": null, "artist": null, "age": null, "bookmarked": false, "vote": 0, "title": "Zeno Power partners with U.S. Department of Energy to recycle radioactive material", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "album": ""}, {"comments": [], "source_obj__id": 338, "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/analysis-microsoft-layoffs-are-the-latest-example-of-gaming-industry-labor-issues", "dead": false, "date_published": "2024-01-26T01:05:34+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Xbox-Series-X-1-TB-black-version.jpg\" width=\"800\" /><br />Microsoft\u2019s latest round of layoffs is just a symptom of a much larger issue concerning labor rights and abuses, which could and should change the direction of the international games industry. These layoffs, announced Thursday morning, affect roughly 1,900 people or 9% of the Xbox company network. At time of writing, most of the cut positions appear to be at Microsoft\u2019s newly-acquired subsidiary Activision Blizzard, although the core Xbox division and Zenimax Media have both absorbed some of the impact. In addition, Blizzard president Mike Ybarra and original co-founder Allen Adham have both departed from the company, and Blizzard has&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/analysis-microsoft-layoffs-are-the-latest-example-of-gaming-industry-labor-issues/\">Read More</a>", "page_rating_votes": 0, "language": "en-US", "tags": [], "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "user": null, "thumbnail": null, "artist": null, "age": null, "bookmarked": false, "vote": 0, "title": "Analysis: Microsoft layoffs are the latest example of gaming industry labor issues", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "album": ""}]
