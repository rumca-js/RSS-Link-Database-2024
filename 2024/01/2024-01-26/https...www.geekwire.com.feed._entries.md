The legislation mandated a first meeting date by December 2022, a complete report a year later, and an expiration date of January 2024. Those dates came and went, but the blockchain working group never met. Now, the legislation is expired.  According to multiple people close to the matter, the working group’s failure can be chalked up to government inefficiencies, lack of political will, and a quickly changing technological innovation landscape.

Many firms need to deploy capital, but last year was sluggish with shrinking valuations and a slow IPO market. This year brings potential impact from elections, geopolitical instability, and an uncertain interest rate environment. Meanwhile, many firms are betting big on the AI gold rush — that could be overhyped or underhyped, depending on who you ask. Such was the backdrop for a panel discussion hosted by TiE Seattle at Bellevue City Hall on Wednesday. Speakers included: Read on for our key takeaways.

The transfer of the material from Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee benefits Zeno as well as the Department of Energy: Zeno &#8212; which has offices in Seattle and Washington, D.C. &#8212; gets the strontium-90 fuel that it needs for its next-generation RPS. At the same time, the DOE gets an opportunity to put a decades-old RPS to good use instead of putting it through a costly disposal process. &#8220;This&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/zeno-power-doe-oak-ridge-recycle-radioactive/">Read More</a>

These layoffs, announced Thursday morning, affect roughly 1,900 people or 9% of the Xbox company network. At time of writing, most of the cut positions appear to be at Microsoft’s newly-acquired subsidiary Activision Blizzard, although the core Xbox division and Zenimax Media have both absorbed some of the impact. In addition, Blizzard president Mike Ybarra and original co-founder Allen Adham have both departed from the company, and Blizzard has&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/analysis-microsoft-layoffs-are-the-latest-example-of-gaming-industry-labor-issues/">Read More</a>
