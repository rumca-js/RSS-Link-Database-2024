Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has shared an update on the farm-life sim's highly anticipated - and long-in-the-works - 1.6 update, saying he's now "done adding major new content" and that it'll "definitely" be out this year.
</p><p>
Barone revealed he was working on a 1.6 update for Stardew Valley <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-patch-16-is-on-the-way">back in June 2022</a>. At the time, he warned players it would be relatively modest in scope, and 'mostly modding-focused'.
</p><p>
With each new showing, however, 1.6 has seemingly grown more ambitious, and Barone last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-16-includes-new-late-game-content-and-another-major-festival">confirmed</a> it'll introduce one major new festival and two new mini festivals, new items and

It's been five months since Paradox Interactive's surprise announcement Everybody's Gone to the Rapture developer The Chinese Room <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">had taken the reins</a> of its troubled Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2; in that time, the studio has been openly discussing its approach to the sequel, with its latest update now focusing on what it's calling "visceral immersive combat".
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/visceral-immersive-combat">newly shared blog post</a>, creative director Alex Skidmore outlines three main gameplay styles the studio wants accommodate on release, each emphasising or de-emphasising combat in different ways. The first is wh

As The Last of Us Part 2 strides back in the spotlight thanks to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-is-getting-a-playstation-5-remaster-in-january">recently released PS5 remaster</a>, developer Naughty Dog has announced an arrival date for its previously confirmed making-of documentary, which will be available to watch on YouTube from Friday, 2nd February.
</p><p>
Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2 is (as its name very much implies) the sequel to Naughty Dog's original Grounded documentary, which released in 2015 and charted the "dogged development and unique philosophy" of the first The Last of Us game.

This follow-up documentary almost didn't happen; filming was forced to wrap up prematurely when the coronavirus pandemic struck in 2020, but the footage (which goes

A cunning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> fan has found an unreleased Pal creature hiding away in the game's code. 
</p><p>
The black and purple beastie is currently codenamed "Dark Mutant", and can be seen through a datamine of Palworld's files. It has a 3D model - which you can see above - and a text log entry for the game's Pok&eacute;dex, sorry, Paldex.
</p><p>
"Some say a beam from a {characterName id=|DarkMutant|/}  that has perfected its technique can tear holes into other dimensions," the game says of the creature. "It's even believed that certain species of Pals were born from such phenomena."

Shared-world puzzle game Islands of Insight now has a release date: 13th February.

Tekken 8 is the latest installment in the long running Tekken franchise and - arguably - right up there with the very best. After finding success in its last series entry, the development team pushed harder than ever before, packing this new game full of every mode and option you could imagine. It's an absolute blast to play whether you're looking for competitive play or an over-the-top single-player experience. It's also the first big fighting game built using the latest generation of Unreal technology. As such, unlike Street Fighter 6 and Mortal Kombat 1, Tekken 8 is a game available only on current generation platforms and by and large, it's a winner on all systems. 
</p><p>

After the delightfully excessive introduction sequence - a Tekken staple - you're dropped into a main menu packed with modes and options, perhaps more

## Ruiner developer Reikon Games lays off half its studio

Reikon Games has reportedly laid off 60 to 70 people, equating to 56 percent of the company. 
</p><p>
According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">Kotaku</a>, layoffs at the Ruiner developer happened on 23rd January. These layoffs were to the surprise of its staff, who said they were "sudden" and "shocking". 
</p><p>
The Poland-based company was established in 2014. It went on to release Ruiner, a brutal action shooter, in 2017. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ruiner-review">Eurogamer's Ruiner review</a>, contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called it a "powerfully grim, fleet-footed cyberpunk action odyssey that is caught in the spell of its own nihilism".

Ubisoft has announced an open beta for Skull and Bones. 
</p><p>
The studio's long-in-the-works pirate game has had quite a troubled development, which has resulted in several delays over the last few years. However, it now seems like Skull and Bones is really, actually, finally going to happen. 
</p><p>
Following a closed beta last month, the studio has now <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/skull-and-bones/news-updates/63lU49UJ7nEm7pv4xwBf68/devblog-open-beta">announced an open beta</a>, which will run between 8th and 12th February for those of us in the UK, across PC (Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store), PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Preloads kick off on 6th February.

Our game of the week is Tekken 8 - one of the easier choices, really, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-review">due to its glowing review from Lewis Parker, who gave it five stars</a>.</p><p>I was fascinated reading what Lewis had to say, and I was particularly struck by the emphasis on learning he put at the heart of the experience. Tekken can be complex, I gather - abstruse is the word Lewis uses. But this new game goes out of its way to pull players in and help them along. It wants everyone to learn what makes this series so brilliant, and it sounds like it does a wonderful job.</p><p>This all sounds very appealing. And the more I turned it over in my head, the more I felt like it sounded very familiar too. It's odd to realise, I think, just how much learning there is in most video games. I

## Social MMO Rec Room developer just "can't justify the cost" of a PSVR2 port

There are no current plans to bring Rec Room - the social VR app that's part meeting place, part mini-game hub featuring sporting events, fantastical quests and even games of Charades - to PlayStation VR2. This is because the studio behind it (also known as Rec Room) simply "can't justify the cost", despite its popularity. 
</p><p>
As spotted by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/rec-room-psvr-2-comments/">UploadVR</a>, Rec Room's CCO and co-founder Cameron Brown recently held an AMA chat on Reddit. Here, the developer stated the team had no current plans to port its popular social MMO to Sony's latest VR platform, even though they and their community would love it to happen. 
</p><p>
"We've looked into it, it's a non-trivial port, and we haven't found a way to make it make economic sense," Brown said. "In an ideal world, we would

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-type-chart-strengths-weaknesses-every-element-9409">Palworld</a> has passed another impressive milestone, with more than two million concurrent players on Steam recorded. 
</p><p>
Palworld is only the second game to ever manage this. The other is PUBG, which boasts a concurrent player record of 3,257,248 on Valve's platform. 
</p><p>
While Pocketpair's breakout hit is yet to creep over the 3 million bar, it is still welcoming an enormous number of players, with 1,531,287 Pal tamers currently making their way through the world at the time of writing. These numbers will surely increase further over the weekend, when the work week is done.

Microsoft's decision to cut 1900 staff members has reportedly seen the company's games retail teams reduced, prompting fresh questions over Xbox's future in the physical games business. 
</p><p>
Writing on X, Windows Central's Jez Corden <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/1750590022842278391">said</a> Microsoft had "shut down departments dedicated to bringing Xbox games to physical retail".
</p><p>
Is this the end for boxed Xbox games? Perhaps not yet, Corden continued. Microsoft can outsource physical game production and may be consolidating teams across departments. But the news it has cut staff working on physical game releases comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-xbox-series-xs-consoles-detailed-in-enormous-microsoft-leak">Microsoft accidentally revealed it had planned for a digital-only con

Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> will feature an eight-inch LCD screen, according to a new report. 
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-26/switch-2-nintendo-s-next-gen-console-to-have-8-inch-lcd-screen-omdia-says">Bloomberg</a> today said that Nintendo's next console will feature the company's largest screen size ever, according to an analyst with knowledge of the supply chain. But it will be LCD, rather than OLED - a decision which will help keep costs down.
</p><p>
To compare, the Switch OLED features a seven-inch screen. The original Switch model features a 6.2-inch screen. Nintendo declined to comment when contacted regarding the report.
