<p>Instagram is testing yet another feature meant to give users an alternative to finstas. It’s called “flipside” and it allows people to create a secondary photo grid that only designated friends can see.</p>
<p>If that sounds somewhat familiar it’s probably because Instagram already makes it pretty easy for users to create posts intended for a more limited audience. The app added the ability for users to share  grid posts with <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/you-can-now-limit-instagram-posts-and-reels-to-close-friends-181123680.html"><ins>“close friends”</ins></a> back in November (Stories for close friends has been a thing since 2018). More recently, it tested <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-is-testing-multiple-audience-lists-for-stories-050150933.html"><ins>audience lists</ins></a> for Stories, so users could create multiple lists for small-group sharing.

<p><em>Cities: Skylines II </em>developer Colossal Order has a uniquely close relationship with its community. The original <em>Cities: Skylines</em> came out in 2015 and gobbled up the audience that was left behind by EA’s <em>SimCity</em>, which came out in 2013 and was a busted mess. <em>Cities: Skylines</em> scratched that urban-planning itch, plus it cost just $30. The game came first to PC, Mac and Linux with modest hardware requirements, and it hit consoles within two years. Critically, <em>Cities: Skylines</em> also supported mods through the Steam Workshop, allowing players to add their own tools to the game and share those features with others.</p>
<p>“With <em>Cities: Skylines</em>, the audience grew in size and the modding took even a bigger role, allowing for a huge amount of creativity and inspiration for us devs,” Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen told Engadget. “Anything from quality-of-life improvements to ideas for DLC content, we have gathered a huge a

<p>To the surprise of just about everyone — seemingly <a href="https://twitter.com/BitPlanetGames/status/1750659657603956736"><ins>including the studio behind it</ins></a> — virtual reality game <em>Ultrawings 2</em> has hit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/psvr2/"><ins>PlayStation VR2</ins></a> earlier than expected.

The <a href="https://www.korg.com/us/products/synthesizers/microkorg/">original MicroKorg</a> is one of, if not the best selling synthesizer of all time. It's also probably the longest continuously manufactured synth, having hit the market in 2002. Of course, technology has advanced quite a lot in the last 22 years and it was time to give what is arguably the first classic synth of the 21st century an update.</p>
<p>The new version that Korg announced just ahead of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/namm%202024">NAMM 2024</a> stays largely true to the original design. It's small, but solidly built.

It claims the online media company that posted the video, Dudesy, violated the performer’s right to publicity and infringed on a copyright.</p>
<p>The video’s called “George Carlin: I'm Glad I'm Dead” and features an hour of new “material” by the comedian, who died in 2008. As AI replications go, it’s certainly not going to break any records. It’s audio only and, honestly, doesn’t even sound that much like Carlin. It sounds like a below average impression of the comed

<p>Tesla is recalling 200,000 vehicles in the US due to a malfunctioning backup camera. There were reports that the cameras wouldn’t engage when the cars were in reverse, which is a pretty big safety issue and the whole point of those cameras in the first place. Tesla has processed 81 warranty claims potentially related to the issue, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2024/01/26/tesla-recalling-nearly-200000-vehicles-over-backup-camera-glitch/"><ins>according to </ins><em><ins>Autoblog.</ins></em></a></p>
<p>The recall includes certain Model Y, Model S, and Model X vehicles from 2023. Tesla says it delivered 1.8 million vehicles in 2023, so this recall accounts for more than 10 percent of the company’s yearly output.

<p>If there’s one thing we can all agree upon, it’s that the 21st century’s captains of industry are trying to shoehorn AI into every corner of our world. But for all of the ways in which AI will be shoved into our faces and not prove very successful, it might actually have at least one useful purpose. For instance, by dramatically speeding up the often decades-long process of designing, finding and testing new drugs.</p>
<p>Risk mitigation isn’t a sexy notion but it’s worth understanding how common it is for a new drug project to fail. To set the scene, consider that each drug project takes between three and five years to form a hypothesis strong enough to start tests in a laboratory. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9293739/">2022 study from Professor Duxin Sun</a> found that 90 percent of clinical drug development fails, with each project costing more than $2 billion.

We focus on how much has changed since Apple’s disastrous 2016 lineup, why the Apple Silicon chips feel so revolutionary, and look back at our earliest Mac experiences. Also, we review the Framework Laptop 16, a wonderfully modular miracle of a laptop, but one that we wish had more graphics power for gaming. (But hey, at least you can replace the GPU eventually!).</p>

<p>Apple is making <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pple-details-how-third-party-app-stores-and-payments-will-work-in-europe-183931334.html">major changes to the App Store in Europe</a> in response to new European Union laws. Beginning in March, Apple will allow users in the EU to download apps and make purchases from outside its App Store. These changes are already being stress-tested in the iOS 17.4 beta.</p>
<p>Developers will be able to take payments and distribute apps from <em>outside</em> the App Store for the first time. Apple will still enforce a review process for apps that don’t come through its store, but it will be “focused on platform integrity and protecting users” from things like malware. The company warns it has less chance of addressing other risks like scams, abuse and harmful content.</p>
<p>Apple is also changing its commission structure, so developers will pay 17 percent on subscriptions and in-app purchases, reducing the fee to 10 percent for “most de

<p>GM's driverless <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2023-was-the-year-cruises-robotaxi-dream-came-to-a-crashing-end-153002522.html">Cruise division</a> is under investigation by both the Department of Justice (DoJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/25/cruise-investigation-doj-sec/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> has reported. The probes follow an incident last year in which a jaywalking pedestrian was struck by a Cruise autonomous vehicle and then dragged 20 feet, worsening her injuries.</p>
<p>At the same time, yesterday Cruise released its own third-party findings regarding the accident, which took place on October 2 and involved another vehicle (a Nissan). The company said it &quot;failed to live up to the justifiable expectations of regulators and the communities we serve... [and] also fell woefully short of our own expectations,&quot; adding that it's &quot;fully cooperating&quot; with investigator

<p>Catching up on a new podcast should get easier very soon. <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/5316-transcripts-on-apple-podcasts">Apple has announced that it will automatically transcribe podcasts</a>, which should allow more people to enjoy episodes. Apple Podcast will allow creators to upload their own transcript for display or opt for Apple to create one.</p>
<p>There are some caveats to be aware of, though. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-podcasts-update-makes-it-easier-to-find-content-in-your-favorite-genres-125458706.html">Apple Podcasts</a> should start creating the transcription when the episode is uploaded. However, it has a &quot;short delay&quot; until it's available, so people eager to play their favorite podcast right away will have to wait for an unspecified amount of time (Apple tells podcasters to give it at least 24 hours after uploading an episode). It's likely that the longer the episode is, the longer the transcription will take to be
