The FBI&#8217;s counter-terrorism work has always been noted for its willingness to radicalize people just to arrest them.

People with mental issues or deep wells of insecurity [&#8230;]

Okay, look, this post is basically a repost of a post from two years ago. But, because David Mamet has decided to refile the exact same amicus brief he filed for the 5th Circuit again at the Supreme Court, I figured we can repost the same exact post ripping it apart (with a few tiny [&#8230;]

There&#8217;s not much that&#8217;s more inadvertently hilarious than the efforts of law enforcement officials to convince the general public that simply being in the immediate area of fentanyl could result in instant death. That&#8217;s not how drugs work. Drugs need to be ingested. While some drugs can obviously be absorbed through the skin, it takes [&#8230;]

Nikko D’Ambrosio has had a pretty rough week, but apparently that&#8217;s not going to stop him from texting the court from a new number. You may recall this dude bro from the Chicago area, for his decision to sue basically everyone he could think of after a few women he dated wrote about their experiences [&#8230;]
