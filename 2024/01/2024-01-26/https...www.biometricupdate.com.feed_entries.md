		The introduction of ID documents with integrated NFC chips in countries around the world has made remote identity verification easier for people and organizations equipped to use them. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/regula">Regula</a> is introducing a service to enable organizations implementing ID verification to test their identity document-scanning capabilities.

The Regula NFC TestKit includes sample documents embedded with fictitious identities that can be read through the chip or a machine readable zone (MRZ). Providing representations of identity documents with multiple data fields allows organizations to test the complete process for remote customer onboarding to find potential challenges or vulnerabilities, according to th

		This week brought news that Amazon, on the one hand, appears to be selling AI services to the FBI, and on the other, curtailing Ring video access for local police.

There may be a business strategy through-line for Amazon between the two developments, but it isn’t visible at the moment.

Amazon’s request-for-assistant service, one of the Ring doorbell services, had been used by local police and firefighters to ask Amazon for access to a Ring owner’s video feed without warrants. The service made those devices de facto municipal surveillance network nodes.

But no longer.

A <a href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/ring-announces-new-neighbors-app-features-sunsets-request-for-assistance-post/">post</a> on Ring.com states that public safety agencies will have to scroll thr

		A U.S. privacy case in state court that accuses a Chinese surveillance camera maker of “corporate voyeurism” has been narrowed to the benefit of the defendant. More generally, the defendant is accused of making false product claims.

Anker Innovations, maker of the Eufy camera, is <a href="https://ecf.ilnd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_temp.pl?file=25543242-0--5958.pdf&amp;type=application/pdf">accused</a> in an Illinois federal court of violating the state’s Biometric Information Privacy <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/bipa">Act</a> and other consumer laws.

		The spiralling trend of identity-related fraud in Africa, perpetrated mostly through national ID documents, portends great dangers for Africa’s lofty plans of leveraging its digital economy to meet crucial socio-economic development goals.

This warning is contained in a <a href="https://cms.media.usesmileid.com/2024-digital-identity-fraud-africa-report.pdf">64-page report</a> released this week by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/smile-identity">Smile ID</a>, a digital ID verification services firm headquartered in Lagos.

		Nepalese government officials have announced that biometrics will not be collected anew from passport applicants whose personal data is already in the national identity card and civil registration database.

Authorities plan to issue passports using the same biometric hardware and software installations already deployed by the national identity card and civil status registration and vital statistics systems.

This new plan will mark a shift from the current system in which those applying for passports are expected to still submit their biometrics, even if they did so while registering for a national ID which is a prerequisite for passport application.
