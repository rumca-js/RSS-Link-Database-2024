<p>Fortnite has long been that rare game where the microtransactions are actually part of the appeal, and so fans have been pretty baffled lately by the messy state of the game's Item Shop. The selection of skins, emotes and other cosmetics has been pretty poor recently, and also the shop seems quite buggy. Combined with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/11-ways-fortnites-locker-ui-is-worse-in-chapter-5/1100-6519750/">the awful new locker UI introduced in Chapter 5,</a> Fortnite's cosmetic game is really struggling in some surprising ways.</p><p dir="ltr">The Shop has particularly been a bit of a nightmare this week. On Monday, the Skull Trooper skin was added to the shop in two separate tabs, and a potentially related issue forced Epic to take down the entire store aside from the packs you buy with real currency through the platform you're playing on. On Tuesday morning after this week's patch, a bunch of the content creator Icon skins were supposed to be available

<p dir="ltr">ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith decided to step away from commentary on the NBA season and other professional sports to talk about Pokemon. Why? Well, because a fan asked him on X (formerly known as Twitter) about his choice between Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbgbV0okEO4">The YouTube video from The Stephen A. Smith Show</a>--seen below--gives the impression that Smith has never discussed Pokemon before. He has quite a unique enunciation for Bulbasaur and Charmander, for one, and he doesn't even know where the pocket monsters are from initially. However, that doesn't stop Smith from ultimately going with Charmander.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Smith chooses Charmander because "it reminds me of me because of the forehead." This transitions into a funny side-by-side comparison of Smith and the creature. "That's who I'm going to go with, okay," the host adds.</p><a href="https://www.gamespo

<p dir="ltr"><em>Mass Effect 2 is celebrating its 14-year anniversary today, January 26, 2024. Below, we look back at one of its strangest aspects, and how it set up a broader subplot that went almost entirely unexplored.</em></p><p dir="ltr">The Suicide Mission of Mass Effect 2 is one of the all-time great climaxes of a video game. After tens of hours building relationships with a crew of characters you've recruited from all over the galaxy, you take them into a final battle where you have to make use of their specific skills and any missteps can result in the deaths of any one of them (or potentially even all of them, and you). But less remarked upon is the climax of the climax--a boss battle with a giant robot called a Reaper.</p><p dir="ltr">Mass Effect introduced a Reaper at the end of the first game, cementing what a massive threat these things were. What the characters first thought was a colossal, incredibly powerful spaceship turned out to be a colossal, artificially

<p>Asus threw its hat into the handheld gaming PC space last year with the release of the ROG Ally, and in a new interview, the company has confirmed that a second-generation version of the device is already in development and could be out later this year.</p><p>"We most likely will launch a second-generation [handheld gaming console] this year. We will still keep the Windows features, but we will focus more on gaming,” Asus India's VP of consumer and gaming PCs, Arnold Su, said to <a href="https://www.techlusive.in/features/exclusive-asus-to-make-consumer-gaming-pcs-in-india-starting-2024-says-arnold-su-1455395/">Techlusive</a>.</p><p>The Asus ROG Ally is an impressive device, as it combines a sleek design with powerful hardware and a sharp IPS screen. Because it runs on Windows 11, it also gives users a greater selection of digital marketplaces to access in comparison to Valve's Steam Deck. Steam, GOG, and Uplay all perform well on it, and you can even turn it in to a Game
