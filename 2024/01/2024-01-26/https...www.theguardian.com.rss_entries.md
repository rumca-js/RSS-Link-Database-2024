<p>He won cups and improved players but most of all the German knew that what matters most is how football makes you feel</p><p>To the very end, Jürgen Klopp’s sense of theatre never left him. The little pregnant pause at the start of the video where he announces his departure, when everyone knows what’s coming but still wants to hear him say it out of his own mouth. The way his voice cracks and breaks. The way he stares straight down the camera, so you can’t look away. And of course the immaculate timing, the disorienting flourish, a sense of pure shock that will reverberate through the last four months of this season. One last mind game. One last competitive edge. For Klopp the business and the pleasure of football were always symbiotically linked, one in the service of the other.</p><p>This was the talent, and these were the convictions, that could hold a dressing room, an auditorium or a stadium in the palm of his hand.

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/jurgen-klopp">Jürgen Klopp</a> has stunned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool">Liverpool</a> and the world of football by announcing he is to leave the club at the end of the season. The 56-year-old attributed his shock decision to “running out of energy”. Klopp has been Liverpool manager since 2015 and is under contract until 2026 but, in an announcement via the club’s media channel, has revealed he will stand down two years early. The players were told by Klopp before training on Friday. The news will come as a devastating blow to Liverpool supporters – who idolise the charismatic German – and also to the squad and the owner, Fenway Sports Group, whose appointment of the former Borussia Dortmund coach transformed the club’s fortunes. Under Klopp Liverpool have won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Club World Cup. They reached another Carabao Cup final on Wednesday and have a fiv

<p>Lossiemouth alert prevented the market leader for Saturday’s big race running with too much lead in the saddle </p><p>The British Horseracing Authority has narrowly avoided the embarrassment of a hot favourite running with too much weight in the saddle after it emerged that Lossiemouth, last season’s Triumph Hurdle winner, had been set to carry 3lb more than her correct burden when making her seasonal debut in the Grade Two Unibet Hurdle at Cheltenham on Saturday.</p><p>Lossiemouth was initially given a weight of 11st 3lb in Saturday’s race, which included her mares’ allowance of 7lb, but the published weight was amended to 11st on Friday morning, apparently because the conditions surrounding a penalty for her Grade One win at last year’s Festival had been incorrectly applied. Under the race’s conditions, a 6lb penalty is incurred for a Grade One win after 30 September 2022, but is reduced to 3lb if the win came in novice or juvenile company.</p> <a href="https://www.thegu

Still, in between the monosyllabic answers, he is also quietly funny.

The temptation is to go back to what you were previously drinking with a huge sigh of relief, in much the same way as you hit the Easter eggs after giving up chocolate for Lent.</p><p>There is another way forward, though, and that is to buy wines that are lower in alcohol; after the recent increase in duty on wines with a higher ABV, there are a now growing number of them, too. An 11% wine, for example, attracts £2.35 duty, compared with £2.67 for most still wines; reduce that to 8%, meanwhile, and you have to pay only £1.49.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/26/not

## I’m a sex educator. Here’s the biggest myth about desire in long-term relationships

<p>It turns out every part of the narrative we’re taught about desire is not merely wrong, but wrongheaded</p><p>When I first began having long(ish)-term sexual relationships during my college years I believed an old-fashioned narrative about how desire works. We’re told it’s all passion and “spark” early in a relationship, and that lasts a couple of years maybe. Then we have kids or buy a fixer-upper house or generally get busy with work and life, and the spark fizzles out, especially after 50, when apparently every hormone we ever had floats away on a sea of aging and we’re left, sexless and neutered, to hold hands at sunset.</p><p>Our options, we’re told, are either to accept the fizzling of our desire for sex or to fight against it, to invest our time, attention and even our money in “keeping the spark alive”.</p><p>At the start of a sexual and/or romantic relationship, we should feel a “spark”, a spontaneous, giddy craving for sexual intimacy with our (potential) partner

Klopp has been Liverpool manager since 2015 and is under contract until 2026 but, in an announcement via the club’s media channel, revealed he will stand down two years early. Klopp said he had told the owners in November of his intention to leave. “I can understand that it’s a shock for a lot of people in this moment, when you hear it for the first time,” Klopp said. “I love absolutely everything about this club, I love everything about the city, I love everything about our supporters, I love the team, I love the staff. I love everything. But that I still take this decision shows you that I am convinced it is the one I have to take."</p><ul><li><p><a hre

<p><strong>Orange Tree theatre, London<br /></strong>Writer Zoe Cooper and director Tessa Walker reignite Jane Austen’s early novel with hilarious physical storytelling and a fizzing cast, though the romance sputters out too soon</p><p>Jane Austen’s slim oeuvre has an odd place in the literary and filmic canon: readers tend to fall passionately in love with it when they are too young to understand how barbed and ambivalent its worldview is beneath the sprigged muslin. So it is both fun and appropriate to see her early novel given a fanfic makeover by Zoe Cooper of the sort that has previously seen Harry Potter copping off with Ron Weasley. Janeites, be warned.</p><p>The first act of this three-hander is a delight, tracking the progress of the breathy young northerner Cath, from her birth in a hard-pressed household, overburdened with babies, to the dizzy social whirl of Bath, where she is whisked by childless friends of the family, with only her intimate knowledge of gothic l

<p>Andrew Haigh’s supernatural fantasy about a grieving screenwriter is a bittersweet journey into love and heartbreak. Does it get it right, and did you cry?<strong><br />• This article contains spoilers for All of Us Strangers</strong></p><p>So … did you cry? All of Us Strangers has finally been released in the UK after leaving cinemagoers in the US, and at various film festivals, in floods. It’s won seven gongs at the British Independent Film awards and is up for six Baftas, but no Oscars – whatever. For me, the film’s achievement is the way it’s managed to talk about love, grief and loneliness in such a powerful and original way. I first saw it at the end of September when it hit me like a ton of bricks, and I can honestly say that I’ve thought about it every single day since.</p><p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/29/a-generation-of-queer-people-are-grieving-for-the-childhood-they-never-had-andrew-haigh-on-all-of-us-strangers">I interviewed writer-

Just at the point in our&nbsp;lives when we start seriously considering our long-term health and mortality – perhaps after witnessing older loved ones getting an illness such as dementia – our responsibilities are piled so high that we can feel as if we’re losing our mental capacities already. The names of our favourite animals and humans become an interchangeable word soup. Our keys become increasingly elusive. Alerts must be set on all calendar entries.</p><p>But how can we tell whether this frustrating flakiness is a reflection of age-related cognitive decline; the early signs of our own impending dementia; or merely an overly taxing phase from which we will recover?

Here’s how to pull off the double cord look while avoiding 1970s staffroom territory</p><p>You can’t have too much of a good thing, and corduroy is a good thing. Which means that double corduroy – like double denim, but make it cord – is a very good thing. A doubly good thing. The thought process behind double corduroy as a winter wardrobe winner goes like this. You wake up and, well, really you would like to wear jeans if it’s all the same to everyone else. Jeans have a combination of hardiness and familiarity that makes them very appealing on a winter morning. Also, they are on the chair next to the bed where you took them off last night, so that’s handy.</p><p>On the other hand … the jeans are on the chair next to the bed where you took them off last night. Which reminds you that you have been wearing them quite a lot and maybe you should make a bit more of an effort? Because, yes, January is a bit rubbish but in the end, in life you

<p>The Indian writer on Hobsbawm, Russian fairytales – and the complete works of Jackie Collins</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><br />Like many upper-caste households in north India, my family possessed clothbound copies of a Hindi translation of the Mahabharata. As a child, I read the volumes cover to cover, lingering over the sketches of the protagonists, and I then reread them – I can’t remember how many times. This first experience of imaginative literature, I now recognise, was also the most crucial.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><br />I wish I still possessed the collections of Russian and Ukrainian folktales that my parents bought from bookshops subsidised by the Soviet Union. The Soviets fought the cultural cold war in vast tracts of Asia, Africa and Latin America by attractively showcasing the range and abundance of Russian literature, and making it cheaply available. I spent much of my early years dipping into volumes of fairyta

<p>Cyclone downgraded after dense fog hits parts of the US and India while drought affects Philippines and southern Africa</p><p>Tropical Cyclone Kirrily made landfall on the coast of Queensland on Thursday night (local time). Kirrily originated as a tropical low over the Coral Sea, and gradually intensified over several days. The tropical cyclone then quickly intensified on Thursday, reaching a category 2 system by 10am AEST, and category 3 by 3pm, producing gusts of 170 km/h (105mph). As Kirrily moved inland five hours later, it left more than 34,000 homes and business without power in Townsville.
