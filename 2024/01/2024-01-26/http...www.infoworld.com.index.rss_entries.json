The company also updated its GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 large language models, and unveiled two new text embedding models.</p><p>OpenAI made the rollout on <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates\" rel=\"nofollow\">January 25</a>. Two API key managment platform improvements aim to give developers more visibility into usage and control over APIs. First, developers now can assign permissions to API keys from the <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/api-keys\" rel=\"nofollow\">API keys page</a>. For example, a key could be assigned read-only access to power an internal tracking dashboard or restricted to access only certain endpoints.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3712564/openai-unvei", "page_rating_votes": 0, "language": "en-us", "tags": [], "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "user": null, "thumbnail": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2023/11/04/09/macworld-the-2023-ultimate-ai-chatgpt-python-programming-bundle-100948138-small.jpg", "artist": null, "age": null, "bookmarked": false, "vote": 0, "title": "OpenAI unveils new embedding models, GPT Turbo updates", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "http://www.infoworld.com/index.rss", "album": ""}, {"comments": [], "source_obj__id": 563, "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3712425/is-api-design-a-lost-art.html#tk.rss_all", "dead": false, "date_published": "2024-01-26T10:00:00+00:00", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>It\u2019s Friday morning, and you are excited.

One of the perennial questions of computer programming is how closely or loosely the bits of code that perform those tasks should be coupled. One answer is the microservices architecture, which consists of discrete chunks of functionality that interact with other discrete chunks to create a larger system. Each chunk is a microservice.</p><p>Although the idea of connected components isn\u2019t new, microservices have gained popularity as a natural foundation for cloud-based applications.
