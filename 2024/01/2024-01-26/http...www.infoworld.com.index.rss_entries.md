<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">Generative AI</a> juggernaut OpenAI has introduced new ways for developers to manage and track the use of API keys. The company also updated its GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 large language models, and unveiled two new text embedding models.</p><p>OpenAI made the rollout on <a href="https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates" rel="nofollow">January 25</a>. Two API key managment platform improvements aim to give developers more visibility into usage and control over APIs. First, developers now can assign permissions to API keys from the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/api-keys" rel="nofollow">API keys page</a>. For example, a key could be assigned read-only access to power an internal tracking dashboard or restricted to access only certain endpoints.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712564/openai-unvei

<p>It’s Friday morning, and you are excited. Today your new generative AI system running on a large public cloud provider is going to begin to work with the existing e-commerce systems that drive 80% of the company’s revenue.</p><p>The company is expecting the new ability to generate more sales while providing a better understanding of the customers using the site. The system will also be able to craft custom bundled deals on the fly. Marketing estimates this will increase the average single sale by 30%. Game changer.</p><p>There has been such a push to implement this that the cloud and website development teams skipped most of the stress testing, relying instead on the promise that these cloud-based systems “should be able to scale.”</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712425/is-api-design-a-lost-art.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Nearly every computer system performs multiple tasks using shared resources. One of the perennial questions of computer programming is how closely or loosely the bits of code that perform those tasks should be coupled. One answer is the microservices architecture, which consists of discrete chunks of functionality that interact with other discrete chunks to create a larger system. Each chunk is a microservice.</p><p>Although the idea of connected components isn’t new, microservices have gained popularity as a natural foundation for cloud-based applications. Microservices architecture also dovetails with the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3215275/what-is-devops-transforming-software-development.html">devops philosophy</a>, which encourages rolling out new functionality rapidly and continuously.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3445043/what-are-microservices-your-next-software-architecture.html#jump">To read this article i
