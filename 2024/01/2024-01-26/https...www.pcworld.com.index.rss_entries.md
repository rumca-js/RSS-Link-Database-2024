<p>Shortly after Apple made news by <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2219072/apple-opens-the-door-for-xbox-nvidia-game-streaming-on-iphones.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">allowing game streaming services on the iPhone</a> for the first time, AMD has some mobile game streaming news of its own&hellip;though probably not as welcome. The company announced that it&rsquo;s ending support for the AMD Link mobile app, which allows gamers to stream games from PCs with Radeon graphics cards to Android and iOS as well as remotely control and monitor PC gaming functions. The system won&rsquo;t be integrated with AMD&rsquo;s Adrenalin driver package going forward. </p>

<p>One of the most appealing parts of the rise of game streaming services like GeForce Now and Xbox Game Pass is making full-power PC and console games available on your phone or tablet. Assuming, of course, that the people making said phone or tablet don&rsquo;t throw up an artificial roadblock. Apple has been doing just that for years, shutting down game streaming services that want to release dedicated apps in the App Store. But apparently that policy has just been changed. </p>



<p>According to an update to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=f1v8pyay&amp;xcust=2-1-2219072-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Apple&rsquo;s iOS and iPadOS developer portal</a> yesterday, game streaming services are now allowed, though they&rsquo;ll be subject to the

<p>Apple is all about high-quality design, but sometimes style comes at the expense of substance. For instance, the Apple TV remote is not remotely intuitive and the finicky trackpad makes scrolling for your favorite movies and shows a major pain.
