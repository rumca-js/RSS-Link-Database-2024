This week on Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss Palworld , a survival game that launched into Early Access last week on PC and Game Pass with some sizable buzz behind it. Since its reveal, many were referring to the game as Pokémon with guns. People quickly accused developer PocketPair of using AI generated assets to create the game, as well as lifting models from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
