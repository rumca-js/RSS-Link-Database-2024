<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 26 January 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01797-0">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01797-0</a></p>Samples of NdNiO2+x are prepared with meticulous control of the oxygen content. Their X-ray scattering and spectroscopy measurements then reveal that the previously reported charge density wave in undoped infinite-layer nickelates is, in fact, a spurious effect.

Chemo-mechanical failure mechanisms of composite Si|Li6PS5Cl and solid-electrolyte-free silicon anodes are now revealed and should help in designing improved electrodes.
