It really is. That is why it is loaded with insane amounts of sugar to mask the taste of burnt toast with a sour aftertaste. And for someone whose entire business model is based on finding ways to disguise the revolting taste of your product by adding insane amounts of sugar, it is no surprise they would treat heroic employees the same way they treat their products. And that is like trash. </p><p>Two wannabe degenerate thugs tried to rob a Starbucks with fake guns. One of the robbers hit a barista in the head with his toy firearm. But it was not even a good fake because part of it shattered the moment he assaulted the worker.
