Despite most games in the genre withering away, however, Enshrouded might end up being one of the rare titles that bucks the trend thanks to its refinement of genre conventions, as well as an emphasis on combat-oriented encounters with its action RPG gameplay.\n\nWhile Enshrouded doesn\u2019t really bring anything brand new to the genre, the game is able to make expert use of tried-and-tested genre conventions, as well as an interesting emphasis on character progression.

Why do so many people enjoy what's essentially another survival crafting title? Pokemon does enter the equation, as some may feel that it does things that it can't while presenting better visuals or a much larger scale.\n\nHowever, it also comes down to the fact that Palworld stands out enough to make it enjoyable.
