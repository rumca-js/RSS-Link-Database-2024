Last week, Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller caused controversy among players by revealing major gameply changes that'll see tank and damage heroes receive a "modified, tuned-down version of the Support self-healing passive" in Season 9 - and Keller has now admitted it was a "mistake" to make the announcement "out of context".
</p><p>
In his <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24053284/">original announcement on the Overwatch blog</a>, Keller explained the changes - part of a wider gameplay overhaul intended to reduce 'frustration' when teams aren't working together - should "give non-Support players more options in terms of sustaining themselves" and "take some of the pressure off Support players to keep everyone alive since individual players now have more control of their own health pool." The idea,

Studio Wildcard has announced release dates for Ark: Survival Ascended's first two expansion map remasters - specifically, The Center and Scorched Earth - following their delay last year, confirming they'll arrival in February and April respectively.
</p><p>
A spruced-up version of Scorched Earth was originally due to launch alongside Ark: Survival Ascended - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-delayed-survival-evolved-official-servers-to-shut-down-later-this-year">controversial</a> full-price remaster of Wildcard's 2015 dinosaur survival game Ark: Survival Evolved - last year. However, in July, the studio announced that not only was it pushing the launch of the base game back to October, its expansions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-survival-ascended-delayed-to-october-dlc-no-longer-inclu

Rebel Wolves - the studio formed by a number of ex-CD Projekt staff, including Witcher 3 game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz - has confirmed its first project will be dark fantasy RPG Dawnwalker, after the title was reported online toward the end of last year.
</p><p>
When Rebel Wolves <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-director-starts-own-studio-called-rebel-wolves">announced its existence in 2022</a>, the studio said its mission was to "evolve the cRPG genre by creating unforgettable stories and stirring deep emotions", confirming its first project would be a then-unnamed "AAA dark fantasy built inside the Unreal 5 engine".
</p><p>
We've not heard an awful lot about Rebel Wolves' debut game in any official capacity since then, although CEO Tomaszkiewicz - who also served as head of production and

GAME, the UK's biggest high street video game retailer, will no longer allow customers to trade in physical video games from next month, staff have told Eurogamer. 
</p><p>
The chain is expected to end its long-running video game trade-in facility on 16th February, with remaining pre-owned stock continuing to be sold until it has run out.
</p><p>
GAME staff have been told of the change, and Eurogamer has corroborated this with multiple branches of the retailer nationwide. We've contacted GAME itself for more.

Elden Ring has received a new DLC listing as part of an update on Steam. While nothing official has been announced by developer FromSoftware as yet, there is a high chance this update relates to the game's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-expansion-confirmed-by-fromsoftware">Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a>.
</p><p>
The update was shared by Ziostorm on X, after the user noticed Elden Ring's DLC category had been updated on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1245620/dlc/">SteamDB</a>. The update in question doesn't have a name, and is merely listed as "SteamDB Unknown App 2778580" for now. However, many have speculated the developer will be making an announcement regarding the expansion's release date in the near future. We will keep you posted.

Ned Luke, the voice actor behind Michael De Santa in Grand Theft Auto 5, has called out a company for using his voice as the basis of an unofficial AI chatbot.

The actor reshared a post from AI company WAME, which offered GTA fans the chance to have a "realistic voice conversation" with Michael. "This is fucking bullshit," Luke <a href="https://twitter.com/ned_luke/status/1746559971695763562">wrote</a> in response, tagging WAME.

The mysterious, long-rumoured Halo battle royale project from series co-developer Certain Affinity is no longer in development, a new report has claimed.

</p><p>
While officially unannounced by Microsoft itself, Certain Affinity had discussed the project publicly in broad terms several times, and said in late 2022 that it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/studio-rumoured-to-be-making-halo-infinite-battle-royale-offers-fresh-tease">been in the works for more than two years</a>, with nearly 100 people then working on it.

Faheem Rashad Najm, aka T-Pain, is working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> with Rockstar. 
</p><p>
The Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter, known for his penchant for auto-tune and singing about apple-bottom jeans and those boots with the fur along with Flo Rida, confirmed the news during a livestream.
</p><p>
However, this news arrived not because T-Pain was announcing his collaboration with Rockstar specifically, but because he was lamenting on an unexpected consequence of his new gig: the fact he can no longer roleplay on NoPixel, a GTA roleplay server.
