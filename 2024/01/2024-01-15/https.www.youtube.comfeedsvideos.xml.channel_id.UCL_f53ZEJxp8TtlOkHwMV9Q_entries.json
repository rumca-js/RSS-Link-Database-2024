Peterson sits down in person with Dr. John Vervaeke. They discuss the relationship between your calling and your conscience, the three dimensions of the sacred, how Descartes' famous \u201cI think therefore I am\u201d conclusion might be restructured in modern day, what exactly Socrates\u2019s Daemon was, and the bridging of morality and meaning.\n\nJohn Vervaeke is an Associate Professor in Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto. His work constructs a bridge between science and spirituality in order to understand the experience of meaningfulness and the cultivation of wisdom so as to afford awakening from the meaning crisis.\n\nThis episode was recorded on January 8th, 2023\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nShopify: Get a $1/ month FREE trial with full access to Shopify's entire suite of features: https://shopify.com/jbp \n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNu1_wnveyA", "date_published": "2024-01-15T22:01:26+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Jordan B Peterson", "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/QNu1_wnveyA/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
