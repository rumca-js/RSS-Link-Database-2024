One, Trump got rich before he got into politics whereas it is usually the other way around. Two, Trump truly loves his supporters and that is not so obvious with people like Sleepy Joe. But the biggest difference between him and the current president is that he delivers pizza to first responders in frigid Iowa, while Biden can barely pick up his ice cream cone.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n<span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n<small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Donald Trump delivers pizza to firefighters in Iowa</small>\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4xLOQLBD4A\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>\n</small>\n</p><p><a href=\"ht", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trump-iowa-pizza", "date_published": "2024-01-15T19:16:02+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=51088983&width=980", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "FAA's Diversity Push Includes Hiring People With A Focus On \u201cSevere Intellectual\u201d And \u201cPsychiatric\u201d Disabilities", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=51088699&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C256%2C0%2C256\" /><br /><br /><p>Until five minutes ago, society was not required to include <em>all </em>people in <em>all </em>things. That was never a thought because it is so foolish. But the left has taken the term \u201cinclusive\" to a whole new extreme. Rather than focusing on including people based on insignificant birth traits, the Federal Aviation Administration is focusing on hiring people who suffer serious mental conditions, including \u201csevere intellectual\u201d disabilities, psychiatric problems, and physical and mental disorders. </p><p>That is how deranged the term \u201cinclusive\u201d is. There is absolutely no reason someone with a severe intellectual disability should be charged with regulating aviation, especially when passengers are involved. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/faa-diversity-push", "date_published": "2024-01-15T18:25:14+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=51088699&width=980", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "\"We can't even have these conversations a lot of the time...\": Crowder sits down at a Black barbershop to get the scoop", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=51088141&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>Episode two of Black & White on the Gray Issues at a Black Barbershop was released today.
