<p>At last, this show drops the bloated, male-dominated stories of earlier series for an icy murder case in Alaska – with blistering turns from Foster and Kali Reis</p><p>Full disclosure: I have never been a fan of True Detective, even in its first and, by wide consensus, best instalment. It was so very full of Acting-with-a-capital-A and Directing-with-a-capital-D. When the two subsequent iterations of the anthology series became overwhelmed by the self-indulgences that had always threatened, I took my leave, along with many other viewers.</p><p>Now it is back for a fourth season – True Detective: Night Country. It is the first outing without its creator, Nic Pizzolatto, as either showrunner or writer (though he remains as executive producer). There has been radical change: a brutal, beautiful stripping-back by the new writer and director, Issa López. Instead of the broiling sun under which previous detectives, criminals and victims laboured we are now in the fictional mining town o

<p>Signing 31 players in the summer after promotion to the Premier League has left Forest facing the prospect of a points deduction</p><p>When Nottingham Forest spent £150m in one transfer window in the summer of 2022, it was supposed to be a sign of ambition. It is not cheap being a Premier League club, and building a squad capable of staying up – never mind challenging for trophies – is an expensive business.

When second division Las Palmas reported for pre-season last summer, the midfielder told them something wasn’t right: he was tired, didn’t want to eat and couldn’t sleep. His spleen was inflamed, his kidneys hurt and his calcium levels were too high. Doctors removed a cyst and the results of the biopsy revealed a Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer. It was August 2022 and he was 26. He underwent six sessions of chemotherapy, crossing them out on a calendar. There were pills and injections, he felt weak and his hair fell out.

The day he announced his il

<p>Thanks to shrinkflation, there was barely a stir when a Suffolk couple took home a million on Ant and Dec’s Limitless Win last week. These days, we demand infinite cash! </p><p>On Saturday night, two contestants participating in the ITV gameshow Limitless Win won a million pounds. The contestants – named Helen and Charlie, from Suffolk – walked away with the prize after correctly identifying how many years it had been since Blur and Oasis battled it out for a No 1 single.</p><p>And, you know, good for them. Their ability to pinpoint key moments in the Britpop wars has made them incredibly rich. But if you detected a note of apathy in the wider public on news of this win, you’re probably right.

<p>Being a Deaf professional dancer can feel isolating – but my experiences in clubs made me realise I could create a dance space that would welcome everyone</p><p>I used to <em>hate</em> raves. As a Deaf woman, I rarely felt comfortable in clubs and parties. After too many experiences of being excluded or subjected to unwanted attention, sexual harassment and assault, I had come to view those spaces as dangerous and unsafe. Many of my Deaf and disabled friends felt the same.</p><p>But I have always loved dancing. I started when I was six years old and would skip and twirl everywhere I went, from walking down the street with my parents and waiting in the town pool queue. I obsessively watched dance videos. I even asked my school principal if I could use the school hall at lunchtimes to dance, then dragged my Deaf classmates there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/16/sydney-festival-2024-spin-dance-rave-event-founder-anna-seymour">Continue reading...</a>

OK, he was clad in the No 10 shirt this time rather than the No 7 but in most other senses, it was as if Jadon Sancho had never been away.</p><p>Whether that is positive or negative is not an easy question to answer.

This is, however, the most typical of January transfers. Three desperate parties coming together to hammer out the best, least-worst solution to their very immediate problems. The opening stanza of the renewed player-club relationship underlined exactly why they’ve come together and why, at this point in time, they need each other like they do.

I’d seen the vertiginous display and attractive prices, and also been reminded of my grandmother, who loved and depended on them almost as much as ginger biscuits – but it was Vincenzo who brought home five packets, for cheese and emergencies (that is, for when we run out of bread). He put two in the tin and the rest in the bulk store cupboard, which, hardly up to the job, is a metre-square section of the kitchen dresser that’s already so full of pasta and tinned food, it’s hard to close the door. So, before I had even had one, I was annoyed by the packets that filled the tin and fell out every time I opened the cupboard.

To be in movies without becoming famous</p><p>Dominic Sessa wasn’t thinking about the movies when he entered his senior year of high school at Deerfield Academy in western Massachusetts. The original plan was hockey – Sessa, a scholarship student from southern New Jersey, knew that New England prep schools are a launchpad for college careers. But a broken femur and the school’s winter activity requirement landed him in theatre, which he took to like a fish to water. So, new plan: maybe drama school. But in autumn 2021, when Sessa was starring in a student production of Neil Simon’s Rumors, his drama teacher asked him to audition for a Hollywood casting director who was scouting Deerfield as a potential filming location.</p><p>The film was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/11/the-holdovers-review-ale

He’s had work published but has real problems paying the rent and has got involved in an illegal fake sublet scam. Out of the blue, an old high-school acquaintance appears; this is Whit (Whitmer Thomas), a needling, wheedling guy who has come to LA to break into acting. Whit wants to hang out with Clay but he’s someone that Clay doesn’t especially want to befriend.</p><p>What makes it more awkward is that Whit is a ghost.

<p>Right-backs steal the show at Old Trafford, questions for Howe and a turning point for Chelsea?</p><p>Full-backs don’t often grab the headlines, and sure enough they didn’t at Old Trafford as Rodrigo Bentancur, Rasmus Højlund and Marcus Rashford all scored classy goals. But the best player on either side, according to the WhoScored.com ratings, was the right-back. For Spurs, Pedro Porro earned 8.1 out of 10 for a fearless attacking display that included an assist when his pinpoint corner picked out the peroxide head of Richarlison. Ange Postecoglou says he wants his players to stop thinking of themselves as defenders or attackers, and Porro is both at once. For Manchester United, Diogo Dalot did even better with a rating of 8.2. If he was less buccaneering than Porro, he was the more polished defender, making crucial interceptions and heading off the line. One of the two, surely, should have been player of the match – but another right-back, Gary Neville, gave the award to Bentanc

<p>The psychologist and researcher’s persuasive inquiry into how life’s struggles take their toll is full of hard-won wisdom</p><p>Vincent Deary is a clinical and academic specialist in fatigue, in the ways in which we might be mentally and physically spent by life. This book, part memoir of his working practice, part inquiry into the ways in which mental health is undone, is a sequel to an earlier volume, <em>How We Are</em>, published in 2015. The chronology is pertinent. The trajectory of those intervening nine years of austerity, and pandemic, and precarity, serve to make this volume both inevitable and urgent. Sleeplessness and anxiety have been among the few growth sectors in that decade. If Deary’s previous book was, just about, a meditation on how we might thrive in the world, this one is a subtle catalogue of the ways in which we fail to do so. One of his colleagues has a phrase for our prevailing psychological moment: “It’s like we are always one step ahead of the hounds.”<
