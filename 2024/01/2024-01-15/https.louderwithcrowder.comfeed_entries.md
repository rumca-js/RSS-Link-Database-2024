One, Trump got rich before he got into politics whereas it is usually the other way around. Two, Trump truly loves his supporters and that is not so obvious with people like Sleepy Joe. But the biggest difference between him and the current president is that he delivers pizza to first responders in frigid Iowa, while Biden can barely pick up his ice cream cone.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

That was never a thought because it is so foolish. But the left has taken the term “inclusive" to a whole new extreme. Rather than focusing on including people based on insignificant birth traits, the Federal Aviation Administration is focusing on hiring people who suffer serious mental conditions, including “severe intellectual” disabilities, psychiatric problems, and physical and mental disorders. </p><p>That is how deranged the term “inclusive” is. There is absolutely no reason someone with a severe intellectual disability should be charged with regulating aviation, especially when passengers are involved. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

If you wanted an elevator pitch over what a failure President Puddinghead has been, this is it right here.</p><p>At issue is Michelle Obama's recent comments. She won't calm down and is "terrified" about the prospect of losing in 2024. Critics say she's the one Democrats will replace Biden with when the time is right for them to do so, because you know they're sitting back and waiting for the time to be right to do so.
