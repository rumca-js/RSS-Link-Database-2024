<p>Is Java ancient yet? The kind of programming language used by old timers who prattle on about front panels with blinking lights and the days of floppy disks? Or is it still hip, with all the latest language enhancements for intuitive coding and top-notch performance? Maybe Java is somewhere in between: a mature language, but young at heart.</p><p>Close to 30 years ago on May 23, 1995, Java officially entered the world. It began as an enabling technology called “Oak” for a set-top box that Sun Microsystems imagined would soon colonize the American living room. That plan didn't work out, not at first, anyway. But the language grew into one of the core foundations for modern software, running on everything from tiny sensor chips to large server boxes.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3711866/11-reasons-the-new-java-is-not-like-the-old-java.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709489/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">Large language models</a> (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude 2 have captured the public’s imagination with their ability to generate human-like text. Enterprises are just as enthusiastic, with many exploring how to leverage LLMs to improve products and services. However, a major bottleneck is severely constraining the adoption of the most advanced LLMs in production environments: rate limits. There are ways to get past these rate limit toll booths, but real progress may not come without improvements in compute resources.</p><h2>Paying the piper</h2>
<p>Public LLM APIs that give access to models from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic impose strict limits on the number of tokens (units of text) that can be processed per minute, the number of requests per minute, and the number of requests per day. This sentence, for exampl
