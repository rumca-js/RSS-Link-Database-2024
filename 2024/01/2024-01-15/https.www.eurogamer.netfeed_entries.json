href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/WoqACiE90EM?si=TEy7Fyc_Xi74AFUt\">XboxEra</a> podcast, reliable insider Shpeshal_Nick said the game, codenamed Project Tatanka, had seemingly been cancelled.\n</p><p>\nWhile officially unannounced by Microsoft itself, Certain Affinity had discussed the project publicly in broad terms several times, and said in late 2022 that it had <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/studio-rumoured-to-be-making-halo-infinite-battle-royale-offers-fresh-tease\">been in the works for more than two years</a>, with nearly 100 people then working on it.\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-battle-royale-reportedly-cancelled-after-yea", "link":

<p>The developer of the recently struck down Portal N64 port has shed some more light on what happened and told fans to not be mad at Valve.</p><p>Last week, James Lambert announced he had <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-asks-portal-64-developer-to-cease-project-following-nintendo-concerns\">taken down the playable build of Portal 64 at Valve's request</a> due to its dependence on \"Nintendo's proprietary libraries\". </p><p>In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdBzok8GjA0\">update video</a> uploaded over the weekend, Lambert said he expected Valve would ask him to take Portal 64 down \"because it's their IP on a Nintendo console\". \"Somebody from Valve reached out to me and I was put in contact with their legal team,\" he revealed.</p> <p><a
