It has come to pass that lava is flowing into Grindavík, a thriving town where people have built their lives, engaged in fishing and other occupations and created a community in harmony with God and one another.</p><p>Although we now find ourselves in turmoil, we must hold onto hope. In some cases, this hope may be based in faith.</p><p>Lava once spilled out over the Vestmannaeyjar islands and ash covered the community. But the lychgate at the church there didn’t burn. The words ‘I live and you all will live’ stood on the gate and stand to this day.</p>
