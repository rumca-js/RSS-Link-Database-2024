Shrek and Donkey will forever be one of the best animated duo's in history.  When Shrek first hit theaters audiences fell in love with not only the characters but the story and it's parody on fairy tales.  Though the villain of this animated film, Lord Farquaad, may have been a parody of Disney's most powerful executive.  Shrek will forever be a beloved children's movie, but as you peel back layers of the onion it seems there's a lot more behind the curtain than audiences realize.
