		The world is about to receive its first region-wide digital economy agreement covering areas such as digital ID, digital payments, data flows, trade and much more.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is hoping that its ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) will harmonize digital economies across the 10-country bloc. But while policies can help digital transformation, socio-economic differences across the region and different regulatory regimes are posing challenges, writes Joo-Ok Lee, the World Economic Forum head of regional agenda for Asia-Pacific, in a new <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/01/asean-building-trust-digital-economy/">explainer</a> on the initiative.

		The age-verification/porn debate will never end because every law takes a freedom away and there's always someone with a stricter moral code or purer definition of health.

That's good for the biometrics industry.

Most governments will implement laws to prevent children younger than 18 from being exposed to pornography. And because few standards exist yet, the best elevator pitch -- not market share – likely will prevail for a few more years.

Regardless of how public opinion shifts, short of the rare verification bans, vendors can count on revenue from new features that accommodate the new virtue.

		Selfie biometrics remain a popular tool for digital ID verification, authentication and KYC, with new integrations and partner developments across the UK and Europe for firms including Yoti, Daon, iDenfy and FaceTec. But features such as liveness and channel artifact detection will become increasingly important as deepfake fraud techniques achieve a new level of realism.

Startup <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/hummingbirds-ai">Hummingbirds AI</a> says its continuous facial authentication software is the world's first secure shared web browser.

It reportedly scans users' faces. If an approaching face matches an authorized user, the app pulls up the relevant profile as they approach a device. It is said to also launch the applications and information that were present during the last session.

The company says the software increases security without passwords and other biometric scans in environments where multiple authorized people share devices.

		<em>By Reed McGinley-Stempel, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://stytch.com/">Stytch</a></em>

In the ever-evolving tapestry of cybersecurity, 2024 marks a pivotal juncture. We've witnessed a paradigm shift from the traditional bulwarks of password protection to the avant-garde of biometric authentication with the meteoric rise of passkeys over the past year. This transition heralds a new era of security -- one that promises both impenetrable robustness and seamless user experience. Yet, amidst this progress lies a hidden Achilles' heel: the vulnerability of session security post-authentication. This overlooked facet is pivotal in fortifying our digital domains against the insidious threat of session hijacking.

		The London police have deployed facial recognition during protest actions in support of Palestine and Israel over the last weekend to identify people bearing offensive placards and banners and committing other types of offenses.

On Saturday, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and other groups led a march through the city in support of Palestine while on Sunday, another rally was held in support of Israel on London’s Trafalgar Square.

Before the events, the London Metropolitan Police announced they would be using facial recognition to compare CCTV stills and images shared on social media against a database of images held on the police custody system.

During the pro-Palestine protest, a total of six people were arrested, the BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk

		In the near future, all Ethiopians seeking government services will have to present a digital ID, the executive director of the Ethiopia National ID program (NIDP), Yohade Zemichael, is quoted as telling local news portal <a href="https://shega.co/post/no-digital-id-no-service-ethiopia-to-enforce-mandatory-digital-id-requirement-to-access-government-services/">Shega</a> in an interview.

According to Zemichael, the move is part of a government plan to ensure that all government services are integrated into the digital ID.

Although under four million people have so far been enrolled for the digital ID dubbed Fayda, the country expects to register 90 million eligible citizens by 2028. The initial deadline for this target was 2025, but that is no longer po

		Ugandan authorities are studying a plan which may require citizens holding old and expired cards to hand them back before new ID cards are issued to them in the new dispensation.

This idea is being considered to discourage a common phenomenon in the country whereby money lenders collect ID cards from borrowers as collateral for loans, <a href="https://www.dispatch.ug/2024/01/10/ugandans-must-provide-old-national-ids-for-new-ones-in-mass-registration-says-nira/">reports</a> Kampala Dispatch.

		Nations such as Kenya, Namibia, Pakistan and Russia have been enforcing measures at different levels related to biometric SIM registration. A January 1 deadline for the exercise in Namibia has been pushed to March 31 to allow more time for compliance, while thousands of SIM cards were blocked in Russia at the close of last year for lack of proper identification information. In Kenya, a rise in mobile money fraud has been linked to SIM cards that were registered remotely. In Pakistan, officials of the Telecommunications Authority (PTA) recently launched raids which led to the seizure of SIM cards that were illegally activated.
