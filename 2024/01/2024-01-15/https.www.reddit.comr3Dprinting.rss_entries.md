Was wonderin wether you think selling prints like the one attatched is a viable buisness idea? The printing time was around 30 hours and the painting time was around 50-60 hours so it is a pretty time consuming product so not sure how I would sell something like this to make a profit. How much do you think something like this is worth? Just curious to get your opinions. Print was done on a bambu p1s with the standar 0.4 nozzle</p> </div
