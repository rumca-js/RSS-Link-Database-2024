Then two was standard.  Now it's common for even\nrelatively low end systems to be able to give you more mixes than you\nneed, and in some scenes a separate stereo mix for each each member's\nin-ears is standard.  On the other hand, we generally haven't seen an\nincrease in the number of inputs.  What changed?  Asymptotic\ncomplexity!\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nWith a traditional analog mixing board, a large part of the cost is\nproportional to the product of your inputs and your outputs.  For each\ninput you need to decide how much should go to each output, which\nmeans at least a little knob.  If a board has <code>N</code> inputs, then every\nadditional output requires another <code>N</code> knobs.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWith a digital board, however, it's all virtual.  You need hardware\nfor each input (<code>N</code>) a", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/live-sound-big-o-improvements", "date_published": "2024-01-15T08:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
