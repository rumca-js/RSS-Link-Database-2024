<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) could file “a sweeping antitrust case” against Apple as soon as the first half of this year, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/technology/antitrust-apple-lawsuit-us.html">according to</a> <em>The New York Times</em>. The report says the agency is in “the late stages” of its investigation, focusing on the company’s control over hardware and software services and how its “walled garden” approach has allegedly made it harder for rivals to compete and customers to switch to competing products.</p>
<p><em>The New York Times</em> report says the investigation has expanded beyond what was previously reported, according to people with knowledge of the meetings. Among other areas, its scope has allegedly covered how the Apple Watch is more tightly integrated with iPhone services than rival wearables and how it locks competing platforms out of iMessage.</p>

<p>An investigative <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-05/twitch-clips-feature-being-used-to-exploit-minors">report</a> from <em>Bloomberg</em> paints a disturbing picture of Twitch’s difficulties in moderating the livestreaming platform —&nbsp;especially its Clips feature, which allows users to preserve short videos. The outlet reports that, after analyzing about 1,100 clips, it found at least 83 with sexualized content involving children. Twitch removed the videos after it was alerted, and a company spokesperson wrote to Engadget in an email that it has since “invested heavily in enforcement tooling and preventative measures, and will continue to do so.”</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em> highlighted one incident that exemplified the problem with Clips’ permanent nature on the otherwise transient platform. It recounts the unsettling story of a 12-year-old boy who took to Twitch last spring “to eat a sandwich and play his French horn.” He soon

<p>It’s the week before CES officially kicks off in Las Vegas, but our fingers are already tired from typing up a ton of early news. In this episode, Cherlynn and Devindra discuss the big topics they expect to see at CES 2024 (AI PCs will be huge, we swear!), as well as some of the stories that have already landed, like Dell’s revamped XPS line. Also, we explore some of 2023’s biggest winners and losers (just take a guess where Twitter ends up), and we chat about Apple Fitness+ highlighting Super Bowl halftime performers. And for a bit of fun conjecture, we explore the possibility of Apple purchasing Peloton to bolster its health ambitions.</p>
