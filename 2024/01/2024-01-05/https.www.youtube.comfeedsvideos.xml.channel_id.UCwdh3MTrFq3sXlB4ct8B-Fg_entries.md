In this video, we'll show you two different styles for painting your movement trays for Warhammer: The Old World – a muddy Bretonnian battlefield, and an ancient Khemri desert. Using just a few paints for each style, you can create some great-looking transportation for your undead hordes and knightly battlelines. 

If you're new to painting, our Citadel Colour Painting Essentials playlist hosts an array of beginner-friendly videos to help you get started.
