Chinese netizens commented when they saw the employee dancing, that they "didn't find it cheerful, but rather inexplicably heartbreaking. " It seems to be a reflection of the restaurant industry in China today: restaurant owners are racking their brains to attract customers. In the restaurant business, employees are burdened with the high pressure of daily existence. Even the happiest melody can't cover up their exhaustion and helplessness.
China's official figures are usually somewhat embellished. According to the data from Enterprise Search Qichacha, from January to October 2023, China's national restaurants added a total of 3.501 million, 374,000 more than the same period in 2022 when the epidemic was on. But at the same time, from January to October 2023, a cumulative 1.056 million restaurants closed in the country.
