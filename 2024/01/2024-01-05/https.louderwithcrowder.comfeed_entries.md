They hate it so much that it not only gets them mad. They also tend to have a knee-jerk reaction where they go into a panic that is similar to how a chicken would react when its head is cut off. This is what happened to NBC's Dasha Burns when she tried to throw some race-baiting questions at Vivek Ramaswamy. </p><p>It was just a few days ago when Ramaswamy<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/vivek-ramaswamy-wapo-white-supremacy" target="_blank"> annihilated a WaPo </a>reporter after she asked him to condemn white supremacy. You could not see the reporter but her name is Meryl Kornfield and she has much, much lighter skin than Vivek, who has what liberals call "colored" skin, due to the fact he is from India. </p><p>Can an Indian American even be a "white supremacist" by definition

They covered a lot. There is a fun clip of them sh*ting on vegans floating around. And one area they discussed is the extreme tactics Democrats are using to remove any opponent from the ballot.</p><p>Sheridan's comments are what I found interesting, because I rarely hear from people who follow politics but come from, for lack of a better phrase, the "center." It's either people entrenched on the Right (we can smell our own) or Leftist progressive twats. Sheridan seems like someone <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/yellowstone-season-premiere-red-state" target="_blank">to the Left of all of us at LwC</a>, but <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/yellowstone-creator-hbo" target="_blank">to the right of the Joe Biden De

Hours after the White House announced he was kicking off his campaign with a Saturday speech claiming everyone who disagrees with him is white supremacist (I'm paraphrasing), a WaPo journalismer asked Vivek to condemn white supremacy twice. Let's focus on this one sentence from Vivek's response.</p><p>"I know you're going to go print this headline tomorrow, I know how your game works, 'Vivek Ramaswamy Won't Condemn White Supremacy.'"</p><p>She did it anyway.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
