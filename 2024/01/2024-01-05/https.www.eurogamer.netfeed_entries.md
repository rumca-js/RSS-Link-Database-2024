Epic's Unreal Engine 5 is swiftly becoming the engine of choice for current generation gaming. It's not hard to see why: it combines ease of use and flexibility with some of the most advanced rendering tech in the industry, especially with its Lumen and Nanite systems. At the same time, that sophistication poses a challenge for lower-power platforms, which often aren't the target for Unreal Engine 5 projects - and that extends to Valve's Steam Deck.</p><p>The Linux-powered portable powerhouse is capable of some impressive feats, but more advanced titles often don't scale well to the system. So is Unreal Engine 5 a bridge too far for the diminutive handheld or does Epic's boundary-pushing tech scale down better than you might expect? 
</p><p>
As of early 2024, we have a nice variety of early UE5 software to take a look at - mostly

Baldur's Gate 3 includes an incredibly touching tribute to a player's father living with Alzheimer's.
</p><p>
To fully appreciate this tribute, we need to go back a few years. When Baldur's Gate 3 was still in early access, forum user Solfalia messaged Larian to thank the studio for releasing Act I, despite the game not being complete. This release allowed Solfalia to play the game - as it was at the time - with their father, who had recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Their father had played other Larian games in the past and was a fan, so this opportunity meant a lot to them both.
</p><p>
"This Early Access means that this Xmas I'll be able to go on an adventure with him one last time, and I know he'll enjoy it," Solfalia wrote in their <a href="https://forums.larian.com/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;

Ubisoft's upcoming 2.5D Metroidvania game Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown has been developed to be "accessible by design", with a host of features that aim to make it an approachable release for all.
</p><p>
In a new video from the developer focused specifically on accessibility, the team shared how they have approached this release, with senior gameplay programmer Christophe De Labrouhe stating "Metroidvania games can be quite hard, and this one can be quite hard too". 
</p><p>
But while The Lost Crown can be challenging, the team doesn't want this to put players off, and so has included a variety of accessibility options as standard. This includes larger text by default, no quick time events and "no colour-based feedback". In addition, there will be options that will allow players to customise the game

Developer Larian is working alongside Microsoft to sort out "annoying and uncool" account bans, which can happen when Baldur's Gate 3 footage containing nudity gets uploaded to Xbox servers. 
</p><p>
This all stems back to the weekend, when Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/18u5pnj/xbox_users_do_not_record_game_clips/">Daddy-Vegas</a> warned other Baldur's Gate 3 players about capturing certain footage in Larian's award-winning RPG. The Redditor recorded "some naked camp time fun", which they planned to share with their brother. Xbox then automatically uploaded the footage to its servers.

Atlus has released the intro video for Persona 3 Reload, premiering the all-new music track Full Moon Full Life.
</p><p>
Each of the games in the series features a stylish animated opening, known for their brilliantly catchy songs. Persona 3 Reload is no different.
</p><p>
The remake of the 2006 RPG brings the game up to the modern standards set by Persona 5 and that's exemplified by this opening video: it's far more detailed and story driven than the original and the new music track is something of a remix. Check it out below.

## Game of the Week: Enjoy an aimless January day in Garden Galaxy

If you're lucky enough to live near a bit of greenery you might know what I mean. One morning, for no real reason, you find yourself heading off to wander around trees and grass and mud and the odd patch of sukebind.</p><p>This kind of walk can never be planned, but it can be postponed - by the kind of miserable weather we've had the past few days. So inevitably I found myself loading up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1970460/Garden_Galaxy/">Garden Galaxy on Steam</a> and getting a bit of the same feeling going indoors. It's been wonderful, and it's our Game of the Week as a result.</p><p>Garden Galaxy is fascinating, slightly hypnotic even. I guess you could argue it's a clicker, but it has none of the usual connotations that come with clickers.
