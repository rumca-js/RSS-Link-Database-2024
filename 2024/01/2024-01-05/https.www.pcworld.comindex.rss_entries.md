<p>In April of last year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1803581/microsoft-pc-peripherals-are-now-a-collectors-item.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">announced that it was exiting the PC accessory business</a> (mice, keyboards, headsets, et cetera). While Microsoft is still planning to sell computer accessories under the more stylish (and expensive) Surface brand, its self-titled hardware was sunsetting after nearly three decades on shelves. But it looks like the designs, if not the Microsoft branding, are getting a stay of execution. Incase, a company specializing in laptop bags and sleeves, is reviving many of Microsoft&rsquo;s products in 2024. </p>

<p>Nothing beats gaming or watching movies on an ultrawide monitor, which has a bigger aspect ratio of 21:9. More screen means more immersive game play as well as more room for multitasking. If you&rsquo;re in the market for such a monitor, you&rsquo;re in luck. Samsung&rsquo;s ViewFinity S5 UltraWide monitor is on <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-34-viewfinity-s5-ultrawide-qhd-100hz-amd-freesync-monitor-with-hdr10-displayport-hdmi-black%2F6532277.p%3FskuId%3D6532277&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=2-1-2192806-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">sale for $279.99 at Best Buy</a>, which is a savings of $100. This 34-inch monitor is spacious and should provide seamless game play thanks to the 100Hz refresh rate.</p>

<p>Tech devices have an inherent expiration date&mdash;eventually batteries die, soldering breaks, capacitors burn out. You never know exactly when it&rsquo;ll be, but that day does come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s an entirely other situation when the company that creates the device also kills it with a software update. Not only that&mdash;it then dusts its hands of the problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is what you can expect from Fitbit.</p>



<p>Back in 2021, PCWorld purchased a Fitbit Charge 5 for evaluation. It did well&mdash;I ended up&nbsp;naming it a top pick among the Fitbit models you could buy then. After months of use, I moved on to test other gear. At that time, I thought Fitbit had finally turned the corner with reliability. Earlier trackers didn&rsquo;t always behave after app updates, but this one had held up smoothly.</p>
