Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic&#8217;s robotic Peregrine lander is scheduled to begin a circuitous 40-day trip to the moon with liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 2:18 a.m. ET Monday (11:18 p.m. PT Sunday). NASA TV will stream video coverage of the countdown. It&#8217;ll mark the first launch for United Launch Alliance&#8217;s&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/peregrine-moon-lander-dna-data-storage/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/peregrine-moon-lander-dna-data-storage", "date_published": "2024-01-05T17:54:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Meta fights shutdown of Seattle-area Reality Labs cleanroom by state safety regulators", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/meta.png\" width=\"1200\" /><br />Meta Platforms is asking a judge in Seattle to nullify a Washington State Department of Labor &#38; Industries order that has forced the Facebook parent company to shut down a key part of a facility where it develops and tests futuristic devices.

The Seattle startup this week revealed the slight but notable tweak to its name. The change reflects a growing product suite, according to CEO and co-founder Luis Ceze. The company launched its OctoAI product in June to help customers run, tune, and scale generative AI models.
