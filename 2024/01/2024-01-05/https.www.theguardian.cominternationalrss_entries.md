This is vital because we spend so much of our lives trying to find some version of perfection.

This can’t work in reverse – if we try to accept other people while still holding a seething bedrock of anger and hate at ourselves, we will project that anger on to other people.</p><p>I rarely speak in absolutes, but I will say it is impossible to feel for someone else what we cannot feel for ourselves.

<p>Studio bigwigs were apparently keen to ice one of the halflings in the trilogy but as the director realised, killing off a main character – just because – isn’t always the answer</p><p>It’s always tempting to wonder what might have been in the world of Hollywood blockbuster film-making. If directors were able to follow their instincts and break all the rules rather than using all the tried, tested and generally predictable techniques of screenwriting to keep the audience on their toes. What if Harrison Ford’s Han Solo hadn’t been killed off in Star Wars: The Force Awakens? The Corellian scoundrel’s demise at the hands of his son certainly raised the stakes and ensured JJ Abrams’ film would not be easily forgotten, but in retrospect might Ford’s gruff presence have grounded later instalments? It may even have made the director think twice before sparking up the narrative blunderbuss that was bringing back Emperor Palpatine from the dead in the abhorrent Rise of Skywalker. After all

<p>With major new films from Lynne Ramsey, Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Eggers, the year promises a feast for fans</p><p>Polaris will be the fifth feature film completed in the 25-year career of the unprolific yet consistently excellent Lynne Ramsay, and her first since 2017. She works with a glacial patience matching the one sentence of information known about her next project: “Set in Alaska during the 1890s, an ice photographer meets the devil.” With real-life couple Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara as the only announced cast, either one could conceivably play either role, and both combinations would be equally tantalizing. But Ramsay is a singular talent, irreplaceable and irreplicable in her fluency with psychological violence and expertly calibrated fusions of brutal realism with stylistic liberation. Her sojourn into the frigid wilds brings her into unfamiliar territory, though the elemental minimalism in those endless expanses of snow and ice fits right in with her focus on
