		Half of the 2024 operational commitments made by the U.S.' top transportation security agency involve digital identity.

Officials with the Transportation Security Administration have <a href="https://www.performance.gov/cx/dashboard/actionplans/2023/2023-hisp-action-plan-dhs-tsa.pdf">published</a> their four-part action plan for the year. It includes expanding its mobile driver's license pilot and the use of facial recognition in airports.

They say they will increase from seven to nine the number of states participating in a pilot program designed to test the use of mobile driver's licenses and digital IDs at TSA stations. In May, the TSA reportedly <a href="https://www.hstoday.us/featured/tsa-expands-biometric-and-digital-identity-operational-assessments-after-promising-ear

		Biometric digital identity services firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/trust-stamp">Trust Stamp</a> has filed another patent for tokenized identity as it could help meet increasingly strict global biometric data regulations.

A provisional patent application for the technology named Stable IT2 was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The technology uses a cryptographic token generated from a user’s face biometrics.

Tokenizing turns biometric data into an abstract, anonymized set of vectors, eliminating the exposure of sensitive data. Trust Stamp hopes its technology will become the new standard for biometric authentication as it allows users more control over personal data, aligning privacy and data minimization principles, according

		<a href="https://www.revfin.in/">RevFin</a>, an Indian fintech company that uses biometrics and psychometrics in loan underwriting and management for electric vehicles, has received $14 million in funding led by Omidyar Network to continue expanding. The company says it is “building India’s largest lending company.”

RevFin uses an alternative underwriting technique that mixes psychometric and biometric “tests” to predict the likelihood that someone will pay back a loan.

The company uses a low touch digital model and uses an app to verify a customer's identity. It uses biometrics to compare a video of an individual to the face on their ID document.

The app determines the customer's honesty by having them respond to a series of questions about themselves referring to i
