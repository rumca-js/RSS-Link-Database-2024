Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic&#8217;s robotic Peregrine lander is scheduled to begin a circuitous 40-day trip to the moon with liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 2:18 a.m. ET Monday (11:18 p.m. PT Sunday). NASA TV will stream video coverage of the countdown. It&#8217;ll mark the first launch for United Launch Alliance&#8217;s&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/peregrine-moon-lander-dna-data-storage/">Read More</a>

The dispute involves a cleanroom at Meta&#8217;s &#8220;Matrix&#8221; facility in Redmond, Wash., according to a petition filed Wednesday in King County Superior Court, asking the court to vacate a Dec. 18 order by L&#38;I&#8217;s Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The facility is the headquarters of Meta Reality Labs, where the company develops technologies that work in conjunction&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/meta-fights-shutdown-of-seattle-area-rd-cleanroom-by-state-safety-regulators/">Read More</a>

The Seattle startup this week revealed the slight but notable tweak to its name. The change reflects a growing product suite, according to CEO and co-founder Luis Ceze. The company launched its OctoAI product in June to help customers run, tune, and scale generative AI models. It&#8217;s part of an evolution of the company&#8217;s offerings that now support image generation and text generation applications. &#8220;We now have tens of thousands of users and run billions of inferences regularly,&#8221; Ceze told GeekWire. &#8220;The time was right for us to make the switch to better reflect the value we&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/heres-why-seattle-startup-octoml-changed-its-name-to-octoai/">Read More</a>

University of Washington astronomer Matthew McQuinn will receive a grant of $175,000 to flesh out his plan for a solar-system-scale interferometer capable of determining cosmological distances with precision that&#8217;s an order of magnitude beyond what&#8217;s possible today. The plan would require building and launching a constellation of four radio dishes, each measuring at least several meters (yards) in diameter. The detectors would have to be&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/nasa-niac-deep-space-interferometer/">Read More</a>
