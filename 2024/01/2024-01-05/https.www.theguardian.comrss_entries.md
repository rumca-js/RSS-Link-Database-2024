<p>In address near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, US president tore into Donald Trump like never before, including calling him a ‘loser’</p><p>This time it’s personal. On Friday Joe Biden tore into his predecessor Donald Trump as never before. He brimmed with anger, disdain and contempt. He apparently had to stop himself from swearing. So much for “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/michelle-obama-stephen-colbert-catchphrase-b2225386.html">when they go low, we go high</a>” – and plenty of Democrats will be just fine with that.</p><p>If Biden was seeking to jolt his half-conscious 2024 re-election campaign into life, this may have done the trick. The palpable loathing of Trump took a good 10 or 20 years off him. Keep hating like this and he might do a Benjamin Button all the way to election day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/05/biden-january-6-anniversary-speech-trump-democracy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This was a kind of non-game. It washed over Craven Cottage, leaving little impression on anyone present. There was no intensity, no jeopardy and no hint of Rotherham causing an unlikely upset. Their sole aim was damage limitation and they at least succeeded on that front, albeit without ever making any pretence of actually trying to end Fulham’s interest in the FA Cup.</p><p>It was all understandable enough. Rotherham are bottom of the Championship, seven points off Huddersfield Town in 21st place, and have three wins in the league all season. They could be forgiven for allowing realism to trump romance. Perhaps Leam Richardson’s side even regarded a 1-0 defeat against mid-table Premier League opposition as a kind of moral triumph.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/05/fulham-rotherham-fa-cup-third-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Political adviser during the New Labour era until the 1998 Lobbygate scandal who became a psychotherapist<p>When Peter Mandelson was thinking of hiring Derek Draper as a research assistant in 1992, he called a well-placed Labour colleague for a reference. He was advised that his young candidate was “rough, tough and ruthless”. The description was meant to be discouraging, but Draper nevertheless got the job and thus secured his foot on a ladder that would give him a privileged view of the political operation that became Tony Blair’s New Labour government.</p><p>For just over a decade, Draper, who has died aged 56 after a long period suffering the effects of Covid, was one of the most familiar figures behind the scenes at the interface between journalism and politics in the bars at Westminster, in the dining rooms of Pall Mall and among the cushioned comforts of the plusher Soho clubs.

While their neighbours from St James’ Park play in the division above them, their record in the competition over the past two decades has been fairly atrocious and has not improved in recent seasons under the new ownership regime. While Newcastle may have rocketed up the Premier League since the arrival of their Saudi owners, their FA Cup woes have continued and even under the transformative hand of Eddie Howe, they have twice been embarrassed in the third round by lower-league opposition. Given their lengthy knack list and appalling away form, there is every chance that run of early exits could continue on Saturday when Sunderland welcome them to the Stadium

<p>Back from the brink of extinction, the Golden Globes returns this month to declare awards season open – but would Hollywood rather look the other way?</p><p>In 2021, the Golden Globes were almost sidelined into extinction.

What merit was there in being celebrated by such a discredited society? And isn’t all that hoopla a bit distasteful in the age of Covid?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/05/do-the-golden-globes-still-matter">Continue reading...</a>

There emerged <a href="https://twitter.com/KarenFaz/status/1740081932757553210?s=20" title="">a short clip</a> from a 1997 edition from the BBC guffaw-fest They Think It’s All Over featuring a blindfolded Rory McGrath and Gary Lineker feeling the bumps of a full-kit Sean Dyche and fellow members of the Chesterfield team that had reached that season’s semi-finals. The players, and their manager, John Duncan, standing shyly at the back, were greeted with warm applause.</p><p>The tale of that Chesterfield team is well told. Kevin Davies, their teenage striker, scored a hat-trick against his future club Bolton in the fourth round. A classic Old Trafford 3-3 semi-final with Middlesbrough will be forever recalled

<p>Inspired by the artist Donald Judd, we focused on colour, pattern and texture</p><p>Retired couple Patricia Lynch and Gwen Williams had been living in their north London terrace for more than 20 years when they realised they had a tough decision to make: renovate or relocate. Lynch bought the house in 1999, the year she met Williams, who moved in with her two years later. They had both fallen in love with the Tottenham area over the years, but the house wasn’t working for them in its current state. The pandemic lockdown finally prompted them to make a decision: to either spend their twilight years in the house they’d grown so fond of, or move and start afresh.</p><p>“We loved that we could walk our collie on the nearby marshes, and go to the theatre and be back by 11 – there’s a lot to be said for that,” says Williams, a retired solicitor. “We looked at other areas, but the housing stock was more expensive and it just didn’t make financial sense to move; plus our social life was h

A January jumper needs to be made of sturdy stuff, to keep body warmth in and draughts out, and leave minimal skin exposed.

<p>Weather observatory records period of more than 300 hours in which temperatures remained below freezing</p><p>The Chinese capital, Beijing, experienced its coldest December since records began in 1951, after a cold wave hit much of the country. Temperatures fell below -10C, alongside heavy snowfall and blizzard conditions at times. Northern and north-eastern parts of China experienced the coldest temperatures, as cold air moved southwards from the Arctic, with some areas reaching lows of -40C.</p><p>The Beijing weather observatory recorded a period of more than 300 hours in which temperatures remained below freezing, which is the longest for December since records began 72 years ago. The cold snap forced the closure of many schools and businesses in Beijing, owing to travel disruption and the stress from added heating demands. Temperatures have risen into the new year, but Beijing remains cold, with maximum temperatures reaching just above freezing so far this January.</p> <a href

<p><strong>(Cibachrome Editions)</strong><br />The leading noise musician has teamed up with Quartetto Maurice to create an album that distorts acoustic instruments to create an eerie, apocalyptic freak-out</p><p>Lea Bertucci is many things – composer, saxophonist, bass clarinettist, electronicist, and performer of unique site-specific pieces. She’s probably best known as a leading light in downtown New York’s noise scene, making discordant, drone-based music that explores unusual textures and timbres. Part of her aim, she says, is to reimagine classical music from a noise musician’s perspective: using orthodox instruments to create textures that sound eerie and discomfiting by applying electronic processing and extended techniques (overblowing, unorthodox fingering, distortion) Of Shadow and Substance is the best example of this approach: the Italian string outfit Quartetto Maurice create unearthly sounds using cellos, double basses, harps and percussion, with Bertucci providing spa

Not quite: amid all the hullabaloo about a “restructuring” at the club following Jim Ratcliffe’s purchase of a 25% stake – all that talk of job cuts and belt tightening, squad turnover, comings and goings in the executive suite, meetings between Ratcliffe and Erik Ten Hag, a fresh energy both on and off the pitch – it’s been easy to forget that commercial control of the club remains firmly in the hands of the Glazer family. Manchester United’s corporate structure splits ownership into Class A and Class B shares. Real control of the club lies with the owners of the Class B shares, which are worth 10 times the voting rights of Class A shares. Ratcliffe has spent around $1.6bn for a quarter of the club’s Class A and B shares. But critically, Class B shares

However, she makes the mistake of approaching the investigating officer on the case (Capaldi’s DCI Daniel Hegarty) head on – and before long, she’s on the back foot.

<p>We’re proud of our health-led drugs policy, but the rise of the global illegal drugs trade means we need international solutions</p><p>In the Netherlands, we used to look on the international “war on drugs” with a certain amount of disdain. Its solutions were prohibition, criminalisation, stiff penalties and sentences; our national drug policy, on the other hand, focused for decades on reducing the health risks for users – and was relatively successful. We are lenient on soft drugs such as cannabis, allowing for personal use under specific conditions. Hard drugs are technically illegal, but possession of small amounts (like half a gram of hard drugs or one ecstasy pill) is often not prosecuted. Police cracked down on the largest drug traffickers, who mainly operated locally. There was drug crime and even killings, but these remained traceable and largely manageable. Drug trafficking hardly affected our economy or daily life.</p><p>That is no longer the case. Spurred on by globalis

The usual choice, Son Heung-min, is away on Asian Cup duty while the vice-captains, Cristian Romero and James Maddison, are injured. Yet to Postecoglou, it will not be “really that significant” because the pecking order is established and the stopgap will be exactly that. It was striking to hear how gutted the manager was over Son’s absence – within the context of wishing him well with South Korea. Postecoglou lavished praise on a “generational” talent and “outstanding leader,” adding: “If you name a team of the year at the moment, he’s in it.” Son, he said, would be a “significant absence … a big loss.” Ben Davies is the most senior candidate to step in but, as Postecoglou stressed, every player must step up. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p><p><em>Tottenham v Burn
