<p>Netflix said that user engagement with games on the service tripled in 2023. “[Despite] games still being small, and certainly not yet material relative to our film and series business, we’re pleased with this progress,” the company said in its <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/NEW-FINAL-Q4-23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">earnings report</a> on Tuesday. As an example, the company pointed to the addition of the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> trilogy to the service last year, although it isn't clear how much the trilogy, which only arrived on Netflix on December 14, helped drive engagement in the final two weeks of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Netflix said that <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> has become its “most successful launch to date” in terms of installs and engagement. It didn’t say how many people had downloaded the trilogy since it was released on the platform, however. Some customers had signed up for Netflix just to play the

<p>Slowly but surely, some platforms are embracing passkeys to provide <a href="https://www.engadget.com/passkeys-passwords-authentication-security-133024414.html"><ins>an easy and more secure login alternative to passwords</ins></a>. The latest notable company to enable passkeys is <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/Safety/status/1749881895641633080"><ins>X (formerly Twitter)</ins></a>, though only for US-based users on iOS for now.</p>
<p>When you set up passkeys for an account, your device generates one public key and one private key. The private key stays on your device, while the shared public key is stored on the platform you want to sign into (in this case, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/x-corp/"><ins>X</ins></a><ins>)</ins>. Once you’re all set up, you can choose a passkey option instead of a password to log in to an X account. Your device will authenticate your identity using the public key.

<p>Hold onto your cabbages. Netflix just dropped a full trailer for its forthcoming live-action adaptation of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender.</em> It actually looks pretty cool, surprising fans who have been dreading a repeat of the disastrous 2010 film adaptation. The vibe is on point, calling to mind the source material, and the casting department looks to have done a fantastic job. Just look at Sokka, as portrayed by Ian Ousley.</p>
<div id="664faf4615574143b97fa8b9346d7bad"></div>
<p>This is the second trailer for the show, but the first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflixs-live-action-avatar-the-last-airbender-series-gets-its-first-trailer-104024809.html"><ins>was more of a teaser.</ins></a> The new trailer features two and a half minutes of footage, complete with jokes, action set-pieces and plenty of appearances by the franchise’s resident cutie-pies, the air bison Appa and winged lemur Momo. They are both CGI, but look pretty good to me.</p>

<p>I say Netflix “technically” received the most nominations because it depends on your point of view. Disney actually scored 20 nominations across various categories, but only when you don’t split up its various sub-brands. Remember, Disney owns just about everything, including 20th Century Studios, Hulu, Lucasfilm Ltd., Marvel Studios, National Geographic Documentary Films, Pixar Animation Studios and Searchli

This might be helpful if you have a lot of recurring tabs open. When you click ‘Organize Similar Tabs,’ the AI will aggregate open pages together based on topics.

<p>If you’re a PC hardware geek who’s been dreaming of a laptop that you can upgrade far beyond the life cycle of a typical machine, Framework's modular notebooks must seem like a miracle. The American company has a straightforward pitch: What if your laptop could be nearly as customizable as a desktop, with the ability to swap components out for repairs and upgrades? What if we could put an end to disposable hardware? We were intrigued by<a href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-review-150001399.html"> Framework's original 13-inch notebook</a> and its<a href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-modular-repairable-chromebook-review-173035156.html"> Chromebook variant</a>, despite some rough edges and a basic design. Now, with the Framework Laptop 16, the company is targeting the most demanding and (arguably) hardest group of PC users to please: Gamers.</p>
<p>Framework has already proved it can build compelling modular laptops, but can the Laptop 16 cram in powerful g

<p>Mere days after Alphabet and Google CEO Sudar Pichai warned of more job attrition this year, the company is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-is-cutting-dozens-of-jobs-at-its-x-moonshot-lab-203505073.html">shedding more staff, at its moonshot lab</a>. Alphabet is also restructuring X (not to be confused with what used to be called Twitter) to make it easier to spin out projects with backing (read: money) from outside investors.</p>
<p>X division head Astro Teller told staff in a memo that the company was “expanding our approach to focus on spinning out more projects as independent companies funded through market-based capital.”</p>

<p>Intuit is once again facing consequences for misleading advertising that claims it offers "free" services. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/01/closer-look-ftcs-ruling-intuits-free-claims-deceived-consumers">banning TurboTax's maker from claiming services are free</a> when most customers will end up having to pay. "We find that Intuit's ads on their face, expressly or by strong implication, conveyed to reasonable consumers the message that they can file their taxes with TurboTax for free," <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/d09408_commission_opinion_redacted_public.pdf">the FTC concluded</a>. "Respondent's claims of free filing are false for roughly two-thirds of U.S. taxpayers, who do not meet Intuit's simple tax return qualifications and are therefore ineligible to file for free with TurboTax."</p>
<p>The FTC further emphasized that companies can't describe a product as "free, free, free" whe

<p>There are plenty of Engadget staffers who have been forced to suffer through karaoke nights with me. And they can attest to the fact that I have the singing voice of a chain smoking diner waitress and the vocal range of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGpf6B8EvVY">mid'80s speech synthesizer</a>. And yet, I just cant help myself. I have zero shame. There's nothing out there that will magically make me a good singer, but a healthy dose of effects and some pitch correction courtesy of a <a href="https://www.boss.info/us/products/ve-22/">Boss VE-22 Vocal Performer</a>, which is making its debut at NAMM 2024, might make listening to me croon bearable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The VE-22 is the latest in Boss' long line of vocal effect units and pedals. There's an XLR input on the back with a preamp and phantom power, in case you want to use it with a condenser mic. Two XLR outputs allow you to run audio out in stereo, dual mono or wet/dry. There's also an aux input for singing al

They told the media organization that the layoffs were part of a routine reorganization, but <em>NPR</em> said the company decided to let them go to cut costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier today, Riot Games announced that it is eliminating 530 roles globally, which make up about 11 percent of its workforce.

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has provided more details about how its official X account was compromised earlier this month. In <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.sec.gov/secgov-x-account#jan22"><ins>a statement</ins></a>, the regulator confirmed that it had been the victim of a SIM swapping attack and that its X account was not secured with multi-factor authentication (MFA) at the time it was accessed.</p>
<p>“The SEC determined that the unauthorized party obtained control of the SEC cell phone number associated with the account in an apparent 'SIM swap' attack," it said, referring to a common scam in which attackers persuade customer service representatives to transfer phone numbers to new devices. “Once in control of the phone number, the unauthorized party reset the password for the @SECGov account.”</p>
