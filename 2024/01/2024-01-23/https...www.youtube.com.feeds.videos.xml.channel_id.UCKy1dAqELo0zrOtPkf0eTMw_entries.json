The mod replaced many assets with Pok\u00e9mon characters, and of course Nintendo was having none of that. Popular mod hosting site NexusMods has also begun taking down other Pok\u00e9mon-esque mods for Palworld. In other news, Riot Games has laid off about 11% of the company, amounting to roughly 530 people. Riot Games CEO explained that the company is without a sharp focus and cannot sustain such a large workforce. This continues a very troubling trend of layoffs in the tech and gaming industries. And finally, Nintendo has revealed new Joy-Con colors, this time a spring pink theme to coincide with the launch of Princess Peach: Showtime later this year.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UzjoWfy00", "date_published": "2024-01-23T23:16:43+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "IGN", "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/73UzjoWfy00/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Diablo 4: Season of the Construct - Official Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Diablo 4 is ushering in a new season with Season of the Construct for the hit hack-and-slash action RPG.
