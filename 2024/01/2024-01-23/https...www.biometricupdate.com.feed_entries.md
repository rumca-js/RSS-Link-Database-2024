		The Science &amp; Technology Directorate at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is expanding its evaluation of software for remote identity validation to presentation attack detection and spoof prevention.

Remote Identity Validation Technology Demonstration (RIVTD) Track 3 assesses the ability of selfie biometrics systems to tell legitimate users from attempts at impersonation.

Track 1 of RIVTD deals with identity document authentication, and Track 2 evaluates the capability to match a selfie to the image included on the document. The third track, assessing liveness and PAD technologies, was revealed in the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/dhs-remote-identity-validation-demonstration-details-revealed-ahead-of-first-deadline">initial anno

		The push to reach millions of digitally and financially underserved people and communities in Africa and around the world remains at full throttle with several new projects, programs and partnerships recently announced.

One such recent announcement is Mastercard’s plan to expand its Community Pass program by facilitating agriculture, healthcare and petty commerce transactions for the rural poor. Digital payments service <a href="https://www.vodafone.com/about-vodafone/what-we-do/consumer-products-and-services/m-pesa">M-Pesa</a>, widely used in East Africa, is also set to ramp up its financial inclusion efforts as part of a 10-year strategic partnership signed between <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> and Vodafone to reac

<strong>National Harbor, MD</strong>
<strong>April 10-11, 2024</strong>

DSI’s 10th Annual Identity Management Symposium will address the importance in developments across the biometric and identity management sectors as they relate to national security. Biometrics and identity management systems stand as crucial pillars in fortifying the security infrastructure of the U.S. federal government. As technology evolves, the need to safeguard sensitive information and maintain the integrity of federal accounts becomes increasingly paramount. The U.S. federal government, entrusted with safeguarding national interests and critical data, relies on these advanced sy

		Another arrest in the United States that relied on facial recognition has resulted in a horror story of misidentification and a lawsuit. The mistaken identification appears to have been made first by retail security professionals, rather than police, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/22/sunglass-hut-facial-recognition-wrongful-arrest-lawsuit">The Guardian</a> reports.

A robbery at a Sunglass Hut in Houston, Texas was robbed at gunpoint by two men. In the aftermath of the robbery, an employee of Sunglass Hut parent company EssilorLuxottica contacted Macy’s, which is a retail partner of the company, as part of its investigation, according to the lawsuit filed by Harvey Eugene Murphy Jr. Footage from security cameras that the lawsu

Password managers like Bitwarden and 1Password are giving users the option to log in to their password vaults with their biometrics using passkeys.
<h2>The slow burn of passkey uptake may pick up in 2024</h2>
In 2023, there was a sharp spike in the number of tech companies that support passkeys, the authentication method that allows users to log in with a face or fingerprint biometrics, or with a PIN. Customer uptake shows promise but remains slow, which is not a surprise to careful observers.

		<a href="https://dapplesecurity.com/about-us/">Dapple Security</a>, a digital identity and passwordless login startup, has raised $2.3 million in its pre-seed round. The startup leverages biometrics to replace passwords for more phishing-resistant authentication.

Dapple is offering a way for employees to replace all their passwords with a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/what-are-passkeys-and-how-do-they-work">passkey</a>. Dapple creates a digital "lock and key" from a user's biometrics such as a fingerprint or voice. While data used for biometric authentication is often stored locally on a given device, Dapple saves the digital lock in the cloud, allowing one passkey to be used across multiple devices rather than needing to create a k

		Hundreds of transgender Indonesians will be able to vote for the first time in the upcoming February 14 election after getting access to government issued KTP physical and digital ID cards, according to <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=e1b7210c-43ea-4db4-a650-eb60e99cc5a4">Openly</a>.

KTP IDs are needed to access public services, banking, and voting in the country. But many transgender Indonesians leave home as teenagers, find themselves living on the streets, and have a hard time applying for IDs.

Jakarta-based LGBTQ+ rights group Suara Kita has helped some 650 trans women obtain their KTP cards, joining the 95 percent of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/digital-ids-and-the-global-fight-for-identity">Indonesians with an e-KTP card</a>, though fo

Someone reportedly was able to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/secgov-x-account#jan22">perform a SIM swap</a> on a Securities and Exchange Commission phone account January 9.

Complicating the situation, SEC staff in July decided to temporarily disable multi-factor authentication on the agency’s X account to deal with problems staff were having accessing the account.

MFA was not restored until after the January 9 SIM swap attack.

		Anti-immigration voices in the United States are misleading public opinion about biometric identification rules for non-citizens traveling by air domestically and internationally.

Migrants are required to provide federal Transportation Security Administration personnel with their alien ID number or biographical data. They do not have to show a passport or national ID because in many cases, asylum seekers do not have the documents.

They are encouraged to have their photo taken at an airport by TSA, but as with citizens, facial photos or scans at airports are not mandatory. Photo IDs are <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification">required</a> of citizens.

Indian security officials have been probing likely data breaches from the use of biometric attendance devices deployed by thousands of government institutions across the country.

This comes after intelligence authorities became aware that the machines, supplied by over ten Indian firms, are embedded with microchips and hardware of Chinese origin, India Today <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/big-data-breach-threat-from-chinese-chips-in-govt-biometric-attendance-2491261-2024-01-20">reports</a>.
