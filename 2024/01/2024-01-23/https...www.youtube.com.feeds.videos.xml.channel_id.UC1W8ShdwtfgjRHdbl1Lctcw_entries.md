I colorized with new technique, restored  and created a sound design for this video  of Paris, France in 1921, You can clearly see that this is happening in broad daylight and many historical monuments and sequences of horse-drawn carriages and cars from the early 1910s and the Parisian style of dress from that period.

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
