<p>This fascinating documentary sees three sons investigate a group of Jewish retribution killers of Holocaust criminals – possibly involving their dad. It’s a wild historical education</p><p>Jack, Jon and Sam Green remember their childhoods as happy and their father, Boris, as a vital part of that. But he was “not an open book at all”. This was surely the same experience as many children of Holocaust survivors. Boris and his brother Fima, who spent years as partisan fighters in eastern Europe, hunting Nazis in the Lithuanian forests, were the only members of their extended family still alive by the end of the second world war. When Fima found Boris again, he was living 200 miles away from their home town with a handful of other survivors, wanting to die with them rather than live with all his memories and terrible losses. Fima wouldn’t let him stay, or die. “That is what I achieved in my life,” he tells an interviewer compiling their stories for a Holocaust memorial museum.

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> A wannabe actor undergoes dramatic facial reconstruction surgery in a torturously empty psychodrama</p><p>A Different Man, a New York-set fable-cum-psycho-thriller from writer-director Aaron Schimberg, is the type of relentlessly bleak movie that conflates suffering with depth. Almost all of that suffering is borne by Edward (Sebastian Stan), a loner in a damp New York apartment building isolated by a genetic physical disfigurement (Stan wears prosthetics) who wants to be an actor. Life is a parade of indignities for Edward: people either stare too long or avert their eyes from his face. His ceiling leaks. The only acting gig he can find is in a PSA for offices on how to overcome disgust to treat coworkers with physical disfigurements like humans – “ask how they’re doing occasionally like you would anyone else”. His new neighbor Ingrid (The Worst Person in the World’s Renate Reinsve) literally gasps upon seeing him for the first tim

After 18 months of turbulence, Chelsea delighted in cutting loose and turning this Carabao Cup semi-final into a demolition. Mauricio Pochettino, the coach charged with making sense of all the spending, could relax. Chelsea, who once made reaching cup finals look routine, were never in danger.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/23/chelsea-middlesbrough-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

When it comes to the personal income and assets of the super-rich, how much is too much? The answer, she suggests in Limitarianism: The Case Against Extreme Wealth, should be anything above €10m. At that point, taxation should intervene, redeploying the surplus for the common good.</p><p>Ms Robeyns is not naive. She thinks of her €10m figure as a guiding ideal to be striven for, but one that is unlikely ever to become a reality given the current way of the world. Quite. Nevertheless,

<p>Completing the trilogy that began with Band of Brothers and The Pacific, this epic mega-budget TV series tells the brutal, thrilling story of the US bombing raids that left from East Anglia. We meet its stars</p><p>Anthony Boyle is describing the sensation of sitting inside a cramped B-17 bomber flying over hostile, Nazi-occupied territory and spying a trigger-happy enemy fighter approaching fast. “You could see it small in the distance,” he says. “Then bigger and bigger and bigger – until it was right on top of you. And then the plane would shake when you were getting hit with bullets. You were really thrown about.”</p><p>Boyle is not a war veteran, though. He’s an actor talking about the experience of making Masters of the Air, possibly the most staggeringly epic and eye-wateringly expensive war series ever made (it’s rumoured to have cost $250 million).

American soul and jazz singer best known for California Soul, Mercy, Mercy, Mercy and Go Away Little Girl<p>Over the course of a long career, the American singer Marlena Shaw moved from jazz to soul and back again, searching for settings that would best enhance her fine voice. In later decades she commanded the allegiance of the British fans of the rare-groove movement, who rediscovered and particularly cherished her version, released in 1969, of a much recorded song called California Soul.</p><p>Shaw, who has died aged 81, made her first stage appearance at the Apollo theatre in Harlem, New York, when she was 10 years old. Billie Holiday was still alive and Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington were other inescapable influences on a jazz-inclined teenage singer seemingly destined to work with big bands in dancehalls and smaller groups in nightclubs.

<p>After 13 years of Conservative rule, many voters simply resent taxes, now that they no longer mean better public services</p><p>It used to be said that, in their myopia, British voters wanted European levels of public service provision on American levels of taxation. But the recent direction of travel has been towards American levels of public service provision on European levels of taxation. The risk is that tax, as an idea and institution, becomes unmoored in Britain from any lingering social democratic optimism, instead becoming another symptom of national decline.</p><p>Against this background, Britain has entered an election year in an unusual position: outside Scotland and Wales, whose devolved governments have limited room for fiscal manoeuvre, all the major political parties are arguing that taxes have risen too high.

Director best known for In the Heat of the Night, who saw film not only as entertainment but as a vehicle to confront racism and other socio-political issues<p>The director and producer Norman Jewison, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/22/norman-jewison-dead-director-moonstruck" title="">has died aged 97</a>, had a career dedicated for the most part to making films that, while entertaining, included socio-political content.

Thames Water, which has its headquarters in Reading, said that subsequent pipe bursts then made it impossible to increase water pressure to homes, meaning some people have been without water for days. Emergency bottled water stations have been set up in the affected areas. On Monday, some schools and offices were forced to close as the low water pressure meant it was unsafe to stay open.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/23/households-across-reading-left-without-water-for-three-days-after-burst-mains">Continue reading...</a>

Instead, you learn about lead character Ichiban’s job at the local job centre and his lack of dating experience.</p><p>Eventually, the plot emerges. He’s to go to Hawaii and find his birth mother, a woman named Akane previously believed dead.

She still can’t believe it: “It was a complete shock, my poor dad was getting ready to commiserate me.” But her play Intelligence, which begins with the Victorian computing pioneer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ada-lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> in the 1840s and then moves through a series of unexpected reincarnations, is a truly original, illuminating epic – and as one of the prize judges, I’d know.</p><p>The idea for the prize originated with producer Ellie Keel in 2019.

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> A magnificent lead performance from newcomer Jay Will helps to lift a rousing yet often uneven drama based on the life and death of a Yale student</p><p>How do you tell the story of Rob Peace? He was an exceptionally smart Black kid living in New Jersey, the product of a hard-working mother and a father who was convicted of murder when he was seven. His intellect and interest in science took him all the way to Yale on a scholarship, but circumstance took him back home and to a period of dealing drugs, a bright star crashing to earth, shot to death at the age of 30.</p><p>It’s a horrible, haunting tale, told by his old roommate Jeff Hobbs in the book The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace, and now adapted to the big screen by Chiwetel Ejiofor, his sophomore feature as director. Trying to find a way to sensitively bring it to life, to weave a way through a maze of assumptions and cliches, is an unenviable trek. And while Rob Peace,

<p>There isn’t a clear formula for quality and cost. But you can find good value if you know how and where to look</p><p>Wine prices can sometimes be baffling. You can never be quite sure where you stand. I write this having just read a piece on 2019 Bordeaux that deems some bottles priced between £40 and £50 to be “bargains”, another that trumpets the “cheapest price on the market” for a £173.50 bottle of Dom Pérignon, and another that says I need never pay more than £20 for the best quality wine around. They can’t all be right, can they?</p><p>Finding value in wine is perhaps more complicated than in other areas of food and drink. There isn’t a nice, clear formula that will give you X more quality for Y more money spent.

It’s a survival adventure released by a small company in Japan, which had only previously released one game. It’s called Palworld, and it’s being accurately described as “Pokémon with guns”. And if that sounds horrible to you, it seems you are very much alone. Within three days of its release on 18 January, it had sold 5m copies.

<p>Intelligent, unsettling drama focuses on the treatment of German refugees by the Danes who have endured five years as a captive nation</p><p>At the end of the second world war, around 250,000 German refugees were left stranded in Denmark. What responsibility, if any, did Danes have, after five years of brutal Nazi occupation, to look after them? That’s the question at the heart of this intelligent drama-thriller from Anders Walter. It’s a film that’s as morally complex as it gets, with some nailbiting moments; I watched a couple of scenes through my hands. What’s really interesting is that it doesn’t strike a triumphant note anywhere; no scene of flag-waving crowds cheering as the defeated Germans sling their hook.</p><p>It’s April 1945, a month before the end of the German occupation, and Jacob (Pilou Asbæk) is the headteacher of a boys’ boarding school.

Everyone loves these when I put them on the menu, they’re easy to make and incredibly versatile, because they can be filled with a variety of ingredients, both savoury or sweet.

<p>The Mortal Kombat star plays an LA cop returning home to avenge his brother’s murder in this charming piece of grindhouse schlock</p><p>On an unnamed island in the Caribbean, a cartel boss named Manuel (Edoardo Costa) kills bartender Akeem (Tristan Duncan) merely because he spills a drink on Nora (Cami Storm), a young singer Manuel was planning to lock up in his villa and force to sing only for himself, like a canary. The murder is not only grisly and bad management practice, but also consequential because it brings down the wrath of Akeem’s brother Mark (action movie star Michael Jai White, from Mortal Kombat and Black Dynamite), an LA policeman. It turns out Mark grew up on the island where he left behind an ex-wife, Akilah (Gillian White, who is married to her co-star Michael in real life), his mother and lots of old friends. Swearing to find out how Akeem really died, he moves back and a series of fisticuff face-offs ensue as he works through the chain of command, even

Your attention will drift off, and drift back in, and that train will still be there, streaming along. And even when you can no longer hear its roar – when the wind’s slap of silence takes over your ears again – you’ll still be able to see the freight carriages, taking their time to vanish from that bare landscape.</p><p>We don’t talk much about Britain’s flat places.

<p>The appalling treatment of unmarried mothers and their babies is given a profound new dimension by Cambridge professor Clair Wills as she investigates the story of a lost cousin</p><p>M<em>issing Persons</em> must have been a very difficult book to write, for certainly it is difficult to read. This is not due to any defects of style or execution – it is an expertly crafted work, at once vigorous and subtle, which manages its effects and conserves its revelations with all the skill of a master novelist. The difficulty for the reader is in struggling to absorb the pain and pity of the story, or stories, which it relates.</p><p>All families nurse guilty secrets, secret sorrows, as Clair Wills more than once acknowledges. Most of us are content to leave such matters undisturbed; not so Wills, who, with fortitude and much honest misgiving, puts on private trial a family, a generation and, indeed, an entire people and finds them guilty. She refrains, however, from condemnation.
