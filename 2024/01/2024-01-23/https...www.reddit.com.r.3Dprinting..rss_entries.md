<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm not sure if this has been discussed here previously? But recently, I visited a microbrew pub/restaurant and noticed in the corner, someone had a vending machine that was vending little plastic toys and gadgets. Everything was in a little re-sealable plastic bag as it came out of the machine, and they had this storage container on the right side of the machine that encouraged people to deposit the empty bags back in it to reuse/recycle them.</p> <p>It looked like they had a combination of 3D printed items and possibly some injection molded trinkets they were buying in bulk from some distributor to resell, plus some stickers/decals.</p> <p>This made me think, &quot;Hey! This might be an awesome way to sell of my 3D printed items to make a few extra bucks, without all the time and effort invested in spending whole days at random expos, fairs or other events with a vendor booth.&quot;</p> <p>I hadn't even considered this before, though -- so
