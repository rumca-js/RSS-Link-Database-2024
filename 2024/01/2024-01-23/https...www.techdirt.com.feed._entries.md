A far-right state lawmaker in the Oklahoma state legislature has started his first term on the civil liberties shortbus. Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican lawmaker and Southern Baptist pastor, introduced a complete ban on consensual pornography&#160;despite its First Amendment protections.

Any school shooting is horrific. But the Uvalde school shooting went far beyond the usual nightmarish levels of something that happens so often in the United States, we can actually use the modifier &#8220;usual.&#8221; Police officers entered the school three minutes after the shooter did. But they did not actually end the terror until more [&#8230;]

A couple of weeks ago, a friend sent me Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar&#8217;s and Rep. Madeleine Dean’s proposed NO AI FRAUD Act, which purports to “protect Americans’ individual right to their likeness and voice against AI-generated fakes and forgeries.” Now, there are legitimate concerns about uses of generative AI tools to create fake images, videos, [&#8230;]
