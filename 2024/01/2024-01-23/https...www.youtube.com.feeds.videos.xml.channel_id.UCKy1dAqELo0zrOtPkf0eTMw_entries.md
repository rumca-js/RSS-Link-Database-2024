In today's Daily Fix:
A popular mod for the hit survival/crafting game Palworld has incurred the wrath of Nintendo. The mod replaced many assets with Pokémon characters, and of course Nintendo was having none of that. Popular mod hosting site NexusMods has also begun taking down other Pokémon-esque mods for Palworld. In other news, Riot Games has laid off about 11% of the company, amounting to roughly 530 people. Riot Games CEO explained that the company is without a sharp focus and cannot sustain such a large workforce. This continues a very troubling trend of layoffs in the tech and gaming industries. And finally, Nintendo has revealed new Joy-Con colors, this time a spring pink theme to coincide with the launch of Princess Peach: Showtime later this year.

A new year means yet another shuffling of the films and television shows available on the myriad of streaming services that customers now have to keep track of. But despite the age of digital media promising unlimited access and more options than ever, we have often seen the opposite actually happen in practice. For a pressing recent example, most of the Star Trek films were taken off of Paramount+ in the United States at the start of 2024, with only the newest trilogy of films starring Chris Pine remaining on the service. Paramount may have promised that their in-house streaming service was the place for all your Trek needs, but if you want to watch the first 10 films on streaming, you’ll have to fire up HBO Max.

This is not an isolated incident. Although most of the major film studios now have a proprietary streaming service of some kind, the idea of every piece of media from fan-favorite franchises all being in the same place has largely proven to be a mirage. So much con

Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PlayStation 5. Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, and PC.

"Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth’s overhauled combat system injects some welcome flexibility and flash into every turn, its difficulty curve has been pruned of nasty spikes to remove the need for repetitive grinding we endured in the last turn-based game, and its spectacular Hawaiian setting is crammed with enough enjoyable activities to overload even the most ambitious of holiday itineraries. A compelling, country-hopping crime story kept me on the hook like a freshly lured barracuda for the 50 hours it took to complete, and the vibrant new job classes and unique combat arenas ensured that the fighting continued to feel fresh. Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series."

The greater the spy, the bigger the lie.
 
From the twisted mind of Matthew Vaughn (Kingsman franchise, Kick-Ass) comes Argylle, a razor-witted, reality-bending, globe-encircling spy thriller.
 
Bryce Dallas Howard (Jurassic World franchise) is Elly Conway, the reclusive author of a series of best-selling espionage novels, whose idea of bliss is a night at home with her computer and her cat, Alfie. But when the plots of Elly’s fictional books—which center on secret agent Argylle and his mission to unravel a global spy syndicate—begin to mirror the covert actions of a real-life spy organization, quiet evenings at home become a thing of the past.
