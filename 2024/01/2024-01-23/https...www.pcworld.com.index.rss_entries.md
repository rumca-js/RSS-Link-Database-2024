<p>Google Chrome is adding three new generative AI features, ranging from the creative to the practical. For now, however, they&rsquo;re an experiment &mdash; though it&rsquo;s likely they&rsquo;ll arrive in the stable version of the browser before long.</p>



<p>The three new features include AI-powered tab organization, a way to use AI to generate tab backgrounds, and an AI writing feature that will debut next month. But to turn them on, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure your version of Chrome is up to date with version M121, and you&rsquo;ll need to ensure you enable the experimental features via the Settings menu.</p>



<p>(To do so, navigate to the &ldquo;More&rdquo; menu (the three vertical dots in the top right corner) in Chrome. From there, you should see a list of settings, including one marked &ldquo;Experimental AI.&rdquo; Toggle it on.)</p>

<p>An analysis of the DRAM and flash market confirms prices in both commodities are rising sharply and could continue to do so for the remainder of 2024. This means that prices of memory modules and SSDs could be on the rise, too.</p>



<p>TrendForce began noticing the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2158035/as-flash-prices-rise-the-end-of-great-ssd-deals-may-be-near.html">increases in the spot market for DRAM and flash</a> at the end of last year. Prices had fallen for two straight years since the end of 2021. Now, the company is predicting price increases in the contract market for DRAM of between 13 to 18 percent in the first quarter alone as well price hikes for NAND flash of between 18 to 23 percent.</p>

<p>Some of the most notable PC game releases of the last few years have been former PlayStation exclusives &mdash; albeit several years after they made their debut on Sony&rsquo;s consoles. It looks like that trend is set to continue, as Sony looks for wider revenue streams outside of the PlayStation 5. In a recent interview with investors, Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said that PlayStation games will be expanding to &ldquo;PC, mobile, and cloud.&rdquo; </p>



<p>Yoshida spoke with the Norges Bank Investment Management in an extended interview <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNe1lOhE6Pc&amp;xcust=2-1-2215448-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">posted to YouTube</a> (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://insider-gaming.com/son

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to think that all USB-C cables are the same, and that manufacturers are only claiming to be superior in order to jack up the price. After all, it&rsquo;s <em>just a cable</em>, right?</p>
