Initiative 2109, which would repeal the tax, qualified for the ballot after collecting enough signatures and getting certified by the state on Tuesday. It now moves to the state legislature but will likely make its way to the ballot. The tax went into effect in 2022 and brought in nearly\u00a0$900 million\u00a0in its first year, exceeding original projections. The first $500 million collected goes toward education and child care programs, while the remainder is designated for school construction projects.

A new filing with the Washington state Employment Security Department posted Monday shows 62 workers being laid off Feb. 9 due to an office closure in Redmond, Wash. A Walmart spokesperson confirmed that the layoffs are related to the shutdown of Store No8. &#8220;Store No8 was established as a standalone model seven years ago and we\u2019ve since graduated talent and capabilities that are now fully embedded across the broader company,&#8221; a spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/walmart-lays-off-62-people-in-seattle-area-as-part-of-innovation-unit-shutdown/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/walmart-lays-off-62-people-in-seattle-area-as-part-of-innovation-unit-shutdown", "date_published": "2024-01-23T15:33:42+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "New study on coding behavior raises questions about impact of AI on software development", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3743d9d0-77a9-4f15-8e09-b755373102f0.jpeg\" width=\"1024\" /><br />Software development is one of the early use cases for generative AI. Thousands of companies big and small are already using tools such as GitHub Copilot to speed up how they build new applications and services. But while AI may boost production, it could also be detrimental to overall code quality, according to a new research project from GitClear, a developer analytics tool built in Seattle. The study analyzed 153 million changed lines of code, comparing changes done in 2023 versus prior years, when AI was not as relevant for code generation.
