<p>Docker has unveiled <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/build-cloud/" rel="nofollow">Docker Build Cloud</a>, a cloud-based build service that promises to accelerate builds of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3204171/what-is-docker-the-spark-for-the-container-revolution.html">Docker</a> images for engineering teams.</p><p>Introduced January 23, Docker Build Cloud aims to address the pain point of how much time engineering teams spend waiting on Docker image builds to complete. The company says that Docker Build Cloud accelerates Docker image builds up to 39x by offloading them to the cloud, regardless whether developers build locally or through <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3271126/what-is-cicd-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-explained.html">continuous integration</a>.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712400/docker-build-cloud-aims-to-accelerate-docker-builds.html#jump">To read this article

<p>Authentication and authorization rank among the top priorities for application developers today. While they’re often used interchangeably, they actually represent two very different things. Yet in order to ensure a secure and seamless experience for users, both must work in concert.</p><p>To illustrate the distinction between authentication and authorization, I often use the example of taking your family to Disneyland. Authentication is like the front gate where upon arrival you show your ticket and ID to the gatekeeper who checks to confirm that you are who you say you are—much like when you log onto an application in which the authentication system checks your username and password to validate your identity.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712191/a-guide-to-implementing-fine-grained-authorization.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

## Most cloud failures have nothing to do with cloud

<p>I’m often taken aback by how the press frames cloud computing failures. For instance, headlines like “The Cloud Fails to Deliver.” Those might get clicks, but they are misleading. Cloud technology has always delivered on what was promised. The issue is that human error is the core cause of cloud failures, which has not changed across generations of this technology.</p><p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/search?q=Linthicum+%2B+fail#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=Linthicum%20%2B%20cloud%20fail&amp;gsc.sort=date">As I’ve often written about here</a>, most technology failures have a single typical pattern: misunderstandings, lack of leadership, and, in many instances, lack of knowledge and experience. As we set out to drive substantial generative AI projects in the cloud, it’s time to reflect and see how we can do better.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712440/most-cloud-failures-have-nothing-to-do-with-cloud.html#jump">To read this article in

<p>Oracle’s plans to evolve Java in 2024 involve OpenJDK projects ranging from<a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/amber/" rel="nofollow"> Amber</a>, for developing smaller, productivity-oriented features, to <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/babylon/" rel="nofollow">Babylon</a>, for extending Java to foreign programming models such as GPUs, to <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/valhalla/" rel="nofollow">Valhalla</a>, for augmenting the Java object model with value objects to eliminate longstanding performance bottlenecks.</p><p>In a <a href="https://inside.java/2024/01/18/newscast-61/" rel="nofollow">video posted January 18</a>, Oracle Java developer relations representative Nicolai Parlog covered what was on the drawing board for Java this year. “Keep in mind, though, that most of the work in any given year will not be released in the same year and so many of these improvements will only be usable in 2025 or later,” Parlog cautioned
