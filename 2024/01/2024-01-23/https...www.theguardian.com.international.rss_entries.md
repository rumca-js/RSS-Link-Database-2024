When someone did, it was usually a Black person or person of color</p><p>Walking into the main hospital building at NYU on my way to orientation on my first day, I passed through what’s known as the Hall of Portraits. This is a long bank of paintings in gilded frames hanging in a corridor off the main lobby at Tisch hospital. Every single one of the faces I saw in those portraits was that of a white man. Some wore glasses, some posed with microscopes, others held a pen in hand. Doubtless, these men in the pictures were physicians and surgeons who had made important scientific advancements in their respective fields over the past few centuries. Some of the paintings looked old enough that I wondered how many of their subjects had participated in and profited from slavery or had experimented on enslaved people. They certainly would have benefited from the

<p>Move over Cumberbatch – Jonny Lee Miller’s Sherlock and Lucy Liu’s Watson saw the two timeless heroes grow into something bold and new</p><p>A murder scene with no body, baffled cops milling about. An eccentric British consulting detective picks up a marble, places it gingerly on the floorboards, and watches it roll swiftly down a corridor. Panic rooms, the detective explains to the officers trailing behind him, are heavy. And the weight of one can give the floor of an apartment an imperceptible tilt. The marble comes to a halt against a wall. The British man presses a hidden switch and, with a swoosh, a secret door opens. A gasp, a flourish, and the thrum of a violin. Cut to an ad break.</p><p>This is Elementary, the single best modern depiction of Sherlock Holmes ever committed to screen. A bold claim? Not really. Arriving four months after the end of House, in which Hugh Laurie played Holmes as a doctor, and in the wake of the almost fetishistically self-aware Sherlock,

<p>The recent restaurant industry narrative has been one of doom, gloom and closures, except when it comes to this Italian dish. So why are pizza sales growing so fast, while other brands struggle?</p><p>In 2004, when Daniel Young first arrived in London, he encountered a problem. “I’m from New York. I don’t understand a world where pizza is not a life essential,” says the food writer also known as <a href="https://youngandfoodish.com/about/">Young &amp; Foodish</a>. “In New York, we go from the mother’s breast to pizza. It’s our first solid food.”</p><p>By contrast, Britain had “no inherent pizza culture or style”. Popular chains such as Domino’s and Pizza Hut existed, but few people were passionate about pizza. It did not excite debate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/23/hotter-than-ever-how-pizza-conquered-britain-leaving-its-rivals-in-the-dust">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Voice cloning is ever more sophisticated – and can be used to impersonate a child and target their parents. So I have devised a new phone greeting for my teenagers</p><p>A friend recently got duped by a scam text purporting to be from his middle daughter, and transferred £100 to an account to cover some baffling yet, according to the text, extremely time-sensitive untoward event.</p><p>You can imagine how the scammer pulled that off. Think of everyday, low-level parental anxiety, expecting bad news when kids are anywhere farther away than the kitchen table; add the sheer believability of any bad news that starts with a 19-year-old texting: “I smashed my phone”; all a scammer has to do is lean in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/23/worried-about-ai-voice-scams-luckily-i-have-one-foolproof-solution">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Argentinian director Manuel Abramovich juxtaposes the spicier elements of porn star Lalo’s life with his loneliness</p><p>Lalo (Lalo Santos) is a sex influencer and porn star, and his job is to present his life as one long, hard, sweaty state of permanent arousal. To follow his various accounts online is to imagine a world simmering with constant sexual potential, always ready to boil over into hardcore scenarios, perhaps even involving you, his loyal follower. But even if the title of the film hasn’t clued you into the fact that Argentinian director Manuel Abramovich’s docudrama is not an enthusiastic commercial for this lifestyle, the first scene in the film will get you up to speed pretty quickly: Lalo stands alone in a busy street, people passing him by. He breaks down and begins to weep, an image of isolation in the hustle of modern living.</p><p>This isn’t an especially rare theme in modern independent queer cinema; musings on a life where explicit videos are common
