Sam Barlow - the developer behind acclaimed investigative FMV adventures Immortality, Telling Lies, and Her Story - has announced he's working on two new horror titles, including a third-person survival horror said to be for old school Barlow fans "that played Silent Hill: Shattered Memories back in the day."
</p><p>
Listings for Barlow's next two projects, to be developed at his Half-Mermaid studio, initially surfaced on Steam. However, as was the case with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/her-story-and-telling-lies-dev-sam-barlow-teases-ambitious-new-game">Immortality's first tease</a>, both pages are heavily redacted, only offering up snatches of legible text and a couple of woozy mood videos.

As Fortnite continues its apparent mission to feature all other video games within itself in some capacity (until presumably it then puts itself in itself, including all other video games within), developer Epic Games has revealed Solid Snake isn't the only Metal Gear characer joining the battle royale line-up - with Raiden also set to appear as a new premium skin.
</p><p>
Fortnite, which is currently a month into Chapter 5 Season 1, released its first major update of the year - officially known as 28.10, number fans - earlier today. It includes new Bonus Reward styles for it Battle Pass skins, and, more notably, unlocks the ability to earn the previously announced Solid Snake Battle Pass skin and themed cosmetics by completing in-game quests.

As is often the case, a range of new store-bound premium cosmetics

A little over thirteen months after its grand unveiling, Death Stranding 2 could be readying for another big reveal - with a new leak claiming more information on Hideo Kojima's sequel, including its full title, will be shared in the next few weeks.
</p><p>
That's according to ultra-reliable leaker billbil-kun who, <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ds2-death-stranding-2-voici-le-veritable-titre-du-successeur-de-death-stranding-39537">writing on Dealabs</a>, claims Death Stranding 2 will get a fresh showing within the next 15 days - possibly during an upcoming PlayStation's State of Play event, as referenced by the ever-leaky Jeff Grubb earlier this year.

Billbil-kun says they're still investigating certain aspects of Death Stranding 2's release - including whether it might launch for PC alongside

And certainly in terms of the controversy and conversation around it at launch.</p><p>If you're yet to hop on board and wondering about what you're missing, you can relax. Palworld is big and controversial; it is also absolute rubbish. It's primitive and derivative, a game that appears at first glance almost to be completely fake - the type of thing quickly mocked up for a three-second appearance on a teen's PC monitor in the background of a mid-budget TV drama. A game to be played one-handed with an N64 controller by Tony

Set in crime scenes and courtrooms, these titles revolve around defending clients while trying to solve cases in abbreviated and eccentric legal proceedings. 2019 and 2021 saw a selection of these portable games released for home consoles, and now to start 2024 we have the final mainline titles hitting PS5, Series X/S and Switch with Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy. </p><p>Those previous re-releases, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, suffered from their share of technical failings, so does the new game learn from those mistakes and make full use of the console hardware available?

Greed. Exploitation. Instability. Appropriate topics for a series (once known as Yakuza, RIP) that so often has our heroes struggle to protect innocence in Japan's criminal underbelly. But Infinite Wealth isn't just a story <em>about</em> excess, it embodies that overabundance with an almost untrackable number of things to see, do, and level up - easily making for the series' grandest entry yet while still (somehow!) tightening up its predecessor's sloppy first attempt at an RPG.</p><p>This latest entry takes our loveable goofball Ichiban Kasuga overseas to the shores of Hawaii in search of his long-lost mother, where he also runs into the series' often-resurrected main man Kazuma Kiryu, who happens to be there on a similar mission.</p><p

Dragon's Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno has weighed in on fast travel in video games. His thoughts? Travelling the traditional, 'long' way itself isn't boring. It's more about whether the game you are playing is interesting enough to keep you entertained while you travel.
</p><p>
"Travel is boring? That's not true. It's only an issue because your game is boring. All you have to do is make travel fun," Itsuno told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-director-explains-why-less-fast-travel-can-be-a-good-thing">IGN</a> when asked about fast travel mechanics.

Even as someone who considers themselves to be well versed in the fighting game community's language and terminology, I've always found Tekken to be uniquely impenetrable when compared to its contemporaries.</p><p>Whether it was due to the wealth of poorly explained legacy mechanics brought over from previous entries, the unnecessarily abstruse instructions in a character's already dauntingly large movelists, or the franchise's weird disdain for tutorials in general, improving in each new Tekken title has felt like an insurmountable task. I have reached a point in every new iteration where I had to turn to YouTube guides - more often than not recorded by some poor nervous guy heavily breathing into his microphone as he umm'd and ahh'd his way through explaining what a just frame

Union membership numbers in the UK have risen significantly, following a tumultuous period in the video game industry (which still continues today).

The Game Workers branch of the <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/">IWGB</a> union - which aims to "end the institutionalised practice of excessive/unpaid overtime" among other goals - told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/20/video-game-developers-union-membership-in-uk-soars-after-thousands-laid-off">The Observer</a> it saw its membership numbers increase by almost 50 percent between December 2022 and the end of last year.

Developer Teyon has released a major update for RoboCop: Rogue City, adding New Game Plus and more.
</p><p>
New Game Plus will allow players to redo their RoboCop shenanigans, but this time with all of those hard earned skills and Auto-9 upgrades from the first time around. This will provide the "full 'invincible robotic law enforcement officer' experience", the developer said. 
</p><p>
RoboCop: Rogue City's New Game Plus can be unlocked by finishing the game after the update is applied. This can be done from an earlier save file, so don't worry, you won't need to replay the whole thing again. Completing the game will also unlock a new Golden Auto-9 skin for you to use, or just admire. Au-right!

PlayStation head of indies Shuhei Yoshida has suggested Palworld could be on its way to PlayStation.

Yoshida responded to the official Palworld account on X (formerly Twitter) to congratulate the team on its huge success. When a fan requested a PS5 version be released as soon as possible, Yoshida replied with a simple "yes" and tagged Jingwen Zhu, PlayStation's partner development executive for China and Japan, in the post.

So does this mean Palworld could be on its way to PlayStation?
