For now, however, they&rsquo;re an experiment &mdash; though it&rsquo;s likely they&rsquo;ll arrive in the stable version of the browser before long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three new features include AI-powered tab organization, a way to use AI to generate tab backgrounds, and an AI writing feature that will debut next month. But to turn them on, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure your version of Chrome is up to date with version M121, and you&rsquo;ll need to ensure you enable the experimental features via the Settings menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(To do so, navigate to the &ldquo;More&rdquo; menu (the three vertical dots in the top right corner) in Chrome. From there, you should see a list of settings, including one marked &ldquo;Experimental AI.&rdquo; Toggle it on.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2215905/google-chrome-tests-smart-ai-powered-features-with-more-to-come.html", "date_published": "2024-01-23T19:09:28+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "DRAM and NAND flash prices are definitely rising, analyst says", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>An analysis of the DRAM and flash market confirms prices in both commodities are rising sharply and could continue to do so for the remainder of 2024.
