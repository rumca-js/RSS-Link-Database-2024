Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is a staggeringly massive RPG featuring the culmination of all that RGG Studios, and the Yakuza/Like a Dragon franchise, have worked towards over the last two decades. 

An incredibly high quality experience that doubles down on everything that was beloved about the previous entry, Infinite Wealth completes the series' transformation into a genre-leading RPG franchise.

It's tough to narrow down what makes Tekken 8 so great. The visuals are stunning, while the high-energy soundtrack sounds crisper than ever. The setting is compelling, even with some slight hiccups in the pacing. Super Ghost Battle also ensures a stream of fun battles against AI opponents.

Then you have the new Heat mechanics that deliver hype moments and intriguing strategies blended with the signature Tekken-style combos and juggles. Perhaps it's all of this wrapped in a package with so many compelling extras, the return of Tekken Ball, fun new characters and detailed training options.

Regardless, Tekken is back and arguably better than ever, setting a new standard for the series while aspiring to new heights. Check out our review before its launch on January 26th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC.
