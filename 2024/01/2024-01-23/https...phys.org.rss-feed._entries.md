A "fitness check" of regulations in five countries, meant to protect animals during transportation, has deemed that they all fall short of fully protecting animals during transport. Findings from this interdisciplinary work involving animal welfare scientists and a law lecturer which compared animal transport rules designed to protect the billions of livestock that are transported on lengthy journeys—within Australia, Canada, New Zealand, EU (including the UK) and the US—highlight serious failures.

The power of gravity is writ large across our visible universe. It can be seen in the lock step of moons as they circle planets; in wandering comets pulled off-course by massive stars; and in the swirl of gigantic galaxies. These awesome displays showcase gravity's influence at the largest scales of matter. Now, nuclear physicists are discovering that gravity also has much to offer at matter's smallest scales.

Color mixing is the process of combining two or more colors: red and green make yellow, blue and red make purple, red and green and blue make white. This process of mixing colors is the basis for the future of solid-state lighting. While currently white light is achieved by phosphor down-conversion, LED color mixing actually has a higher theoretical maximum efficiency, which is needed in order to achieve the 2035 DOE energy efficiency goals.

HABs include any event causing adverse effects on human health, socioeconomic interests, or aquatic systems. The consequences of HABs are far-reaching, ranging from the production of potentially harmful or lethal toxins to the creation of hypoxic or anoxic zones, elevated water treatment costs, and a decline in water body quality and usability.
