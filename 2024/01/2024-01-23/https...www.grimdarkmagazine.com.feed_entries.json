[{"source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "title": "REVIEW: Echo", "description": "<p>It\u2019s been some time since Marvel were producing hit after hit to mostly critical acclaim. There\u2019s been the odd piece of quality (Loki, Shang-Chi, Guardians of the Galaxy 3) but they seem lost amongst uninspiring stories (Ant-Man: Quantumania, Eternals, Thor: Love and Thunder). I don\u2019t know of anyone who asked for or wanted a series based on Echo, a side character from the underrated Hawkeye show, but I have to admit, now it\u2019s here, I\u2019m glad someone made that big call. Following the events of Hawkeye, Echo flashes back to show us the story of the deaf Choctaw girl, Maya, who lost her leg in the car crash that killed her mother. Forced to move away with her father, she trained hard to defend herself and her dad\u2019s criminal ways introduced her to the man who would become her uncle, the always amazing Vincent D\u2019Onofrio as the Kingpin. Having shot Kingpin in the eye at the end of the previous series, Echo is about this Native American young woman returning to her home and family", "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-echo", "date_published": "2024-01-23T04:25:46+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-AU", "thumbnail": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Echo-Banner.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 81, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 1, "page_rating": 81, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
