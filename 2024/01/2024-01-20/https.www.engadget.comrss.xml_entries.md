<p>NASA is trying to figure out how to reach its Ingenuity Mars helicopter after losing contact with the craft earlier this week. During its 72nd flight — a “quick pop-up” to an altitude of about 40 feet — <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/508/flight-72-status-update/">NASA</a> says Ingenuity stopped communicating with the Perseverance rover before it was meant to. It went quiet on Thursday, and as of Friday evening, NASA still hadn’t heard from it.</p>
<p>Ingenuity sends data to Perseverance, which then forwards it on to Earth. According to NASA, the small helicopter completed the ascent as planned, but ceased communications while on its way back down. “The Ingenuity team is analyzing available data and considering next steps to reestablish communications with the helicopter,” NASA said in a status update on Friday. Ingenuity had previously ended a flight earlier than it was supposed to, and Thursday’s jaunt was meant to “check out the helicopter’s

<p>Welcome back to your Saturday morning tech injectable. This week's TMA focuses on two big tech launches. First of all, Samsung started 2024 early with its flagship smartphone series, announcing three S24 models set to go on sale at the end of the month.  This time around, sure, they look like last year's phones again, but that's offset with a barrage of AI tricks and features that you can't find on any other smartphone. And isn't that the point of getting a new phone?</p>
<p>We've also got more in-depth impressions of Apple's first foray into VR/AR/XR as the Vision Pro ($3,500) goes on preorder, ahead of launch later this month. You've got big pockets right? This is the company’s first new product since 2014’s Apple Watch and our most recent impressions suggest the Vision Pro is a fluid, intelligent headset experience beyond the VR headsets we’ve seen so far. Two Engadget editors strapped on the Vision Pro for some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-o
