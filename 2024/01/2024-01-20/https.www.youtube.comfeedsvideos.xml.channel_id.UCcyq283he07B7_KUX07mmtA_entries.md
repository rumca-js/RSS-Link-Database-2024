Hot-air balloons have been around for centuries. They're certified aircraft for those looking to take the slow and scenic route, but owning one can set you back considerably â€” 30,000 euros for a smaller balloon, and 150,000 euros for a larger one. 

At Ultramagic Balloons, half the cost is attributed to the balloon itself, known as the envelope. It can take two months to complete a safe, quality envelope. And that's just the tip of the quality-control iceberg.
