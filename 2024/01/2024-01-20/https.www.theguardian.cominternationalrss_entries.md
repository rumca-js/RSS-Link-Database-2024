<p>From lightning-storm dances to reflective cups of tea, there were many gentle, silly instances that showed <strong>Michelle Brasier</strong> she was in love</p><p>It is hard to pinpoint a particular moment when I knew I loved Tim Lancaster from Tangambalanga (real place). When I first saw him looking at a dog? When he first draped a coat over my shoulders on a cold night?</p><p>We met the traditional way: in a production of Legally Blonde the musical. I was playing Elle and he was playing Warner, the arsehole who breaks up with her and inspires her to get into Harvard Law School. (What, like it’s hard?) Tale as old as time. We sang in harmony and laughed in dance rehearsals when I stepped on his feet. On closing night where there was one kiss in the script, I gave him two. And this is the moment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/21/the-moment-i-knew-on-closing-night-where-there-was-one-kiss-in-the-script-i-gave-him-two">Continue reading...</a>
