It's a significant change from the free-to-play shooter's typically weighty, long-running seasons, and could be a sign that 343i is now scaling back on the 2021 game.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinites-season-5-will-be-the-last-as-it-switches-to-smaller-updates-and-343i-works-on-new-projects?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed">Read more

When Shenzhen-based firm Elegoo offered to send their <a href="https://www.elegoo.com/en-gb/products/neptune-4-plus-fdm-3d-printer?variant=40973712457776" rel="sponsored">$350</a>/<a href="https://www.elegoo.com/en-gb/products/neptune-4-plus-fdm-3d-printer?variant=40973712457776" rel="sponsored">&pound;300</a> Neptune 4 Plus for review, I figured I'd better take them up on their offer and find out just what's possible with a modern 3D printer - and what challenges awaited me as a complete beginner. Here's what I've discovered - from the gauntlet of the initial setup process to the successes and failures that have defined the first few weeks of 3D printing.</p><p>First, the setup process. The Neptune 4 Plus comes in pieces, so you ne

## What's next for OlliOlli and Rollerdrome developer Roll7?

You could call it the OlliOlli studio but would that really be correct, because what about Rollerdrome? What about Laser League? What about Not a Hero? You'd miss half of what the studio has done.</p><p>Maybe it's that Roll7 is an inventor; I like that. Because think about it: who knew 2D skateboarding could be a thing before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olliolli-review">OlliOlli came along</a>? Hold the down button and release it to perform an ollie - it's the foundation of the game. Then gradually layer on other moves and you have an experience that feels more like playing with a tiny finger skateboard than a video game.</p><p>And who could have predicted Laser League? It had nothing at all to do with OlliOlli, so where
