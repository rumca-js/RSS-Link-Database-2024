When it comes to cosmetics and skincare, the masses tend to lean towards sweet rather than savory. That is just how humans have adapted over time. But Burt\u2019s Bees disagreed and broke massive barriers with this one. Subsequently, my faith in humanity has reached a whole new level of disappointment I could never have imagined. </p><p>Burt\u2019s Bees released four new chapstick flavors. Those flavors were ranch, carrots, buffalo, and celery. Yes, we all see what they did there. And it is wrong. These are crimes against buffalo wings and it is unlikely they will be held accountable for these actions. </p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/burt-s-bees-ranch", "date_published": "2024-01-20T12:18:45+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=51137173&width=980", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Watch: Michigan Coach Jim Harbaugh Shares Strong Pro Family Message At The March For Life", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=51137162&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C4\" /><br /><br /><p>Friday was the perfect day for a pro-life March, according to Coach Jim Harbaugh. </p><p>This was not the first time Harbaugh proudly shared a pro-life message but it was the first year he attended March for Life. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1748419808222445659\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dcnewsnow.com/news/michigan-coach-jim-harbaugh-attends-march-for-life-rally/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">According to DC News Now: </a></p><blockquote>\u201cDespite the snow and cold temperatures, thousands gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. for the March for Life rally Friday, including Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh.<br /><br />\n\u2018It\u2019s a great day, this is football weather", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/harbaugh-football-weather", "date_published": "2024-01-20T12:15:26+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=51137162&width=980", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Watch: WEF's Klaus Schwab Wants To Take Away Your Right To Vote...
