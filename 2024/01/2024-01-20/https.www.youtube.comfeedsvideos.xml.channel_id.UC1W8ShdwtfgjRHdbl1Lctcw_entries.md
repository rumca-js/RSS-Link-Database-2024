I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of London 1930s, we start with Westminster Bridge, we can see the transport link and the movement of vehicles and pedestrians. Horse-drawn carriages and early motor vehicles frequently crossed the bridge, as did buses, which were mainly double-decker and featured an emblematic open roof. 

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
