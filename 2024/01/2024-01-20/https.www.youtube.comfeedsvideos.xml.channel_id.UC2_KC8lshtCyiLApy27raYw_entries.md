Concept buildings always interest me. There’s always a good chance that the best looking stuff will never get built, and the weirdest structures are rarely even intended to get built.

Whether it’s to attract attention, or just show off some creativity, I can appreciate good concept buildings.

And these are! Or they would be, if they weren’t underwater.

But they are.

So they never got built.
