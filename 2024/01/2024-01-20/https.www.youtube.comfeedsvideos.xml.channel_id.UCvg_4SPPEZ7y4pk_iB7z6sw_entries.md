A while back this channel was mostly dedicated to covering “console variants”. Different colors and models of consoles.

Overtime I started to fall out of this, mostly because, well, time. Was taking too long to make these vids, but I feel it’s worth going back to.

So today I’m doing the original Nintendo 3DS.

I will follow this up later with a 2DS, New 3DS, and all that other fun stuff, but to give each console more than just a passing glance, this is the compromise I decided to make.
