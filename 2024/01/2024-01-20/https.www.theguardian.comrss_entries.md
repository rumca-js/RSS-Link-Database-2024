<p>A winter trip to Spain will provide the chance for the coach to focus on the key Test areas of the breakdown and scrum </p><p>England are jetting out to the Costa Brava this coming week but winter sun is only a small part of the package. While Steve Borthwick wants his players to spend some time relaxing away from their well-appointed training base of Girona, currently top of La Liga, he is also keen to ensure they are good and ready for the specific demands of a modern Six Nations Championship.</p><p>Borthwick, as he loves doing, has been digging into the stats and, before a ball is box-kicked, reckons he knows where the championship will be won and lost. Spoiler alert: it will not be all about flowing back play or individual wizardry. According to England’s head coach, the key areas will be the breakdown and the scrum, mirroring the knockout stages of the recent World Cup.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/20/steve-borthwick-england-rugby-union-six-

It’s an incredibly difficult web to weave - even Jordan Peele himself facing the odd stumble since his ground-shifting breakout – yet still so many keep trying, dissertations clumsily disguised as films.</p><p>But in I Saw the TV Glow, a buzzy, brilliant new film premiering at the Sundance film festival, the writer-director Jane Schoenbrun has made it all look so easy, crafting something loaded with meaning yet light on its feet, provoking us to discussion and debate while never feeling like an academic exercise – a movie that never forgets that it’s, well, a movie.</p><p>I Saw the TV Glow is screening a

<p>The coincidence of the ‘Little Magpie’ losing his job at Roma just as Newcastle falter is almost too perfect – or too hilarious</p><p>The Premier League, we should never forget, is essentially the most popular soap opera in the world. Yes there’s the football, the winning and losing of matches, and that is important, but alongside it runs the constant drama, the ludicrous plots, the intrigue, the operatic farce. It is the bend of the two that has made football a global obsession. All the best soap operas require a great villain and the greatest, the Dirty Den, the Paul Robinson, the JR Ewing of football is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/jose-mourinho">José Mourinho</a>.</p><p>Mourinho is 60 now, his hair white, his eyes perched above swales of shadow.

Roy Hodgson folds his glasses into a coat pocket and stands on the touchline, gazing bleakly out into the maelstrom, looking – as he often does these days – like a man reminiscing about a sandwich he once had in 1962. A cameraman spots the opportunity for the perfectly framed shot; he wheels around Hodgson and captures him from behind, staring out at a distant banner in the Crystal Palace end: WASTED POTENTIAL/ON AND OFF THE PITCH/WEAK DECISIONS/TAKING US BACKWARDS.</p><p>The natural tendency here, at least for the professional storyteller, is to superimpose some kind of human narrative on this confected tableau, to peer inside Hodgson’s brain and empt

You can see why. From the moment you dropped the needle on the New York City girl group’s first hit, 1964’s Remember (Walking in the Sand), Morton’s production style was hard to ignore. Working, so he claimed, without any experience or musical ability, he was not a man at home with subtlety or good taste. He drenched everything in echo and slathered on dramatic sound effects: screaming seagulls and crashing waves, thunderclaps, the whistle and clatter of departing trains, the squeal of tyres and the crunch of vehicles colliding at speed.</p><p>Perhaps Mo

In relentlessly pursuing his own agenda, the prime minister has lost the trust of Israelis and isolated his country<p>It was plain long before the 7 October attacks that Israel badly needed a change of leadership. That need is now urgent. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/15/netanyahu-israel-western-allies-religious-coalition" title="">should have resigned</a> over the security failures surrounding the Hamas massacre, when about 1,200 Israelis were murdered. Instead, he has blamed others. Netanyahu argued the crisis required him to stay and lead a war to destroy the terrorists. He has repeatedly promised “total victory” and the freeing of Israeli hostages. But he has repeatedly failed to deliver.</p><p>The ongoing violence is unprecedented, Hamas is undefeated, many innocents remain in captivity, and government and country are split over tactics and a long-term settlement.

The 86-minute project billed as an “essay-film”, which premiered at Sundance and will stream on Netflix later this year, has clear eyes on the past, synthesizing the work of several academics with a robust archival record to examine the origins, structure and impact of police power in the United States.</p><p>That doesn’t mean it’s unnecessary; the film makes cogent, sweeping sense of the record for perhaps the most illuminative, swift and damning case against the institution of policing – the real fourth estate, as one subject puts it – of the many investigations conducted in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests.

Why is that important? Simply this: although scandals generate controversy, shock, anguish and anger, they don’t result in significant change. After a while, the public becomes bored, the media caravan moves on – to the next story, the next scandal; politicians piously declare that “lessons have been learned” (though heads rarely roll), and so on. Crises, on the other hand, <em>do</em> lead to systemic change, at least in working democracies. Laws change, institutions are closed or radically reformed, culprits go to jail… life does not go on as before.</p><p>There’s no question

## Gabriel heads Arsenal back to winning ways in thrashing of Crystal Palace

<p>Arsenal may still be looking to unlock Gabriel Jesus’s goalscoring potential but they were perfectly satisfied by a game-breaking contribution from his namesake. Two first-half headers from Gabriel Magalhães, the second converted via the Crystal Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson, exposed weak defending at corners and offered a timely reminder that Mikel Arteta’s side are far from a lost cause.</p><p>They wrapped things up through Leandro Trossard after the interval and two added-time goals from Gabriel Martinelli and, while a wretched Palace were present in body only, sailed through with a level of comfort that matched many of their early-season performances. Palace gave the under-fire Roy Hodgson little suggestion they could eke out a result here and the sight of Graham Potter looking on from the stands, no doubt with some interest, may have added fuel to those calling for a change of manager.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/20/arsenal-crystal-pa

## McIlroy’s stunning 63 reignites hopes of record fourth Dubai Desert Classic

<ul><li>World No 2 shoots 63 to surge up leaderboard</li><li>Cameron Young leads McIlroy by two strokes</li></ul><p>It seemed astonishing to recall Rory McIlroy began day three of this Dubai Desert Classic 10 shots off the lead. By the time the defending champion was undertaking media duties, he topped the leaderboard. A 63 and some vintage McIlroy means a record-breaking fourth Desert Classic crown is within his grasp.</p><p>By the setting of the desert sun, McIlroy’s position was not as formidable as in the immediate aftermath of his round. Cameron Young, the 36-hole leader, recovered from front-nine wobbles to post a 71 and edge two clear of McIlroy. Can the American, a debutant here, withstand pressure from McIlroy on day four? The pair will play together. Adrian Meronk remains a key part of the conversation, tied with McIlroy at 12 under par after adding a 70 to rounds of 68 and 66.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/20/rory-mcilroy-reignites-hopes-o

But before the wide availability of high-speed internet, things were more complicated.</p><p>In the 1990s and early 2000s, 3D graphics in video games were becoming more and more complex, but the low network speeds of the period meant that these games, unlike slower-paced and less graphically intensive strategy games, were nearly unplayable over an internet connection. In this moment, in which communications technology was being outpaced by graphical power, the Lan (local area network) party was born.</p><p>Euskal party, Bilbao, Spain, 2004.

As the images on their screens indicated the drone fleet was hovering exactly above the target – a key military base in the town of Lailenpi – they hit the button on their controllers and bombs began to fall.</p><p>“We had precise hits,” said Noah, 20, one of the specialist drone fighters in the Chin National Army (CNA), one of the ethnic rebel groups who have been fighting Myanmar’s military for almost three years. “It took them by surprise.

<p>Allegations against Newcastle chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan could mean potential reputational cost to myriad sports</p><p>It has been fascinating to watch the conversation move on. At the Centurion Club in Hertfordshire in the summer of 2022, the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer had to withstand a shout of whether he was “accepting blood money” through his association with LIV Golf. Household names in European golf sat on a podium – uncomfortably – while having to defend their defections to a tour funded by Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The same issues swirled around St James’ Park as Saudi’s Public Investment Fund bought a controlling stake in the club in late 2021. As fans whooped and hollered at the curtailment of the Mike Ashley era, there was discomfort elsewhere at a British sporting institution falling under the spell of an autocratic regime which has been intrinsically linked to the butchering of Jamal Khashoggi.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bl

Yes, they’re often big and white and root and raw. In so being, though, they positively necessitate the addition of heat, time and fat. The transformation of something such as a swede or a cabbage, for example – or indeed any other root vegetable that has to work a bit harder to be thought of as pure comfort – never fails to remind me of the wonder of cooking.

That the world is no longer her oyster? That she is no longer young, free or single (she has been going out with Nikolai von Bismarck since she was 41)? Or something else, something more “no regrets” – the 90s were then and this is now, and the preciousness of the past is that it can’t be relived?</p> <a href="h

<p>Understanding the human brain can put sport in perspective for the elite and fill the hole that frequent success still leaves</p><p>The drive to commercialise sport and commoditize players can seem all powerful but there is an equal and opposite force in sport which gets significantly less media spotlight yet continues to grow just as inexorably.

<p>Rural protests draw on a populist playbook. But farmers’ legitimate grievances could be addressed with progressive policies</p><p>In my local area in rural Brandenburg, every village signpost offers the same harrowing sight: a pair of wellingtons dangling from the metal frame, often marked with a cross sprayed on to the green rubber. The boots started appearing just before Christmas after the German government, a coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and Liberals, announced that tax exemptions for farm vehicles and diesel would be scrapped. The boots are supposed to express <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/german-farmers-block-roads-tractors-subsidies-protest">the farmers’ current campaign of resistance</a> as well as their longstanding grievances.

<p>The umami-rich byproduct that magically renders from meat during cooking makes for a rich, savoury seasoning that works with all sorts, including popcorn</p><p>When you make a roast, fry bacon or grill burgers, an umami-rich, nourishing but often wasted ingredient called tallow, lard or schmaltz magically renders from the meat during the cooking. This free ingredient can be used instead of butter or oil in just about any savoury dish and, depending on the type, age and quality of the meat you use, its flavour will range from mild to intensely meaty. Lamb, mutton and beef fat have a very high smoke point between 200C and 205C, which makes them a great choice for cooking food at high temperatures, be that chips, roast potatoes or popcorn. For my tallow popcorn, I saved the fat from two grass-fed burgers, which yielded just over a tablespoon and a half of fat, plenty to pop a bowl of corn for two. The flavour was rich, savoury and, once seasoned with mustard powder and smoked

<p>String of unexplained disappearances have left volunteer crews emotionally shattered and searching for answers</p><p>The single engine plane landed briefly at British Columbia’s Cranbrook airport in June 2017. Its Canadian pilot, Alex Simons, and his girlfriend, Sydney Robillard, had stopped to refuel the Piper Warrior, a rented plane popular for training, before continuing westward.
