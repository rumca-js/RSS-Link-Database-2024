Dr. Jordan B. Peterson speaks with English actor, musician, broadcaster, and party leader Laurence Fox. They discuss his current canceling, arrest, and litigation, the globalist scheming of London's current mayor, Sadiq Khan, the ironic expansion of surveillance cameras across England, and the state of Western Democracy when removed from humor, art, and nuance.

Laurence Fox graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 2001. He debuted as a screen actor in 2001â€™s The Hole, directed by Nick Hamm. He is likely best known in the entertainment world for his 10 year stint as James Hathaway in the TV show Lewis. In 2020, Fox criticized both the George Floyd riots, and the COVID vaccine mandates, coming from the Conservative point of view. He then founded the Reclaim Party, from which he unsuccessfully ran for mayor. Since this, he has been ever-present in the media, denouncing political correctness.
