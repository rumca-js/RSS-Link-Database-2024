In today's Daily Fix:

All signs are pointing to a proper Nintendo Switch follow-up in 2024, and according to industry analysts, it'll be priced at $400 or less. Of course, there's no official word from Nintendo, but let's hope they make some kind of announcement soon. Sony also kind of sort of made an announcement regarding 2024 with two highly anticipated remakes. The Silent Hill 2 remake and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater are being positioned as 2024 releases, according to PlayStation, but Konami has yet to make an official release date statement. And finally, Xbox just quietly released some new hardware...in the form of a toaster. Complimenting the Xbox Series X mini fridge, you can also add an Xbox Series S toaster to your kitchen appliances. It's available now at Walmart.
