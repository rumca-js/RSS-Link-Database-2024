California law has not caught up to the cars, even though they are already on the road, say public safety agencies and experts.</p><p>SFPD policy states that officers can make a traffic stop of autonomous vehicles (AVs) for violations, but can only issue a citation if there is a safety driver in the vehicle overseeing its operations. Since June 2022, autonomous vehicles have been permitted to operate without safety drivers as long as they are inside the city limits. Officers can issue citations to the registered owner of an unoccupied vehicle in absentia for non-moving violations such as parking or registration offenses

There are no women in the audience because they were not allowed in the public bar back then, or allowed to get a chequebook or apply for a mortgage. But here was a Black woman, of West Indian/Australian heritage, a verifiable star of the entertainment firmament, tearing up the room with her deep, growling voice full of honey and cinnamon, the piano accordion a sparkling accompaniment to her song.</p><p>Born in 1900, Small was a cross-dressing, jazz- and blues-singing, third-generation Australian entertainer, kn

<p>Today’s whispers are juggling plates</p><p>There are few lands left to conquer for <strong>Jos</strong><strong>é Mourinho</strong>. In fact, with eight league titles, five European trophies and eight major domestic cups across four countries, he’s effectively won it all. Which is why a brewing rumour that he could be taking charge of the Brazilian national team is so tantalising.<br /><br />Picture it. The Special One. The yellow and blue of the <em>Seleção</em>. The most expectant fanbase in the world. Joelinton. It’s a potent mix and would certainly inject some needed star power on the touchline of the international game.</p><p>“I don’t know if it’s true or not about Brazil, because they did not speak directly to me,” said Mourinho after Roma’s 2-1 win over Cremonese on Wednesday night. “I told my agent that until the club has decided if I am staying or not, I don’t want to know or talk to anyone else.”<br /><br />The chat has been fuelled by reports that Roma are in the hunt fo

## Alex Ovechkin’s shot at hockey’s most hallowed record is fading fast. Why?

<p>The longtime Capitals star entered the season just 72 goals shy of Wayne Gretzky’s storied career mark. But a ongoing scoring slump threatens to keep the lofty milestone out of reach</p><p>On 7 December, Alex Ovechkin notched his 1,500th point of his career – an assist during a 5-4 loss to Dallas. Ovechkin is just the 16th player in NHL history, and one of only two active players, to have hit the milestone. That other player is Pittsburgh’s Sidney Crosby. Ovechkin and Crosby, perennial rivals since they were drafted first overall consecutively in 2004 and 2005, have tracked nearly identical points-earning paths throughout their careers, differing only in how they accumulated them. Crosby’s playmaking has given him 966 assists and 567 goals. For Ovechkin, the points combo was always the reverse of Crosby’s: 675 assists and 827 goals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/04/alex-ovechkin-career-goals-record-wayne-gretzky-chase">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Calls for drastic overhaul of funding as conflicts and climate crisis drive surge in humanitarian needs and appeals fall short</p><p>The queue for water at Metche, a camp of 40,000 refugees on the Sudan-Chad border, starts at dawn and lasts until sunset. The aid agencies helping the people there, who fled fighting in Sudan earlier this year, do not have enough money to drill boreholes, so there is a chronic water shortage.</p><p>Latrines have also yet to be dug and the desert around the camp serves as an open-air toilet.

<p>From the 1960s, baby brokers persuaded often Indigenous Mayan women to give up newborns while kidnappers ‘disappeared’ babies. Now, international adoption is being called out as a way of covering up war crimes </p><p>In 2009, Dolores Preat went looking for her birth mother. A softly spoken woman with a bob haircut and glasses, Preat had been adopted as a five-year-old from Guatemala by a Belgian family in 1984. Her adoption paperwork recorded her birth mother as Rosario Colop Chim, originally from an area that had been brutalised in the civil war that ravaged Guatemala from 1960 to 1996.</p><p>Aged 32, Preat booked a plane ticket to Guatemala. She had managed to trace Colop Chim to her home in Zunil, a small town sitting in a green valley at the base of a volcano. <em>Zunil</em> means reed whistle in the Indigenous Mayan language K’iche’, and the town’s population is almost entirely Indigenous. (In Guatemala, Indigenous people make up about half the population, identified and diff
