That second ball from Hasan hit a crack on a length and jagged back to hit Smith’s belt line. He folded in half before rising with a wry smile.

<p>VAR can always be counted on to distract from the football. This was no advert for the FA Cup, and certainly not for the fixture’s bizarre scheduling, and neither Crystal Palace nor Everton will welcome going again at Goodison Park. But those still paying attention had a flashpoint to chew on in the 79th minute when Dominic Calvert-Lewin was, at some length, sent off for a tackle on Nathaniel Clyne that appeared more misjudged than outright dangerous. Even then James Garner missed a fine chance for the visitors to emerge triumphant, but they left feeling doubly bruised after Dwight McNeil was carried off on a stretcher late on.</p><p>If the authorities were serious about this competition they would not have sanctioned staging the opening third-round tie on a Thursday night, only 48 hours after the Premier League’s sprawling festive schedule had finished. A rainswept night in south London hardly added positive vibes but the sight of 4,000 Everton fans packing almost half of the Art

<p>This gorgeous, indulgent drama about TV chef Julia Child is back for a second helping. After taking a moment to warm up, it is rich with sumptuous scenes, spiky speeches and top talent </p><p>I could watch Sarah Lancashire and Isabella Rossellini argue about the propriety of fish-shaped pastry for much longer than an hour, but apparently Julia has other characters and would like us to spend some time with them. Lancashire’s performance as the chef and author Julia Child is one of this arch, twinkly show’s main draws, but by the time we rejoin her in season two, her TV show The French Chef has triumphed over the odds, making her a star, so now the drama must find other sources of tension. Franco-American disagreements about what constitutes a cassoulet seem as good a place to start as any.</p><p>Julia is a rich and highly stylised show, which lingers as lovingly on its dialogue as it does on food. It begins its second outing with a lengthy period of separation for the bulk of the c

<p>It’s almost as if Sunak is ashamed of his record and slipping under the radar as Starmer takes the initiative</p><p>The Curious Incident of the Dog That Didn’t Bark in the Night-time. Exactly a year ago today, Rishi Sunak began the first of his many relaunches with a speech in which he announced his five pledges. Pledges that were downgraded over the course of the next few months first to promises and then to vague aspirations. Pledges that had been chosen not because they were hard, but because they weren’t. Come 2024, he would be able to boast that he wasn’t a complete failure.</p><p>Now the election year is upon us and … nada. Normally a prime minister would choose to mark the occasion with a big set-piece speech. A few Tory donors and supporters to make up the numbers and loads of hacks to report every word. A live TV feed to every news network. This month, not so much. It’s almost as if Sunak is ashamed of his record and is trying to slip under the radar. His latest relaunch

<p><strong>(Domino)<br /></strong>Ryder-Jones’s recent production experience comes to the fore on this wide-reaching album, making use of Motown, 60s pop and a children’s choir to find the light in the darkness<br /></p><p>Since Bill Ryder-Jones left the Coral in 2008 after five Top 10 albums, he’s been quietly busying away in his Yawn studio in West Kirby on the Wirral Peninsula. He’s produced records for the likes of Saint Saviour, Brooke Bentham and Michael Head (his 2022 masterpiece, Dear Scott) while his succession of Yawn-created solo albums has mapped out a singular musical vision. This has stretched from orchestral imaginary soundtracks (2011 debut If…), fragile, damaged folk-rock (2013’s A Bad Wind Blows in My Heart), angular, soul-baring rockers (2015’s West Kirby County Primary) and emotionally wracked slowcore and bleak wit on 2018’s Yawn, later reimagined as the acoustic Yawny Yawn. Now, Iechyd Da (Welsh for “good health”) throws more into the mix with his burgeoning pro

Although she enjoyed her work, she had a long-held ambition to become an entrepreneur. “A lot of people find it strange that anyone would want to give up a stable career,” she says. “I wanted to meet like-minded people, so I posted a message on a women’s social group on Facebook asking if anyone knew about any interesting events for startups, and whether anyone wanted to join me.” Although she says she found it scary putting herself out there, she was pleased when Ulrika responded to her message.</p><p>Ulrika had recently moved back to Sweden to work in corporate events after two years living in San Francisco. “I was still in touch with my old high school friends but we lived completely different lives.

I remember that day clearly – listening to the dense canopy of trees vibrating in the wind, the sight and crowing of colourful birds and monkeys. I had never heard or seen anything like it before. Little did I know that a year later I would see something in that forest that would change our understanding of chimpanzee “culture” for ever.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/04/i-discovered-ekwoge-abwe-cameroon-chimpanzees-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

In the 20-odd years he’s been in power, even the Russian leader’s physical appearance has undergone a series of ominous transformations.

And that’s nothing compared to the changes that have happened in Russia: at the dawn of the millennium it seemed to be stumbling towards democracy. It had, albeit imperfectly, such things as free speech and opposition politicians. Even Putin seemed to talk sincerely of partnership with his former cold war opponents.

I paid the £3,000 deposit in March 2022. After the initial survey in April, it disappeared without giving me an installation date.

<p>A high-altitude ski touring trip among the 4,000-metre peaks of the Bernese Alps proves a tough challenge and a valuable lesson in mountain skills</p><p>One Thursday last March I emerged from the <a href="https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/">Jungfraujoch</a>, Europe’s highest train station, and crossed into another world. Inside the station, a guide with a novelty Swiss flag was marshalling a party of Asian visitors. Outside, we were soon on the Jungfraufirn, a small glacier that feeds the Aletsch, the largest glacier in the Alps. Sunlight shone through breaks in the cloud, and the ice, flanked by buttresses of dark rock, ran south for miles. The pitch was gentle and the ungroomed snow looked inviting.</p><p>I was on a training course in <em>skihochtouren</em> – high-altitude ski touring –organised by <a href="https://bergpunkt.ch/">Bergpunkt</a>, a Swiss-German mountaineering school for a book I’m working on about ski mountaineering.

<p>High interest rates, a slowdown in China and a possible Trump victory could make for a rocky year</p><p>The global economy was full of surprises in 2023. Despite the sharp rise in interest rates, the US successfully avoided a recession, and major emerging markets did not spiral into a debt crisis. Even Japan’s geriatric economy exhibited stunning vitality. By contrast, the EU fell behind, as its German growth engine sputtered after China’s four-decade era of hypergrowth abruptly ended.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2024, several questions loom large. What will happen to long-term inflation-adjusted interest rates? Can China avoid a more dramatic slowdown, given the turmoil in its real estate sector and high levels of local government debt? Having maintained near-zero interest rates for two decades, can the Bank of Japan (BOJ) normalise rates without triggering systemic financial and debt crises? Will the delayed effects of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate rises eventually push the US

By the end of that afternoon, I felt reassured, and not just because of how engaged these 16- and 17-year-old students appeared, asking well-informed questions and commenting on my work. It was because behind many of their interventions there was something very personal. They were not discussing abstract concepts unrelated to their lives, but were well aware that this is their Europe and their planet, and that it is up to them to contribute to save both. They wanted to know how best to fight back against Russian disinformation; how to change their lifestyles to make the European gree

Who the fuck do you think you’re talkin’ to?”</p><p>Where does it come from, the paranoia that shrouds Bickle?

There is too little research into the reasons for the shortage, explains Armstrong, but a complicated application system and invasive questioning are thought to be part of the problem, as well as a history of systematic rac
