<p>Actor Patrick Stewart appeared in a cameo role in 2022's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness as his X-Men character, Charles Xavier. Stewart recently reflected on the process of filming that cameo, saying it was not the best experience.</p><p>Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjtqmYQoWpM">Happy Sad Confused podcast</a> with Josh Horowitz, Stewart confirmed that he filmed this scene alone, just like John Krasinski (Reed Richards), Anson Mount (Black Bolt), Hayley Atwell (Captain Carter), and Lashana Lynch (Captain Marvel) did for their cameos in the movie's Illuminati scene.</p><p>"I was alone. I think each one of the leading actors had the same experience," Stewart said. "It was frustrating and disappointing but that is how it has been--the last few years have been challenging."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/patrick-stewart-on-why-his-doctor-strange-cameo-was-frustrating-and-disappointing/1100-6520115/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue

<p>The Ayer Cut of DC's Suicide Squad is officially dead. After eight years of attempting to get his version of Suicide Squad re-released under a director's cut banner, the filmmaker has given up and washed his hands of DC entirely. Even though the #ReleaseTheAyerCut movement didn't reach the height of momentum that Snyder's did, even Ayer was hopeful as recently as December.</p><p>"You know, there are a lot of people that are invested in certain narratives that don't want it to see the light of day," Ayer told <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/12/david-ayer-suicide-squad-ayer-cut-1235654057/">Deadline</a>. "So there's an immense political headwind against it because if that cut were made public, the cowardliness and the whole just general shittiness of how the film's been treated, and how the actors have had this great work that they'd done taken away...That narrative blows up once people see the movie."</p><p>That level of optimism officially died as Ayer went public Wednesday sta
