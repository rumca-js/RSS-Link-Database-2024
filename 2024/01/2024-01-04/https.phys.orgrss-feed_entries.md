Each summer, community college students from Colorado and surrounding states converge on the CU Boulder campus to participate in an immersive nine-week research program. A recent CIRES-led study reveals that when the students head home, they don't just take new scientific and professional skills with themâ€”they also leave with more confidence in their ability to do science and a greater sense of belonging in the science community.

Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is primarily produced in the United States in California, Arizona, and Florida, with a production value of $2.7 billion (USDA-NASS 2021). Florida produces an estimated 3% of the total lettuce in the United States (USDA-NASS 2019), primarily in the Everglades Agricultural Area, which is a humid subtropical region in southern Florida. Despite this relatively low proportion of the industry in the United States, lettuce grown in Florida has significant market demand because it is harvested during winter and spring months.

Climate change is one of the biggest issues of the 21st century, a crisis that affects the fate of the entire world as well as our place in it. A warming Earth will destroy ecosystems, flood cities, and lead to countless suffering and death for people worldwide. Part of the challenge of dealing with climate change is helping people understand its complex impacts.

Firms worldwide are increasingly adopting electronic voting, enabling shareholders to cast their votes online instead of attending shareholder meetings in person. Shareholders can enjoy superior accessibility to the meetings with electronic voting compared to those with traditional and in-person setups. Despite the emerging popularity of electronic voting in recent years, there is limited evidence of its impact on governance.

Climate change can be demoralizing. For years, scientists have been carefully documenting how the Earth is warming ever faster. One inglorious climate record follows another; 2023 was by far the warmest year since measurements began. The consequences can be felt as extreme weather events all over the world. Meanwhile, global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, while effective international climate policy measures are still lacking.

## High levels of mercury traced to particular cell types in brains of mammals

Exposure to mercury (Hg) is extremely neurotoxic in most chemical forms. Even scientists who study mercury compounds are at risk due to potential exposure to Hg. Renowned physicist Michael Faraday suffered from Hg poisoning due to prolonged exposure to Hg vapors, leading him to halt his research at the age of 49 due to deteriorating health. Another example is lab chemist Karen Wetterhahn who was killed by dimethylmercury poisoning after a few drops escaped from a pipette and landed on one of her latex-gloved hands.

Not only do many bats die at wind turbines, the turbines also displace some species from their habitats over large areas. When the turbines are in operation at relatively high wind speeds, the activity of bat species that hunt in structurally dense habitats such as forests drops by almost 80% within a radius of 80 to 450 meters around the turbine.

There is a growing interest in sustainability among orchestras, ensembles and concert halls in Germany, in terms of reducing their environmental impacts, and in relation to programming, such as creating concert formats that engage with sustainability on a thematic level. Is the classical concert industry contributing to the broader transformation of society towards sustainability? RIFS researchers see room for improvement, finding that many institutions and orchestral musicians are not sufficiently self-critical in their approach to sustainability issues.

Physics is filled with mysteries. To find a few worth exploring, look no further than an ice cube. At room temperature, of course, the cube will melt before your eyes. But even far below freezing, ice can shift in barely perceptible ways that scientists are still trying to understand. Using imaging tools at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory, researchers have detected a phenomenon known as premelting at temperatures far lower than those previously observed.

Tillamook residents have always dealt with floodingâ€”they sit at the confluence of five rivers where coastal storm surges and high tides push in large amounts of seawater. But the heavy rains that washed out roads, forced vehicle rescues and prompted a state of emergency in early December is a reminder that more frequent and severe flooding will come with climate change and sea-level rise.

Robert Plot, an English natural history scholar, was the first of these to describe a dinosaur bone, in his 1676 book The Natural History of Oxfordshire. Over the next two centuries dinosaur paleontology would be dominated by numerous British natural scientists.

It is no secret that the Romans were heavy wine drinkers. Estimates put the average Roman male's consumption at a liter or more of diluted wine per day. The drink was also a symbol of civilized behavior, and widely used as a drug, medicine and ritual beverage. Winemaking was therefore a widespread and very profitable activity, and vine growing dominated much of the agricultural landscape.
