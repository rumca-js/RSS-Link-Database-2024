The former longtime ESPN executive joined Amazon in 2018. Donoghue is &#8220;one of the most powerful women in sports media,&#8221; according to Sportico. Amazon bolstered its sports arm during Donoghue&#8217;s tenure, including a massive deal with the NFL to exclusively stream Thursday Night Football through 2033, as well as an array of other partnerships with teams and leagues. Amazon streamed the first Black Friday game in NFL history in November. The New York Post first reported Donoghue&#8217;s departure Thursday.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/tech-moves-amazon-sports-vp-departs-ai-product-leader-leaving-microsoft-and-more/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/tech-moves-amazon-sports-vp-departs-ai-product-leader-leaving-microsoft-and-more", "date_published": "2024-01-04T21:14:06+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Amazon shuts down last remaining Fresh Pickup location in Seattle", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"930\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Image-uploaded-from-iOS-3-1240x930.jpg\" width=\"1240\" /><br />Amazon closed the last of its only two Amazon Fresh Pickup locations, marking the end of another effort by the tech giant to disrupt how and where people get their groceries.

The project will cover 69 acres of the southwest portion of the Seattle campus, revitalizing and unifying an area of buildings that officials called old and underutilized.
