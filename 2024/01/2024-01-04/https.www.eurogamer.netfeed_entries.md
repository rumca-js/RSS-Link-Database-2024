So, what did you get up to on the holiday break? I was intending to spend a bit of time catching up on my horribly late slate of projects, but I ended up going down yet another rabbit hole - and this one's quite intriguing. Cyberpunk 2077 on PC ships with a range of internal benchmarks and streaming tests, only one of which users actually get to see. However, several others are available and thanks to a quirk of CD Projekt RED's cross-platform save system, it's possible to port those benchmark sequences across to consoles. I wasn't exactly optimistic that they would work - but they do. The question is, are they in any way useful?
</p><p>
CDPR's 'official' benchmark and a range of others are accessible in the PC version of the game and by my count, four of them auto-save during their duration, or else allow you to make a manual save as t

A collection of Monty Mole games from the 1980s will be making their Nintendo Switch debut on Monday, 8th January (well, here in the UK, at least - they are already available in the US). 
</p><p>
The Monty Mole Collection comprises five games, covering the original Monty Mole saga. This includes the main trilogy of games: Wanted! Monty Mole, Monty on the Run, and Auf Wiedersehen Monty. 
</p><p>
In addition, there are two bonus games to enjoy: Moley Christmas (which was originally given away with a magazine. As the name suggests, it will provide players with a "seasonal adventure") and Sam Stoat: Safebreaker. This is the "solo adventure of Sam Stoat, a supporting character from the main Monty Mole games".

It's a new year, and there is a new Humble Choice bundle to ring in 2024.
</p><p>
Every month, the team at Humble selects a collection of PC games for its members to keep forever. In addition, members get 20 percent off the vast collection of games in the Humble Store, plus there's a charity donation. It's a nice little deal all round, really.
</p><p>
This month, the bundle building team has grouped together another eight games for its subscribers to enjoy. These are: Marvel's Midnight Suns, Two Point Campus, Aragami 2, OTXO, The Red Lantern, Roguebook, Hell Pie and Twin Mirror.

## 13-year-old boy becomes first person to 'beat' Tetris

They said it couldn't be done, but to the nay-sayers let me tell you this - Tetris has finally been "beaten".
</p><p>
In a world first, 13-year-old Willis "Blue Scuti" Gibson - who is a competitive Tetris player - has managed to get the decades old falling block game to reveal its "kill screen". While not your traditional end of game, with credits or even game over message, this screen essentially sees Tetris crash. This is beating Tetris, a once thought impossible feat. 
</p><p>
The delight shown by the young player, who was born over two decades after the game actually released, as the screen freezes is palpable. "Oh my god," Gibson repeats. "I'm going to pass out, I can't feel my fingers."

Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is shutting down in April, after nearly 10 years of A-list fabulousness. 
</p><p>
The mobile sensation, which was released back in June 2014 by Kardashian and Glu Mobile, will no longer offer users any in-app purchases. It will be removed from the various app stores as well.
</p><p>
Those who already have Kim Kardashian: Hollywood installed can continue to play the game and use up their K-Stars (its in-game virtual currency) up until 8th April. After then, the "game will become inaccessible for all players".
