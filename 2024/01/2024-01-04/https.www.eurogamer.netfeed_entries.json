I was intending to spend a bit of time catching up on my horribly late slate of projects, but I ended up going down yet another rabbit hole - and this one's quite intriguing. Cyberpunk 2077 on PC ships with a range of internal benchmarks and streaming tests, only one of which users actually get to see. However, several others are available and thanks to a quirk of CD Projekt RED's cross-platform save system, it's possible to port those benchmark sequences across to consoles. I wasn't exactly optimistic that they would work - but they do. The question is, are they in any way useful?\n</p><p>\nCDPR's 'official' benchmark and a range of others are accessible in the PC version of the game and by my count, four of them auto-save during their duration, or else allow you to make a manual save as t", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-cyberpunk-2077-internal-pc-benchmarks-tested-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-consoles", "date_published": "2024-01-04T17:00:52+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "album": "Eurogamer.net Latest Articles Feed", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "title": "Infamous Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser denies involvement with new flash cart project", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/Bowser-in-Super-Mario-Odyssey.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser has denied being involved in a new flash cart project claimed to allow Switch users to play back-ups of their owned games.</p><p>The MIG-Switch flash cart, officially, is a \"third party back-up and development device for the Nintendo Switch\" according to the device <a href=\"https://migswitch.com/\">website</a>, that's not endorsed nor licenced by Nintendo of Japan.
