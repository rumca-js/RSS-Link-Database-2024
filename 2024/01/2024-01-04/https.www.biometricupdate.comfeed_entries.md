		As what is popularly called artificial intelligence or AI becomes ever-more integrated into society, a spectrum of views is emerging on how to govern its more controversial uses, and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/uk-bill-would-let-police-run-facial-recognition-against-all-drivers-licenses">facial recognition</a> in particular. Where academics, policymakers and regulators land on facial recognition may depend on how they see it – or, more accurately, how it sees them.
<h2>Low- and medium-risk uses of AI are already abundant</h2>
In an <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/a-framework-assessing-ai-risk">article</a> on the Ideas Made to Matter blog of the MIT Sloan School of Management, journalist Beth Stackpole reports o

		Thai authorities are hailing a project using iris and facial recognition to provide medical services to eligible migrant workers.

A pilot conducted by the Department of Disease Control (DDC) to improve access to healthcare services for foreign workers, refugees and members of ethnic minorities with biometrics has so far helped identify 8,619 migrant workers eligible for medical welfare and assistance, <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2715624/ddc-hails-ifr-tech-use-on-migrants">according </a>to the Bangkok Post. Among them, 80 percent were from Myanmar.

The agency notes that the system has also eased the workload of officials.

Policies for improving access to healthcare services for non-Thai citizens received a push during the Covid-19 pandemic. The iri

		A release says Hyundai Mobis has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Republic of Korea Marine Corps to implement its biometric system for motion sickness reduction.

Previously integrated into its Smart Cabin Controller feature for commercial vehicles, Hyundai Mobis’ system performs real-time monitoring of posture, heart rate, and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202110/brain-wave-biometrics-yield-93-authentication-rate-in-research">brain waves</a>. It then analyzes this biometric data to generate sensory stimuli for vision, hearing, smell and touch, which the firm says can reduce the symptoms of motion sickness by 40 percent, and outright prevent it in many cases.

		Court battles between defendants and their insurers in U.S. biometric data privacy cases are not common and don't get the attention that consumers' original complaints do, but they can be <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/us-privacy-law-catches-insurer-and-amazon-settlement-nears-in-another-case">momentous</a>.

It's understandable that an insurance company would do what it can to avoid paying a settlement in the hundreds of millions of dollars. They don't get rich on the premiums people pay. They get rich by not paying on claims.

Two cases in the state of Illinois alleging violation of its Biometric Information Privacy Act show how this is playing out.

In the first instance, a state of Pennsylvania insurer has begun the process of getting itself off th

		It is time for Nigeria’s President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to make a substantial increase to the funds allocated to the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) – the government agency overseeing the country’s legal and digital identity program, a civil society organization says.

In a press conference late last month in Abuja, the CEO of the Citizens Advocacy for Social and Economic Rights (CASER), Frank Tietie, said increasing the NIMC budget will enable the agency better execute its digital ID issuance mission, which is crucial for Nigeria’s socio-economic planning and development, <a href="https://www.thecable.ng/for-seamless-identity-management-group-canvasses-adequate-funding-for-nimc">reports</a> The Cable.

		The Dominican Republic has become the latest country to join the 50-in-5 advocacy campaign as a first-mover nation following <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/11-countries-pledge-to-establish-inclusive-dpi-as-50-in-5-campaign-launches">the launch of the initiative</a> last November.

The 50-in-5 advocacy campaign is a project supported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and other multilateral partners to help 50 developing nations set up secure, inclusive and interoperable digital public infrastructure (DPI) in the next five years.

Effective immediately, the fingerprint biometrics requirement aims to bolster national security. Individuals will need to go through the registration process to access government services and documentation.

The changes also mean foreign residents can now use exit and re-entry visas to return to the country until the

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/authid-ai">AuthID</a> has published some non-GAAP financial data that paint its fourth quarter in a positive light. Complete GAAP information for the quarter ended December 31 will wait. Specifically, the biometric ID verification and authentication firm says it signed new customer contracts with gross booked annual recurring revenue valued at $1.7 million in the quarter. That is a 64 percent increase over the third quarter of the same year.

Many caveats come with the news. Comparing consecutive quarters can be misleading because some sales are seasonal. A big rise could be less important than a year-over-year rise. Or it could be significant is the preceding quarter usually is bigger than the following quarter. A
