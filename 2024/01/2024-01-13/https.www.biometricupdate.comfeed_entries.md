		Biometrics issues related to consent were a theme running through many of the most-read articles of the week on <em>Biometric Update</em>. Digi Yatra sign-ups and DNA research tainted by a lack of consent, like surreptitious searches of passport data with facial recognition by UK police, fuel popular anxieties about biometrics. The industry is well aware. This week’s example is Google turning to a cash incentive in an attempt to build up an ethically-sourced dataset for age verification development. Meanwhile, CES again demonstrates the increasing value consumers place on biometrics. Automotive biometrics featured at the Vegas show include offerings from trinamiX, Precise Biometrics and Cerence.
