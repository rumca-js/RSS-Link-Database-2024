Earlier in her career, she led marketing at Dropcam, where she expanded its user base before its acquisition by Google. &#8220;I honestly have some unfinished business from that time, because we sold early to Google, and there was still so much we wanted to do,&#8221; she said in a recent interview with GeekWire. &#8220;So I feel like I get to come full circle 10&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/unfinished-business-ring-ceo-liz-hamren-leads-amazons-home-monitoring-products-into-the-ai-era/">Read More</a>

Built in Seattle by tech veteran Scott Avy and a small team, Skip skips past some of the things that can make thousands of other dating apps tiresome, including chatting within the app. Rather than diving into conversation that may lead nowhere, Skip is designed to help people land quality dates more quickly and safely.
