How much do software engineers actually make? There are many variables that dictate this: experience level, company at which you work (including their industry), location, and the specific programming technologies and languages you use - as well as your ability to negotiate yourself a higher salary.

Well in today's video, not only are we going to look at the visuals for the median salary based on those individual variables, but also the top salaries in each level of experience (so entry-level software engineer, mid-level software engineer, senior software engineer, staff software engineer, and principal software engineer), what companies are paying those top salaries, and the breakdown of base salary, stock, and bonus - all beautifully visualized.
