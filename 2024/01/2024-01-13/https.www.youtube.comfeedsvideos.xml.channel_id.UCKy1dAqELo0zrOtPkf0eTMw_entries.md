## What GTA 6 Can Learn From Red Dead Redemption 2 and GTA Online | GTFM

Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 are very similar in how visually stunning each look, with narrative structures that are able to rival most films seen in theaters. GTA 6 has a lot to live up to, and while the last trailer we saw on the surface visually surpasses its #RockstarGames predecessors, there are a few things that the devs might wanna take into consideration throughout the development process of #GTA6. We’re joined by ex-Rockstar Games employee Mike York. Mike lended his animation skills to both GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2. You might’ve even seen his reaction video to the first GTA 6 trailer on his YouTube channel, @YorkReacts. We’ll be discussing what we hope to see in Grand Theft Auto 6, and what features we hope to see in Rockstars’ latest iteration of the franchise. To note, this is all speculation: Nothing we say here is official confirmation - we’re merely doing a deep dive and having Mike weigh in given his expertise.

## Mean Girls Review

If there’s anything that the third iteration of Mean Girls should teach us, it’s this: “In Tina Fey We Trust.” It’s the rare talent who can take their own beloved adaptation of a nonfiction bestseller, turn it into a successful Broadway musical, and then translate that back to screen as its own thing. In lesser hands, that’s a nightmare waiting to happen. But Fey, backed by the strength of Jeff Richmond and Nell Benjamin’s lively songs and the energetic direction of Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr., has refreshed this early aughts tale of the brutalities of high school hierarchies and made it relevant for Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences. While this musical doesn’t expand upon its source material in any consequential ways, the new Mean Girls stands on its own merits.

Take a look at IGN's review for this fresh new take on a girl world classic, Mean Girls.

In today's Fix of entertainment news:
Netflix has announced some big casting news for the upcoming fourth season of The Witcher. Laurence Fishburne will join the series as Regis, whom you may remember from the The Witcher 3's DLC expansion, Blood and Wine. In other streaming news, Paramount+ has dropped a new trailer for Season 2 of Halo. Unfortunately, it's not being received very warmly by fans who don't really care for a helmet-less Master Chief. And finally, we have word that a fan-favorite character from Stranger Things' fourth season won't be returning for the final run. That's right, Argyle will not bve delivering any pizzas in the upcoming fifth season of Netflix's hit show.
