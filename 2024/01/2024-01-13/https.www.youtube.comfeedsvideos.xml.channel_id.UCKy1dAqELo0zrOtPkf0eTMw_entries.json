GTA 6 has a lot to live up to, and while the last trailer we saw on the surface visually surpasses its #RockstarGames predecessors, there are a few things that the devs might wanna take into consideration throughout the development process of #GTA6. We\u2019re joined by ex-Rockstar Games employee Mike York. Mike lended his animation skills to both GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2. You might\u2019ve even seen his reaction video to the first GTA 6 trailer on his YouTube channel, @YorkReacts. We\u2019ll be discussing what we hope to see in Grand Theft Auto 6, and what features we hope to see in Rockstars\u2019 latest iteration of the franchise. To note, this is all speculation: Nothing we say here is official confirmation - we\u2019re merely doing a deep dive and having Mike weigh in given his expertise.\u00a0\n\nCheck out Mike York\u2019s channel: ht", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66frOP2nn80", "date_published": "2024-01-13T14:00:04+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "IGN", "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/66frOP2nn80/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Does Samus murder for money?

In lesser hands, that\u2019s a nightmare waiting to happen. But Fey, backed by the strength of Jeff Richmond and Nell Benjamin\u2019s lively songs and the energetic direction of Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr., has refreshed this early aughts tale of the brutalities of high school hierarchies and made it relevant for Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences. While this musical doesn\u2019t expand upon its source material in any consequential ways, the new Mean Girls stands on its own merits.\n\nTake a look at IGN's review for this fresh new take on a girl world classic, Mean Girls.\n\n#ign #meangirls", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eqBeie5ZJM", "date_published": "2024-01-13T01:20:04+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "IGN", "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6eqBeie5ZJM/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Ted star Max Burkholder\u2019s favorite game of all time is Kingdom Hearts 2! #ted #kingdomhearts #gaming", "description": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk3aQzAGAtA", "date_published": "2024-01-13T01:08:44+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "IGN", "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/Lk3aQzAGAtA/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "The Witcher S4 Casts Laurence Fishburne as Fan-Favorite Character - IGN The Fix: Entertainment", "description": "In today's Fix of entertainment news:\nNetflix has announced some big casting news for the upcoming fourth season of The Witcher.
