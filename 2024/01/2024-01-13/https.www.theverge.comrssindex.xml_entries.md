  <p id="vGr9CA">A company called Doublepoint announced a new app during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23971966/ces-2024-news-announcements-products">CES this week</a> called WowMouse that turns Android smartwatches like the Samsung Galaxy Watch into a gesture-based mouse for your computer. That means waving your arm around to move the mouse and pinching your fingers to click (similar to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23928706/double-tap-apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2">Double Tap feature</a> on the Apple Watch Series 9).

  <p id="1ZziLK">This year at CES was the year AI took over.

It was a little too much.</p>
<p id="uFmRVD">It may be the year of AI at CES, but many of these “AI” features have been around for a while — it’s just that companies are only now embracing the branding of artificial intelligence.
