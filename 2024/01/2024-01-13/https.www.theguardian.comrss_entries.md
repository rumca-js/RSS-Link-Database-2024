<p>Fair Isle knits conjure images of open fires in chalets perched among snowy mountains. They’re the clothing equivalent of a hot water bottle</p><p>If you add a Fair Isle jumper to your winter rotation you’ll enjoy some hygge in sweater form. Originating on the eponymous island in Shetland, the Fair Isle jumper uses a traditional knitting technique that creates patterns using multiple colours at once. With their intricate patterns and artisanal credentials these knits are loved by designers, including <strong>Molly Goddard </strong>(pictured left), who has created a new spin on the style each season alongside her tulle skirts. <strong>Ralph Lauren</strong>’s British heritage aesthetic also favours the design, while <strong>Khaite</strong>’s creative director Catherine Holstein showed multiple versions of the printed knit, from a traditional turtleneck sweater to a street-style hoodie.</p><p>Be prepared to play fast and loose with the term Fair Isle while browsing online.

The big question is: who will bite the dust?</p><p>Children of the 1990s, ready! For no reason other than why the hell not, weekend teatime classic Gladiators is back. It’s on BBC One this time instead of ITV as it was years ago, but the format is unchanged: we at home lie belly-down on the lounge carpet watching explosive physical challenges in which members of the public with fitness addictions and mild narcissism take on retired athletes with shiny leotards and severe narcissism.</p><p>The gladiators are a new cohort of sprinters, gymnasts and bodybuilders, with stage names such as Giant, Fire, Electro, Nitro and Comet.

<p>For this series of large-scale charcoal portraits made between 1956 and 1962, the German-British painter Frank Auerbach drew his sitters over and over again, erasing the image after each session so that only a ghostly outline remained. He repeated the process until he felt he had captured the person’s essence; often the paper would rip. “What is so captivating about the drawings is how Auerbach could elicit such complex responses using just a piece of charcoal and a stick of chalk,” says curator Barnaby Wright, who has brought the portraits together for the first time for an exhibition. “We are so saturated by superficial images of people that these drawings offer us an enriching alternative, something deeply human and full of vitality.” </p><ul><li><a href="https://courtauld.ac.uk/whats-on/exh-frank-auerbach-the-charcoal-heads/">Frank Auerbach: The Charcoal Heads is at the Courtauld, London, 9 February-27 May</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery

<p>As the Post Office debacle has amply demonstrated, putting blind faith into a new form of technology can be perilous</p><p>It doesn’t take much imagination to describe what happens when a large corporation, over 16 long years, is allowed vindictively to prosecute 900 subpostmasters for theft, false accounting and fraud, when shortfalls at their branches were in fact due to bugs in the accounting software imposed on them by that corporation, as “one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation’s history”.</p><p>But then Rishi Sunak is not the most imaginative of men. The US Marines, on the other hand, have an economical term that fits the Horizon fiasco like a glove: it was a “clusterfuck” – primly defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as “a very rude word for a complete failure or very serious problem in which many mistakes or problems happen at the same time”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/13/horrified-by-horizon-then-get-ready-to-be-totally-app

The context of what Starmer was saying was clear. He was describing the prime minister as being out of touch with the general public. This is barely an insult. It is affirming that you are more aligned with the interests of British voters than the political party you are trying to replace in power. It would be strange if Starmer didn’t think Sunak was out of touch.</p><p>Nevertheless, a statement from Downing Street said that Sunak was as “British as Starmer”.

<ul><li>Group B: Australia 2-0 India (Irvine 50, Bos 73)</li><li>Goalkeeping error gifts Socceroos second-half breakthrough</li></ul><p>For 50 minutes of Australia’s opening Asian Cup fixture against India, a contest that ultimately ended in a 2-0 win, they crashed against the Blue Tigers’ defence like green and gold waves against a cliff. With a sense of maddening monotony, Graham Arnold’s side felt trapped in an awful, endless loop. Get the ball forward, blunt themselves against a deep-lying low defensive block, see their latest foray forward repulsed, and try again. Every concern around Australia’s ability to break down a stubborn underdog was being made manifest.</p><p>In such circumstances, a circuit breaker is needed; a moment of individual brilliance or a team bursting into life with a move straight off the training track. Frequently for the Socceroos, it’s a set-piece move swung on to the head of one of their towering aerial presences. Something, anything, that can turn the t

But if we imagined for a moment that the 11th album by Sleater-Kinney – the evergreen duo of singing guitarists Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker – had arrived free of context, without the baggage of life events, its 10 songs might land in certain ways, and maybe not others.</p><p>Perhaps the sharpness of its pointillist post-punk would garner effusive praise, or the crackle of its melodies. <em>Little Rope</em> feels, after all, like one of Sleater-Kinney’s most taut and focused outings, with every crisp guitar line and expressive vocal showcased in textured relief, standing proud with space around it like the raised print on an old-style debit card.

<p>Look after your body, and your body will soothe your mind</p><p>In the summer of 1996, when I was just six years old, I had my first brush with the world of medicine. It was a humid afternoon in suburban Mumbai. I was out playing street cricket with my cousins and some other kids. It’s the city I was born in, although by this stage our family was living in England after stints in Hong Kong and Nairobi. I stood in the road, wielding my bat, as one cousin ran towards me to bowl. As he did, he was struck by an invisible force: clutching his abdomen, he crumpled to the ground in agony a few yards in front of me. I ran over to him, with nothing to offer but panic and fear. As far as I knew, he was about to take his final breaths. At that moment, I felt so helpless.</p><p>My family rushed him to hospital, where doctors diagnosed a ruptured appendix. I didn’t know what that meant at the time, but I knew I wanted to find out. That sense of helplessness had a profound effect on me: I decid

<p>Zingy with Mexican spice, this protein-fortified chilli goes brilliantly with rice, guacamole and tortilla chips on the side</p><p>My husband, Hugh, recently made some changes to his diet, including lowering his carb intake and increasing his protein to keep him full (instead of the carbs). I wanted to cook him something that was easy to throw together, something he could eat without carbs in tow (curries, for example, are tricky), but without compromising on flavour. Today’s recipe is the result of my tinkering. The vegetables and tofu can be processed in a food processor (or chopped very finely by hand), then it’s just a matter of putting everything in the oven and waiting for the magic to happen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/13/oven-baked-tofu-chilli-vegan-recipe-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

Postecoglou, then a national youth coach with Australia, took serious exception to Foster’s line of questioning during a live television debate. “I don’t sit in glass houses, mate,” was among his assertions. Postecoglou implored the former Australia midfielder to come and watch a training session. “I don’t care what you think about me personally,” he insisted.</p><p>It’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWGNPFI-MtE">YouTube gold</a>, Ali v Frazier in verbal terms.

<p>An engrossing account of the perilous course charted by Ramsay MacDonald, Britain’s first Labour prime minister </p><p>On 22 January 1924, Labour formed a government for the first time in its quarter-century existence. Circumstances had conspired to present an opportunity that many in its ranks were loath to take. The result of the December election had been inconclusive. Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin’s Conservatives (then badged as Unionists) were still the largest party, with 258 seats. The Liberals had 158 and Labour 191. Six weeks of speculation and permutation ensued; Baldwin knew he didn’t have the numbers to carry a king’s speech. He could have tried to do a deal with the Liberals but that would have resurrected a coalition rejected by the public at the October 1922 election. As for the Liberals themselves, Herbert Asquith made the fateful decision to stand aside so that Labour could reveal their inadequacy to govern.</p><p>“If a Labour government is ever to be tried in th
