The Dark Energy Survey took an entire decade to produce a value for the cosmological constant—and it's smaller than you might think! There were other stories as well, including one about primeval black holes, and because I am inescapably drawn by the relentless gravity of black hole news, it's included below, along with two other stories related in one way or another to heads.
