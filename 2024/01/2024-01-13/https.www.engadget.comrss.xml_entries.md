<p>Two months after <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gamestops-nft-wallet-will-shut-down-in-november-164252057.html">shutting down its crypto wallet</a>, GameStop says it’s killing its NFT marketplace, too. In an <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://nft.gamestop.com/">alert</a> posted on the website, first spotted by <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://decrypt.co/212761/gamestop-bails-on-crypto-gaming-killing-nft-marketplace"><em><ins>Decrypt</ins></em></a>, the company has notified customers that the NFT marketplace will no longer be usable as of February 2. Echoing the statement it issued with the termination of the wallet, GameStop says the decision comes in response to “the continuing regulatory uncertainty of the crypto space.”</p>
<p>GameStop’s NFT marketplace wasn’t around very long. It launched in July 2022 in a partnership with Immutable X and Loopring following rumors of the project at the beginning of that year. Now, it only has a fe

<p>You’d think grabbing a scoop of dirt off an orbiting space rock and then delivering it back to Earth would be the most complicated part of an asteroid sample collection mission, but the real challenge, it turns out, is actually opening that sample container once it’s back home. It’s taken a little over three months, but <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/osiris-rex/2024/01/11/nasas-osiris-rex-team-clears-hurdle-to-access-remaining-bennu-sample/"><ins>NASA</ins></a> says it has finally removed two stuck fasteners that were preventing it from accessing the bulk of material collected from asteroid Bennu by its OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. OSIRIS-REx dropped the sample off on September 24 before heading off to study another asteroid, Apophis.</p>

<p>Facebook was flooded with fake advertisements featuring a deepfaked Rishi Sunak ahead of the UK's general election that's expected to take place this year, according to <a href="https://www.fenimoreharper.com/research/deepfake-political-advertising">research conducted</a> by communications company Fenimore Harper. The firm found 143 different ads impersonating the UK's Prime Minister on the social network last month, and it believes the ad may have reached more than 400,000 people. It also said that funding for the ads originated from 23 countries, including Turkey, Malaysia, the Philippines and the United States, and that the collective amount of money spent to promote them from December 8, 2023 to January 8, 2024 was $16,500.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/12/deepfake-video-adverts-sunak-facebook-alarm-ai-risk-election"><em>The Guardian</em></a> notes, one of the fake ads showed a <em>BBC</em> newscast wherein Sunak said that the UK gove

## OpenAI's policy no longer explicitly bans the use of its technology for 'military and warfare'

<p>Just a few days ago, OpenAI's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240109122522/https:/openai.com/policies/usage-policies">usage policies page</a> explicitly states that the company prohibits the use of its technology for &quot;military and warfare&quot; purposes. That line has since been deleted. As first noticed by <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/01/12/open-ai-military-ban-chatgpt/"><em>The Intercept</em></a>, the company <a href="https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies">updated the page</a> on January 10 &quot;to be clearer and provide more service-specific guidance,&quot; as the changelog states. It still prohibits the use of its large language models (LLMs) for anything that can cause harm, and it warns people against using its services to &quot;develop or use weapons.&quot; However, the company has removed language pertaining to &quot;military and warfare.&quot;</p>
<p>While we've yet to see its real-life implications, this change in wording comes just as militar
