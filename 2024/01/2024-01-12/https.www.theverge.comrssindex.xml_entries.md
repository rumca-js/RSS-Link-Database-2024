  <p id="f6eUpL">Google just announced a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/14202510">change for users in Europe</a> that will let them decide exactly how much data-sharing they’re comfortable with. The new policy, which the company said was in response to the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), allows users to opt out of data sharing across all, some, or none of a select number of Google’s services. The services listed include YouTube, Search, ad services, Google Play, Chrome, Google Shopping, and Google Maps. But the policy isn’t watertight — Google will still share user data when it’s necessary to complete a task (e.g., if you’re paying for a purchase on Google Shopping wit

But that promise largely started and ended with smart home tech.</p>

  <p id="Qjwjcu">It’s always frustrating to get caught in a traffic jam because of a lane closure or because everyone is rubbernecking a recent fender bender. But even if you’re stuck, you can gain some karmic points and help others avoid the situation by reporting it via Apple Maps or Google Maps.</p>
<p id="uhkRJu">Your report on its own may not be enough to get a warning placed on the map, but if enough people <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/iphone/iphb8a99022c/ios">make the same report</a> — Apple calls it having “a high level of confidence” —  then Apple or Google will probably take action and add an update.

  <p id="beWGT3">For the past few years, the Oura Ring has been the most recognizable smart ring on the market. After what I saw on the CES show floor, it’s about to get some real competition.</p>
<p id="Xn9Dig">The smart ring is a promising form factor, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/21/23414298/samsung-oura-ring-smart-rings-wearables">it’s tricky to get right</a>.

  <p id="GfwxwF">Microsoft has started testing a change to Windows 11 that will see its AI-powered Copilot feature automatically open when Windows starts on “widescreen devices.” The change is being tested as part of Microsoft’s latest Dev Channel preview of Windows 11, allowing Windows testers to provide feedback ahead of a broader rollout.</p>

  <p id="nynIOC">Rivian released the latest edition of its environmental impact report, in which the company commits to building a new generation of electric vehicles that are even less polluting than its current generation. </p>
<p id="w78r47">Rivian said its goal is to launch a product by 2030 “with half the lifecycle carbon footprint” as its 2022 R1 vehicles, which include the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. “Lifecycle carbon footprint” refers to all the greenhouse gas emissions, direct and indirect, associated with a product’s activities. For an EV, that would include its production, operation, and charging, from conception to junkyard. </p>

  <p id="5GKUmz">Two classic Game Boy Advance role-playing games are coming to the Nintendo Switch next week: 2001’s <em>Golden Sun</em> and 2002’s <em>Golden Sun: The Lost Age</em>. The games will either be available on January 17th according to <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1745611822005137690">this tweet</a> or the 16th according to this <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240111751140/en/">press release</a> (presumably this confusion is timezone-related, and we’ve followed up with Nintendo for clarification). But regardless of the exact date, they’ll be available as part of a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.</p>
