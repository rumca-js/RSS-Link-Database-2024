She was short and abrupt, batting away questions with as much force as her vicious two-handed backhand.</p><p>It turned out that she had plenty on her mind. The next day she withdrew from the tournament due to injury and announced she would take an indefinite leave from the tour as her injuries healed.

<p>The attacks on ships in the Red Sea are only one manifestation of a regional conflict which won’t easily be ended</p><p>The reality is that the war in Gaza has already spread through the region. The question is how far it extends and how intense it grows. Those involved are calculating and calibrating; they have in mind small blazes, rather than a regional conflagration. But their confidence that they can take containable risks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/12/yemen-houthi-airstrikes-red-sea-crisis-joe-biden-us-uk-australia">may prove misplaced</a>.

<p>If the right economic support is put in place, collective memory can be used to reinvent a better future for hard-pressed areas</p><p>In one of his most recent works, the renowned Italian anthropologist Vito Teti argues that <a href="https://www.mariettieditore.it/9788821113093-nostalgia">the social value of nostalgia</a> has been underrated and misunderstood. “It’s not about imagining a return to the past,” he writes at the beginning of Nostalgia: Anthropology of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Feeling in the Present. “We can never turn around&nbsp;and go back. It’s about regarding the past with&nbsp;<em>pietas</em> [dutiful respect] for that which was and wasn’t, and also with consideration, perhaps via possible utopias, for the unrealised potential of men&nbsp;and women who once existed.”</p><p>Prof Teti has explored such ideas in relation to his home region of Calabria, where a long history of migration has created towns which could be thought of&nbsp;as prototype “left-behind” communities.

<p><strong>London Coliseum</strong> <br />Version created by Mary Skeaping in 1971 retains its seductive power, ably driven by principals Katja Khaniukova and Aitor Arrieta<br /></p><p>One of the strengths of the ballet Giselle is that dance itself is so entwined with the subject matter. Dancing is the peasant girl Giselle’s great talent and joy, but also the thing that threatens her weak heart. And in the second act, dance is how the wilis, the ghostly spirits of betrayed women, enact their curse on men who cross their path, forced to dance themselves to death. Dance can be pleasure and punishment (something ballet dancers know all about).</p><p><br /><br />But there are many reasons this finest of Romantic ballets endures 183 years after its debut: the tight focus on the central characters and plot, without much filler; the rich role for a ballerina veering from innocence to madness to the afterlife. This version was created for English National Ballet in 1971 by Mary Skeaping, who

<p>The game was banned in the armed forces until 1994; now members meet in a tie that brings pride to its trailblazer</p><p>The standout tie in the opening round of this year’s Challenge Cup is perhaps an unusual one to casual rugby league observers, with the Royal Air Force taking on the Navy in an all-armed forces affair at RAF Cranwell. It is fitting, though, that such a fixture headlines the first round of 2024 given that this year is the 30th anniversary of the ban being lifted on forces personnel being allowed to even play the sport, let alone compete in its biggest competition.</p><p>The game on Saturday will be broadcast on the BBC but, had it not been for the efforts of men such as Squadron Leader Damian Clayton, it would not have been possible.

That was the year my wife and I decided we might be ready to start a family and we wanted to treat ourselves to one last mega holiday before we were too broke and too tired to enjoy it. So we went to Australia to visit friends and family for two and a half weeks, spending Christmas Day on the beach outside Melbourne and Boxing Day at the Test match. That last outing might not have been quite Jill’s idea of fun. This year we went off to Minneapolis to see our daughter.

<p>For many, the game became the sound of the 90s – but Josh Mancell tells us how the music for PlayStation’s first mascot game originated in Kraft cheese and Kraftwerk</p><p>‘When people are playing video games, they want to have fun,” Josh Mancell, composer for Naughty Dog’s early Crash Bandicoot games, tells me. It’s a simple statement, but one that laid the foundations for everything the PlayStation’s most famous mascot would come to represent. Even when players were banging their heads against their CRT TVs in frustration as the paranoid, eerie music of Slippery Climb began playing again for the hundredth time, Crash Bandicoot was fun. And Mancell’s soundtrack was there, from beginning to end, to remind you of that.</p><p>The characteristically eccentric, manic energy that fuelled Crash’s madcap platforming adventures didn’t come out of nowhere, though. “As I was working on the game, I was definitely throwing stuff against the wall to see what would stick,” Mancell says.</p> <a

<p>It shouldn’t be controversial to expect equal treatment in education, employment and healthcare – whatever the size of your body</p><p>I’ve been fat my whole life and in the early 2000s, I discovered fat activism.

But many people of my liberal and progressive ilk simply haven’t caught on: the kindness we preach doesn’t seem to extend to people who live in larger bodies.</p><p>It’s not just my impression: hard data backs up how entrenched fatphobia remains in society. When it comes to race, skin tone, disability, age and sexuality, both conscious and unconscious bias against marginalised characteristics appears to be on the wane

<p>Keeping fruit trees looking attractive and cropping well isn’t as tricky as you think, and definitely worth the effort  </p><p>It’s something of a myth that there is less to do in the garden during winter. There’s always plenty to get on with, just fewer daylight hours in which to do them in. And certain things must be done in the middle of winter, when most perennial plants and trees are dormant.</p><p>One such job is pruning mature fruit trees – apples and pears – so as to maintain their shape as well as keep them healthy and productive. Pruning an established tree can feel like a daunting task but with a few helpful guidelines, you can be cutting confidently in no time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/12/prune-your-apples-and-pears-now-and-youll-be-repaid-in-bushels-come-september">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Many mothers feel a bond with the people who support them through childbirth: seeing them anxious about their jobs is hard to bear</p><p>It’s hard to know what to say when you’re asked what childbirth is like. There are as many answers to that question as there are women. Perhaps it’s how the poet Fiona Benson describes it, as an act of submission “to my body’s wild stampede”; or her contemporary Hannah Sullivan, whose C-section was “like dying at the hairdresser’s”. Sylvia Plath resonates, with her description of having “boarded a train there’s no getting off”, while Dorothea Lasky (“screaming pain on a Sunday”) and Mina Loy (“I am climbing a distorted mountain of agony”) convey the brutality.</p><p>Less poetically, I’d say this: there was a moment when I threatened to jump out of the window. And there was another, specifically when my husband said the words, “it’s our boy”, when I felt the exhilarating distillation of the most whole and perfect joy I have ever felt.</p><p>Rhiann

<p>Naming consultants are on the rise. But could I really outsource something so personal to a stranger?</p><p>Towards the end of my 12-week scan, the sonographer leaned in and told us he was “70% certain” we were expecting a girl. It was early days but they had ways of knowing, he said. How nice that we already had a girl’s name ready – my grandmother’s, Narayani, or Nara. But at the 20-week scan another sonographer informed us we were actually having another boy. Our hearts sank when we realised we had to go through our previously rejected boys’ names again.</p><p>First time round, my boyfriend and I were fighting about our five-week-old son’s name inside the actual register office. “If you can’t think of a better name than Ivan, that’s what we are going with,” he hissed. I couldn’t, and so we did. We thought we’d call him Van, like the singer, but he became Kraken, after the sea monster (he was a bad sleeper), until a therapist suggested he’d “end up on the couch”. Now he’s Ivan.<

<p>He abandoned his French horn years ago, so why did the composer decide now was the time to dust the cobwebs off it?</p><p>I grew up in a forest at the edge of England and Wales; a borderland in the shape of a heart, isolated between two rivers, with its own unique dialect<em>. </em>Local playwright Dennis Potter called the Forest of Dean a “strange and beautiful place”,<em> </em>and JRR Tolkien is said to have found inspiration here for Middle-earth; today it remains drenched in myth and legend, with tales of faeries, witches and ghosts commonplace.</p><p>But the forest is also a place full of music. I remember the sound of brass bands drifting across the canopy from every direction as they rehearsed in their tiny, purpose-built practice rooms. Female-voice choirs would sing from tree-shrouded churches. As a child I would fall asleep to the noise of foxes and deer, while enormous sound systems from illegal raves which would pop up from time to time blared out techno and rave music

It’s a 19th-century, three-storey property on the corner of a quiet residential street in Notting Hill, west London. Its brick walls were painted baby pink, and I knew I had to have it. Back then, in the 70s, I was managing the fashion designer Ossie Clark, and it was an exciting time to be in west London. Notting Hill has always been very colourful.</p><p>One day, I spoke to the gentleman I saw coming out of the house. “I’d love to buy your house,” I told him, but he said it wasn’t for sale. Months later, I saw him again and he said he had put the house on the market. I rushed to the estate agent and gave them a cheque for 10% of the asking price. They wouldn’t accept it because they said the property was being advertised in the Sunday paper. So I had to wait until Monday morning, and when I went in again, they said their ph

Sticking to the decreed hemline was considered to be entry-level fashion compliance.<br /><br />Then the needle got stuck on the midi dress for absolutely ages, because it was super easy and also, I think, because the quick change of hemlines was the drumbeat of an era when trends felt disposable and, as a result, clothes began to feel disposable.</p><p>All of that feels like madness now.

<p>From the 80s driving experience of Outrun and After Burner’s dogfighting F-14 to Golden Axe’s high fantasy hack-’em-up – here’s what you wished was in your local arcade</p><p>At the close of 2023, Sega announced its plans to reimagine several of its greatest arcade games, including Crazy Taxi and Golden Axe, for current home consoles. It’s a welcome endeavour as modern gamers reared on Sonic the Hedgehog may overlook the company’s incredible heritage. While we’ve been trained to think of Sega as a perennial also-ran in the console wars, it dominated the arcade scene for years, some of its biggest hits occurring during the Sega Saturn era. So here’s a gentle reminder of the greatest coin-op games in the manufacturer’s long history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/jan/12/the-15-greatest-sega-arcade-games-ranked">Continue reading...</a>

Born and bred in County Donegal, she sang the traditional blues song Candyman – taught to revivalists by the renowned gospel musician Reverend Gary Davis in the mid-20th century – with a light and frisky southern US accent, fingerpicking her guitar with playful dexterity. It’s the opening track of her debut album, which only came together when Covid-19 waylaid her interest in combat sports and forced her to hole up with her guitar. She posted videos of herself playing on YouTube, which led to a deal with respected US folk and indie label Tompkins Square.</p><p>Recorded in first or second takes, I Kept These Old Blues is unavoidably impressive.

<p>The rightwing populist party could play an outsize role in the next UK election – and cost the Conservatives dearly</p><p>“A sinking ship” was how Antonia, an administrator from Middleton, described Britain at the start of 2024. That assessment, while damning, isn’t unusual, with “broken”, “mess” and “struggling” the top words used to describe the UK today. But Antonia, and her fellow focus group participants – former Conservative voters from the “red wall” seats of Heywood and Middleton, Great Grimsby and Dudley North – weren’t planning on expressing their exasperation with the state of Britain by voting Labour. Instead, they were tempted by the successor to the Brexit party – Reform UK.</p><p>Since October, Reform has enjoyed a steady rise in support, hitting 10% in some opinion polls. While unlikely to win seats of their own, by attracting former Tory voters Reform could play the role of spoiler. An analysis by the thinktank More in Common suggests that at present polling level

A raw and gritty novel of&nbsp;gay love, grief and resilience, it focused on Joe Gunner, a working-class young man stalked by visions, revenants and enemies.

<p>Lingering prejudices mean Fatmas and Kevins get a raw deal. Dirks and Evas get the best restaurant tables</p><p>Anja sold my green sofa online. It was an emotional process, since over the years I had written two novels and survived several heartbreaks on that couch. A few expressions of interest dropped in straight away. Somebody called Erich wrote to Anja saying he was very interested in buying it. He made a polite and humble attempt at bargaining by email, and Anja told him he could come and pick it up at my Berlin address on a recent Sunday.</p><p>When Erich arrived, it became clear that he was as much of an Erich as I was an Anja. The moment we shook hands at my door, my real name slipped out of my mouth and I looked at him, pretty embarrassed. He said: “Mohamed, pleasure.” We nodded the realisation of both our fake identities away and concluded our sofa deal within minutes. I looked at the empty space in my living room and felt lost.</p><p>Fatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based auth

<p>A rail-replacement service turned into a non-existent taxi. Once again, the rich take dividends and the rest of us pay the costs</p><p>The weather was worse than forecast. By the time I reached Bristol, at 5pm, all trains to the south-west had been cancelled, because of rising flood waters. It was no one’s fault – just one of life’s vicissitudes. What happened next was a different matter. I believe I’m still suffering the effects of it: I think privatisation has made me sick. In various ways, it has sickened the whole country.</p><p>Hundreds of people travelling to Somerset, Devon and Cornwall were ejected from my train at Bristol Temple Meads. In the information office, we were sorted into groups of four. Each group was issued with a code written in ballpoint on a slip of paper. This, we were told, could be handed to a taxi driver outside the station, who would take us to a station near home.

<p>From the murder inspired by Breaking Bad on 3 Body Problem to stabbings on Lost and ‘awful explosive diarrhoea’, TV sets are so often littered with strange tragedies</p><p>Few shows this year have as much riding on them as Netflix’s 3 Body Problem. A sprawling, outrageously ambitious sci-fi that spans whole centuries, the show has been adapted from a beloved series of novels, which means it has an army of fans to appease. It’s the first show made by David Benioff and Dan Weiss since Game of Thrones, which means it has to overcome an even larger army of fans still disappointed about that finale. Plus it’s a big, expensive show made for Netflix; a platform notoriously happy to cancel shows with no warning.</p><p>There’s also the dead executive to contend with. A recent Hollywood Reporter profile of Benioff and Weiss mentioned that 3 Body Problem was almost derailed when Lin Qi – the billionaire owner of Yoozoo, the company that owns the 3 Body Problem rights – was killed in 2020.

<p>Netflix’s latest big-budget action film from Fast &amp; Furious’s F Gary Gray pairs slick sequences with an unconvincing art thief played by Kevin Hart</p><p>You know the Netflix formula: take a reliable box office trope – the big-budget action movie, the international spy thriller, the hitman and car chase bonanza – repackage it for the laptop screen with evermore disposable wrapping, attach a big name star with a hefty paycheck, release, move on. Such results – Sweet Girl, the Adam Project, the Gray Man, just to name a few – are often widely viewed yet under-discussed, throwaway blockbusters in the house style (overlit, frenetic) without much staying power or distinguishable flair. (To be fair to Netflix, this afflicts the other streaming services – does anyone remember Apple’s Ghosted?)</p><p>So there are well-worn and reduced expectations going into Lift, the latest collaboration between Netflix, comedian Kevin Hart and a tried and true concept (in this case, clever thieves wi

<p>Ireland coach may still have plenty to prove but he knows what’s needed on tour and is the right man for the job</p><p>Among the pressing questions at Andy Farrell’s first press conference as head coach of the British and Irish Lions it had to be asked exactly how many people it takes to get a rugby tour organised in the 21st century.</p><p>Back in 1888, on the very first tour, the Lions had a backroom staff of exactly two. These days, 136 years later, it took three just to welcome each of the attendees and escort them through the doors and up to the 14th floor of the office block hosting the event. The Lions have a staff of about 90 at their peak, but by the time you’ve added in all the sponsors, media, and public relations wranglers, it feels like it runs nearer 900.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/12/only-connect-andy-farrell-knows-what-makes-lions-tours-tick">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Luton and Burnley fans on the receiving end, the Asian Cup and Afcon kick off and big weekends for Birmingham and Portsmouth</p><p>It is hardly breaking news that the interests of match-going fans are not given a second thought by TV companies but Luton’s 400-mile round trip to Burnley on Friday night is a staggering insult nonetheless. The game was chosen for the televised Monday night slot in October, with the caveat it could be switched to Friday or Sunday depending on whether the clubs had an FA Cup replay or Burnley reached the Carabao Cup semi-finals. Confirmation of the rearranged date arrived with Luton’s third-round draw against Bolton on Sunday. As Tony Scholes from Up the Clarets said: “To be sat waiting for the result of a game to decide the date of the next game less than a week later is totally unacceptable.” The Football Supporters’ Association added: “We’ve raised this problem with leagues, broadcasters and the authorities repeatedly but little progress has been ma
