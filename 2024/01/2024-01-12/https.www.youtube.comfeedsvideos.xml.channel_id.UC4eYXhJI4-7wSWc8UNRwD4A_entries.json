There are references to his parents\u2019 journey to the U.S., Sufi dance music and the mash-up of Bollywood and the Italian westerns of the 1960s.\n\nSunny Jain\u2019s latest musical exploration is another road taken from his days leading the Brooklyn bhangra band Red Baraat (which did an explosive Tiny Desk concert in 2017) and if you listen closely you\u2019ll hear how unique his musical vision is. In fact, if his musical projects were actual travel junkets, I would whip out my passport and jump on board as soon as I could.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cImmigrant Warrior\u201d\n\u201cBrooklyn Dhamal\u201d\n\u201cWild Wild East\u201d\n\u201cBlackwell\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nS", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIYIn7yTtTo", "date_published": "2024-01-12T10:00:46+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "NPR Music", "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zIYIn7yTtTo/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
