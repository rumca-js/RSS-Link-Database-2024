Konami and Limited Run Games are bringing retro classics Felix the Cat and Rocket Knight Adventures back for the modern age. \n</p><p>\nThe upcoming Felix the Cat release will include the feline's NES title and Game Boy title. Both games will come with a range of new features and \"quality of life fixes\" for today's gaming enjoyment. \n</p><p>\nThis release will be available physically for those with either a PlayStation console (it is coming to both 4 and 5) or a Nintendo Switch. Konami is handling the digital side of things, and is yet to announce a release date. \n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/konami-brings-back-retro-classics-rocket-knight-adventures-and-felix-the-cat?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed\">Read more</a></p>", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/konami-brings-back-retro-classics-rocket-knight-adventures-and-felix-the-cat?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "date_published": "2024-01-12T12:09:16+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/I6C-y7Kw.jpeg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "title": "Capcom reverses Resident Evil Revelations update with Enigma DRM", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/resident-evil-revelations-story-trailer.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>Capcom has rolled back a recent update to 11-year-old game Resident Evil Revelations which added a DRM called Enigma Protector.</p><p>The DRM was noticed after <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/222480/discussions/0/4034728215967966362\">Steam players</a> began reporting errors when launching Revelations last week, including a reduced and unstable framerate, as well as broken mods.</p><p>Steam users <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/222480/Resident_Evil_Revelations/#app_reviews_hash\">review bombed</a> Revelations with complaints about Enigma, which prompted Capcom to roll back the game on 9th January (which can be seen on its history via <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/222480/history/\">SteamDB</a>). </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-reverses-resident-evil-revelations-update-wi", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-reverses-resident-evil-revelations-update-with-enigma-drm?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "date_published": "2024-01-12T11:54:57+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/resident-evil-revelations-story-trailer.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "title": "Game of the Week: Prince of Persia and the question of memory tax", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/Prince-of-Persia---hero-shot.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>I think I first heard the term memory tax when I was writing about chess. In chess, at the really great levels of play, memory tax is a huge part of what you're dealing with. You don't just have to remember what a bishop does and how castling works - I hate castling. You have to remember whole openings and end-games, and remember how to counter this kind of move, and where that will leave you, and how to regain tempo. Lots of memory tax is chess!</p><p>Often these days, though, I find myself thinking about it in all kinds of games. And this point is worth restating up front: when you're reviewing a game you play it in a very different way to how you might play it if you were playing it purely for fun. The biggest difference is focus. If I'm reviewing a game, I plough through it and I don't leave huge gaps between putti", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/game-of-the-week-prince-of-persia-and-the-question-of-memory-tax?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "date_published": "2024-01-12T11:53:40+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/Prince-of-Persia---hero-shot.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "title": "Twitch \"isn't profitable\" admits CEO, in wake of recent layoffs", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/dan-clancy-twitch-ceo-stream.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>\nTwitch CEO Dan Clancy has admitted the Amazon-owned streaming platform isn't profitable.\n</p><p>\nClancy led a <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2029584705\">Q&amp;A stream on Twitch</a> following the news earlier this week <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-around-500-employees-later-this-week\">the company is laying off over 500 members of staff</a>, equating to around 35 percent of its workforce.\n</p><p>\n\"We've implied this before where we say we need to run it sustainably,\" said Clancy, \"but I'll be blunt: we aren't profitable at this point.\"\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-isnt-profitable-admits-ceo-in-wake-of-recent-layoffs?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed\">Read more</a></p>", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-isnt-profitable-admits-ceo-in-wake-of-recent-layoffs?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "date_published": "2024-01-12T11:42:52+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/dan-clancy-twitch-ceo-stream.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "title": "Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review - fabulous exploration and combat", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/Prince-of-Persia-The-Lost-Crown-review-header-2.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>There's something about a magic door.

It's the latest game in a beloved series whose lineage stretches all the way back to the glory days of home computing. It's a metroidvania so beautifully put together it almost feels like a Plantonic example of the form. It's a promising sign that Ubisoft is starting to let a series' soul dictate the ultimate structure of a game, rather than pouring its molten life into the same open-world mould. And it's a game that really knows the value and impact of a magic door.</p><p>To wit: I'm in a kind of hub area, done up like a breezy Persian marketplace.
