<p>At CES 2024, ASUS seems to have taken people by surprise with the announcement of its AirVision M1 glasses, with some viewing it as an alternative to Apple’s Vision Pro headset. But I discovered that ASUS’ glasses are much more of a novel alternative to portable monitors than something meant for spatial computing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The big difference between the AirVision M1 glasses and something like the Vision Pro or even Xreal’s Air 2 Ultras is that it doesn’t really support anything in the way of interactive AR. Sure, the glasses are able to project your desktop or multiple windows into space, but it needs to be tethered to a nearby device and doesn’t recognize hand gestures or other virtual objects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The current standard PDAC screening criteria catches about 10 percent of cases in patients examined by professionals. In comparison, MIT’s PRISM was able to identify PDAC cases 35 percent of the time.</p>

## The EPA scraps plan that would have had it ban mammal testing in favor of computer models

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency has scrapped a plan to phase out mammal testing for studying chemical toxicity, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/epa-scraps-plan-end-mammal-testing-2035"><em>Science </em>reports</a>. In 2019, the regulatory agency vowed to completely phase out animal testing for toxicology studies by 2035 in favor of non-animal “test subjects” programmed into computer models.</p>
<p>The call to challenge the status quo was controversial from the start — it not only was going to impact thousands of studies and experiments, but many scientists argued that computer models were nowhere near ready to replace animals as test subjects. In a <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/2023-03/epa-letter-tsca-nams-20230315.pdf">letter written</a> by a group of public health officials, the experts urged the EPA’s head Michael Regan to reconsider the ban because computational models, in their opinion, were “not yet developed to the point” where they

<p>Audio cues can sometimes be crucial for success in games. Developers frequently design the sound environment for their experiences to be not only rich and immersive, but to also contain hints about approaching enemies or danger. Players who are hard of hearing can miss out on this, and it's not fair for them to be disadvantaged due to a disability. A <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/audio-radar-launches-enabling-deaf-140000062.html">product called Audio Radar</a> launched at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-live-latest-tech-weird-gadgets-and-our-best-of-ces-awards-000021076.html">CES 2024</a> and it can help turn sound signals into visual cues, so that gamers with hearing loss can "see the sound," according to the company AirDrop Gaming LLC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Want some bad news as a lead up to the weekend? NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-analysis-confirms-2023-as-warmest-year-on-record/">just released its annual global temperature report</a> and, lo and behold, 2023 was the hottest year on record since measurements began back in 1880. Global temperatures last year were approximately 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) above the average for NASA’s baseline period of 1951 to 1980.</p>
<p>Compared to the 1880s, the planet was 2.5 degrees warmer in 2023. If you do the math, you’ll find that the vast majority of that increase occurred after NASA’s baseline period. In other words, the past several decades have been the worst of the worst. July of 2023 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/july-3rd-was-the-hottest-day-in-recorded-history-214854746.html">was the hottest month ever measured,</a> which is a record nobody wanted or asked for but, well, here we are.</p>

<p>One of the missing pieces of puzzle for VR is scent, but at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/our-favorite-accessibility-products-at-ces-2024-170009710.html">CES 2024</a> in Las Vegas, Japanese startup Aromajoin showed off a wearable that may be up to the task. Simply dubbed <a href="https://aromajoin.com/products/aroma-shooter-wearable-3">Aroma Shooter Wearable</a>, this neckband houses six replaceable scent cartridges, and it's controlled by a mobile device or PC over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or USB. The product is still in its early days, and the Kyoto-based company is targeting developers and business clients, who can pick from a library of &quot;hundreds&quot; of scents — or even custom scents from, say, fragrance brands — to suit their needs.</p>
<p>In Aromajoin's demo, a video player app was programmed to cycle through those six scents — lavender, blueberry, shampoo, caramel, smoke and fresh cut grass — to match the six scenes in the short clip. Even though I was watching what was

<p>You should check out the full slate of winners, but our Best of Show went to GE Profile’s Smart Indoor Smoker. I know: CES is more typically a TV show or car show, but sometimes it’s niche products that win us over.</p>

<p>CES 2024 in Las Vegas had all kinds of tech, from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rabbit-r1-is-an-adorable-ai-powered-assistant-co-designed-by-teenage-engineering-001051537.html"><ins>attention-grabbing AI gadgets</ins></a> to, uh, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-cpr-dummy-of-the-future-can-piss-blood-165533305.html"><ins>whatever this is.</ins></a> There were also a whole bunch of laptops.

<p>These weren’t just any laptops with minor spec bumps. The theme of the year was, of course, AI, with many computers adopting dedicated AI chips. OLED displays with speedy refresh rates were also all over the show floor and, of course, there were several unique designs that just about defy description. We’ve gone through them all and come up with a list o

<p>With the transition to electric vehicles, the way we travel needs to change too. And at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-live-latest-tech-weird-gadgets-and-our-best-of-ces-awards-000021076.html">CES 2024</a> in Las Vegas, the <a href="https://pebblelife.com/pebble-flow">Pebble Flow</a> is providing a glimpse at how an RV designed for the EV age should function.</p>
<p>The 25 feet long Pebble Flow is designed for a family of four. Interior space stands at about 150 square-feet though, unlike some of its competitors, there aren’t any pop-out sections to expand its dimensions. Powering the whole thing is a 45 kWh LFP battery and a 1kW solar panel that provide enough juice to keep the RV running for about a week. And in addition to having support for up to Level 3 DC fast charging (with a 0 to 80 percent charge taking about an hour), the Pebble Flow also offers vehicle-to-load functionality, allowing you to power other devices, recharge an EV, or even keep the lights on in y

<p>So much of what we see at CES tends to be focused on technological innovation for the sake of innovation, or obvious attempts to tap into whatever trend is gripping the internet's attention that year. In the last few shows, though, there has been a heartening increase in attention to assistive products that are designed to help improve the lives of people with disabilities and other different needs. At CES 2024, I was glad to see more development in the accessibility category, with many offerings appearing to be more thoughtfully designed in addition to being clever. It's so easy to get distracted by the shiny, eye-catching, glamorous and weird tech at CES, but I wanted to take the time to give due attention to some of my favorite accessibility products here in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The tenth season of the FIA-sanctioned all-electric Formula E racing series goes green this weekend with the opening round in Mexico City on January 13. This will be the second year of the series using the ultra-efficient <a href="https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-gen-e-electric-race-car-164542680.html">Gen3 car</a>, and aside from a number of teams swapping out one or both drivers, there aren't any huge changes from last year. However, Formula E's new TV deal should make races easier, and less frustrating, to watch in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following last week's terrifying incident in which a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/boeing/"><ins>Boeing</ins></a> 737 Max 9 lost a cabin panel mid-flight, the Federal Aviation Administration says it will have more oversight of the company's production and manufacturing.

<p>Nowadays, there are already plenty of choices when it comes to pet trackers, and some can even monitor heart rate, but apparently none could detect atrial fibrillation (AFib) until now. At CES 2024, GPS tracker specialist Invoxia unveiled the <a href="https://petcare.invoxia.com/en-US/">Minitailz</a>, the world's first pet tracker that can keep an eye out for early heart disease symptoms on your cats or dogs. Together with other vital stats and activity log, the companion app then uses conversational generative AI to generate easy-to-read reports on your pets.</p>
<p>According to the French company, Minitailz is able to track respiratory and heart vitals with an accuracy of 97 to 99 percent, thanks to its advanced biometric sensors combined with AI. Using deep learning algorithms, the set of data is then used to spot digital biomarkers that indicate stress, aging and pathologies. The device can also differentiate the types of movements, such as walks, runs and zoomies, as well as

The Ariya Nismo is based on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissan-ariya-ev-2023-pricing-212421384.html"><ins>Ariya e-4orce</ins></a> and it's scheduled to be available in two trims. The B6 has a 66kWh battery, while the B9 has a 91kWh version. With Nismo being Nissan's performance division, it's no real surprise that the EV will offer a little more power than other Ariyas. The B6 model will have 362 hp and 413 lb-ft while the B9 is set to have 429 hp and 443 lb-ft, though <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a46354317/nissans-nismo-goes-electric-with-new-ariya-model/"><em>Road and Track</em></a> points out that these figures might change before the electric SUV hits the road.</p>

But after testing ASUS's laptops for years, and seeing how much progress it's made with the Zephyrus G gaming line, it's surprising that the company's premium Zenbook hasn't evolved much lately.</p>
<p>While it's a solid step into the "AI PC" era, thanks to its NPU for accelerating AI tasks, the new ZenBook 14 is also a reminder that ASUS is lagging behind Apple and Microsoft when it comes to premium design.

<p>Just as we expected, AI was the running theme throughout CES 2024. In this episode, Devindra and Producer Ben Ellman chat with co-host Cherlynn Low, who’s on the ground in Las Vegas with the Engadget team. We dive into AI coming to almost every product category, new standalone AI hardware, and a surprising amount of “shush” tech. In geekier news, we dive into Micron’s new RAM format for laptops, which has the potential to reshape the notebook industry, and discuss why we all may want a rolling house robot like Samsung’s Ballie. And on a sad note, we chat about the wave of tech layoffs from Google, Amazon and others.</p>

<p>There may be a lot more real-money gaming (RMG) apps available in the Google Play Store before the year ends — at least in certain locations. Google initially started allowing apps that deal with real money in its store back in 2021, but only if they fall under a game type that's regulated by the government. Now, the company has <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/01/a-new-approach-to-real-money-games-on-google-play.html">announced</a> that it's tweaking its rules to allow more &quot;game types and operators not covered by an existing licensing framework.&quot; That will open the Play Store to games that aren't that popular or aren't played widely enough for local governments to create laws around them.&nbsp;</p>
