<p>If there's one thing I've learned about my fellow Android appreciators in recent years, it's that folks who love the dark <em>really</em> love the dark.</p><p>I'm not talking about night owls, mind you, but rather Android-carrying hominids who prefer the mellow vibes of their device's dark mode. I'm tellin' ya: It's a <em>thing</em> — and people who are into Android's dark mode are often impressively passionate about that preference.</p><p>Personally, I tend to be a light mode kind of guy.
