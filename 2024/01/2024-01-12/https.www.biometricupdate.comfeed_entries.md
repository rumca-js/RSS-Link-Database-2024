		A <a href="https://www.fifpro.org/media/equii03m/fifpro_workplace-safety-report-2023_final_light.pdf">Player IQ</a> report surveyed 41 national football player unions and found that workplace safety and fan violence is a growing concern, and tech interventions like facial recognition could help keep players safe.

Most unions – 66 percent – believe football fan culture has become increasingly more violent and abusive in recent years, with some regions having larger and more active fan bases. Seventy-four percent of the over 19,600 abusive social media posts during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 came from Europe and South America.

The most common forms of physical abuse players faced in and around the stadium were projectile objects, firecrackers and flare

		San Francisco assembly member Phil Ting has introduced <a href="https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB1814/2023">AB 1814</a>, a bill that would prevent police from using facial recognition technology (FRT) matches for probable cause in California, with hearings expected to take place this spring. Under the bill, law enforcement would not be able to base a search, arrest or affidavit for a warrant solely on an FRT match.

The bill refers to using facial recognition for 1:n matching where the face of an unidentified person is biometrically compared to a database of known individuals. Officers must also examine any information taken from facial recognition systems carefully and consider the possibility that the matches could be inaccurate.

The aim of the bill is to pre

		A pair of U.S. House of Representative members have introduced a bill intended to restrict unauthorized fraudulent digital replicas of people.

The bulk of the motivation behind the legislation, based on the wording of the bill, is the protection of actors, people of notoriety and girls and women defamed through fraudulent porn made with their face template.

Curiously, the very real threat of using deepfakes to defraud just about everyone else in the nation is not mentioned. Those risks are growing and could result in uncountable financial damages as organizations rely on voice and face biometrics for ID verification.

The representatives, María Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) and Madeleine Dean (D-Penn.), do not mention the global singer/songwriter Taylor Swift in <a

Biometric authentication has already been yielding customer experience benefits for organizations adopting it in several industries, the report shows.

Biometrics increased customer satisfaction by 8 percent for bank accounts at challenger banks and 22 percent for loans at traditional banks, both of which are particularly vulnerable to synthetic identity fraud

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/next-biometrics">Next Biometrics</a> has a significant step towards expanding its footprint in the second most populous nation in the world. The Norwegian fingerprint sensor maker has received the China ID certification for its popular FAP20 sensor, allowing it to access more market segments in the country.

Marcus Laurén, chief product officer at Next, says that the certification will open doors to high-end markets. Only a few original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) globally hold the China ID certificate.

The certification was obtained through a local Chinese partner.

“Achieving the China ID is a key milestone in our entry into [the] biometric market in China," says Laurén. “The certification is the result of a rigorous testin

Digital ID systems like India’s Aadhaar, the GhanaCard, and South Africa’s Home Affairs National Identification System each leverage biometrics in their digital registration systems. The systems are often shaped by each nation's individual capacities and weaknesses, but have already altered the foundation for economic growth in various countries, despi

		The U.S. is making a new data-access demand of Norway in return for visa-free travel between them.

There are <a href="https://www.bt.no/politikk/i/GMVjdx/usa-vil-soeke-fritt-i-norske-politiregistre-ellers-faar-du-ikke-reise-dit-uten-visum">reports</a> that Washington's Homeland Security Department wants to move from having to ask for biometric and criminal data about Norwegian visitors and instead doing searches itself.

No agreement has been announced.

In an existing agreement similar to one the U.S. has signed with other favored nations, Washington relaxes visa requirements of Norwegians wanting to travel to the country.

		As Ethiopia continues to implement its digital ID project, which is part of the country’s 2025 Digital Strategy, the government believes more success will be recorded with increased participation from private sector partners. This comes as the country is also enjoying considerable multilateral support. The World Bank (WB), last month, said it is offering more support to the country to accompany its ambition of reaching at least 90 million people with secure ID and inclusive digital services under the Digital ID for Inclusion and Services Project. Earlier same month, the Bretton woods institution had announced the implementation of the second phase of a digital integration project that will serve borderland settlements, refugees and host communities in Et
