<p>Ducky is a mechanical keyboard brand well-known to hobbyists for its frequent collaborations resulting in stylish boards. The company&rsquo;s latest creation is with Bethesda, celebrating the long history of the original boomer shooter, <em>Doom</em>. The 65 percent board is black with blood-red accents, naturally, but it&rsquo;s the PBT keycaps that are the showstopper. They&rsquo;re completely covered in an image of the Doomslayer doin&rsquo; what he does best, giving a whole lot of demons a hell of a bad day. </p>



<p>The keyboard is a spruced-up version of the Ducky One 3 SF, which features a unique double-layered case, N-key rollover for gamers, integrated silicone and foam dampening, hot-swappable switches, and RGB lighting. But if you set those lights to anything except &ldquo;hellfire red,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re doing it wrong. </p>

<p>At CES 2024, Nvidia and Twitch <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/twitch-multiencode-av1-livestreaming/&amp;xcust=2-2-2199898-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">announced a collaboration with OBS</a> called &ldquo;Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting&rdquo; &mdash; a complete overhaul of the traditional streamer-to-Twitch pipeline and encoding experience.</p>



<p>This new feature aims to make streaming easier, low-latency and buffer-free viewing more accessible, and has the potential to revolutionize video quality on Twitch along the way. And yes, AV1 is coming to Twitch, too &mdash; though maybe not as immediately as many are hoping for.</p>

These help accelerate AI tasks locally, rather than reaching out to cloud servers (like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot). But what does that actually mean for <em>you</em>, an everyday computer user?</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s the question I hoped to answer as I wandered the show floor, visiting PC makers of all shapes and sizes. Most early implementations of local, NPU-proces
