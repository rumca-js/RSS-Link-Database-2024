The medium of games is highly dependent on the available technology of the time, and the rapid pace of advancements in this field can quickly render a product dated in just a few years. 

Games that were once considered to be technological achievements wouldn't suffice as a minimum viable product in a modern market scenario, which is why it is important to revisit classics and see how they hold to this date. 

With this video, we will be taking a look back at Batman Arkham City from the perspective of it being released in 2024, and break down each aspect of the game to understand which of its elements have aged well and which haven't - and finally assign a corresponding score to it.

Monster Hunter World launched in 2018 for Xbox One and PS4 before coming to PC in the same year. It has sold 23 million units, and has captivated many players who stuck with it through the post-launch updates, the launch of Iceborne and the final update.

Despite its age, the action RPG is seeing a bit of a renaissance nowadays following the announcement of Monster Hunter Wilds. After the Return to World campaign, Steam's concurrent player counts have crossed 100,000 over the past several weeks. Discounts have allowed new players to hop in and experience the magic for themselves.

However, it's also a prime reason for experienced players to return, whether to guide newcomers and help them succeed or re-engage with a game that's still as fun and endearing as ever.

It's no secret that Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Rocksteady's first new game since 2015's Batman: Arkham Knight, looks rough. Despite solid-looking visuals and a large world to explore, some feel that it's little more than a live-service cash grab if not another looter shooter that barely does anything unique.

Following various hands-on previews and impressions, the flaws of Suicide Squad have become even more apparent. The dialogue ranges from funny to annoying; the UI, whether in combat or navigating menus, desperately needs a facelift; the movement looks clunky while combat appears chaotic; and worst of all, the objective variety in missions is lackluster.

Check out our latest concerns for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League before its launch on February 2nd for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.
