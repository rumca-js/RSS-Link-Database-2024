Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2, as it's officially known, is the sequel to Naughty Dog's 85-minute making-of documentary for the first game, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH5MgEbBOps">launched back in 2015</a> and charted the "dogged development and unique philosophy" of The Last of Us 1.

## Naoki Yoshida thinks Final Fantasy 17 should be directed by someone new

Square Enix's Naoki Yoshida thinks Final Fantasy 17 should be directed by someone new to make a game "with challenges that suit today's world".
</p><p>
Yoshida was interviewed by Sony's Shuhei Yoshida on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGh7Ti0b_bY">Game Maker's Notebook podcast</a> (Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences) and candidly discussed development of Final Fantasy 14 and 16, as well as the future of the series.
</p><p>
When jokingly asked if he's directing Final Fantasy 17, Yoshida replied that nothing has been decided yet. "I've had the chance to work on two of these, 14 and 16, so maybe it's time for someone new, instead of having the same old guys handle the next one," he said.

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, the well-received Three Kingdoms-era Soulslike from developer Team Ninja, is bundling its base game and DLC into a single Complete Edition, which is launching for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, and PC on 7th February.
</p><p>
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, which originally launched last March, serving up a challenging - but surprisingly approachable - action-RPG adventure build around a faster, more aggressive style of combat compared to Team Ninja's Nioh games.
</p><p>
"A new setting may suggest a new chapter," Eurogamer contributor Alan Wen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-masocore-action-with-an-approachable-twist">wrote in his Recommended review</a>, "but I'd almost prefer to call Wo Long a Nioh-like, or rather the sequel that Nioh 2 should

Whether it's via FPS Boost or bespoke software upgrades, backwards compatibility on the current-gen consoles delivered an unexpected delight - the ability to liberate older console games from their 30fps limits, running them at 60 frames per second or even higher. FPS Boost did the business for Xbox Series consoles on an impressive range of titles, but there was always the sense that PS5 could do more. It's a hunch that checks out as a range of frame-rate unlocks are available for PS5, covering many must-have games - the major caveat being that only exploitable consoles running on older firmwares are invited to the party.

We've talked about Bloodborne running at 60fps in the past, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Games like Red Dead Redemption 2, DriveClub and Batman: Arkham Knight are transformed via this very unofficia

Sand Land, the upcoming game based on Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama's manga, will release on 26th April across PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
</p><p>
Sand Land, for those unaware, is set in a post-apocalyptic desert world where water is in short supply for everyone. Yes, demons and humans. Obviously, something needs to be done about that, and so a rag-tag team sets off in search of the Legendary Spring to bring an end to this thirst.
</p><p>
Sand Land was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/akira-toriyama-creator-of-dragon-ball-returns-with-a-game-based-on-his-manga-sand-land">first announced last year at Summer Games Fest</a>, where we got a look at its arid setting and gorgeous art style.

The cat's out of the bag. No, really. It is. Konami and Limited Run Games are bringing retro classics Felix the Cat and Rocket Knight Adventures back for the modern age. 
</p><p>
The upcoming Felix the Cat release will include the feline's NES title and Game Boy title. Both games will come with a range of new features and "quality of life fixes" for today's gaming enjoyment. 
</p><p>
This release will be available physically for those with either a PlayStation console (it is coming to both 4 and 5) or a Nintendo Switch. Konami is handling the digital side of things, and is yet to announce a release date.

In chess, at the really great levels of play, memory tax is a huge part of what you're dealing with. You don't just have to remember what a bishop does and how castling works - I hate castling. You have to remember whole openings and end-games, and remember how to counter this kind of move, and where that will leave you, and how to regain tempo. Lots of memory tax is chess!</p><p>Often these days, though, I find myself thinking about it in all kinds of games. And this point is worth restating up front: when you're reviewing a game you play it in a very different way to how you might play it if you were playing it purely for fun. The biggest difference is focus. If I'm reviewing a game, I plough through it and I don't leave huge gaps between putti

Who could resist them? I can't. I don't know anyone who can.</p><p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a lot of things. It's the latest game in a beloved series whose lineage stretches all the way back to the glory days of home computing. It's a metroidvania so beautifully put together it almost feels like a Plantonic example of the form. It's a promising sign that Ubisoft is starting to let a series' soul dictate the ultimate structure of a game, rather than pouring its molten life into the same open-world mould. And it's a game that really knows the value and impact of a magic door.</p><p>To wit: I'm in a kind of hub area, done up like a breezy Persian marketplace.

Ubisoft will fix a small amount of text-to-speech generated dialogue in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown as part of a future update.

The upcoming 2.5D Metroidvania game features the regular human-voiced cast you'd expect, bar one character: a tree spirit named Kalux. Kalux only has a small handful of lines throughout the game, but these have been left with work-in-progress generated dialogue.

Ubisoft has said it plans to add human-recorded dialogue at a later date.

Sometimes time away can do that, can't it, reinforce our feelings about a game? I suppose if you feel strongly about it weeks or months later then you really do like it.
