That is bad enough. But his lack of morals is worse than that. After being caught as the suspected thief he probably is, he decided to BITE the security officer and abandon his kid when he ran away like the disgusting coward he is.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

It is so American, that it is enshrined in the Constitution that we have an inalienable right to defend ourselves. Canadians don’t have these sorts of human rights. It even seems as if it is a de facto crime if you stop someone who would have likely killed you.

If he had someone to endorse, he could have just said "I'm for DeSantis" or "Sure, I guess Trump." And while the Kentucky Senator has things he likes about other candidates -- Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, Robert Kennedy, Donald Trump - there is one candidate he is 100% NOT endorsing. Nikki Haley.</p><p>Rand's big announcement was the launch of <a href="https://nevernikki.net/" target="_blank">NeverNikki.net</a>.</p><p>"I'm not yet ready to make a decision, but I am ready to make a decision on someone who I cannot support," Paul stated.
