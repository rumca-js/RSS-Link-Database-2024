*An edited, illustrated and narrated playthrough of the game Dwarf Fortress*

 The Dwarves of Spearcavern have been running around like lunatics trying to traverse their labyrinthine lair. The time has come to make this place a tad more efficient!

 ..Though the dwarves should be wary of being too eager for their goals..
