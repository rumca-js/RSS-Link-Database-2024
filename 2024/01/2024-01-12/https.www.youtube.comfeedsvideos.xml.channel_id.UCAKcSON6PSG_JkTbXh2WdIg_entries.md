Although they’re based in Los Angeles, the band ill peach have strong ties to Minnesota, and they wear those ties proudly on their sleeves during their recent studio session at The Current. “I loved playing in bands in high school and going to shows,” says Pat Morrissey of ill peach. “I think the local band scene was super strong growing up. That was a major, major influence.”

Morrissey, together with  bandmate Jess Corazza and longtime collaborator Jesse Schuster, visited The Current studio to play songs from "This Is Not An Exit," the debut album from ill peach, out now on @subpop. Here's their spirited live performance of the song, "BLOOM."
