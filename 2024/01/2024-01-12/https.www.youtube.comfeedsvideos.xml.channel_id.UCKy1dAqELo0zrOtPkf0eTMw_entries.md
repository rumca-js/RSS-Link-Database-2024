In today's Daily Fix:
A third-party AI company may have accidentally revealed a release window for the Nintendo Switch 2. AI Shark—formerly GameShark (remember that thing?)—has announced that their new AI-powere game help tool will launch in the release window of the Switch 2, which according to them is September 2024. They have since said that they were basically guessing at the release date, but hmmm September does sound like a reasonable time to release a new console this year. In other game leaks, Best Buy Canada may have accidentally revealed a Version 2 of the PS5 DualSense controller with longer battery life. And finally, the upcoming Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown features an AI-generated voice...but by accident?
