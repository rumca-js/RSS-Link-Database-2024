The company&rsquo;s latest creation is with Bethesda, celebrating the long history of the original boomer shooter, <em>Doom</em>. The 65 percent board is black with blood-red accents, naturally, but it&rsquo;s the PBT keycaps that are the showstopper. They&rsquo;re completely covered in an image of the Doomslayer doin&rsquo; what he does best, giving a whole lot of demons a hell of a bad day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyboard is a spruced-up version of the Ducky One 3 SF, which features a unique double-layered case, N-key rollover for gamers, integrated silicone and foam dampening, hot-swappable switches, and RGB lighting. But if you set those lights to anything except &ldquo;hellfire red,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re doing it wrong. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extended", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2200569/duckys-hellish-doom-keyboard-is-limited-to-666-pieces.html", "date_published": "2024-01-12T15:17:23+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting changes everything about streaming to Twitch", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>At CES 2024, Nvidia and Twitch <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/twitch-multiencode-av1-livestreaming/&amp;xcust=2-2-2199898-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced a collaboration with OBS</a> called &ldquo;Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting&rdquo; &mdash; a complete overhaul of the traditional streamer-to-Twitch pipeline and encoding experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new feature aims to make streaming easier, low-latency and buffer-free viewing more accessible, and has the potential to revolutionize video quality on Twitch along the way.
