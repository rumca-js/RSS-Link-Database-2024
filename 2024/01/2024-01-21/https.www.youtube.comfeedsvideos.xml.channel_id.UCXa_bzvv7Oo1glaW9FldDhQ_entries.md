As a live service looter shooter, the upcoming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has attracted more than its fair share of skepticism from most that have laid their eyes on the game, and though there’s surely plenty about it that does warrant skepticism, the one part of the game that it’s hard not to be optimistic about is Harley Quinn.

Here, we talk about all of that and more.

Big-budget, blockbuster, AAA single player titles might be what PlayStation’s exclusive output has become known for over the years, but soon, we’ll be seeing something different from that pipeline. Several years on from the original Helldivers’ launch, Sony and developer Arrowhead Game Studios are set to launch its sequel, and in more ways than one, Helldivers 2 is looking like a promising and intriguing evolution of the original game’s chaotic co-op antics. 

From retaining elements like friendly fire and the importance of stratagems to the core gameplay to introducing new ones like an over-the-shoulder third-person camera and the added emphasis being placed on loadouts and progression systems, there’s plenty about Helldivers 2 that has caught the eye in the lead-up to its release. Here, that’s exactly what we’ll be talking about.
