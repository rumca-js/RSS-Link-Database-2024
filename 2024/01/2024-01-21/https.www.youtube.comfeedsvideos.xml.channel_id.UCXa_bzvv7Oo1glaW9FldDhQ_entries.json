Several years on from the original Helldivers\u2019 launch, Sony and developer Arrowhead Game Studios are set to launch its sequel, and in more ways than one, Helldivers 2 is looking like a promising and intriguing evolution of the original game\u2019s chaotic co-op antics. \n\nFrom retaining elements like friendly fire and the importance of stratagems to the core gameplay to introducing new ones like an over-the-shoulder third-person camera and the added emphasis being placed on loadouts and progression systems, there\u2019s plenty about Helldivers 2 that has caught the eye in the lead-up to its release.
