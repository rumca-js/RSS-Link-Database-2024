On January 8, 2024, China's NetEase released a documentary with the headline: "30 Years of Working Like This" with the subtitle: " Hefei Migrant Workers' Survival Story: Waiting for Work Starts at 4:00 a.m., and Some Can't Afford to Pay the 380-Yuan Health Insurance." 
The documentary focused on the survival of China's grassroots laborers. It resonated with the public and ignited widespread discussion. But, the next day, on January 9, 2024, the video was removed. 
At the same time, all related discussions, and comments, including those on the Zhihu website, a Quora-like website, were cleared out.
