<p>OpenAI has suspended the developer behind Dean.Bot, a ChatGPT-powered bot designed to impersonate Democratic presidential candidate Dean Phillips to help bolster his campaign, according to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/20/openai-dean-phillips-ban-chatgpt/"><em><ins>The Washington Post</ins></em></a>.

It had already been acting up prior to this, having cut its previous flight short for an unknown reason, and NASA intended to do a systems check during the latest ascent.</p>
