Remixed on the Sonicware SmplTrek with Korg Nanokey Studio

Luke: Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different.
Yoda: No. No different. Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
Luke: All right, I'll give it a try.
Yoda: No. Try not. Doâ€¦ or do not. There is no try.
