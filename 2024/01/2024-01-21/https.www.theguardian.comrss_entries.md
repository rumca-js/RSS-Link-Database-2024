<p>Avantika’s knockout comic timing lifts a lacklustre fusion of the 2004 high school comedy starring Lindsay Lohan and the 2018 Broadway show </p><p>This scattershot movie musical remake of a Broadway show based on Mark Waters’s 2004 comedy of high school hierarchies is not overly endowed with new ideas. In fact the feature directing debut of Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr adheres so closely to the story beats of the original movie – homeschooled Cady (Angourie Rice) relocates to an American school from Kenya, and finds herself adopted by the school’s in-crowd, the “Plastics” – that you rather wonder what the point of it is.</p><p>Fortunately, a couple of shambolic dance sequences notwithstanding (the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXROn5zUZ6Q">Apex Predator number</a> is a sloppy low point), <em>Mean Girls</em> has a couple of notable assets.

Guests included Venus Williams and Stella McCartney, but the lack of gawping paparazzi pics suggests it was mainly her friends in attendance; the whole thing seemed high on glamour and low on scandal, as befits a 50-year-old style icon with absolutely nothing left to prove

<p><strong>Wigmore Hall, London</strong><br />In a supremely poetic and impressive performance Levit perfectly conveyed the searching spirit of Brahms’s late-life piano works</p><p>It is a mark of Igor Levit’s standing that he can sell out the Wigmore Hall weeks in advance with an all-Brahms programme. In the event, some fractious pre-concert jostling for returns seemed almost justified: this was an outstanding evening’s pianism.</p><p>When Brahms embarked on a remarkable year of composition in 1892, he was 59 – not especially old – and yet an almost unrelieved melancholy pervades the four sets of late piano pieces, which suggests either an irreparably broken heart or an awareness of his own mortality. (And, in fact, he only had five years to live.) It makes a traversal of these often inward-looking works a special challenge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/21/igor-levit-review-wigmore-hall-london-brahms-piano">Continue reading...</a>

Russia is rounding on Ukraine and stands on the brink of war. Closer to home, animal rights activists round on the men, as they punch in for another day of grimy, factory floor killing, to tell them that “Meat Is Murder”.</p><p>The friendship between Welsh-born chatterbox Dan (Phillip John Jones) and laconic Ukrainian migrant Kostyantyn (Shannon Smith) builds nonetheless, but we see how little ability they have to change their lives in Grace Joy Howarth’s play. For a while, the soul-destroying work in the slaughterhouse seems to be the play’s focus. There is a corporate tyrant of a boss (Jordan El-Balawi) and the dull trauma of the job itself.

How much can the impression it makes on your retina move you, alienate you, create beauty or identity? On the face of it, quite a lot, and it is most of what you see when buildings are published in history books or newspapers or in snapshots in social media culture wars that pit traditional against modern buildings. But in the lived experience of architecture, other qualities are at least as important: how they work, materials and surfaces, the fall of natural and artificial light, detail and craft, scale, acoustics, the relationships of buildings to their human-made and natural surroundings, and to the lives that go on in and around them.

<p>The great British photographer is celebrated for his 1960s photos of the industrial north of England. Less well known are these early images of the secret night climbers at Cambridge University</p><p>John Bulmer was in his second year of an engineering degree at Cambridge University in the late 1950s when a recently graduated friend tipped him off about the night climbers, a secretive group of students who spent their nights scaling the tops of the college buildings. Though he wasn’t keen on heights, as a photographer who had already started to sell pictures to the national press, the opportunity was too good to pass up. So he started tracking their movements, enlisting a helper to fire off an old-fashioned flashbulb as he worked. “I wanted to photograph them in their environment, so quite often I used wide angle lenses and open flashes, because you can’t climbup a building with a tripod,” he explains.</p><p>There was a good reason for the secretiveness. Night climbing had

<p>Where to go on the Portuguese island for lush vegetation, clifftop settings, fine wine and the promise of winter sun </p><p>Set in the heart of Funchal’s atmospheric Old Town, the five historic houses that make up Castanheiro offer guests an immersion in more than 300 years of Madeiran history. Communal areas in each house are filled with antique furniture and period pieces from its earlier incarnations – one as a handcraft atelier, another the home of wealthy traders – while bedrooms are sleek and modern. The cherry on the cake is the rooftop pool, with fantastic views over Funchal and plenty of quiet outdoor spaces on the walled terraces for relaxing with a book or a cocktail. There’s no restaurant, but plenty of good options within a minute or two’s stroll.<br /><em>Doubles from £153 B&amp;B; <a href="https://www.castanheiroboutiquehotel.com/">castanheiroboutiquehotel.com</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/jan/21/raise-a-glass-to-madeira-10-gr

It finds the Edinburgh man, aged 29, on the brink of a career breakthrough, reflecting on sexy accents, gender equality, and his journey from his working-class roots. We are discouraged from taking any of it remotely seriously, mind you, because “I’m a fucking idiot”, he says, and nothing in the show aspires to any significance whatsoever.</p><p>That’s fair enough in principle, if dispiriting when attached to the idea that anyone who likes comedy with substance is “arty-farty”.

We couldn’t get enough of the pictures of her tiny features and wrinkly wee hands, and got very emotional over the footage of her coming home to meet her big brother, Charlie. Two days later, our friends Diarmaid and Kate sent photos from Melbourne of their newborn son, Tiernan, and we once again pored over the pics with fawning adoration.</p><p>We were so moved that we took a dig back through photos of our own adventures in newborn care. ‘God,’ my wife said, as we scrolled through pictures of our daughter when she was only minutes old, ‘do you remember her being that small?’</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/21/seamas-oreilly-why-have-i-so-little-memory-of-my-daughters-birth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Not a huge amount happens in this tale of illicit fortysomething love, but Jacobson’s writing is so good it hardly matters</p><p>When the writer Alan Coren was asked by his friend Jeffrey Archer to provide a quote for his new book, which Coren didn’t much like, he came up with the following: “Fans of Jeffrey Archer will not be disappointed.” It’s a joke, but it’s funny because it’s true. There are writers whose readers, once initiated, will follow them anywhere, their distinctive vision and style acting as a wall that keeps fans in the fold just as surely as it repels those with no appetite for it.</p><p>Howard Jacobson is one of those writers. For four decades his novels have covered territories of subject matter, from a washed-up academic (<em>Coming from Behind</em>, 1983) to a coming-of-age story with added ping-pong (<em>The Mighty Walzer</em>, 1999) to Jewishness and death (his 2010 Booker winner, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/15/finkler-que

It was always going to be a dream gig. Here, the actor talks about perfecting his patois, the power of authenticity and what he learned working on the Barbie set<p>After about an hour chatting with me – we are in a pub near his home in the London suburbs – the actor Kingsley Ben-Adir’s thoughts turn to some tricky work he has ahead of him this afternoon. The 37-year-old is due in a studio in town, where he’ll record some last pieces of dialogue for the new biopic <em>Bob Marley:</em> <em>One Love</em>, which is scheduled to come out on Valentine’s Day weekend. Ben-Adir plays Marley in the movie. It’s a huge opportunity for him, after a career of solid supporting work, most recently in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/barbie" title="">Barbie</a></em> (he was one of the dimmer Kens), the Marvel show <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/26/secret-invasion-recap-episode-six-its-hard-to-care-about-this-jeopardy-free-finale" title="">Secret In

Attempts to excise the group and its leaders are unlikely to succeed and risk not only perpetuating the cycle of violence but spreading it wider<p>In late 1935, a small band of irregulars led by a Syrian-born Islamist cleric launched a guerrilla campaign against the British mandatory government that had the establishment of a Jewish “national home” in what was then predominantly Arab Palestine, as part of its purview. The campaign was swiftly suppressed by British forces, and its leader, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, was killed as were the majority of his men.</p><p>But Qassam’s readiness to take up arms and die in the service of the Palestinian cause made a deep and lasting impression on Palestinian society, and his “martyrdom” became a symbol of sacrifice that has continued to resonate throughout the past 90 years, eventually providing both inspiration and a name to Hamas’s armed wing in the late 1980s. The fact that Qassam failed was essentially irrelevant. More important was his

Few remember Tokyo, the international tribunal that arraigned the surviving Japanese leadership. And yet Tokyo lasted for more than two years (1946-8), as against Nuremberg’s brisk 11 months (1945-6), produced a far taller mountain of documents and – in contrast to the German trial – found every single defendant guilty. The Tokyo judges intended to build on Nuremberg’s achievement, laying wider foundations for the code and practise of international law. But almost the only living and active memory of their efforts today is one dissenting opinion: the astonishing rejection of the tribunal itself and much of its evidence by the In

<p>Great night-time formulas for when your skin goes into repair mode</p><p>What exactly are night creams? Cynics might say they were any cream you slap on at bedtime. They’re just thicker moisturisers, right? To be clear: they are not, or at least they shouldn’t be. During the day your skin works overtime to protect itself from environmental aggressors. At night it goes into repair mode, which means it needs products to work accordingly. While you sleep, the skin loses a higher rate of moisture than it does during the day – it’s known as transepidermal water loss – so a day cream won’t touch the sides. Meaning you need great night-time formulas with powerful ingredients. Many of these increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun, but they are perfect to use while you sleep. So with the plethora of night creams on the market, how does one choose? Well think about what issue you want to tackle and be led by the ingredients that help with that: retinols and glycolic acids help t

<p>These dark days require rich wines with robust flavours to warm your spirits</p><p><strong>Piero Busso Langhe Nebbiolo, Piemonte, Italy 2017 (£23.21, <a href="http://justerinis.com/">justerinis.com</a>) </strong>Like many – most – people, I wouldn’t say I’m at my best in January. But I have at least come to a kind of accommodation with this long, dark month, a grudging respect for its uncompromising January-ness, which, looked at in the right way, can be seen as a kind of tonic or antidote to the glittery, sugary, fatty excesses of December. Certainly, in the kitchen so far this year, I’ve come to appreciate the unfussy, almost austere charms of this season’s vegetables cooked simply: the sweetly earthy bass tones of root vegetables and the trilling variations on a theme of bittersweet of cabbages, kale and sprouts. As for wine, I reckon the ideal style for this sort of food and mood, and weather, are reds that are filled with flavour, depth and texture, but don’t feel fat

<p>Fifteen months after two men were shot in Bratislava, evidence suggests the killer may have been helped by an unidentified US-based extremist</p><p>The October evening was warm and sunny. At about 7pm, two young men stepped out of the Tepláreň bar on Zámocká Street in the centre of Bratislava, to sit on a concrete bench and drink lemonade. Matúš, 23, had just arrived in the Slovakian capital to study Chinese. His 26-year-old friend worked in a local clothes shop and enjoyed anime, K-pop and dance.</p><p>Standing in an alcove a few metres away was Juraj Krajčík. The 19-year-old had been loitering for about half an hour, witnesses later said. Shortly after the two patrons of the Tepláreň sat down, Krajčík stepped forward, raised a .45-calibre handgun and fired several shots at them. Then he turned and ran, gun in hand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/slovakian-gay-bar-attack-great-replacement-conspiracy-theoryfast-spreading-racist-ideology">Continu
