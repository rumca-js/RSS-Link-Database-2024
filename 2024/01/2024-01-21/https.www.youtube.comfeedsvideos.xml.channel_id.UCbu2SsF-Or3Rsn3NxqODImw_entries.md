The Glock is the most popular pistol in the world, so it’s no surprise that this pistol has been a trusty sidearm in dozens of video games, including Half-Life, Counter-Strike, and Call of Duty. It’s a pistol that has enjoyed a huge amount of pop culture attention, but the weapon has also been surrounded by its fair share of myths and tropes.

With the help of Keeper of Firearms & Artillery, Jonathan Ferguson, we’ve come to the Royal Armouries museum in the UK to take a deep dive into the story and video game legacy of the iconic Glock.

In this episode of Loadout, Dave Jewitt visits the Royal Armouries to talk to Keeper of Firearms & Artillery Jonathan Ferguson to chat about one of pop culture’s most iconic pistols, the Glock!
