They then followed this up with two sequels, before shifting to sci-fi for their upcoming novel,\u00a0Exordia.\u00a0 Much like their fantasy novels, it&#8217;s an absolutely fascinating tale, and ponders the psychology of violence, along with the hard choices we make and justify to ourselves. Seth was kind enough to sit down with us at\u00a0Grimdark Magazine\u00a0and answer some questions we had for them, ranging from their thoughts on that theme of violence, to literary inspirations and what they&#8217;re working on next&#8230; [GdM] Like The Traitor Baru Cormorant, your book Exordia was a short story before it became a novel. In this case, Anna Saves Them All.
