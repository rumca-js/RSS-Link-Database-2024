<p>This witty debut novel, set in 412BC, imagines a couple of locals drumming up a production of Medea with captured Athenian soldiers</p><p>This immensely likable debut novel from Irish writer Ferdia Lennon opens in Syracuse, south-east Sicily, in 412BC. The city has lately defeated a military expedition from Athens and thousands of surviving invaders have been thrown into nearby quarries to rot. No Syracusans lament their fate until two locals visit one day with an idea to cast the prisoners in a play by Euripides.</p><p>The two men are Gelon, a melancholy theatre obsessive, and his wisecracking friend Lampo, who narrates the novel in a distinctly un-Sicilian voice. “Would you be knowing any passages?” he demands of a near-dead Athenian, seeking an actor to play Jason in <em>Medea</em>. Soon the pair are sneaking down daily to rehearse their ragtag troupe for a double bill to which the whole town is invited.</p><p><em>Glorious Exploits</em> by Ferdia Lennon is published by

<p>‘Top Boy’ Kane Robinson and Jedaiah Bannerman excel in the directors’ feature debut, which isn’t quite as distinctive as its near-future setting</p><p>The directorial debut of Kibwe Tavares and Daniel Kaluuya unfolds in a dystopian near-future London, a city in which the division between the haves and the have-nots has deepened to such an extent that society seems to be simmering on the brink of a civil war. The flashpoint is the Kitchen, a condemned housing estate that nods to <em>Blade Runner</em>-style future slums and the powder-keg banlieue of Romain Gavras’s 2022 film <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/02/athena-review-venice-film-festival-romain-gavras">Athena</a></em>.

Then he encounters Benji (Jedaiah Bannerman), a 12-year-old whose mother has just died and who is looking

<p>The German director is more illuminating than anyone else in this rich profile</p><p>Thomas von Steinaecker’s documentary portrait of Werner Herzog, the singular German film-making talent who gave us pictures such as <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,4267,539047,00.html">Aguirre, Wrath of God</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jun/24/dvdreviews">Fitzcarraldo</a></em> and the documentary<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/feb/03/1"> </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/feb/03/1">Grizzly Man</a></em>, is every bit as fascinating as you would hope. A director who is not just open to the chaos on the fringes of civilisation, but who voluntarily invites it into his life (in the form of the actor and world-class pain in the ass Klaus Kinski), Herzog has a wealth of meaty anecdotes. <em>Radical Dreamer</em> is less successful in its attempt to bring in other voices

<p>James uses the pursuit of a plundered 18th-century artefact to examine the legacy of colonialism in a vivid novel that straddles continents</p><p>Tania James’s fiction has straddled continents since the publication of her 2009 debut, <em>Atlas of Unknowns</em>. In <em>Loot</em>, her third full-length novel, she brings this transnational perspective to the story of a real-life artefact and the fictional characters drawn into its gravitational pull.</p><p>The object in question, known as Tipu’s Tiger, is a wooden automaton commissioned in the 1790s by Tipu Sultan, ruler of the Indian kingdom of Mysore. It currently resides in the V&amp;A and depicts a near-life-size tiger mauling the prone body of a European soldier; machinery inside causes the figures to emit a growl when a crank is turned. The circumstances of the tiger’s origin are lost to us, but – according to an authorial note – its craftsmanship suggests a melding of Indian and French expertise. From these scant detai
