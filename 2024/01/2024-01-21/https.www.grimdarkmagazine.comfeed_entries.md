<p>Seth Dickinson first astounded (and broke the hearts of) readers when they burst onto the scene with their 2015 debut novel, The Traitor Baru Cormorant, a fiery and unapologetic look at imperialism, rebellion and the sacrifices an islander savant must give to reclaim their conquered home. They then followed this up with two sequels, before shifting to sci-fi for their upcoming novel, Exordia.  Much like their fantasy novels, it&#8217;s an absolutely fascinating tale, and ponders the psychology of violence, along with the hard choices we make and justify to ourselves. Seth was kind enough to sit down with us at Grimdark Magazine and answer some questions we had for them, ranging from their thoughts on that theme of violence, to literary inspirations and what they&#8217;re working on next&#8230; [GdM] Like The Traitor Baru Cormorant, your book Exordia was a short story before it became a novel.
