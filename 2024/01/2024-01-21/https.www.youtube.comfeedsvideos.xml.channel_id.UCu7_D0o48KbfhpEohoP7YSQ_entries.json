With the standardization of USB-C connectors, it also became easier, right? Wrong. Because, without precautions, you still will encounter low transfer speeds and slow or even no charging at all.\nBecause the topic is complex, I will divide it into two parts. Today, we will start with Power Delivery. After the two videos, you will understand this new technology and will be able to avoid pitfalls.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nKM003C: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdjeEi9 or https://amzn.to/42bwVqc\nCH224 PD chip: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DCDHkK9\nUSB-C PCB connector: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEwDO8Z\n240W/40GB Cable: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdyPtcl\nUSB-C Tester: https://bit.ly/3S0a1P6\nQuick Charge video: https://youtu.be/dw3MehLAyWU\nUSB-C connectors with resistors: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdgzNcN\nTest adapters: ht", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV03FfdPHOw", "date_published": "2024-01-21T08:00:27+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Andreas Spiess", "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/qV03FfdPHOw/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
