The anti-anxiety drug diazepam causes side effects: drowsiness, confusion, and nausea. The same applies to the antidepressant amitriptyline. A possible solution to the problem could be a new compound, GML-3. It simultaneously exhibits the anti-anxiety activity of diazepam and the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline. At the same time, it is devoid of most of their side effects. However, it is not used in pharmaceuticals since it is poorly soluble in water; this is a necessary condition to create convenient dosage forms based on the drug.

The global effort to keep climate change to safe levels—ideally within 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures—is moving far too slowly. And even if we stopped emitting CO2 today, the long-term impacts of the gas already in the air would continue for decades. For these reasons, we will soon have to focus not only on halting but on reversing global warming.

The bulk of the computing in state-of-the-art neural networks comprises linear operations, e.g., matrix-vector multiplications and convolutions. Linear operations can also play an important role in cryptography. While dedicated processors such as GPUs and TPUs are available for performing highly parallel linear operations, these devices are power-hungry, and the low bandwidth of electronics still limits their operation speed. Optics is better suited for such operations because of its inherent parallelism and large bandwidth and computation speed.

A team of scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory and Columbia University has demonstrated a way to produce large quantities of the receptor that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, binds to on the surface of human cells. That binding between the now-infamous viral spike protein and the human "ACE2" receptor is the first step of infection by the virus. Making functional human ACE2 protein in mouse cells gives scientists a new way to study these receptors and potentially put them to use. In addition, as described in a paper just published in the journal Virology, the method could facilitate the study of other complex proteins that have proven difficult to produce by other means.
