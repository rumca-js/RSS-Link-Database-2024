## Palworld Sells 5 Million Copies Over the Weekend, Devs Get Death Threats - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
Palworld sold 5 million copies across Steam and Xbox over the weekend, making it a certified smash hit. But not everyone's happy. Apparently some die-hard Pokémon fans are taking issue with the pals' very Pokémon-esque character design (which...fair), and have sent some very nasty messages to the developers. In other news, the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel could be getting multiplayer, after the mode was planned and then scrapped from the most recent game. And finally, RoboCop: Rogue City gets an update that adds New Game Plus, which now makes killing bad guys in cheesy 80's style just a little more difficult, if that's your thing.

The Mandalorian Movie is announced taking the adventures of The Mandalorian to movie screens! Star Wars had a certified hit with The Mandalorian (Season 3 has fair criticism though), but it’s undeniable the series changed everything with “Baby Yoda,” and star Pedro Pascal. We’re discussing what will come in the Mandalorian full movie, who is “Mandalorian,” and how Grogu holds everything together beyond Disney+. Din Djarin and Boba Fett are important Mando characters, but are they indeed “The Mandalorian?” 2023 was a rough year for the Star Wars Galaxy, and the starpower from The Mandalorian, Grogu, and co might just be a winning solution. Can they pull it off? Will The Mandalorian and Grogu movie set the tone? And just when are we getting The Mandalorian season 4? Here’s why we think the biggest hero of all  is Grogu, “Baby Yoda,” as some of you know him.

Based on Donald L. Miller’s book of the same name, and scripted by John Orloff, “Masters of the Air” follows the men of the 100th Bomb Group (the “Bloody Hundredth”) as they conduct perilous bombing raids over Nazi Germany and grapple with the frigid conditions, lack of oxygen and sheer terror of combat conducted at 25,000 feet in the air. Portraying the psychological and emotional price paid by these young men as they helped destroy the horror of Hitler’s Third Reich, is at the heart of “Masters of the Air.” Some were shot down and captured; some were wounded or killed. And some were lucky enough to make it home. Regardless of individual fate, a toll was exacted on them all.

From executive producers Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman, the series features a stellar cast led by Academy Award nominee Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle, Nate Mann, Rafferty Law, Academy Award nominee Barry Keoghan, Josiah Cross, Branden Cook and Ncuti Gatwa. “Masters of the A
