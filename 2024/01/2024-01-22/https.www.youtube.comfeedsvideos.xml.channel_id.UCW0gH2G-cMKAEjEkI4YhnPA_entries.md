As we enjoyed the South of Rivendell mountain-side filming location, I thought it would be the perfect place to share my newest collectible - made by the incredible folks at @wetaworkshopnz !  This is a mini-length unboxing as we were quite tight on time, but look for more collectibles vids in the future!

Product Description:
Gandalf on Gwaihir is brought to you by sculptor Gary Hunt, an accomplished artist who is one of Wētā Workshop's longest-serving crew members, being part of the original Lord of the Rings crew.

Gary has captured this iconic pairing for you in a perfectly sized miniature statue - ideal for your bookshelf or desktop. Gandalf on Gwaihir is an Open Edition statue.
