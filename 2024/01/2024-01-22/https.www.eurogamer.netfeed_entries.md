With a sequel now just months away, developer Ninja Theory has temporarily slashed the price of its acclaimed action-adventure Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice to a mere &pound;2.49 on Steam, meaning you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/414340/Hellblade_Senuas_Sacrifice/?curator_clanid=1749">currently pick up</a> one of 2017's best games for less than the price of an unspecified hypothetical object costing &pound;2.50 or above.
</p><p>
Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, if you clicked on this story because you can't resist a bargain and not because you have any idea what a Hellblade actually is, tells the story of Senua, a Pict warrior - brilliantly played by Melina Juergens - who ventures into Helheim in a bid to rescue the soul of her dead love

Developer Rocksteady have detailed Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's initial post-launch plans, confirming The Joker will arrive as a playable character in a free content update accompanying the game's first "season".
</p><p>
As per Rocksteady's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qyGmNNMnBE">latest Insider video</a>, each of Suicide Squad's post-launch seasons will be themed around a different DC character, with The Joker kicking things off when Season 1 arrives in March. The Joker - well, <em>a</em> Joker technically, seeing as he's an alternate-reality Elseworlds variant hoovered into the Arkhamverse by Brainiac - promises unique traversal abilities and weaponry, including a dainty mace and a rocket-powered umbrella that'll let him launch into the air, drift, and grind on buildings to knock

## Multiplayer being 'considered' for Cyperpunk 2077 sequel says CD Projekt

CD Projekt has confirmed it's "considering" multiplayer elements for its Cyberpunk 2077 sequel during an update on the studio's current development plans - which also included word it's aiming to start the production phase for its next Witcher game this year.
</p><p>
That's according to CD Projekt CEO Adam Badowski, who touched on the Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up - officially codenamed Orion - in an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cd-projekt-aims-start-production-phase-polaris-2024-2024-01-22/">interview with Reuters</a>. While Badowski "would not discuss details" about potential multiplayer elements for the sci-fi sequel beyond confirming the studio was "considering" them, it's an interesting admission all the same.
</p><p>
CD Projekt did, of course, have major multiplayer plans for the original Cyberpunk 2

## How The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered's Lost Levels would have offered further insight into Ellie's trauma

The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered released last week, giving players a native-PS5 version of Ellie and Abby's harrowing experiences. 
</p><p>
Along with this rerelease, developer Naughty Dog included some extra bits and pieces to entice players back, such as its roguelike survival mode No Return (see first video below). However, the extra that piqued my interest most when I dived back in this weekend was the game's Lost Levels. 
</p><p>
As a reminder, there are three Lost Levels included with The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered: Jackson Party, Seattle Sewers and The Hunt. Each offers an interesting bit of background for each level, such as why it didn't make it to the final cut and other development insight. But the bit I want to talk about specifically is how two of the three Lost Levels would address Ellie's trau

## DF Direct Weekly: Xbox's Developer Direct is the perfect vehicle for a big game reveal

It's been just over a year now since Microsoft delivered its first Developer Direct - and back in the day I called it the "best games show we've seen in years". After its latest episode, I stand by those words and more than that, I also believe it's the perfect way to debut a big new game. I don't think they get much bigger with the hugely promising Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. 
</p><p>
This new Developer Direct is the main point of discussion in this week's DF Direct (no underscore) Weekly, where myself, John Linneman and Alex Battaglia share our first thoughts on each of the key titles shown in the show - but the key point is that the formula for the Microsoft show fundamentally addresses a key concern we've had with platform holder event coverage and the 'trailerfication' of games.

## Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy brings some 3DS classics back to their rightful home

For ages I'd been hovering over the trigger for Ace Attorney 5 and 6 (or Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice, to give them their full titles), hoping they'd go on a decent sale, only to miss them altogether when the eShop closed.</p><p>I had previously played Ace Attorney 4 (Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney), which was released in Europe in 2008 on the DS, but I missed out on the other two in the trilogy. Both were released on 3DS, in 2013 and 2016 respectively, but I didn't get a 3DS until it was too late. By that time, it wasn't easy to buy a physical copy of Dual Destinies easily, and Spirit of Justice was only available digitally outside of Japan. The two have been made ava

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-type-chart-strengths-weaknesses-every-element-9409">Palworld</a> is a bit different on Xbox compared to Steam in part because of Microsoft's certification process. 
</p><p>
Over on the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/palworld-dev-explains-steam-xbox-differences-missing-features">Palworld Discord server</a>, the game's community manager Bucky clarified that the versions of Palworld are "not the same between Steam and Xbox", as in Steam v1.2 and Xbox v1.2 are different even though the version numbers are the same.

Chocobo are the giant yellow birds seen across the Final Fantasy series as steeds for various characters. So when Hamaguchi was asked by Game Informer if they smell bad, he replied: "It might be similar to a horse".
</p><p>
To be honest, I would've assumed they smell more like a chicken, but a horse certainly makes sense. The real question, though, is what do moogle smell like? I'd say probably nuts.

A marketing campaign designed to promote recruitment in the British Army using a custom-made Fortnite map looks to have been taken offline. 
</p><p>
Social media posts and a slickly-produced trailer for the British Army recruitment drive have now been removed, Eurogamer has spotted.
</p><p>
Their so-far unexplained disappearance follows a backlash to the campaign, which was set to centre on a new Fortnite experience and be promoted by high profile influencers.

Palword lets players capture NPC humans in a tiny ball - and then sell them on the black market.

Yes, there's an even darker element to Palworld beyond just "Pok&eacute;mon with guns". If you thought capturing creatures and squishing them into tiny balls was inhumane, just wait.

In Palworld players meet various human NPCs, some of which can be fought in battle. And, as streamer Coney, found out, they can then be captured.

Master Chief actor Pablo Schreiber has said he will stake his reputation on Halo's next season being better than the first.  
</p><p>
The first season of Paramount's Halo adaptation received mixed reviews on its release in 2022. Many lamented the show's direction, with it veering away from the source material in many ways. This not only included seeing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramounts-halo-reveals-master-chiefs-face">Master Chief without his iconic helmet</a> numerous times over, but also watching the mighty Spartan having a sexual relationship (something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-tv-show-star-says-master-chiefs-romantic-relationship-was-a-huge-mistake">Schreiber has said was a "huge mistake"</a>).

"Pok&eacute;mon with guns" game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-type-chart-strengths-weaknesses-every-element-9409">Palworld</a> has just blasted through yet another sales milestone - of 5m copies sold in three days.

The extraordinary launch and success of Palworld comes on top of the game's arrival for Xbox, including via Game Pass. There's no word yet on how many more players have also joined in with the game using Microsoft's subscription.
