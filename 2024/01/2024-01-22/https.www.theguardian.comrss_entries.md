From the age of nine months, I was on the run, according to my mother. Not in a sporty or graceful way (I’d often bump into things), but in an energetic, let’s get on with things, way.

Instead of bubbling with plans, I staggered into the new year feeling weary and disenchanted and unable to commit to a single goal. That didn’t mean I wasn’t busy, especially at work.

<p>Enzo Maresca was matter of fact about the implications of both the best and worst-case scenarios playing out in this contest being much the same but that will do little to make him feel any better after Leicester squandered the chance to open up a 10-point gap at the top of the Championship. Ipswich Town, revitalised by Kieran McKenna, a prodigious manager schooled at Tottenham and Manchester United, struck an equaliser through the Brighton loanee Jeremy Sarmiento with a minute of the regular 90 left to play in an absorbing contest.</p><p>A quick glance at the team sheet and the temptation is to assume little has changed since Leicester were relegated last season. After all, Ricardo Pereira, James Justin and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall are in the starting lineup and Jamie Vardy, 37 earlier this month, is still knocking around, too, back in the squad following a knee injury. Kelechi Iheanacho and Patson Daka would be involved were they not at the Africa Cup of Nations. The same g

The show will complete its run at London’s Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 8 September, having been seen by more than 2.8 million people.

With Sam Kerr out for the rest of the season with an ACL injury some might have expected the Blues to struggle in attack. However, Lauren James stepped up in her absence, scoring a hat-trick against her former side to maintain Chelsea’s three-point lead at the top of the table. The England international was clinical whenever she found the ball in the penalty area, which proved to be the key difference between the two teams. James has 10 goals in 10 league games and if she keeps up this form, Emma Hayes has absolutely nothing to worry about. “Human beings are not simple,” Hayes said after the game. “There are a lot of complexities involved with Lauren, but she is a genius footballer.

<p>Quick plays a 70-year-old writer who takes a new treatment that could enable her to have a child. She is emotionally transparent and intellectually engaged, unlike the film</p><p>Diana Quick makes a return to the big screen – after a six-year break – with a first-rate performance in a second-rate (perhaps third-rate) film. Forever Young is a ploddingly drab British sci-fi drama that really doesn’t have what it takes to keep up with Quick; she stars as a 70-year-old writer taking an unlicensed drug to reverse the ageing process. It’s impossible to take your eyes off her: intellectually engaged and emotionally transparent. It’s a pity then that the script is unserious and uninteresting, with nothing to say either about the existential leap in the dark of eternal youth or the ethics of the anti-ageing industry.</p><p>Quick is Robyn, a bestselling author who’s been happily married to Oscar (Bernard Hill) for donkey’s years. Robyn’s big regret is her decision not to have kids.

<p>Ragu doesn’t <em>have </em>to feature meat or tomato – this one is a sublime, buttery sauce brimming with leeks, parmesan and cream</p><p>With a roll and a goo, <em>rag</em><em>u</em> is a satisfying word. It comes from the French <em>ragout,</em> which indicates a stew of meat and vegetables, often with something highly flavoured added towards the end of the cooking. In fact, the related verb is<em> ragoûter</em>, which means to awaken or perk up the <em>goût (</em>taste and appetite). In Italian cooking, the word ragu is inextricably associated with the heavily protected and beefy <em>ragu alla bolognese</em> and <em>ragu alla Napoletana</em>, but it is also – quietly – used to describe a whole universe of fish and vegetable stews to go with pasta.</p><p>Among them are this week’s recipe, <em>ragu di verdura</em>, from the excellent <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/osteria-9780789339638">Slow Food book of osteria recipes</a>, and a place called Trattoria Conca Verde

<p>There are more and more ways to monitor our heart rates, but what do the numbers really mean? Here is everything you need to know</p><p>Are you sitting comfortably? If so, put out one hand so you’re looking at your palm, then use the first and middle fingers of your other hand to feel for the pulse on the inside of your wrist. Count the beats for 60 seconds, and that’s your heart rate. Assuming you’re resting rather than exercising or stressed, it will probably be somewhere between 60 and 100 beats a minute. But what does it mean if it’s at the top or bottom of the range – or even outside it?</p><p>We’ve known about the connection between heart rate and health for thousands of years. Herophilus of Alexandria (325-255 BC), sometimes known as the father of anatomy, designed a water clock to time the pulse, at around the same time that Chinese physicians were using its strength and regularity to diagnose disease. A couple of centuries later, Roman Greek surgeon Galen nudged t

<p>Turner is holding Forest back, Cornet finally seizes his West Ham chance and Jota is Liverpool’s Solskjær</p><p>The oddity of Arsenal’s win over Crystal Palace was that their performance was probably less impressive than the one that brought FA Cup defeat to Liverpool. Gabriel Martinelli’s two late goals may have handy longer-term consequences as a confidence boost. The low-key nature of their victory highlighted the level of aimlessness around their opponents, who turned up corporeally but never looked like being protagonists. Palace’s owners took the brunt of fans’ ire and there is little suggestion knives will be out for Roy Hodgson. But something needs to change. The best that can currently be said for Palace is that the table will probably show three inferior teams – or at least three with a smaller points tally – at the end of the season. That does not bode well. Drift has a habit of accelerating rapidly into decline and the questions reverberating around Palace’s co

<p>Children’s play reveals a lot about life – making it all the more vital to rescue Britain’s playgrounds from austerity and decline</p><p>Like many parents of young children, I spend much of my life in playgrounds. We are lucky in that there are six of them within close walking distance and, because my son loves to be outdoors, some days we will go to two or three different ones.

By which I mean go completely and utterly berserk.</p><p>From the moment your child is born, you become grateful for playgrounds. Even before your baby is old enough to play, these spaces can be a refuge: from traffic, drunks and scary dogs. They seem to be the only remaining places outside parks where benches are permitted; in areas without playgrounds, you end up breastfeeding sitting on kerbs or walls. Playgrounds are spaces for children but, t

<p>The only thing we should be doing at 3.39am is sleeping – but the Australian Open’s organisers appear to think otherwise</p><p>A couple of years ago scientists in California had an intriguing theory. Might a lack of sleep affect a person’s desire to help out another human being? And so, like all good scientists, they put it to the test.</p><p>First&nbsp;they recruited 24 adults and split them into two groups – one of which pulled an all-nighter, while the other slept normally. Then they got everyone to answer a series of&nbsp;questions, such as “I would offer my seat on a crowded bus to a 60-year-old woman”, and perform a social cognition task, while their brains underwent an MRI scan. Finally, they replayed the experiment, swapping the groups.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/22/tennis-must-call-time-on-torturous-3am-finishes-australian-open">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 17th-century painting The Tiger Hunt depicts a visceral battle for power that perfectly sets up the HBO series – and paintings on the walls in other TV shows hold hidden messages</p><p>From old masters to contemporary scenes, artworks are often embedded in our favourite TV shows. They can foreshadow a narrative, give an insight into a character’s storyline, or influence the aesthetics of the whole series. Yet we might not decipher this at first glance.</p><p>It was when I heard the name Artemisia Gentileschi, and her painting Self-Portrait as an Allegory of Painting, being discussed by Prince Philip and art historian (and spy) Anthony Blunt on season three of The Crown, that I realised that art on TV is often much more than just set dressing. The conversation about Gentileschi spoke to the history of the royal collection – the painting was a commission by King Charles I who personally invited the artist to England in 1638 – and pointed to the prominence Gentileschi had

<p>An exhaustive biography of Thomas Hardy’s romantic life is most fascinating when it chronicles his complicated menage with his wife and a young typist</p><p>If only I had the talent, I would write the play. The year: 1910, or thereabouts. The scene: a gloomy drawing room in a large country house, through whose windows the audience is able to see the reason for the murk in the form of a veritable forest of dark and brooding conifers. The cast comprises three main characters: a celebrated writer with white hair, an unusually big head and a beaky nose; his elderly wife, whose clothes, like her manner, are eccentric; and a much younger woman, a companion and typist whose careful warmth barely covers the ruthlessness beneath. Minor characters include a devoted housemaid with a doll-like face, and two grand, male literary visitors, whose bitchy gossip about the household will one day be preserved for all posterity.</p><p>I would call it Max Gate<em>, </em>which is the name of th

<p>Dutch Estonian novelist Sana Valiulina investigates the life of her father who was compelled to betray Stalin’s Soviet Union by serving the Nazi war machine </p><p>Aliona van der Horst’s documentary tells an impossibly painful and sad story from the second world war; it is an extraordinary tale, arguably worthy of Boris Pasternak and David Lean. It is presented by Dutch Estonian novelist Sana Valiulina, born in Soviet-era Tallinn and resident in Amsterdam since 1989. All her life, she reveals, she has been obsessed with the memory of her father, Sayar, a cold and distant figure when she was growing up, because for 15 years after the war he had been imprisoned in the gulag and made to internalise a grotesque sense of shame for having allowed himself to be taken prisoner by the Nazis after the battle of Smolensk in 1941; Stalin had told his troops to die in combat rather than submit to this dishonour.</p><p>Sayar never spoke about the war, or his postwar experiences in the g

<p>A network of privilege entrenches Tory power. To dismantle it, Labour must be bold about remaking the political landscape</p><p>No matter what profound changes come about in England, one thing always seems to remain the same: the unshakable belief that it is simply a conservative country. This is an influential article of faith: the only way Labour can win power, it follows, is to treat voters as so naturally hostile to leftwing politics that they must be appealed to on Tory ground. Keir Starmer’s Labour is lauded as wise and sensible for accepting these terms – wooing big business, being averse to borrowing and spending, adopting a hard line on immigration and ruling out a wealth tax on the richest. In a “conservative country that occasionally votes Labour”, these are the rules.</p><p>But are they really?
