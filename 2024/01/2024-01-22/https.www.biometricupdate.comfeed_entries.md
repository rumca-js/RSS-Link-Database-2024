		An alleged draft of the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act has been leaked online on Monday, shedding light on how and exactly when Europe will regulate contentious issues such as biometric surveillance.

The 892-page draft was posted online by Euractiv Technology Editor Luca Bertuzzi. The document was shared with EU countries yesterday afternoon, ahead of a discussion scheduled for Wednesday within the Telecom Working Party, an EU Council technical body focused on regulating the IT sector. The meeting will be followed by a formal adoption at the ambassador level on February 2nd, according to the journalist's post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/luca-bertuzzi-186729130_aiactfinalfour-column21012024pdf-activity-7155091883872964608-L4Dn

		Nigeria is racing to meet a World Bank target of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/nigerias-digital-id-strides-hailed-but-more-work-needed-to-hit-148m-enrollments-by-2024">issuing digital ID to at least 148 million</a> citizens in the course of this year, but efforts to attain this goal are bedevilled by a myriad of challenges. With over 104 million digital IDs already issued notwithstanding, authorities regret that the issuance process has been facing problems such as lack of adequate infrastructure, insufficient funding, piling debts, as well as corruption and other malpractices perpetrated by some stakeholders like third-party agents involved in the digital ID enrollment process.

		A new U.S. state age-verification law will take effect in March 1 and the government still does not have rules for it. Free speech advocates say it also lacks a single Constitutional leg.

The law, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/new-social-media-regulations-in-utah-try-to-push-childrens-use-off">passed in Utah</a> last year, will <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/france-utah-consider-age-verification-for-social-media-users">require</a> all state residents to verify their age before accessing social media.

		Another couple U.S. states are considering the benefits of digital identification.

New Mexico legislators, with the <a href="https://www.krqe.com/news/politics-government/legislature/new-mexico-motor-vehicle-division-asks-lawmakers-for-electronic-drivers-licenses/">encouragement </a>of the state’s motor vehicle department, have introduced a <a href="https://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/24%20Regular/bills/senate/SB0088.pdf">bill</a> that would make mobile driver’s licenses legal and create an ID verification service.

		Authorities running <a href="https://www.laliga.com/en-GB">LaLiga</a>, Spain’s top tier football league, announced last year they will deploy a facial recognition system at stadiums for fan access, but the plan is being seriously questioned by the country’s data protection authority.

LaLiga issued a tender to pick a contractor for the stadium facial recognition project in October, as <a href="https://www.economiadigital.es/empresas/laliga-reconocimiento-facial-estadios.html">reported</a> then by Economia Digital.

According to the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD), the processing of biometric data raises the need for a thorough review of related governance, legislative and technical aspects.

		The UK’s data protection watchdog says UK police will likely allow the use of cloud services that can send sensitive law enforcement data overseas, including biometrics.

The arrangement will be possible thanks to the information-sharing agreement with the U.S. government known as the U.S. Cloud Act, Computer Weekly <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366566869/ICO-prompts-confusion-over-its-position-on-police-cloud-legality">reports</a>. The Information Commissioner Office (ICO) told the outlet that UK police can legally use cloud services to send sensitive law enforcement data overseas with “appropriate protections” in place. The Office did not specify what these protections are.

The statement is in line with previous announcements from Scottish Biometrics C

		A group of 18 American senators from the Democratic Caucus have written to the Department of Justice to express concerns that funding for facial recognition programs could contribute to civil rights violations.

Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Richard Durbin and 16 other senators pose eight questions to the DoJ about what assurances Americans have that federal funds aren’t violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Their concerns are sparked by the recent news about the false arrest of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/lawsuit-filed-in-us-cross-country-arrest-allegedly-based-on-face-biometrics">Randal Quran Reid</a> and five other cases where facial recognition has been used prior to arrests of innocent bl

Most Americans have become comfortable using face and fingerprint biometrics as a way to unlock their mobile phones. In 2024, the number of Americans using digital IDs and biometric verification to pass more quickly through airport checkpoints will start to catch up.

A growing number of the state agencies that issue identity credentials like driver’s licenses are working to make digital IDs available to residents in the form of mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs). They are also collaborating with federal offici
