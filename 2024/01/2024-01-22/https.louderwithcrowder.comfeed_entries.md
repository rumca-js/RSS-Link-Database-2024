And because Hollywood is filled with a bunch of degenerate commies with no talent, it is never shocking to learn that a classic and timeless fan favorite will now be remade into a more woke and inclusive version. Which we all know will be very bad since there has never been a woke remake of anything better than the original. Not once. </p><p><em>Black-ish</em> creator Kenya Barris is planning on remaking “It’s a Wonderful Life” through the lens of wokeness. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

That is both an opinionated statement and a provable fact because not surprisingly, she has<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbcs-joy-reid-smallest-quarterly-audience-since-reidout-launched" target="_blank"> one of the worst-rated </a>“news” channels on cable. And this story is exactly why no one watches her joke of a show. </p><p>Tiffany Justice, one of the co-founders of Moms for Liberty, agreed to an interview with Reid. That is what they agreed to. But that is not what happened. The segment ended up being Reid condoning books with abhorrent, deranged, and evil content, like the rape of a child by a teacher, saying that it should be up to the parents to decide if their kids should be exposed to “content” about pedophilia rape. </p><
