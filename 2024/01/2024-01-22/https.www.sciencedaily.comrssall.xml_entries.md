A new study investigated trends in calls to poison centers across the country for exposures to liquid laundry detergent packets. The study investigators identified declines in the number, rate and severity of liquid laundry detergent packet exposures among children younger than 6 years. However, the exposure burden remained high. Additionally, exposures have increased among older children, teens and adults.

When people develop myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS), the healthy maturation of blood cells is impaired. Severe forms, known as higher-risk MDS, are characterized by rapid progression, severe symptoms and often a transition to acute leukemia. Patients for whom potentially curative or intensive treatments, such as stem cell transplantation or high-dose chemotherapy, are not suitable, have very few alternative treatment options.

## Scientists trap krypton atoms to form one-dimensional gas

Scientists have successfully trapped atoms of krypton (Kr), a noble gas, inside a carbon nanotube to form a one-dimensional gas. Scientists used advanced transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods to capture the moment when Kr atoms joined together, one by one, inside a 'nano test tube' container with diameter half a million times smaller than the width of a human hair.
