Twenty years into a hip-hop career that includes 10 years as part of the acclaimed group Run The Jewels, Killer Mike has released the solo album, "Michael," (available on @LomaVistaRecs) so that people would get to know the more personal side of Michael Render, “that little nine-year-old boy on the album cover with the horns and the halo and the buck teeth and the smile.”

From a session recorded live in The Current studio, watch Killer Mike and the Midnight Revival Choir perform "MOTHERLESS" from the album.
