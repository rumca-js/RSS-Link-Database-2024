<p><em>The Day Before</em> is no more. The spectacular trainwreck of a game, which saw developer Fntastic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-get-a-refund-for-the-day-before-the-game-that-got-canned-in-just-four-days-045153224.html">announcing its closure</a> only four days after launch, closed its servers for good on Monday, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-is-now-well-and-truly-dead-45-days-after-it-came-out">reports</a> <em>IGN</em>. Publisher Mytona has wiped all references to the much-hyped Steam Early Access title from its website.</p>
<p>To recap the timeline, the $40 game launched on December 7, Fntastic abruptly <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/FntasticHQ/status/1734265789237338453">said</a> it was shutting down on December 11 and Mytona pulled the plug on the game’s servers on January 22.

<p>Apple has released iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 to users. This is a modest refresh, so don’t go looking for anything too crazy. There is, however, a new feature <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-173s-stolen-device-protection-will-make-life-harder-for-iphone-thieves-201633214.html"><ins>called Stolen Device Protection. </ins></a>This isn’t used to locate a stolen iPhone or iPad, but rather to keep the thieves from accessing your personal data.</p>
<p>The feature first popped up in the developer beta of iOS 17.3 and it’s actually pretty handy. If someone manages to steal your iPhone or iPad, and you are updated to OS 17.3, you can lock them out of the system by forcing Face ID or Touch ID access. This works even if they have your passcode, so they won’t be able to put in their own biometrics and lock you out.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The software automatically mandates a one-hour security delay before changing the passcode if the phone or tablet is recogn

<p>As mortgage lender LoanDepot continues recovery efforts from a ransomware attack, it revealed on Monday that hackers stole data from more than 16 million customers. A <a href="https://media.loandepot.com/news-releases/press-release-details/2024/loanDepot-Provides-Update-on-Cyber-Incident/default.aspx">Securities and Exchange Commission filing</a> from the mortgage lender did not detail what kind of information the hackers breached, only that &quot;an unauthorized third party gained access to sensitive personal information.&quot;</p>

The company took some IT systems offline, but it faced <a href="https://loandepot.cyberincidentupdate.com/">a slow recovery</a>.

<p>A cyberattack hit Carnegie Mellon University last summer and the attackers breached personal data, according to a disclosure from the school last week. The Pittsburgh-based university known for its top tech and computer science programs <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/carnegie-mellon-university-cyberattack-impacting-7000-people/">said on Friday</a> that the attack impacted 7,300 students, employees, contractors and other affiliates.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no evidence of fraud or inappropriate use of the information from those files,&quot; a statement from CMU said. Still, the attackers likely accessed and copied data that included names, social security numbers and birth dates. With help from law enforcement, CMU disabled any access to that copied data, according to the school.</p>

<p>Pixar‘s 1998 movie, <em>A Bug’s Life</em>, brought tiny CGI ants to the world’s largest screens. National Geographic’s new docu-series, <em>A Real Bug’s Life</em> inverts that, turning insects into giants in our homes. The only thing digital about the critters featured in the Disney+ series, though, is the technology filming them. But like its animated counterpart, the show explores the world they live in and their adventures in ways we’ve never seen before.</p>
<p>With its focus on insects, <em>A Real Bug’s Life</em> isn’t limited to specific remote habitats. Over the course of the series you’ll visit arid desert planes, tropical jungle, concrete jungle, a rural farm in the UK and even the humble backyard. But thanks to a series of innovations, we see these worlds from entirely new perspectives. “I think that the look and feel of this show, and this is not just me saying it, I don't think that there's anything else that looks like this or has ever looked like this” Nathan

<p>Anyone who likes to take and share a lot of photos will likely agree that AirDrop is a great feature, but its Apple-only status is limiting. Now, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-channels-now-let-owners-send-voice-messages-150016866.html">WhatsApp</a> could give it a run for its money across all devices.

<p>WhatsApp's new feature is currently under development (it hasn't even reached Beta testing yet), so while we don't know when it will be available, we do have a good idea of what it will look like. For starters, users will likely need to shake their device in order to activate a request and, of course, be in close proximity to the other person. The recipient then needs to open WhatsApp and also shake their device to see and accept the share

<p>In a very relatable moment, NASA struggled for three months to get the lid off its asteroid sample container, having sent it into deep(ish) space and back. Same, NASA, same: I’ve struggled with jars of pickles.</p>
<p>The space agency was finally able to get into the asteroid Bennu sample container last week and published a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/take-a-look-at-the-full-asteroid-bennu-sample-in-all-its-glory-161309568.html">high-resolution image </a>of its Touch-and-Go-Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM) on Friday, revealing a delightful array of dust and rocks, scraped off Bennu by spacecraft OSIRIS-REx.</p>
<p>The TAGSAM lives in a special glove compartment to prevent the sample from being contaminated, and only certain tools are approved for use with it. The team eventually had to develop new tools to open the fasteners. Tapping it on the side of the kitchen counter did not work.</p>
