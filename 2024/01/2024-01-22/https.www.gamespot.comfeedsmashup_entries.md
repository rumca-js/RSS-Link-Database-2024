<p>Halo Season 2 will have a darker story with better dialogue. In an interview with SFX magazine, with an extract republished in <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/halo-season-2-pablo-schrieber-reset/">GamesRadar</a>, actor Pablo Schreiber said the upcoming season will have more intense action sequences. Moreover, Master Chief John-117's writing is seemingly getting stronger.</p><p>"I think [David Wiener, Halo's new showrunner] is just a more gifted writer, to be quite frank," Schreiber told SFX. "I think his dialogue is better. He puts words in the mouth that feel more appropriate for the character."</p><p>The actor emphasizes that Halo Season 2 is stronger than the first. The new art director, James Foster, plays a part in this, creating "a visual world that just makes a lot more sense," with a focus on a cinematic feeling. "It's just a better season, period," Schreiber added.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-season-2-is-set-to-tell-a-darker-story-with-b

<p>It's official, RoboCop: Rogue City will allow you to clean the streets of Old Detroit--again--as it's receiving a New Game Plus mode. Developer Teyon detailed the fan-requested addition, as well as a new difficulty mode, and several other tweaks being introduced to the game this week.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1681430/view/3972804940372291728?l=english">On its Steam blog</a>, Teyon added that players will be able to relive the full "invincible robotic law enforcement officer" experience once RoboCop: Rogue City has been updated. When the original game launched last year, one of the criticisms for an otherwise fun RoboCop game was that it was easy to miss out on optional one-time-only quests and Auto-9 upgrades, and the game was also stingy with how many points players could earn to help upgrade OCP's high-tech cop.</p><p>Teyon says that once the patch has been installed, a new save file will be created for players who have completed the game an

<p dir="ltr">I'll admit upfront: I missed Another Code (known in North America as Trace Memory) when it first came out on Nintendo DS. Despite voraciously consuming other DS adventure games like Phoenix Wright, Ghost Trick, 999, and original Another Code developer Cing's other title, Hotel Dusk, Another Code just slipped by me. And with the sequel, Another Code R, being a European Wii exclusive, catching up there wasn't easy to do. So when Nintendo announced remakes of the two Another Code games for Switch, I was eager to correct those wrongs and see what the now-sadly-defunct Cing had put together. To my surprise, Recollection is fundamentally different from the originals in a number of ways--all-new visuals and updated puzzles, for example--and these quality of life improvements helped me appreciate the original game's supernatural mysteries.</p><p dir="ltr">Another Code Recollection puts you in the role of Ashley, a young girl who tragically lost her mother at a very young

<p dir="ltr">Initially known as Pokemon with guns, Palworld has set the gaming world on fire by selling millions of copies in a matter of days and fueling internet discourse with AI art accusations. It's even led to Arkane Lyon studio director Dinga Bakaba creating a fascinating thread <a href="https://twitter.com/DBakaba/status/1749122283346473182">on X (formerly known as Twitter)</a> about the survival game, touching on its mechanics and lightning-rod aspects.</p><p dir="ltr">Bakaba, who was game director on Deathloop, notes upfront that Palworld isn't actually a Pokemon-like and feels more mechanically inspired by Rust and Ark: Survival Evolved. He adds, though, that the title does obviously have similarities to Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Fortnite, and more.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Yeah, I'm surprised by how quickly this is escalating.

<p>Japan has become only the fifth country in the history of the world to land on the Moon, but it wasn't all good news, as the lander might have run out of power.</p><p>The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) <a href="https://global.jaxa.jp/press/2024/01/20240120-1_e.html">announced</a> that its Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) successfully touched down on the moon's surface on January 20. The space agency was able to establish communication with the craft when it landed. However, JAXA said the solar cells on the craft are "not generating power."</p><p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/SLIM_JAXA/status/1749320373731205365">another statement</a>, JAXA said the SLIM's battery only had 12% remaining when it touched down. It was disconnected to avoid being unable to restart as the space agency hopes for favorable sunlight conditions to power it up. SLIM's solar cells are facing west, which gives the craft a chance of catching some rays.</p><a href="https://www.game

<p>People are once again discussing director Christopher Nolan's attitude about bathroom breaks during filming.
