We actually go over 9 algorithms, what they are, how they work, real-world use cases, complete with code examples and explanations, but they fall under 3 categories, 3 types of algorithms you should know. \n\nSorting Algorithms - used to rearrange elements in a list or an array in a certain order. We discuss bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort.\n\nSearching Algorithms - used to find or retrieve an element from a data structure, or to determine its existence and location in the dataset. We discuss linear search and binary search.\n\nGraph Algorithms - used to solve problems related to graph theory, where data is represented as a collection of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges. You probably know these as trees. We discuss depth-first search (dfs), breadth-first search (bfs), Dijkstra's algorithm, and A* algorithm.\n\nSo, why are these algorithms you should you know?
