<p>The first starry awards event of the year is expected to be dominated by Barbenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon and the final season of Succession</p><p>One can only imagine what Elspeth, the frightfully posh character that Rosamund Pike plays in Saltburn, would make of this fashion-forward ensemble. While she took to the Globes red carpet last year in head-to-toe black, this year’s iteration is altogether more dramatic, more operatic and just a little bit gothic, too. What’s not to like?</p><p>Hi, Ellie from the Guardian’s fashion desk here. I hope that, wherever you are, you feel ready for some serious Hollywood pomp. Given this Golden Globes is the first major red carpet event since the end of the actors’ strike, it feels safe to say that we can expect lots of drama on the red carpet tonight. Hollywood won’t be able to look at itself in the mirror tomorrow if it wastes a perfectly good opportunity, after so long in hibernation, to ignite some fireworks, sartorially speaking.

He is known for his misogynistic rants and espousals of male superiority (“Female self-defence is a joke.

<p>From mundane beginnings this became one of the weekend’s better Cup ties, although David Moyes will not see it that way. He had picked his strongest available side, giving the competition and Bristol City the respect they deserved, and when Jarrod Bowen scored early on he seemed likely to be rewarded by a serene afternoon. Little went right from there, though, and West Ham may count a heavy cost. Lucas Paquetá and Konstantinos Mavropanos left the scene with first-half injuries and, perhaps most worryingly of all, Bowen pulled up at the full-time whistle and needed helping away. By then, in a second period largely dominated by the Championship team, Tommy Conway’s well taken equaliser had ensured hostilities will be resumed at Ashton Gate later this month. It was the least City, 11th in the Championship, merited from a performance that grew markedly in bravery and confidence.</p><p>It took just over four minutes for Moyes’ commitment to bear some fruit. This had, to everyone’s cred

Heading the case, and fielding a team of 112 sharp-suited forensic accountants, is the Independent Commission Against Corruption investigator Lau Kai-yuen (Lau). Loosel

<p>Understanding the hard science of coffee can help elevate even the cheapest bean and most basic equipment into something far greater than the sum of its parts</p><p>A good espresso coffee is sexy as hell. It flows out of the machine at a languid pace, initially dark and brooding before shifting into a golden foam that would bat its eyelashes at you if it had them. Once settled in the glass, it breathes out and releases an intoxicating scent that is earthy and sweet, capturing everything from the aromas of freshly sawn timber and rich dark chocolate to delicate floral and fruity cherry scents.</p><p>Making the perfect espresso is almost a high art, especially for those who practice at the elite level – and Australia has plenty of those. Ranked <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4615/coffee-market-in-australia/#topicOverview">one of the biggest coffee markets in the world</a>, the Australian coffee market is worth more than $9bn and Australia coffee fiends sip and savour aroun

<p>An author gripped by writer’s block is at the mercy of a malfunctioning robot in this smart low-budget feature</p><p>The latest addition to the malevolent, malfunctioning AI genre (see also <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/15/m3gan-review-top-of-the-range-murderous-teen-robot">M3gan</a></em>), this British sci-fi follows novelist Claire (Rachel Shelley) as she tackles her writer’s block by spending a month in a hi-tech creative retreat. Her every need is catered for by Rita (Heida Reed, bringing a creepily effective physicality to the role), a glassy-eyed android helper. A technical glitch rewrites Rita’s programming and the robot helper becomes Claire’s prison warder and her sternest critic. Rita, as she repeatedly informs us, is equipped to deal with “all kinds of medical emergencies”. You can bet that’s a skill that will come in handy before the end of this smart little thriller.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/07/blank-review-eye-po

<p>James Hawes’s workmanlike biopic of Nicholas Winton, who saved 669 children from the Nazis, is lifted by a stellar cast</p><p>In the late 1930s, shortly before the outbreak of the second world war, a young British stockbroker named <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/07/how-nicholas-winton-saved-669-children-and-counting-from-the-holocaust-he-became-everybodys-grandfather">Nicholas Winton </a>– played here by Johnny Flynn, and in later life by Anthony Hopkins – visited Czechoslovakia, to see with his own eyes the humanitarian crisis and rising panic among the exiled Jewish community in the country.

In particular, it recreates, through intimate personal histories and eyewitness recollection, the ways in which one idealistic, grassroots protest – the staging of a summer party in a field near the Austrian border – became a catalyst for the dramatic peaceful revolutions that reunited the continent.</p><p>The idea for that summer gathering was first imagined by a young Hungarian radical, Ferenc Mészáros, at a meeting organised by a European figure fro

<p>Reassess your makeup bag and make a beautiful start to the new year</p><p>The rhetoric around new year, new you is a tired, unimaginative marketing ploy. While I’m aware that every week I recommend new (and pre-existing) beauty products, the point is not for you to go out and buy them all. The point is to arm you with information so you can make informed choices. Change for the sake of change is unnecessary; just because we have ushered in the new year doesn’t mean everything needs to be totally new. And that goes for your beauty products. If it’s working, carry on. That said, how often do you really evaluate your products? Is the lip colour and texture you’ve long adored still flattering? Does your foundation still do the job? Does it look like skin or does it look like “makeup”? And is it the right shade for winter? Your moisturiser/serum, does it still deliver? I always remind people that skin is not static, it changes and so we need to adapt. And what about your scent? Does th
