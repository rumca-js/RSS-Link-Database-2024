Its plot is largely derivative, and its central protagonist was \u2013 in the beginning at least \u2013 somewhat insufferable. However, as the game rolled on and as superpowers unlocked the game\u2019s micro version of Seattle became an amazing playground. \n\nMake no mistake, inFAMOUS Second Son was fun to play, upheld by fantastic traversal and excitingly vibrant superpowers. There are quite lofty themes centering mostly on the oppression of the game\u2019s superheroes \u2013 or Conduits as they\u2019re known in-game. This video discusses the longevity of these themes alongside the game\u2019s morality mechanic, and other benchmarks of whether a game has held up such as its graphics.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oimIYRVBiKo", "date_published": "2024-01-07T15:30:10+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/oimIYRVBiKo/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Why Tekken 8 Will Be One of the Biggest Games of 2024", "description": "With the King of the Iron Fist Tournament once again open the stage is set for Tekken 8 and given the overwhelmingly positive superlatives levied upon Bandai Namco\u2019s latest by anyone who\u2019s had a go it looks like Tekken 8 will take the early crown for fighting game of the year. \n\nFurthermore, with fighting games having been on a good run in 2023 thanks to Street Fighter 6 and Mortal Kombat 1, Tekken 8 has a lot to live up to. It looks though to be delivering by the bucketload \u2013 cinematic presentation, gloriously epic battles, stronger storytelling (compared to previous iterations), and some of the best graphics I have seen so far in any game ever, Tekken 8 is going to raise the bar for a fighting series already chock full of excellent entries.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zd0Tq5jmX0", "date_published": "2024-01-07T09:30:02+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/2zd0Tq5jmX0/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
