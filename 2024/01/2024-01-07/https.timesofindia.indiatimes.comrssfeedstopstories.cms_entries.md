The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) recommends limiting the use of antibiotics for preventing surgical site infections to a single dose or one day before the procedure. After the surgery, antibiotics should only be given if there is an infection. However, a recent survey led by NCDC revealed that most in-patients receive antibiotics for multiple days to prevent infections. This prolonged administration is not effective and increases antimicrobial resistance, as stated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). ICMR advisory suggests that perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is effective for only 12 hours or less.
