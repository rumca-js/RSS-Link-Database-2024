With just a couple of clicks of the mouse, you can now magically add VR support to potentially thousands of flat Unreal Engine games and it's all thanks to God-like VR modder Praydog's UEVR mod.</p><p>Praydog's Unreal Engine VR Injector Mod (UEVR) has been in the works for at least a year now and, in the Flatscreen to VR Modding Community at least, the buzz for it has been palpable since it was first announced. But does it actually live up to the hype?</p><p>Well, that's where this week's episode of Ian's VR Corner comes in! Check out the video below for an introduction to the mod which includes some short examples of how easy it is to convert flat UE4/5 games to full 6DoF VR and six exa

The new Job coming to Final Fantasy 14 in next expansion Dawntrail has now been revealed: the Pictomancer.
</p><p>
The announcement was made at the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Festival in Tokyo this weekend, along with new details about Dawntrail.
</p><p>
Unfortunately there's still no release date for the expansion beyond 'summer 2024'. Director and producer Naoki Yoshida stated there's an internal target date, but it's not public yet due to previous expansion Endwalker being delayed before its release. "We don't want that to happen again, even if it's just a few weeks," he said.

That's right - I, Percy, the human-paladin-slash-moral-abomination, was naked on a plinth with Nightwarden Minthara, celebrating a victory over the defenders of the druid grove.
