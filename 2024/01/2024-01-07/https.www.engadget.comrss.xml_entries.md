<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/kia/">Kia</a> is returning to CES for the first time in five years and the company is set to take center stage for a spell by hosting a press conference. You'll be able to watch all the Kia CES announcements on January 8 at 6PM ET by <a href="https://worldwide.kia.com/">visiting its website</a>.</p>
<h2>What to expect</h2>
<p>The company says it will offer interested parties a closer peek at several of its concept models including the EV3 and EV4, as well as the EV9 and EV6 GT. Kia is also promising a look at its first so-called &quot;platform beyond vehicle&quot; (PBV) that's scheduled for mass production in 2025.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Kia describes PBV as a mobility solution that blends &quot;fit-for-purpose EVs with advanced software solutions that will open the door to new businesses and lifestyles.&quot; To that end, the automaker will talk through some PBV tech, &quot;its software-defined vehicle strategy&quot; and

<p>The theremin isn’t an instrument known for being easy to learn or budget-friendly, but it <em>is</em> cool as hell — and a new synth from Dubreq could be a good starting point for anyone wanting to dip their toes into the theremin experience. The Stylophone Theremin is the latest addition to Dubreq’s family of synths, and much like the classic contactless instrument, it has an antenna that responds to movement to create experimental sounds. It’ll cost about $110 when it becomes available, and the company has started taking signups for pre-orders on its <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://stylophone.com/theremin-pre-order/"><ins>website</ins></a>.</p>

<p>The Stylophone Theremin isn’t a straight-up theremin but a synth that uses an element of the design. It has a single antenna to control pitch only, rather than the usual two (one for pitch and one for volume).

<p>Some iPhone owners who filed claims in Apple’s $500 million class action settlement over battery throttling have reportedly started to receive their cuts of the payout. In 2020, Apple agreed to settle a 2017 lawsuit that accused the company of intentionally reducing older iPhones’ performance without properly disclosing to consumers that it was doing so. At the time of the settlement, it was estimated that iPhone owners would get <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-throttling-settlement-payment-192727598.html"><ins>payments of around $25 per claim</ins></a>.
