I live in Ohio in one of the bluest counties in the entire Midwest. I have never been governed by a Republican at any level lower than statewide office. The last Republican congressman to represent my district left office in 1982, and the Last Republican mayor of Toledo left office in 1989, a few weeks before I was born.
