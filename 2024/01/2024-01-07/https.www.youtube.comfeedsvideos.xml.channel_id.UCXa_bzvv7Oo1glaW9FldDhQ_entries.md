inFAMOUS Second Son didn’t reinvent the wheel. Its plot is largely derivative, and its central protagonist was – in the beginning at least – somewhat insufferable. However, as the game rolled on and as superpowers unlocked the game’s micro version of Seattle became an amazing playground. 

Make no mistake, inFAMOUS Second Son was fun to play, upheld by fantastic traversal and excitingly vibrant superpowers. There are quite lofty themes centering mostly on the oppression of the game’s superheroes – or Conduits as they’re known in-game. This video discusses the longevity of these themes alongside the game’s morality mechanic, and other benchmarks of whether a game has held up such as its graphics.

## Why Tekken 8 Will Be One of the Biggest Games of 2024

With the King of the Iron Fist Tournament once again open the stage is set for Tekken 8 and given the overwhelmingly positive superlatives levied upon Bandai Namco’s latest by anyone who’s had a go it looks like Tekken 8 will take the early crown for fighting game of the year. 

Furthermore, with fighting games having been on a good run in 2023 thanks to Street Fighter 6 and Mortal Kombat 1, Tekken 8 has a lot to live up to. It looks though to be delivering by the bucketload – cinematic presentation, gloriously epic battles, stronger storytelling (compared to previous iterations), and some of the best graphics I have seen so far in any game ever, Tekken 8 is going to raise the bar for a fighting series already chock full of excellent entries.
