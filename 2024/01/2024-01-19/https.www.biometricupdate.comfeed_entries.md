		<strong><a href="https://eucyberact.org/">International Conference on the EU Cyber Security and Resilience Acts</a></strong>
<strong>Brussels, Belgium</strong>
<strong>March 11-13, 2024</strong>

In the past seven years, the European Union has made landmark efforts to bolster defenses against cyber-attacks and improve product security. The EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA), under development since 2018, is creating an extensive independent European body of cybersecurity regulation as part of the “single digital market” goal. The more recent Cyber Security Resilience Act (CRA) targets a broad swath of consumer products including IoT, cloud, communications, payments, automotive, and more. Product developers will be required to protect their systems and networks from cyber threats,

		Biometrics developer and electronics giant <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/nec">NEC</a> has presented a new facial recognition product that can take vital signs from individuals just by scanning their faces.

The product, which received the CES 2024 Innovation Award in Artificial Intelligence, estimates pulse rate, oxygen level and respiratory rate from the face within just 10 seconds. It then shows the results on the display equipped with a camera. The product was introduced at CES in Las Vegas, Nevada by NEC Fellow Hitoshi Imaoka, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/video/watch/idRW135510012024RP1/">reports</a>.

		Proving that it is not always good to be right, public and private video surveillance is gaining critical mass in U.S. cities and towns, just as privacy advocates have warned.

Sensors over highways, on food delivery <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202201/telpo-brings-computer-vision-to-robot-waiters-amid-labor-market-turbulence">robots</a> and police vests, hanging from public buildings and convenience store awnings, and attached to porches and doorbells are feeding faces and sounds to the cloud, where law enforcement strains it through biometric recognition software for coordinated action.

Skeptical observers for several years have warned that if biometric surveillance evolves unchecked, life in even modestly populated areas everywhere in the Un

		Nigeria’s mandate for SIM cards to be registered to national digital IDs was intended to erect a major barrier against an epidemic of kidnappings plaguing the country. It has not worked yet.

The problem, according to Former Communication and Digital Economy Minister Isa Pantami, is not with the policy, but with its implementation and enforcement. Pantami described his frustration with an incident in which six sisters were kidnapped in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, in a series of social media messages reported by <a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/659091-why-kidnappings-occur-despite-sim-nin-linkage-policy-ex-minister.html">Premium Times</a>.

		With general elections set to begin in April, India continues to crack down on deepfakes – by threatening the platforms used to share them. Deputy IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has warned tech companies that the government is ready to impose bans if they don't put measures in place to detect and remove deepfakes, according to <a href="https://theprint.in/economy/deepfake-issue-mixed-response-on-advisory-govt-to-notify-tighter-it-rules-in-a-weeks-time/1926587/">The Print</a>. He says the ministry plans to amend IT regulations to establish rules requiring platforms to effectively fight against deepfakes.

"If a platform thinks that they can get away without taking down deepfake videos, or merely maintain a casual approach to it, we have the power to protect

		The rollout of the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) is running late due to delays from both EU agencies and European countries, according to reports analyzed by the non-profit organization Statewatch.

Statewatch analyzed <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/media/4148/eu-etias-frontex-prep-report-14648-23.pdf">two</a> reports published by Europol and Frontex in October covering developments from April to September 2023. Both agencies blame the delays on eu-LISA, the EU agency tasked with operating large-scale IT systems related to border management such as the Entry/Exit System (EES), ETIAS, VIS and SIS.

		The European Union is introducing a loophole in the upcoming Artificial Intelligence Act that allows law enforcement agencies to use retrospective facial recognition technology without court approval, according to European Member of Parliament Svenja Hahn.

The German lawmaker, who is a member of the liberal Renew group, said that the changes were not in the original agreement on the AI Act <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/eus-provisional-ai-act-deal-limits-remote-biometrics-use-after-marathon-negotiation">finalized</a> in early December.
