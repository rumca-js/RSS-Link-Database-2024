Sony has revealed the next batch of titles bidding a fond farewell to its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscription tiers in February, which this time include the likes of Resident Evil 7, Tekken 7, and Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown.
</p><p>
Thankfully, that's where the curse of the video game sevens ends, with no sign of the number across the remaining seven PlayStation 4 titles currently listed under the 'Last chance to play' section of the PlayStation dashboard. <em>Oh</em>.
</p><p>
Alongside the zombie, fight-y, plane-y departures mentioned in the opening paragraph, Sony has revealed Playstation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers will soon be losing access to sci-fi narrative adventure Tacoma, colour-based platform-puzzler Hue, ageing indie darling Thomas Was Alone, and Lost Words: Beyond the

Eye-catching 'Pok&eacute;mon with guns' survival game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-type-chart-strengths-weaknesses-every-element-9409">Palworld</a> has already sold a staggering 1m copies according to its developer Pocketpair, just hours into its early access launch on Steam and Xbox Series X/S. That's as the studio addresses the lack of 32-player dedicated servers on Xbox and PC Game Pass, saying the situation is "not up to us".
</p><p>
Palworld's whole <em>thing</em>, if you're unfamiliar, is that it combines Pok&eacute;mon-style creature catching with open-world survival and crafting, giving players the option to exploit (or eat) their Pals in the name of completing tasks more efficiently if they so choose.
</p><p>
It's a proposition that's evidently resonated with  players in a big way; Pocketpair has <a

As The Elder Scrolls Online thunders toward its 10th anniversary this April, Zenimax Online Studios has whipped back the sheet to reveal the fantasy MMO's latest expansion chapter, Gold Road, which launches for PC and Mac on 3rd June with a PlayStation and Xbox release to follow a few weeks' later on 18th June.
</p><p>
Gold Road gives players the opportunity to explore the bountiful region of West Weald (split into temperate, woodland, and highland zones) as well as the city of Skingrad, first seen in the The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Unfortunately, the region has now been "beset by Daedric incursions and the encroaching jungles of Valenwood", meaning there's heroing to be done.
</p><p>
As players journey across West Weald, they'll encounter new quests, challenges, rewards, and stories, with Gold Ro

Palword, the upcoming open world survival and crafting game which the internet has dubbed 'Pok&eacute;mon with guns', is already seeing some  impressive player numbers on Steam - to the detriment of its servers.
</p><p>
At the time of writing, a bumper 352,361 potential Pal catchers are making their way through the game's colourful, eclectic and perhaps slightly dubious world. (I recently learned you can catch and sell humans.)

The original Destiny arrived 10 years ago this year - and finally, Bungie will let players modify their character's face. 
</p><p>
To be clear, if you have been playing as the same character since Destiny 1, this will be the first time in a decade that you will have been able to update your Guardian's basic appearance. 
</p><p>
The ability to do so has been a long, long-requested thing from fans. Now, Bungie has said the option will be implemented this year, ahead of its climactic (and delayed) expansion The Final Shape.

Sony is issuing refunds to those who purchased The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered full price by accident, if they have it on PS4 already. 
</p><p>
Players who got swept up in the moment and accidently purchased the full price game ahead of time, rather than going along the &pound;10 upgrade path, will be met with a nice message of goodwill from Sony, stating they are being refunded. 
</p><p>
"As an owner of the PS4 digital version of The Last of Us Part 2, a digital upgrade to the PS5 digital version will be available at a deeply discounted price on launch day," this message reads.

## Square Enix must diversify its gaming output, company president says

Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu believes the company needs to diversify its gaming output, but also focus on fewer releases.
</p><p>
Kiryu's comments are from an investor <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/24q2outline.pdf">Q&amp;A</a> from November just recently published in English, in which he addressed multiple questions - in particular regarding the company's medium-term business plan and what Kiryu described as "the limited diversity of our title portfolio".
</p><p>
"Because we possess strong IPs like the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy franchises, I believe that we have tended to be overly reliant on certain gameplay styles or genres," he said. "Meanwhile, the tastes of customers in the gaming market have diversified, and customers have come to enjoy content from a variety o

## Halo TV show star says Master Chief's romantic relationship was a "huge mistake"

Pablo Schreiber, the face (quite literally) behind Master Chief's helmet in Paramount's Halo adaptation, thinks it was a "huge mistake" to introduce a romantic relationship for the Spartan warrior. In fact, he pushed back against it. 
</p><p>
As a reminder, in the first season of Halo, Schreiber's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cortana-just-watched-master-chief-have-sex">John-117 has sex with human-turned-Covenant agent Makee</a>, as Cortana watches on. They were Cortana in the act, if you will. 
</p><p>
While the intercorse itself wasn't actually shown, with the two lovers merely seen touching scars and so on before waking up in bed together, it is very heavily implied. Many felt this was a mistake for the series, along with Master Chief showing both his face and his naked derriere.

Eight percent of respondees to GDC's newly-published 2024 State of the Game Industry report say they are developing their current project for Nintendo Switch 2. Out of 3000 people polled, that accounts for 240 responses.

Nintendo recently issued a blanket denial to address various reports that have mapped out the company's ongoing march towards launching the inevitable Switch successor.

35 percent of game developers have been impacted by layoffs in last 12 months and half are concerned more job cuts are on the way. That's according to GDC's newly published 2024 State of the Game Industry report, which highlights current sentiment among developers based on a snapshot of 3,000 industry professionals polled.

According to the report, while 54 percent of developers canvassed said there had been no layoffs at their company over the last year, 35 percent said either they or their colleagues had lost their jobs. Quality assurance positions are said to have been hit the hardest, with 22 percent of QA workers saying they'd been laid off compared to seven percent of all developers.
