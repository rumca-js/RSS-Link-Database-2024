<p>On the 51st anniversary of Roe v Wade, a sparse crowd of activists brave snow on March for Life in Washington DC</p><p>While Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are planning a cascade of ads and events to coincide with the 51st anniversary of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roe-v-wade">Roe v Wade</a>, hundreds of anti-abortion activists gathered on the National Mall in Washington DC on Friday in hopes of re-energizing a movement that has repeatedly stumbled since Roe’s overturning.</p><p>Originally organized around the goal of overturning the Roe precedent that established federal abortion rights, the March for Life has seen what was once its greatest victory become a political liability. In the 18 months since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/dec/15/neil-gorsuch-us-supreme-court-dobbs-abortion">Roe’s demise</a>, abortion rights supporters have trounced anti-abortion activists in state-level ballot referendums.

<p>From 50/50 splits to prioritising fairness over equality, readers share how the division of domestic labour works in their households – and when it doesn’t</p><p>Ideas about who should do what to keep a home clean and functional differ across generations and cultures. As people grapple with the blurring lines between home, work and housework, many Guardian Australia readers told us they found themselves slipping into traditional gender roles – especially when children come into the equation. While reverting to old norms has worked for some, for more readers – particularly women – an unfair share of housework is a source of resentment.</p><p>But negotiating systems that feel fair to all is possible. No matter the specifics – cards, lists, schedules or cocktails – most readers suggested that adapting (and re-adapting) as circumstances change was necessary to get the best results, and many reported periods of unrest before finding household harmony.</p><p><strong><a href="htt

While for mysterious romance Love Me, the involvement of the Oscar nominees Kristen Stewart and Steven Yeun was enough by itself to vault the film to the top of many wish-lists, its logline was less of a sure thing. A post-apocalyptic love story between a buoy and a satellite was something that people would have to see to understand and so there was an unusual sense of curious excitement in the air at its packed out premiere, no one quite sure what was about to be experienced.</p><p>But while the curiosity might have sustained itself for the most part, the excitement slowly faded, the film an alluring but ultimately failed experiment.

Or, to bill it another way, and how everybody is doing: Ivan Toney’s comeback from an eight-month ban for betting offences. Is the Brentford striker fuelled by a sense of injustice?</p><p>Surprisingly, it did not get a great answer because Frank is usually the man for a great answer; always ready to engage, to think deeply, to respond with extra layers. At one point, when he was asked about the potential for Toney to get stick from opposition fans, he brought up David Beckham post-1998 World Cup. “I hope that won’t happen but I know there will be some banter and probably more than banter and stick,” Frank said.</p> <a href="https://www.thegua

Journalist who started out on the Nottingham Evening Post and went on to become the sports editor of the Observer<p>Ronald Atkin, a former sports editor of the Observer, was a journalist of impeccably high standards, whether looking after other writers’ copy or fashioning his own, usually on top-level tennis or football matches. But as a representative of an old Fleet Street newspaper community that did not take itself too seriously, he also had an ability to laugh at the foibles of his profession.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.sportsjournalists.co.uk/view-from-the-pressbox/whats-in-a-name-everything-when-its-your-byline/" title="">amusing piece written</a> in 2012 for the website of the Sports Journalists’ Association, which had voted him their journalist of the year almost 30 years earlier, he listed some of the many ways in which his byline had been mangled over the years.

Their creators, however, hope this will be the next huge breakthrough in sustainable footwear: the world’s first 3D printed, made-to-measure, compostable shoe, which can be broken down at the end of its life, in an attempt to stem the flow of millions of shoes into landfill each year.</p><p>Fashion is among the world’s top polluting industries.

<p>From odd set pieces in the crystal dome to the X Factor’s voiceover man providing narration, television is increasingly trying to wring content from air fryers. But why?</p><p>For some reason, TV is becoming obsessed with air fryers.

Channel 4 has also got in on the act, with Air Fryers: Are They Worth It? But why? There can’t be <em>that </em>much content about air fryers, right? Do these shows actually tell us anything about air fryers that we don’t already know?

<p>Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell’s hot, angry chemistry proved that the good old-fashioned Hollywood romcom still has staying power</p><p>Although Wonka is the undisputed king of the box office this winter, having earned £56.1m since its release in mid-December, it’s Anyone But You, a frothy romcom that recalls the genre’s 2000s heyday, that’s most surprised the film industry in recent weeks. Released last month, the Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell-starring film opened to meagre box office results in the US – $6m (£4.7m) during its first weekend – and a fairly average £1.2m in the UK.</p><p>Since then, the film has shown surprisingly strong staying power, thanks largely to positive word of mouth, as well as the lack of winter films for female audiences. In its first three weeks at the UK box office, the film has continued to gross in the ballpark of its £1.2m debut, a relatively uncommon box office phenomenon. In the US, it’s shown even stronger performance, making nearly $10

<p>Can MachineGames’s new first-person adventure Indiana Jones and the Great Circle live up to the third-person thrills of Indy-influenced hits Uncharted and Tomb Raider?</p><p>History is not exactly littered with glittering Indiana Jones video games. The beautiful LucasArts adventure, The Fate of Atlantis; the pretty good Lego games; the decent Emporer’s Tomb; the presentable SNES side-scroller, Greatest Adventures … There have been <em>good</em> games, but few classics that transcend the brand like, say, Knights of the Old Republic. Maybe that’s about to change.</p><p>During Microsoft’s latest Developer Direct online event, streamed on Thursday evening, we saw <a href="https://youtu.be/Yp7_ImMV1Iw?si=DLN7eQ_aaeBl55MK">a 12-minute preview</a> of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a globe-trotting first-person adventure, set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Last Crusade.

As the 69-year-old Krapp listens to tape recordings of his younger self, he pauses and interjects. Rea’s eyes register minute flickers of emotion, his years of performing to camera adding a subtlety that seems effortless.</p> <a href="

<p>The poet’s kaleidoscopic essay collection asks ‘How do we make sense of what we see?’ – from photographs and sculptures to weather and human faces</p><p>“Exploded essays”, the poet, novelist and memoirist Lavinia Greenlaw calls the 17 pieces of almost-art-critical prose in this bright, mournful book. The phrase suggests a bristling diagram or enlarged view, an annotated arc of thought or feeling. But also something violently botched or ruined – don’t all essays worth the name aspire, more or less secretly, to blowing up their own form? In revisiting a lifetime of looking – at art, landscapes, weather, heavenly bodies, human faces and sometimes nothing at all – Greenlaw puts certain stark questions to herself and the things she looks at: “How do we make sense of what we see? How do we describe what we have never seen before?”</p><p>Her title comes from John Locke’s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, published in 1689.
