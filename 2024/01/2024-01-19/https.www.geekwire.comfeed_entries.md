Amazon, however, told GeekWire this week it does not expect impact on customers who get items delivered from Amazon Flex drivers that work as independent contractors and use their own vehicles. The law, originally passed in May 2022, sets a minimum wage and other benefits for gig workers who deliver meals, groceries and packages. It was the first of several unique “PayUp” gig worker protection laws approved recently in Seattle.

Rather than banning the use of AI and increasingly popular chatbots, the state Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) is urging thoughtful, human-centered use of the tools. &#8220;As this technology revolutionizes industries, communities, sciences, and workplaces, our responsibility is to prepare students and educators to use these tools in ways that are responsible, ethical, and safe,&#8221; said Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal in an intro to the new guide.  The document provides&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/washington-issues-tech-roadmap-for-educators-ai-

Booker&#8217;s Seattle-based startup, EdXeno, is working to fill that gap. EdXeno is developing a mobile app to provide free college advising and resources to students, and give universities a recruiting platform by communicating directly with interested students. It&#8217;s currently concept-testing and building partnerships with universities, and working on&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/founded-by-a-former-high-school-counselor-edxeno-aims-to-connect-students-with-thei

Through an avatar named Ellen, the QuitBot app can engage in conversations with users, sharing science-based information to support smokers trying to resist the urge to light up. Researchers at Seattle-based Fred Hutch spent six years developing and testing the app. They said the QuitBot solution differs from other tools because it provides personalized coaching whenever a user needs it. The app includes 32 short conversations that span a two-week phase leading&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/fred-hutch-researchers-release-free-app-to-help-smokers-quit-with-help-from-a-chatbot-named-e
