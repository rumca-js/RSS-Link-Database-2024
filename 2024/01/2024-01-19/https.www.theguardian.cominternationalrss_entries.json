I suddenly felt small before this extraordinary woman,\u201d said Kaz\u00e9, 51, a leader of the local peasant farmers movement \u2013 and not someone prone to being awestruck.</p><p>Hern\u00e1ndez, a professional clown who in December 2019 began a solo bicycle journey across Brazil in the direction of her native Venezuela had a way of enchanting everyone she met. And throughout her epic ride, the 38-year-old developed a large network of fellow artists and bicycle travellers, who followed her progress closely.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/19/julieta-hernandez-martinez", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/19/julieta-hernandez-martinez-killed-migrant-clown-cyclist-brazil-venezuela", "date_published": "2024-01-19T11:15:27+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe785b5ef2a33523f5902179dc11a11db436b958/0_387_4445_2668/master/4445.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=379860dfa39853a0c62b5eb82f10cd91", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war live: Putin victory \u2018would not end well for Europe\u2019, Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister says", "description": "<p>Speaking in Davos, Gabrielius Landsbergis says \u2018there\u2019s a chance that Russia might not be contained in Ukraine\u2019</p><p>Police in the central Russian republic of Bashkortostan on Friday arrested more protesters incensed over the jailing of a popular activist as a court sentenced nine demonstrators to short jail terms, reports AFP.</p><p>Thousands have taken to the streets of the small town of Baymak in freezing temperatures this week, clashing with riot police in a rare display of public outrage.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-victory-would-not-end-well-for-europe-lithuanias-foreign-minister-says\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jan/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-victory-would-not-end-well-for-europe-lithuanias-foreign-minister-says", "date_published": "2024-01-19T10:38:31+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b14065433072468e15caf713ec762f0ce2006b80/0_0_3811_2286/master/3811.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=43243e1fad1b3cb07ed767ba2ef3b5ff", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Jerry Krause deserved better than boos at the Bulls he helped soar", "description": "<p>The late general manager\u2019s widow was left in tears by Chicago fans.
