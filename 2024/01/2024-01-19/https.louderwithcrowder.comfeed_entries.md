We all know how Bud Light often suffers from its demise. And the problem with being woke is that you often go broke. One reason for this is that you can never be woke enough. The pendulum is always swinging further and further to the left. </p><p>When you have a woke company that tries to push leftist ideology onto the masses, don’t come crying to the other side when inevitably cast your downfall. </p><p>Thousands of workers at Anheuser-Busch’s breweries are threatening to strike and are saying "there won’t be any beer come March” if there is not an agreement on contract negotiations. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

Specifically, in Germany. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

And in this story, the Feds are obviously not the good guys. </p><p>Federal law enforcement agencies worked with some banks to flag purchases if you bought religious texts, like Bibles because they thought it would help in "preventing extremism." </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

That's fine and not unexpected. Most Democrats (or "independents" who vote party line D) will do the same. Unlike most Democrats, Charlamagne is intellectually honest about the party's problems. I share these posts because those problems create opportunities for the Right if we're ever smart enough to take them.</p><p>"The Breakfast Club" host has already said Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/charlamagne-tha-god-desantis-abbott" target="_blank">plan to ship illegals to sanctuary cities was genius from a political standpoint</a>.

But his response to Argentine President Javier Milei speech might be his all-time best yet. And this is a guy who once clapped back at <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-tweet-ron-wyden" target="_blank">a US Senator saying his photo looks like he just ejaculated</a>.</p><p>Some of you may be saying, "But Brodigan, Javier Milei in Davos? <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/argentinians-new-president" target="_blank">I thought he was based</a>, and WEF was like CPAC but for globalist cucks?"</p><p>Milei was even complimentary of the people in attendance, calling them "heroes." But he did so for the same reason liberal Republicans are complementary to Donald Trump
