But the company had a surprise for us this year: new CPUs for the AM4 socket, still seemingly going strong after an incredible seven years of active support. AMD&rsquo;s Donny Woligroski, Technical Processing Marketing Manager for Desktop and Laptop Consumer Processors, took some time to talk to PCWorld&rsquo;s Adam Patrick Murray for our latest YouTube video. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On AM4 specifically, Woligroski said that the huge remaining installation base was a big part of the decision to continue supporting the platform with the new <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2193400/amds-ryzen-8000-brings-ai-to-the-desktop-with-an-am4-surprise.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ryzen 7 5700X3D and three other chip</a><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2193400/a", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2212653/amd-talks-am5-apus-and-am4-longevity.html", "date_published": "2024-01-19T20:26:25+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "CPU-Z now works with ARM64 CPUs on Windows", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>CPU-Z is one of those little programs that has become a staple of the computer nerd world, never making waves, but showing up everywhere from the lowliest forum posts to the most in-depth review benchmarks. That said, it&rsquo;s surprising that it hasn&rsquo;t supported ARM-based processors &mdash; while you could run the program on Windows on ARM hardware, it didn&rsquo;t work properly. A new stand-alone version fixes that, making its measuring powers available to Windows users on tablets and other efficient devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get this new ARM64 version of the program, head to the CPUID website (which I always think sounds like some web 2.0 dating site) and look for the new <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z-arm64.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2212430-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/fee", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2212430/cpu-z-now-works-with-arm64-cpus-on-windows.html", "date_published": "2024-01-19T15:29:46+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Save over $500 on this lightweight, RTX-loaded Asus gaming laptop", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to pick up a gaming laptop that&rsquo;s both powerful and lightweight, you&rsquo;re in luck, as we&rsquo;ve unearthed a fantastic deal for you today.

One example of this is the persistent intrusion of background noise, which can spoil the quality of recordings. Whether it&rsquo;s keyboard clatter in the background or the noise of traffic, the challenge of achieving clear and unadulterated audio recordings remains. The solution often lies in an aspect that is easily overlooked &mdash; the directional characteristic of the microphone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The polar pattern of a microphone, also known as the polar pattern, determines from which direction a microphone picks up sound and which it ignores. This technical subtlety can be the key to keeping unwanted noise out of your recordings and capturing only the sounds you want. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefi", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2204691/suitable-directional-characteristic-of-the-microphone-for-your-recording.html", "date_published": "2024-01-19T14:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "A lifetime subscription to Rosetta Stone is just $150 now", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>A great New Year goal could be to learn a new language, and we&rsquo;re making it easier than ever this year.
