<p>A hacking group linked to a Russian intelligence agency accessed the emails of several senior Microsoft executives and other employees, the company <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/01/microsoft-actions-following-attack-by-nation-state-actor-midnight-blizzard/">disclosed</a> Friday.</p>
<p>Microsoft said it detected the attack on January 12, and has determined that a hacking group known as Midnight Blizzard or Nobelium is responsible. That’s the same group behind the 2020 <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/solarwinds/">SolarWinds</a> cyberattack.

<p>Japan has become the fifth country to successfully land on the moon after confirming today that its SLIM lander survived its descent to the surface — but its mission is likely to be short lived. JAXA, the Japanese space agency, says the spacecraft is having problems with its solar cell and is unable to generate electricity. In its current state, the battery may only have enough juice to keep it running a few more hours.</p>
<p>Based on how the other instruments are functioning, JAXA said in a press conference this afternoon that it’s evident SLIM did make a soft landing. The spacecraft has been able to communicate with Earth and receive commands, but is operating on a low battery. It’s unclear what exactly the issue with the solar cell is beyond the fact that it’s not functioning.</p>

<p>Korg has already made several announcements ahead of NAMM 2024, and now the company’s back with a <a href="https://www.korg.com/us/products/synthesizers/opsix_mk2/"><ins>refresh of its popular Opsix FM synthesizer.</ins></a> The Opsix mk II still offers an approachable entryway into the world of FM synthesis, and it’s even based on the original’s “Altered FM” digital sound engine. However, this is anything but a minor refresh.</p>

<p>The big news is a massive boost in polyphony. The original had 32 voices, which is still plenty, but the mk II offers 64 voices of pure polyphonal goodness. This should allow for some truly complex and multi-layered sounds, or just a burst of cacophony as you try to press every key at once.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fef481967da14b60aa76e0b7c6cfb3de"></div>
<p>The six-operator FM engine is, more or less, unchanged, but it can be kitted out with all kinds of new “sound components” that can drastically change the signal.

## NVIDIA RTX 4070 Super review: A 1,440p powerhouse for $599

<p>No, NVIDIA's mid-range RTX 40-series GPUs aren't getting any cheaper, but at least the new RTX 4070 Super packs in a lot more performance for $599. We called the original RTX 4070 the &quot;1,440p gaming leader,&quot; and that still holds for the Super. It's so much faster, especially when it comes to ray tracing, that it edges close to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-review-3090-ti-power-for-799-140001316.html"><ins>$799 RTX 4070 Ti</ins></a> (due to be replaced by its own Super variant, as well). And together with the power of DLSS3 upscaling, the 4070 Super is a far more capable 4K gaming card.</p>
<p>So what makes the RTX 4070 Super so special? Raw power, basically. It features 7,168 CUDA cores, compared to 5,888 on the 4070 and 7,680 on the 4070 Ti. Its base clock speed is a bit higher than before (1.98GHz compared to the 4070's 1.92GHz), but it has the same 2.48GHz boost clock and 12GB of GDDR6X VRAM as the original.</p>

Its menu sent me into a rage spiral, but it did offer a fair number of hands-on controls.

This week, Cherlynn and Devindra are joined by Senior Writer Sam Rutherford to discuss Samsung’s latest Galaxy Unpacked event, where it debuted the Galaxy S24 smartphone line. They don’t look very different from last year, but they’re packing a load of AI smarts. Also, Cherlynn finally got to try out the Apple Vision Pro and tells us all about her spatial computing journey. While it was a mostly eye-opening experience, the headset also hurt Cherlynn’s head and forced her to confront one of nature’s most terrifying creatures: A butterfly.</p>

On January 16, Massive Monster and Devolver Digital released<em> Cult of the Lamb</em>’s much hyped “Sins of the Flesh” update for consoles and PC, bringing, among other things, a form of in-game sex to its cute-but-brutal world of anatomically incorrect animals and false prophets. It’s exactly what some fans have been asking for, and since its announcement, everyone, including Massive Monster, has been leaning into the fun of “the sex update” actually happening. But it turns out calling it the sex update was a major undersell.</p>

Activision’s warfare simulations (we can just call them first-person shooters, right?) have <em>mostly</em> done just that.
