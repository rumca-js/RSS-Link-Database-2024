<p>Dr. Ratio rivals Herta's arrogance and Ruan Mei's eccentricity. As a member of the Intelligensia Guild, he has a low tolerance for ignorance. Unlike the Genius Society, the Guild believes that the pursuit of knowledge should be free to anyone willing to learn and not just a select few. Dr. Ratio is a scholar and teacher at the Guild, known for his odd habit of wearing a plaster mask like the kind you'd see on a Greek statue or in a museum. (It's apparently to block out the idiots.)</p><p>Dr. Ratio is the first member of the Guild to appear as a playable character in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/honkai-star-rail/">Honkai: Star Rail</a>. He's also the first limited-time 5-star character that HoYoverse has offered to its players. Here's a quick rundown of Dr. Ratio's abilities and his best Light Cones, Relics, and team comps.</p><div></div><p dir="ltr">Dr. Ratio specializes in two things that set him apart from other DPS characters: increased damage against debuffe

You can join four or 32 players, depending on the platform, for your Palworld adventures, but the monster-catching game isn’t keen on actually telling you how to do it. Our Palworld multiplayer guide explains how to play with friends and what co-op features are available on each platform.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to play Palworld multiplayer sessions</h2><p dir="ltr">If you want to play Palworld with friends, you have two options. You can create a world of your own and host your friends in a pretty straightforward way. From the world selection screen, choose “create a new world.” Then, toggle the “multiplayer” setting to on. It’s off by default, so every time you make a world for co-op play, you’ll need to toggle it back on. That’s all you need to do at this point, so just start the game as normal after that.</p><p

This might not sound like a big deal, but Master Chief almost never takes his helmet off in the games, so the announcement that he would in the TV series ruffled a lot of feathers.
