A New Zealand Army soldier reveals every piece of gear he would take on a 72-hour mission. Sam, a bombardier serving in the New Zealand Army's 16th Field Regiment, asked us not to use his full name for operational-security reasons.

While much of Sam's field gear resembles that carried by US service members, he shared some terms that many Americans may not be familiar with, such as "hoochie" and "scroggin."

In November 2023, the New Zealand Army participated in the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center training exercise hosted by the US Army's 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii.
