The very things that he admitted were correct all along, got many doctors fired during the Panny D. </p><p>You don’t need a medical degree or background to know that the government could not, and cannot, control a virus. And claiming that “arbitrary” rules can somehow “stop the spread” is the most pseudoscientific thing one can say. </p><p>So to have listened to Fauci when he demanded we “follow the science,” would have meant we needed to do the exact opposite of what he recommended. Because nearly everything the government forced Americans to do just appeared out of thin air. Someone randomly made it up. So when t

Keywords: "for the NFL season." He also addressed his appreciation that maybe the drama would be behind them and he could go back to talking about football. But the media claimed Rodgers was removed for political reasons and some on the right blasted McAfee for removing Rodgers for political reasons. The podcaster had to address the story again.</p><p>Here's the Wednesday announcement. McAfee discussed how many people Rodgers pissed off and said he was happy the IT (meaning the social media drama) wouldn't be in his mentions anymore. <em>IT</em>, not he (meaning Rodgers), that some are allegeding.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">JUST IN: Aaron Rodgers is suspended from appearing on ESPN's "The Pat McAfee Show"
