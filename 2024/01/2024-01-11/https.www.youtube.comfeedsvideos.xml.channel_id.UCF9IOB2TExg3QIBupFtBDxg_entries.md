SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V can cause 100% mortality in human ACE2-transgenic mice, 

potentially attributable to late-stage brain infection. 

This underscores a spillover risk of GX_P2V into humans,

and provides a unique model for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses. 

Dear Editor,

Two SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin coronaviruses, GD/2019 and GX/2017, 

were identified prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.
The respective isolates, were cultured in 2020 and 2017

the early passaged GX_P2V isolate was actually a cell culture-adapted mutant.

We assessed its pathogenicity in hACE2 mice. 

We found that the GX_P2V clone can infect h
