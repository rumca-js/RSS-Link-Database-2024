Alternatively, the company could reduce the height of its AirJet cooling solution, leaving its cooling capabilities unchanged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter is the approach that Frore took with the AirJet Mini Slim, which can generate the same 1750 pascals of air pressure at just 21 dBA of noise while slimming down from 2.8mm to 2.5mm thick. The weight has also been reduced to just 8 grams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frore&rsquo;s new cooling solution incl", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2198477/frore-launches-airjet-mini-slim-cooling-chip-as-frores-law-begins.html", "date_published": "2024-01-11T15:36:18+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Cooler Master\u2019s kickass NR200P case now fits huge GPUs", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>When it launched in 2020, Cooler Master&rsquo;s NR200 case revolutionized small form factor PC building. Not only did the 18L mini-ITX mesh case cost an astonishing $80, but it offered easy access to every nook and cranny within. Pulling off the panels required no tools and the whole case could be torn down to its individual pieces. You could build an SFF PC for much less money as well as with less intense planning or backtracking during the build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Afterward, a NR200P followed, which came with an additional tempered glass side panel, as did the NR200P Max, a variant that only supported vertical graphics card mounting and included a power supply and AIO CPU cooler. Now at CES 2024, Cooler Master&rsquo;s seemingly blended those two models to create the NR200P V2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtub", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2198773/cooler-masters-kickass-nr200p-case-now-fits-huge-gpus.html", "date_published": "2024-01-11T14:46:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Save $15 on this Apple Watch band with a built-in charger", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearing an Apple Watch is a nice convenience when it&rsquo;s charged.
