I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this RARE experience video that revisits the thrill and adventure of the Apollo 17 mission, the last manned mission to the Moon, broadcast live on a SONY television.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound design only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur)
