<p>Realme, a sister brand of Oppo and OnePlus, made its CES debut this year by unveiling a new mid-range phone with a photography twist. The Realme 12 Pro+, due to launch later this month, is apparently the first in its price segment to not only offer a 3x periscope zoom camera with optical stabilization, but also one with a relatively larger sensor to improve low-light performance. The candybar is the work of Swiss luxury watch designer Ollivier Savéo, complete with a golden fluted bezel surrounding a stunning polished sunburst dial, garnished with a 3D jubilee bracelet over vegan leather — in blue or white.</p>
<p>The periscope zoom camera here is powered by a 64-megapixel OmniVision OV64B, which comes in at 1/2 inches large. Realme says compared to the 3x zoom camera on the iPhone 15 Pro (12 megapixels) and the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra (10 megapixels), the Realme 12 Pro+'s sensor is at least over 2.6 times as large, thus enabling over 1.8 times the amount of light it takes in.

<p>We always find some strange gadgets at CES. There's no way around it, with thousands of exhibitors peddling their wares, trying to find a market for things no one has dreamed up before. From startups to giants like Samsung, there are plenty of things that make us pause, chuckle, and shake our heads. Here's a few favorites from CES 2024. Keep in mind, weird doesn't necessarily mean bad. It just means weird.</p>

<p>LG’s Labs department often takes technology and existing products and spins them into lifestyle-heavy ideas and notions. LG Labs was responsible for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lgs-dukebox-puts-vacuum-tube-audio-behind-a-transparent-oled-display-125526158.html">Dukebox</a>, a vacuum tube-driven speaker with a transparent OLED screen, an LG Gram with two displays, and several other projects. But the LG Bon Voyage concept trailer is a little more involved, packing so many of LG’s CES “greatest hits,” retooled and restyled for near-future camping that’s both incredibly comfortable and… unlikely.</p>
<p>The trailer is 2 meters by 3.8 meters, measuring up to a height of 2.2 meters. LG’s <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2024/01/lg-unveils-a-spectrum-of-cutting-edge-solutions-showcasing-its-creative-essence/">explanation</a> suggests you’d be able to pick and choose which appliances and features are included.</p>

<p>Friends, I’m not what you would call an experienced overlandist, which is a word I have now learned exists to mean when you go camping in a truck. Part of the process of overlandering is that you actually sleep in a collapsible tent on the roof of the truck you’re driving. Now, I’ll be honest and say sleeping on the roof of a truck, even if there are elastic straps stopping you from falling off, is not what I’d call a fun weekend adventure. But it’s the market that Jackery is catering toward with its new concept solar roof tent, which it showed off here at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-what-we-expect-in-las-vegas-this-year-140040145.html">CES 2024</a> in Las Vegas and will launch as a real product by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>The Jackery Solar Generator for Rooftop Tent is equipped with 1,000W solar panels (with a 25 percent efficiency rate). Unlike the flimsy panels you can currently buy, these are rigid slide-out units that should offer a sturdier canopy under which t

<p>One of the key advantages of Bluetooth LE Audio is <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/auracast/how-it-works/">Auracast</a>: a way to broadcast content to connected devices in public settings. It will also allow you to easily connect multiple wireless speakers to each other with diving into an app. Perhaps most importantly, the barrier to entry is going to be very low since a dedicated Auracast app will be built into mobile platforms like iOS and Android. What's more, you'll select available channels like you would a Bluetooth device or a Wi-Fi network. It's simple, and it's presented in a way that people who've used a smartphone are familiar with. Auracast has been mentioned constantly by companies announcing their new audio gear at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-live-latest-tech-weird-gadgets-and-our-best-of-ces-awards-000021076.html">CES 2024</a>, so here's what you need to know about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello and happy new year! Once again, team Engadget has set up shop in Las Vegas for CES, living out of suitcases so that we can scour the massive show floor and occasionally injure ourselves in the process. For <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-live-latest-tech-debuts-weird-gadgets-and-everything-else-from-the-las-vegas-show-floor-000021384.html">CES 2024</a>, we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-what-we-expect-in-las-vegas-this-year-140040145.html">expected</a> to see AI everywhere, and we were not disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

Audible laid off around five percent of its employees on Thursday, which <em>Variety</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/audible-layoffs-amazon-1235869320/">reports</a> is “just over 100 staffers.” The cuts in the audiobook division are part of parent company Amazon’s most recent round of layoffs, also affecting Prime Video, MGM, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-is-reportedly-laying-off-35-percent-of-its-workforce-085946333.html">Twitch</a>.</p>

<p>Years ago, some genius decided to build Las Vegas in the middle of a desert, so for me, any sight of unique humidifying tech at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-live-latest-tech-debuts-weird-gadgets-and-everything-else-from-the-las-vegas-show-floor-000021384.html">CES</a> is a much welcomed sight. It just so happened that a Korean company showcased a device dubbed <a href="https://www.mosslab.com/">Moss Air</a> which, as the name implies, uses real moss to purify air. It's also built with a humidifying feature that can shoot outwards or rehydrate the plant internally. In short, you're getting an air-purifying humidifier that doubles as a mesmerizing miniature foggy terrarium on your desktop.</p>
<p>According to Mosslab, the startup behind this device, not only does the moss convert carbon dioxide back into oxygen, but it's also effective at removing fine dust from the air. Better yet, the plant can apparently break harmful VOCs (volatile organic compounds) down into suga

CEO Jason Citron said that staff across departments will be impacted once the layoffs begin.</p>
<p>According to the memo, Citron believes the company hired too many people since 2020. This, he wrote, led the workforce to take on projects that made Discord “less efficient.” He added that the company needs to sharpen its focus, however, he did not give any insight about any particular strategies moving forward except that the cuts “put us in the best position to continue building a strong and profitable business.&quot;</p>

<p>Ubisoft’s <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> launches next week, but players are likely to encounter an amusing bug as they make their way through the game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-will-have-a-character-voiced-by-text-to-speech-at-launch"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>IGN</ins></em></a><em>.</em> One of the game’s NPCs is voiced by a text-to-speech program, complete with the slightly robotic tones we’ve come to associate with these services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not quite Siri or Alexa, but it’s close and certainly doesn’t fit the game’s Persian-inspired setting.

<p>Credential stuffing, or using compromised login information to take over accounts, has been around as long as we’ve used passwords to secure our accounts. But, perhaps in part because it's gotten easier for hackers to perform this type of attack, credential stuffing made headlines in recent months.</p>
<p>Look at the 23andMe breach <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/23andme-hack-now-estimated-to-affect-over-half-of-customers-165314743.html">affecting nearly 7 million users</a>. While not every account was compromised via credential stuffing, it was how the hackers initially got in, and then they used a social feature called DNA Relatives to keep going.

<p>You can one day use your tongue as a mouse for your laptop, tablet or phone, thanks to a new product that made its first public appearance at CES 2024. The MouthPad (an obvious spin on the word "mousepad") is what <a href="https://www.augmental.tech/">its makers call</a> a tongue-operated touchpad that "sits at the roof of your mouth" and can be connected to your devices just like a standard Bluetooth mouse. I got to see the MouthPad here in Las Vegas, where it's making its first public appearance since its announcement last year, though, to be clear, I did not put it in my mouth to try out for myself. Instead, I watched as the company's co-founder Tomás Vega used the device to navigate an iPhone and open the camera as we took a selfie together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MouthPad is basically like a retainer with a touchpad, battery and Bluetooth radio built in. It's made of a resin that the company <a href="https://www.augmental.tech/faq">says</a> is the same "dental-grade material that i

<p>Valve may have had a change of heart about fan-made tribute projects “borrowing” its intellectual property. <em>GamesRadar+</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/after-years-of-supporting-mods-and-fan-games-valve-takes-action-against-team-fortress-and-portal-fan-projects/">reported</a> on the Steam maker’s <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/01/2024-01-10-valve.md">DMCA takedown notice</a> sent to the creators of <em>Team Fortress: Source 2</em>, a passion project porting <em>TF2</em> to the more modern Source 2 game engine.

<p>Since Sony Honda Mobility revealed its EV collaboration at last year’s CES, not much has changed externally. The Afeela EV does now have a LIDAR notch above the windshield, and there’s been some design refinements and tweaks, but for CES 2024, the company was trying to express exactly how all of Sony’s entertainment and sensor expertise would combine with Honda’s automotive know-how, and why we should care about its high-tech EV.</p>
<p>The Afeela will create its own noise cancellation bubble, apparently “tailoring the cabin for entertainment” using Sony’s Spatial Audio technology. According to SHM’s renderings, there appear to be roughly 30 speakers. These were put to use in one of the most surreal experiences I’ve had at CES: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/i-played-horizon-zero-dawn-inside-sony-and-hondas-afeela-concept-ev-at-ces-2024-205902922.html">playing <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> inside a car.</a></p>

<p>I’ve been interested in solar generators for a long while, but very few of them ever felt worthy of specific comment. Many of them historically boasted of running laptops, TVs or coolers, but their constrained outputs made them incapable of powering kettles, washing machines or air conditioners. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-what-we-expect-in-las-vegas-this-year-140040145.html">CES 2024</a> has shown that the industry has moved beyond those limitations, with newer units capable of fulfilling the promise inherent in their names.</p>

All you have to do is point the gear at a bird and make sure the view is in focus, and then press down an action button. Within a few seconds, the system will overlay a bird’s name over your view, using data pulled from the <a href="https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/">Merlin Bird ID database</a>. That has over 9,000 species tagged, and will even let you know the degree of certainty it has if the bird in question is in an unexpected location. And if this was the only feature these binoculars had, it’d be enough to justify the purchase, but that’s only the beginning of what these things can do.</p>
<p>Between the eyepieces, there’s a function wheel similar to one you would find on a camera that lets you cycle between various features. That includ

It claimed that "expenses related to collision and damage, primarily associated with EVs, remained high" in the most recent financial quarter, "thereby supporting the company’s decision to initiate the material reduction in the EV fleet." Hertz said it plans to reinvest some of the proceeds into purchasing gas-powered vehicles.</p>
<p>"The company expects this action to better balance supply against expected demand of EVs," Hertz <a href="https://ir.hertz.com/node/11206/html"><ins>said in an SEC filing</ins></a>.

The Engadget team has been getting our cardio in, braving both vehicular and human traffic to get face and hand time (and other body parts?) with the most intriguing demos here, while companies haven’t stopped holding press conferences and announcing new items.
