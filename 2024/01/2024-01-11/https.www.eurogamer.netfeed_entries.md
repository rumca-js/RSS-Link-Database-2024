Well here's one way of getting yourself some free publicity: casually announce your product will be releasing alongside Switch 2 this "September" so that everyone excitedly thinks you might have just accidentally splurged Nintendo's big secret, then, when you're confronted about it, give a little shrug and admit you were "just guessing".
</p><p>
That's pretty much what happened today when audio company Altec Lansing shared a <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/altec-lansing-ventures-into-new-territory-as-the-inaugural-licensee-of-ai-sharks-original-gaming-software-302032707.html">press release</a> unveiling a partnership with GameShark (now AI Shark) that'll see it release a new AI-powered GameShark successor - an announcement casually tossing in the sentence, "The official launch is planned to coincide with t

In a week that's already seen Unity and Twitch announce signifiant job cuts, Discord has reportedly told staff it'll be laying off around 170 employees - approximately 17 percent of its workforce - as it seeks to "sharpen our focus and... bring more agility to our organisation."
</p><p>
As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24034705/discord-layoffs-17-percent-employees">reported by The Verge</a>, employees at Discord were informed of the job cuts today by CEO Jason Citron in an all-hands meeting and accompanying internal email.
</p><p>
"Today we are making the unfortunate and difficult decision to reduce the size of Discord's workforce by 17%," Citron wrote in the email shared by The Verge. "This means we are saying goodbye to 170 of our talented colleagues. This is a decision we did not take lightly, but it is one

What with the launch of couch co-op, Adventures mode and a variety of other free content updates, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-now-has-couch-co-op-a-switch-version-and-a-brand-new-engine">Switch version</a>, a new engine, two paid expansions (including an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-announces-among-us-dlc-collaboration">Among Us collaboration</a>), plus news of an animated TV adaptation, 2023 was a busy year for Vampire Survivors. However, creator Poncle isn't done yet, and it's now share a revised development roadmap (of sorts) for its perennially vampire-free minimalist survival RPG, which includes an update on cross-saves and a potential online co-op mode.

If you're big of years but small of shelf space, you might be interested in the newly announced 400 Mini, an officially licensed scaled-down version of Atari's four-and-a-half decade old home computer, the Atari 400, which launches on 28th March this year.
</p><p>
Created by Retro Games Ltd - the company previously responsible for the C64 Mini and Amiga 500 Mini - the 400 Mini sports a similar design to Atari's 1979 8-bit computer (albeit approximately half the size) but can do a little more beyond its inspiration.
</p><p>
As per Retro Games' announcement, the 400 Mini (styled THE400 Mini) doesn't just emulate the Atari 400 hardware, it's also emulates the entire 8-bit Atari range, including the 400's pricier sibling the Atari 800, plus the XL and XE series, and the 5200 home console.

With Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, UbiSoft has completely eschewed its typical open world formula, instead choosing to narrow its focus building a side-scrolling, exploration-driven platform game - and it might just by my favorite thing the publisher has released in the last ten years. The Lost Crown is not pushing cutting-edge visuals, instead focusing on delivering a supremely polished, ultra smooth game that perfectly leverages every platform it has shipped on. That's right, no matter which platform you might choose to play this game on, you can expect something special.

The Lost Crown begins a new chapter in the storied history of Prince of Persia - and for UbiSoft Montpellier, the studio behind the game. Montpellier was previously responsible for the creation of Rayman Origins and Legends over a decade ago and I've await

Remember last year, when The Last of Us composer Gustavo Santaolalla first suggested a new version of Part 2 was on the horizon? He said players would be able to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-composer-lets-slip-new-edition-is-in-the-pipeline">make his in-game character "play certain themes"</a> during the then-unannounced remastered's release. 
</p><p>
Now, we have a closer look at just what Santaolalla was talking about, thanks to a new marketing beat for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.
</p><p>
Santaolalla's cameo will actually be part of the game's Guitar Free Play mode. Although, rather than playing the guitar as we have seen Joel doing in promo shots for the upcoming release, he will play the banjo.

Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal will launch on Nintendo Switch in two weeks time, on 25th January. 
</p><p>
This release will be a souped up version of IOI's 2006 title Hitman: Blood Money. It promises a host of improvements across 12 "highly-replayable" missions, including new features such as Instinct Mode, an ever-present minimap, and an array of gameplay improvements inspired by later games in IOI's Hitman series. Of course, outfit changes and using as many different weapons and/or methods as you can is fully encouraged.
</p><p>
Here is a little trailer for it all, showing off some shenanigans across the globe. While I have no interest in becoming an assassin myself, I am rather jealous of Agent 47's travel opportunities.

Pok&eacute;mon Go's next major in-game event will add a pair of powerful and game-changing new abilities you'll need to obtain special creatures to use.
</p><p>
Pok&eacute;mon Go Tour: Sinnoh will debut Origin Forme Dialga and Palkia from last year's Pok&eacute;mon Legends Arceus - ancient versions of the Legendary creatures from Pok&eacute;mon Diamond and Pearl (the appearance of which is not a surprise, as they were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-timeless-travels-hemisphere-seasonal-spawns-end-date-9304#section-3">first revealed a little earlier than planned last year</a>).

Diablo 4's next season is now confirmed to go live later this month, despite Blizzard so far providing us all with very little detail on what it will actually contain.
</p><p>
Season of Blood - the game's current season - is set to come to a close soon, with the next season then starting up on 23rd January. So, in just under two weeks.
</p><p>
While Blizzard itself has not 'announced' this date at the time of writing, a message has been spotted in Diablo 4 itself proclaiming it to be so. As you can see in the image below, when players boot up the game, they are met with a notice on the character selection screen that reads: "Season 3. Next season begins January 23, 2024".

An unsettling AI-powered hologram of Nintendo mascot Mario at the Consumer Electronics Show 2024 event in Las Vegas was unlicensed and unofficial, the company behind the technology has now admitted. 
</p><p>
The odd-looking and robotic-sounding Mario was the work of Proto Hologram, a company that creates holograms held within large box-like structures that you can talk to and interact with. 
</p><p>
More bizarre still, the Mario hologram was supposed to be a collaboration with the AARP, an American advocacy group for people over the age of 50 - apparently to demonstrate how AI holograms could combat loneliness in the elderly. But with Mario? And more to the point - with a poorly-voiced, dead-eyed broken 3D model of Mario?

Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and The Fate of Atlantis. There are some great Indiana Jones titles out there. There is also Dial of Destiny, but this is not the time or place to discuss that particular release. 
</p><p>
Now, the internet thinks it has worked out the title of MachineGames' upcoming Indiana Jones game. And it is... Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.
</p><p>
This assumption comes from social media user @Kurakasis, who shared their discovery on X last night. The user revealed that Lucasfilm has been registering a number of domain names that are variations on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle over recent days.

We looked at the road ahead, seemingly endless before us, and dreamed big. There seemed to be nothing we couldn't do. Then a year went by and here we are. Here we are again.</p><p>So, how did we do? Did anyone manage to achieve their ambitions from 2023? This is our confessional. It's also an invitation to do it all over again, and to join us as we dream ahead and lay out our gaming ambitions for 2024. What will you do this year?</p><p>Last year I said I'd run a role-playing game, a tabletop role-playing game, and I failed. I didn't manage to do it. But it wasn't a complete failure. I spent more time playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons than any other game
