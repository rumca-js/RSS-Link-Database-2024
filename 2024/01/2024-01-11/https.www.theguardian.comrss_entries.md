But it will make you question every website you dangerously rely on</p><p>Google’s unofficial company motto, at least until it was restructured into Alphabet Inc in 2015, was “Don’t be evil”. That is not a normal thing to have to say. It should have been a warning to us all that big tech’s default position might, in fact … be evil?</p><p>Facebook’s was the slightly less worrisome: “Move fast and break things.” Slightly less worrisome, at least, until seven or eight years ago when Trump took to the platform for campaigning purposes and it became clear that one of the things Facebook might break was democracy. People had been warning that the social media behemoth might wield too much power since at least 2011, when it became central to the Arab spring uprising.

<p>British politics has been drained of credibility. The Labour leader could turn low expectations to his advantage – for a time</p><p>The often messy end of a party’s long hold on power is one of the key rituals of British politics. Voters who made that party’s ascendancy possible now get revenge on ministers who have disappointed them. Journalists get lots of dramatic downfall stories. A new regime finally enters Downing Street, with fresher protagonists and policies. Our electoral system, which has often helped keep the old regime in office too long by <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/general-election-2019-turning-votes-into-seats/">disproportionately rewarding its share of the vote</a>, suddenly seems vindicated.

<p>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of one of the greatest TV shows ever, largely incoherent TikTok recaps have been released</p><p>It is truly impossible to imagine a world that doesn’t have The Sopranos in it. Twenty-five years old this week, David Chase’s mob drama is so seminal – so entirely integral to the way in which we consume television – that it stands as a permanent waypoint in the history of entertainment. The birth of The Sopranos marked the moment when television started taking audiences seriously, the moment when creators started treating TV shows like novels, the moment when cinema was forced to start ceding its superiority to what had previously been a lesser medium. Put simply, life before The Sopranos was vastly different to life after it.</p><p>And so something special had to be done to mark the 25th anniversary of The Sopranos. But what? A full-blown cast reunion, along the lines of the ones given to Friends and Harry Potter? An academically thorough retelling o

<p>Will the delayed TV awards see a victory lap for the final season of Succession? And will Abbott Elementary or The Bear triumph in the comedy categories?</p><p>It’s a strong year for best drama series, with three critically beloved HBO series (Succession, The Last of Us and The White Lotus, now classified as a drama series with its second season) and one less beloved but still phenomenally expensive HBO series (House of the Dragon). There’s also a Netflix awards stalwart (The Crown, for its first Diana-centric season); the cult-hit survival series Yellowjackets; one undersung (at least by the Emmys) series swan song in Better Call Saul; and the under-watched but extremely well-received Star Wars prequel Andor. If there were to be an upset of the undefeated Succession, it would probably be Better Call Saul, the rare excellent spin-off that was acclaimed throughout six seasons.

<p>In this reissued novel from the 1980s, the Australian great explores love, memory, grasslands and the landscapes of a solitary mind</p><p>The reissue of Australian author Gerald Murnane’s fiction is introducing new readers to this&nbsp;most idiosyncratic and formally adventurous of novelists, now in his 80s. Postmodernism is at a nadir, but&nbsp;Murnane’s nested, self-reflexive narratives may be placed alongside the fabulations of Nabokov, Calvino and Borges, once grouped under that label. Murnane is known for not straying far from Goroke in Victoria – he is the anti-type of globe-trotting literary celebrity – but like those writers, and some of the modernists before them, he is a dreamer of other worlds. His work uncompromisingly blurs the frontiers of memory and imagination; it is not for the faint-hearted.</p><p>Inland, originally published in 1988, was the last novel Murnane wrote before a mysterious creative hiatus.

<p>In their new shows, anarchic theatre company Spymonkey and sketch duo Max and Ivan place the spotlight on their own lives more than ever before</p><p>If you’re making comedy, or funny theatre, what’s the last thing you should include in your show? For years – for most of entertainment history, in fact – the answer would have been: backstage strife. No one wants to see that show about how you’re drifting apart as a double act, how touring live comedy just doesn’t pay the bills, or how your company is in the advanced stages of collapse. Remember that Morecambe and Wise show about the tensions in their off-stage relationship? Of course you don’t. It didn’t happen. It would not have brought you sunshine.</p><p>But times change. In the era of autofiction, reality TV and trauma-comedy, the lines between fact and fantasy, onstage and off, blur. For a long time, the duo Max and Ivan were grateful that their chosen artistic niche, narrative sketch comedy, gave them characters and fictions

In physics, the quest for a so-called Grand Unifying Theory has preoccupied the most ambitious minds for generations, alas to no avail. But in the life sciences, we managed to find four grand unifying theories in the space of 100 years or so. Three are well known: cell theory – all life is made of cells, which only come from existing cells; Darwin’s evolution by natural selection; and universal genetics – all life is encoded by a cypher written in the molecule DNA. The fourth, no less important, goes by the chewy name chemiosmosis, and describes the way that all living things live by drawing fuel from their surroundings and using it in a continuous chemical reaction. In summary, life, made of cells that
