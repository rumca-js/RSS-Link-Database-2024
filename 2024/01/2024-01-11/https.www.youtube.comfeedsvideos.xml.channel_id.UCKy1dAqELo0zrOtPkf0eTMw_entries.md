Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown reviewed by Phil Hornshaw on PC, also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.

Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown captures not only what made games such as The Sands of Time so good, but it irons out a lot of the little issues that plagued the 3D games in this series by opting for a 2D perspective – and owning it. It also works extremely well as a traditional Metroidvania, sticking with tried-and-true elements of the genre but executing on them with precision. The story can feel a bit jumbled at times, but it's the fast and fun combat system, the tight and satisfying controls, and the stylish look and feel that elevate Sargon’s journey and make The Lost Crown a worthy successor to the best of the Prince of Persia legacy.

We finally know who’s been cast as Abby in HBO’s The Last of Us season 2. That role goes to actor Kaitlyn Dever, who you might’ve seen in 2023’s scifi horror film, No One Will Save You. Abby’s the main antagonist in The Last of Us Part 2 whose motives for revenge might be justifiable in some folks' eyes given the events that occurred towards the end of season one of the live-action series and the final scenes of the first video game. While Kaitlyn Dever begins bulking up for the role of Abby in #TheLastofUs, we also have another casting announcement in Jesse. Actor Young Mazino will be stepping into the role of the character.
