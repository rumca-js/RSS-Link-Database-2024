Godkings hate this one weird trick!\n\nThis was a lot of fun to work on because I got to spend a lot of time learning THE TRUTH ABOUT GOLD and by that I mean actually interesting facts about how humans use gold. The mythology of gold actually makes a lot of sense through the lens of its physical properties, the fact that ancient humans could make things out of it and those things would outlive generations. It's just rare enough that societal elites can monopolize it, but common enough you can gather enough to actually make stuff with it. So these things, namely jewellery for the leaders, are so resistant to the elements that you can see how the gold itself became representative of the power of the kings, of their claimed immortality.\n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nCrowdfunding: https://www.patreon.com/foldablehuman\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman\n\n00:00:00 - Gold Open\n00:00:53 - Ads for gold\n00:03:05 - Gold is ", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihvG3RgbYzE", "date_published": "2024-01-11T00:35:46+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "Folding Ideas", "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ihvG3RgbYzE/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
