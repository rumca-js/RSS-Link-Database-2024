A Robert Lewandowski strike and another from Lamine Yamal on 92 minutes gave Barcelona a win by more than a single goal for the first time in 21 matches, the longest run in their history, to progress to the final of the Spanish Super Cup. There, in Saudi Arabia on Sunday night, Real Madrid await, as they did last year. “It’s been a long time, it’s true” midfielder Frenkie de Jong said when it was finally over, “but it doesn’t matter: it was about winning.”</p><p>Opponents Osasuna, meanwhile, head back to Spain. This may be a minor competition to most but for a club without a trophy it mattered, however much they would have preferred to have fought for it back home. They have a 5,000km journey ahead of them, time enough to lament an opportunity lost. Or, they felt, taken away, David García comp

<p>New plans could make room for new dynamics, writes advice columnist <strong>Eleanor Gordon-Smith</strong>, but there are deeper issues at play you shouldn’t ignore</p><p><strong>Each Christmas it’s a stressful time for my family. My father reliably becomes passive aggressive, I suspect because he wants Christmas to be a certain way, with certain foods to his liking. The problem is that he is old school and does nothing at all to help with the monumental task of preparing</strong><strong>. Therefore I tend to help my mum cook things </strong><strong> we like, as we are the ones putting in the effort.</strong></p><p><strong>My brothers and father do nothing to help – yet resent not getting what they want. It feels as though it gets more toxic and difficult each year – and we don’t know how to make it better. Any suggestions? Also, </strong><strong>self-</strong><strong>reflection on </strong><strong>the part of my dad will never happen, so we’re at </strong><strong>an impasse.</stro

<p>A moral philosopher examines the cycles of suffering that perpetuate violence</p><p>Jonathan Glover’s new book, on the seemingly intractable nature of the Israel-Palestine conflict, quotes George Orwell on the Spanish civil war: “Everybody believes in the atrocities of the enemy and disbelieves in those of his own side without ever examining the evidence.”</p><p>This could have been written today, amid bipolar thinking and pressure to take sides, where people’s identification with the facts can reflect their political predilections. Glover wrote the bulk of his study before the recent horrors, though it is published with a foreword addressing them. Not surprisingly, it is still deeply relevant. We have seen these tragic cycles of violence again and again in the past; they continue on an even more horrific scale today. Glover is a philosopher and author of Humanity: a Moral History of the Twentieth Century, which took him 10 years to write and involved careful scrutiny of acts of h
