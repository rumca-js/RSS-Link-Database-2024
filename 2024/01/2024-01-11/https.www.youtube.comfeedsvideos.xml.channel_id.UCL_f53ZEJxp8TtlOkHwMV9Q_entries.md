Dr. Jordan B. Peterson speaks with former-Scientologist and podcaster Aaron Levin-Smith. They explore his upbringing within the “church,” how Scientology entices new members, the basis for Dianetics in Freudian psychology, the religiously inspired twist only found behind multiple paywalls, the higher being known as Xenu, what broke Aaron’s belief, and his now ongoing fight against the manipulation of this still relevant, international cult.

Aaron Smith-Levin is a former Scientologist and host of the “Growing Up In Scientology” YouTube channel. He was also a main interviewee on the docu-series “Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.” Since leaving the cult, he has devoted himself and his career to unmasking the harmful practices and beliefs held by the international religion.
