Cats are awesome and this video shows why. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

Probably because his other guest canceled. I don't know. All I know is he decided to waste time with a tarot reader and I am not here for it. </p><p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2024/01/03/paula-roberts-jesse-watters-fox-tarot-cards/" target="_blank">According to <em>The Daily Caller: </em></a></p><blockquote>"Fox News host Jesse Watters invited a tarot card reader to perform a reading during his show Tuesday night, and her prediction for former President Donald Trump was less than ideal.<br /><br />Paula Roberts, an English psychic, pulled one card for Trump and another for President Joe Biden.<br /><br />For Trump, she drew the Five of Cups, which she interpreted as predicting a “sense of loss” for him in the new year.<

Only racism can fix racism. Two wrongs make a right. It is the exception to the rule even though it is a logical contradiction, at best. </p><p>We all know the aforementioned statement makes no sense. But "sense" is not something progressives will let get in the way of their agenda. </p><p>That is why the White House Press Secretary practically jumped up with joy yesterday as she told MSNBC “The president has always, always put equity at the center of every policy he’s put forward!” </p><p>In other words, Sleepy Joe makes sure skin color guides his policies and for some reason, the left thinks this is a good thing. </p><p>She is probably so happy due to the fact she has benefited from the White House placing “equity at the center of every policy.” </p><bloc

She basically said that every human on earth has a legal right to reside in the United States. Yes, all 7.8 billion of them. </p><p>However, although she did not specifically say this, I think it is safe to say she does not mean <em>every </em>single<i> </i>person in the world. Considering her track record with the “electeds of color” <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/boston-mayor-party" target="_blank">party</a>, I would not be surprised if the only illegal humans are those without a “colored” skin tone.

A lot of this has to do with State laws that have de facto decriminalized lawlessness in California. However, progressive officials refuse to make any connection between soft-on-crime policies and the retail theft apocalypse. As of writing this, they are still trying to get to the “root cause” of the issue and figure out what in tarnation is going on. </p>
<p>So while they figure out why criminals are continuing with their criminality, lawmakers have to pretend to care about the increasing risk to public safety. </p>
<p>But how are they going to pretend to care, you ask? Well, police can only publish someone's mugshot now if they use the “correct pronoun
