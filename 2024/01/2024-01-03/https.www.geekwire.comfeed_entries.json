Six of the cell-capable satellites were among a batch of 21 Starlink satellites launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California at 7:44 p.m. PT Tuesday. The satellites were deployed successfully, and the rocket&#8217;s first-stage booster made a routine landing on a drone ship in the Pacific Ocean. SpaceX plans to launch hundreds of the upgraded satellites in the months ahead, with the aim of beginning satellite-enabled texting later this year. 4G LTE&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/spacex-first-starlink-satellite-t-mobile-direct-cell/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/spacex-first-starlink-satellite-t-mobile-direct-cell", "date_published": "2024-01-03T18:26:16+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Curiosity, communication, and capital efficiency: Investors share their tips for startups in 2024", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"1166\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-03-at-8.39.54-AM.png\" width=\"1170\" /><br />Be curious. Communicate openly and honestly. Maintain capital efficiency with a focus on growth. Those are some of the top tips for founders heading into 2024, according to Seattle-area tech investors we polled. It&#8217;s shaping up to be a unique year in the tech startup world, following a steep decline in venture capital in 2023 as investors tightened their belts and companies curbed costs. However, there are reasons for optimism. The excitement around AI, a strong stock market, and additional talent flooding the market following thousands of layoffs last year could help boost prospects for startup leaders in 2024.

One of PNNL&#8217;s research priorities is to identify and combat complex threats to national security, and AI can help meet that priority by detecting attempts to acquire nuclear weapons or associated technology.
