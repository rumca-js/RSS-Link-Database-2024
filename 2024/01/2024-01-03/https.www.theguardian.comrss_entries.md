<p>Narcissism and megalomania are the lifeblood of the Reform UK press conference – an exercise in collective time-wasting</p><p>Just three days in and 2024 is shaping up to be a golden year for political comedy. The closer we get to an election, the more Westminster resembles the theatre of the absurd. You couldn’t create such hapless characters if you tried. Weak, vain narcissists scrabbling around for any attention they can get. Seemingly unaware of the ridicule in which they are held by most of the country. How unforgiven they are for the destruction they have wantonly caused.</p><p>On Tuesday we had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/02/james-cleverly-says-spiking-joke-clearly-caused-hurt">James Cleverly</a> and his technicolour truths. On Wednesday we had a press conference for Reform UK. To all intents and purposes a party that exists purely for the glorification of Nigel Farage. Without Nige, the party is a waste of space.

Sign up now!</a></p><p>For most of Sir Alex Ferguson’s time at Manchester United, one bit of wisdom was repeated throughout football. No, not “youse are all effing idiots”, but, “when you leave Old Trafford, the only way is down”. Gerard Piqué was the first to inadvertently challenge it when he took an unlikely shortcut from Manchester United reserves to probably the greatest club side of all time. Then, when Ferguson retired in 2013, the cliché was properly flipped on its head. In 2024, the only way is down when you enter Old Trafford – down into the Bermuda Triangle where careers are lost forever. From Morgan Schneiderlin to Mason Mount via Anthony Martial and Jadon Sancho, potentially world-class footballers have become victims of football’s version of Squid Game. Then again, given United’s transfer policy and wage structure, it should probably – yes, we re

It almost looked like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/19/hokusai-japanese-artist-late-blossoming-great-wave-mount-fuji">Hokusai’s waves</a>.

He holds the baby rocking and rocking him as if to say, “gone, gone, gone.” He slaps the floor with his hand. He cries out over and over. Then the energy changes, suddenly terrifying, suddenly shocking. I have never seen a man’s body go mad from the inside.

On the other hand, 2024 may even be worse. The man once known as “America’s mayor” faces financial ruin and criminal prosecution with no end in sight to his woes. The hair-dye dripping down his face at a 2020 press conference ominously presaged what would eventually follow. It took less than two decades for the former federal prosecutor and contender for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination to morph into a punchline, full-time defendant and deadbeat.</p><p>Back in the day, Giuliani garnered a reputation for crime-busting – perp-walking Wall Street bankers and sending mobsters to jail.

<p>The MP and former policy chief sets out the battle of ideas that has shaped Labour from Attlee to Starmer</p><p>With Labour potentially on the brink of a historic general election victory, the hard-fought question of what the party stands for has taken on an immediate, practical relevance.</p><p>At the outset of this twisty political history, Jon Cruddas, the outgoing MP for Dagenham and Rainham, admits he is not a neutral observer of Labour’s battle of ideas. His central claim is that Labour’s purpose cannot be reduced to a single statement or slogan – but embraces three distinct ideas of justice, whose hold on the party has ebbed and flowed over time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/03/a-century-of-labour-by-jon-cruddas-review-what-does-the-party-stand-for">Continue reading...</a>

And, simplest of all, would you wear a skirt in public?</p><p>The questions are lighthearted, and not intended to truly cut to the heart of feminist issues, but it’s interesting to see how many men sheepishly give three “no” answers nonetheless.

<p>Rescuers in Japan were scrambling to search for survivors on Wednesday as authorities warned of landslides from heavy rain after a powerful earthquake that killed at least 62 people. The 7.5-magnitude quake on 1 January rattled Ishikawa prefecture on the main island of Honshu, triggered tsunami waves more than a metre high, sparked a huge fire and tore apart roads. The Noto peninsula on the Sea of Japan coast was hit most severely, with buildings ravaged by fire and houses flattened in several towns, including Wajima and Suzu</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2024/jan/03/japanese-earthquake-aftermath-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Although the team fell away in 2023, their remarkable start offers encouragement that investment will pay off</p><p>Watching the 42-year-old Fernando Alonso almost bouncing on the spot, an irrepressible grin plastered over his face, was an enormously endearing moment with which to open the 2023 Formula One season. He and his Aston Martin team had pulled off a brilliant coup at the season opener in Bahrain, Alonso was on the podium and Aston had taken the most improbable seat at F1’s top table.</p><p>Having finished seventh in 2022, impotent at the back of the field, Aston Martin’s form at the Sakhir circuit was revelatory. Alonso was third behind only the two dominant Red Bulls but he had comfortably beaten both Mercedes and Ferrari. Nor was it a flash in the pan. Where Ferrari and Mercedes had stuttered to a start, Aston had hit the ground running. Alonso went on to take six podiums from the opening eight races.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/03/ambitious

<p>The French icon is the most stylish thing about this underpowered tale of the wife of President Chirac attempting a new public image</p><p>Catherine Deneuve makes a stately but good-humoured procession through a bland, underpowered true-life political dramedy that somehow manages to be very apolitical. Deneuve plays Bernadette Chirac, the wife of Jacques Chirac, the former Paris mayor who became president of France from 1995 to 2007, seeing off Le Pen’s far right, but pilloried in Washington as the “cheese-eating surrender monkey” who wouldn’t support the Iraq war, and was finally mired in corruption scandals.</p><p>Deneuve portrays Bernadette as Chirac’s haughty but outspoken first lady, resplendent in Lagerfeld couture, who has long endured her husband’s endless affairs – and in fact, like the French press and public, hardly seems to notice them, a Gallic worldliness quite unlike the attitude in Britain or the United States.

<p>Start with walking in January – then graduate to breathing exercises, circuits and pilates. With a new activity to try each month, you’ll soon improve your flexibility and fitness, without feeling the burn</p><p>Don’t take this the wrong way, but let’s imagine you are heading into 2024 at fitness ground zero: on to a medium to low baseline, you have heaped a month of doing nothing at all. What can you do to return to fighting form as painlessly as possible? Well, a lot – though, I warn you, it will take time.</p><p>This 12-month programme starts easily enough, but by December you should have found at least a few activities that really stretch you, or that don’t immediately appeal. Don’t write them off. The best gestalt fitness advice I ever heard came from an Australian tennis coach, who said: “Whatever you’re doing, you need to introduce an activity at which you are not adept.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/03/the-strength-secret-how-to-get-seriou

<p>UK and US elections don’t usually happen in the same year. So what happens when they do? Jonathan Freedland delves into history books and what lessons they have for 2024</p><p>There are big election years and then there is 2024. In the US that means a full primary season in which Donald Trump looks set to be confirmed as the Republican party’s presidential nominee before an election expected to be an extremely tight re-run of the race in 2020. Meanwhile in the UK, polls show Labour is favourite to return to power after an absence from government of 14 years.</p><p>But as <strong>Jonathan Freedland </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>nothing is predictable – and even more so when these elections collide. This last happened in 1992, when John Major held on as prime minister in the UK and Bill Clinton came to power in the US.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2024/jan/03/2024-what-happens-when-us-uk-elections-collide-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
