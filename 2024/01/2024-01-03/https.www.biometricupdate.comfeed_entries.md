		A U.S. cybersecurity firm analyzing come-ons from dark web entities advertising free stolen personal data says digital ID information is a "primary focus" for criminals.

In what is being referred to so cleverly as "leaksmas," dark web inhabitations began issuing large plumes of stolen personally identifiable data – 50 million records – much of it free for the taking, over the holidays.

The company, Resecurity, <a href="https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/cybercriminals-launched-leaksmas-event-in-the-dark-web-exposing-massive-volumes-of-leaked-pii-and-compromised-data">published</a> a report last week saying that it's clear that cybercriminals are most focused on stealing digital identity information. The motivation for the apparent clearance sale is the short expi

		The UN refugee agency is working on decentralized digital ID utilizing blockchain to protect the identity of people crossing borders is risky situations.

UNHCR Division of Financial and Administrative Management Treasurer Carmen Hett said during a <a href="https://youtu.be/h3ByHC63ROY?si=Ach8HmJOKfoi5beO">panel discussion</a> at Decentral House in Switzerland at the close of 2023. The panel also included representatives of the World Trade Organization and International Telecommunication Union, and focussed largely on how to build support and acceptance for the use of blockchain within agencies that are operationally conservative.

		Serbian authorities have been building up their arsenal of drones equipped with advanced capabilities, including those that allow biometric data gathering, prompting experts to sound the alarm over privacy and surveillance.

According to public procurement data <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2022/02/15/concern-over-uncontrolled-security-cameras-in-serb-dominated-north-kosovo/">gathered</a> by BIRN, Serbia’s Ministry of the Interior has been acquiring powerful unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) from Chinese manufacturers DJI and Yuneec and Romanian company Hirrus. Some of the models are equipped with high-quality video recording and powerful zooms that can be used to record faces from great distances.

		During the first visit by an FBI director to India in twelve years, current agency director Christopher Wray urged Indian authorities to begin collecting biometric data on fugitive criminals – which, says a <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/fbi-director-nudges-shift-in-india-fugitive-hunt-probe-agencies-biometric-data-us-9092280/">report</a> in The Indian Express, all central investigation agencies in the country are now doing.

Until the change, standard practice for so-called Red Corner Notice requests was for Interpol to provide authorities with details such as the accused’s name, residence and current location. On Wray’s prompt, agencies can now pull biometric details from India’s national digital ID system, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/

		A team of researchers at BYU have developed a fraud detection keystroke tracking system that correctly identifies when a user types in someone else's information with 95.5 percent accuracy, according to a recent study. Such a system would be able to detect instances of fraud where a bad actor is inputting stolen PII.

The study tested the hypothesis that people develop muscle memory when typing out information that is familiar to them – like their own name and password. Individuals will use quicker, more fluid movements when writing out their own information than someone would when typing out stolen information.
