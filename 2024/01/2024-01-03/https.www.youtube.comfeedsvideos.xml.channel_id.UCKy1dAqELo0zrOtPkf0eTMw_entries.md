Steven Yeun has reportedly dropped out of Marvel Studios upcoming MCU movie, Thunderbolts. This news comes from The Hollywood Reporter, which doesn’t state an explicit reason for the actor departing his suspected role as Sentry in the #ThunderboltsMovie. Interesting thing about it is that he was never actually confirmed officially by Marvel to be featured in the movie. It was mostly rumored, and somewhat confirmed by outside sources. One of those sources being Robert Kirkman, who you might know as the creator of The Walking Dead and Invincible. Steven and Kirkman go way back, to his days of portraying Glen from The Walking Dead and currently the titular character from Invincible. We also have news on the Terrifier 2 producers working on a Mickey Mouse slasher, and Adam Driver’s status in the Star Wars universe. This is your entertainment fix on IGN with Akeem Lawanson.

New student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is welcomed into the top of the social food chain by the elite group of popular girls called “The Plastics,” ruled by the conniving queen bee Regina George (Reneé Rapp) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika). However, when Cady makes the major misstep of falling for Regina’s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), she finds herself prey in Regina’s crosshairs. As Cady sets to take down the group’s apex predator with the help of her outcast friends Janis (Auli’i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she must learn how to stay true to herself while navigating the most cutthroat jungle of all: high school.

Among the many surprises at The Game Awards 2023, we got our first glimpse of Bethesda’s upcoming Blade game. Developed by Arkane Studios Lyon, this third-person action game puts players in the shoes of Marvel’s most iconic vampire hunter. It’s such a natural fit that we can only question why it’s been 20 years since the last Blade game.

The Blade game and the upcoming Blade movie reboot are both coming at a critical time for Marvel, as the company moves forward after a rough 2023 and embraces this iconic vampire hunter as a key part of its future. Is Blade the cure to what ails Marvel these days? It wouldn’t be the first time. Let's take a closer look at how the original Blade movie starring Wesley Snipes saved Marvel at a pivotal time in the company's history, and why the new game and the Mahershala Ali-led movie reboot might just do the same decades later.

In today's Daily Fix:
While Ubisoft's current stance on Star Wars Outlaws' release date is a vague '2024,' Disney may have revealed a more narrow timeframe. On a Disney Parks blog, a release window of 'late 2024' was given, which more or less sounds like the correct timeframe to release the game. However, an official statement from Ubisoft has told IGN that it's still just 2024, it sounds like Ubisoft just wants to play Star Wars Outlaws' release date close to the chest. And speaking of Disney, the Steamboat Willie version of Mickey Mouse has entered the public domain as of January 1st, and of course a ton of horror-related IP starring the black-and-white mouse is already on the horizon. Nightmare Forge Games has announced Infestation: Origins, a four-player survival horror shooter coming to PC. And finally, Square Enix is doubling down on the company's use of artif
