This news comes from The Hollywood Reporter, which doesn\u2019t state an explicit reason for the actor departing his suspected role as Sentry in the #ThunderboltsMovie. Interesting thing about it is that he was never actually confirmed officially by Marvel to be featured in the movie. It was mostly rumored, and somewhat confirmed by outside sources. One of those sources being Robert Kirkman, who you might know as the creator of The Walking Dead and Invincible. Steven and Kirkman go way back, to his days of portraying Glen from The Walking Dead and currently the titular character from Invincible. We also have news on the Terrifier 2 producers working on a Mickey Mouse slasher, and Adam Driver\u2019s status in the Star Wars universe.
