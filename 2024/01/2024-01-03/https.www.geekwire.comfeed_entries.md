Six of the cell-capable satellites were among a batch of 21 Starlink satellites launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California at 7:44 p.m. PT Tuesday. The satellites were deployed successfully, and the rocket&#8217;s first-stage booster made a routine landing on a drone ship in the Pacific Ocean. SpaceX plans to launch hundreds of the upgraded satellites in the months ahead, with the aim of beginning satellite-enabled texting later this year. 4G LTE&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/spacex-first-starlink-satellite-t-mobile-direct-cell/">Read More</a>

Communicate openly and honestly. Maintain capital efficiency with a focus on growth. Those are some of the top tips for founders heading into 2024, according to Seattle-area tech investors we polled. It&#8217;s shaping up to be a unique year in the tech startup world, following a steep decline in venture capital in 2023 as investors tightened their belts and companies curbed costs. However, there are reasons for optimism. The excitement around AI, a strong stock market, and additional talent flooding the market following thousands of layoffs last year could help boost prospects for startup leaders in 2024.

One of PNNL&#8217;s research priorities is to identify and combat complex threats to national security, and AI can help meet that priority by detecting attempts to acquire nuclear weapons or associated technology. Nuclear proliferation detection is one of the potential applications that could get an assist from the Center for AI @PNNL, a newly announced effort to coordinate&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/pacific-northwest-national-lab-chief-scientist-ai-corley/">Read More</a>
