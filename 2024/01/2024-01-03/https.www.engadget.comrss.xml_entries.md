<p>Twitch has revised its nudity policies yet again. The latest change bars streamers from pretending to be “fully or partially nude,” <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/An-Update-to-Our-Attire-Policy?language=en_US">wrote</a> Angela Hession, Twitch’s VP of Trust and Safety, in a blog post.

<p><em>Tetris</em> is one of the most popular and enduring video games of all time, with versions on just about every console, computer and gadget. Many of these iterations have endings baked into story modes and the like, but the original endless mode was considered unbeatable by humans, until now. A 13-year-old boy has become the first person to ‘beat’ the NES version of <em>Tetris,</em> 34 years after it originally released back in 1989, as announced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aGameScout">YouTuber aGameScout.</a></p>
<p>The reason we put ‘beat’ in quotes is due to the nature of the achievement. Oklahoma teenager Willis Gibson, also known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bluescuti1771"><ins>Blue Scuti on YouTube,</ins></a> didn’t access an authorized ending, as there isn’t one. Instead, he played the game so perfectly for so long that it forced a kill screen that crashed the game. These kill screens are usually caused by an overflow error that occurs when you speed th

<p>The <em>Minecraft</em> adaptation has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-27-lego-movie-minecraft-movie.html">in development since 2014</a>.

<p>TLG just announced <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2024/01/lg-unveils-latest-oled-evo-tvs-at-the-forefront-of-innovation-and-evolution/">a new lineup of OLED TVs</a> just days before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-what-we-expect-in-las-vegas-this-year-140040145.html">CES 2024</a> kicks off in Las Vegas next week. The LG Signature OLED M4 and OLED G4 TVs are, surprise, packed with an updated AI processor that offers four times the performance of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-2023-oled-tv-lineup-specs-010035157.html">last year’s models.</a> The Alpha 11 AI processor works to enhance picture and audio quality, offering a 70 percent improvement of visual performance when gaming compared to its predecessor.</p>
<p>The AI chip upscales objects and backgrounds to reduce blur and allegedly analyzes and adjusts colors to “best convey the mood and emotional elements intended by filmmakers.” LG also promises a more “three-dimensional” image, thanks to its proprietary D

<p>Roku is stepping into premium TV territory at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-what-we-expect-in-las-vegas-this-year-140040145.html">CES 2024</a> with its new Pro Series sets, which feature Mini LED backlighting for better brightness and contrast, as well as enhanced audio. The company announced its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-tv-select-premium-televisions-140014570.html">first self-made TVs at CES last year</a> — a surprising move, since it has also partnered with TCL and others for years to build &quot;Roku TVs&quot; powered by the Roku OS. Roku's first batch of TV sets, the Select and Plus models, were clearly value-oriented, with prices ranging from $149 to $999. The Pro Series — which includes 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch models — tops out at $1,500. We expect to see them in person in Las Vegas next week once CES kicks off.</p>
<p>Calling these &quot;high-end&quot; TVs is relative, of course. You can easily spend thousands more for QLED sets from Samsung,

<p>The fitness tracker isn’t dead, and if you’re reading this, you’re probably one of the people keeping these little devices alive. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">Smartwatches</a> like the Apple Watch and the Samsung Galaxy Watch have all but taken over the mainstream wearable space, but the humble fitness tracker remains an option for anyone that's really focused on one thing: accurate workout and daily activity monitoring. Despite the overwhelming popularity of smartwatches, there are still a number of solid fitness bands out there to choose from. We've tested a bunch of the most popular fitness trackers available today to name our top picks.</p>
<h2>What do fitness trackers do best?</h2>
<p>The answer seems simple: Fitness trackers are best at monitoring exercise, be it a 10-minute walk around the block or that half marathon you’ve been diligently training for. Obviously, smartwatches can help you reach your fitness goals too, but there are so

## The Morning After: Samsung schedules its Galaxy S24 event for January 17

<p>Samsung threw a dart at the year’s calendar and chose January 17. Yes, its next Unpacked event is coming earlier this year and will be held at the SAP Center in San Jose. The event, usually held in February, is typically when Samsung reveals its latest array of flagship smartphones. At this point we’ll see the Galaxy S24 – unless the company shakes up the numbering – and I remember the S8!*</p>
<p>This is all broadly unofficial, though. Samsung typically isn’t explicit about what it’ll reveal (unless it’s bantering about foldables “unfolding”). If you’re feeling risky, the company has already started a “pre-reserve” program where you can register your email address to pre-order… something Galaxy flavored.</p>
<p>– Mat Smith</p>
<p>*Yes I know Samsung changed its naming nomenclature to S20 back in 2020, but <em>let me have my fun.</em></p>

<p>Tesla has <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-vehicle-production-deliveries-and-date-financial-results-webcast-fourth-quarter-2023">unveiled</a> its EV delivery and production figures for 2023, and the company had another banner year — but it has Chinese rival BYD close behind. Elon Musk's company produced 1.846 million EVs last year and delivered 1.809 million, besting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-delivers-record-405278-vehicles-during-q4-2022-203616206.html">2022 deliveries</a> by a wide 38 percent. Those figures include 494,989 EVs produced last quarter and 484,507 delivered.</p>
<p>Tesla's originally projected it would sell 2 million vehicles in 2023, but revised that figure downward in its October 2023 earnings call. It did exceed analyst expectations for Q4 2023, though, according to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;fea

<p>In the US, Montana and North Carolina have been leading the list of states with the highest number of <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&amp;geo=US&amp;q=vpn&amp;hl=en">searches for "VPN"</a> over the past few days. That's most likely because their new age verification laws have gone into effect on January 1, and adult websites are now either requiring a copy of visitors' government IDs or have blocked access in the regions altogether. As <a href="https://www.404media.co/north-carolina-montana-pornhub-blocked-vpn/"><em>404Media</em></a> reports, Pornhub has chosen to block people in both states from accessing its website instead of asking for verification. The other websites owned by its parent company Aylo (formerly MindGeek), including Brazzers, Redtube and YouPorn, are also no longer accessible.&nbsp;</p>
