<p>Tetris, one of the most popular and recognizable games of all time, has finally been "beaten." The person to do it more than 30 years after the game's release? 13-year-old Willis Gibson from Oklahoma.</p><p>Gibson uploaded a video of his achievement to YouTube, and it's quite a sight to behold. He is demonstrably overwhelmed with excitement and astonishment. He exclaims, "Oh my god," before saying, "I can't feel my fingers."</p><p>As you can see in the video, Willis reaches level 157 (the video labels it as level 18, though). At this point, the game freezes. Willis reached the "kill screen," which is the point at which Tetris is no longer playable because it was not designed to reach that level. Technically speaking, Tetris is unbeatable because it could theoretically go on forever. But Willis is believed to have just set a world record.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-a-worlds-first-13-year-old-kid-beats-tetris/1100-6520105/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading
