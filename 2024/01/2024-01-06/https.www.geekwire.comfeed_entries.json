The company also reported that it received a notice from Nasdaq about its stock price being below the $1/share minimum requirement for 30 consecutive business days. It has until July 2 to regain compliance. NanoString&#8217;s stock fell sharply in November following a loss in a patent infringement case against 10X Genomics. 10x Genomics accused NanoString of infringing on seven patents related to NanoString\u2019s\u00a0GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler\u00a0that analyzes RNA and protein.
