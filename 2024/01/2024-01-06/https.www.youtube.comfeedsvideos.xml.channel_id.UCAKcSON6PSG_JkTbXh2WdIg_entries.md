Singer-songwriter Amber Bain — known by the musical moniker The Japanese House — released her latest album, "In the End It Always Does," in June 2023. Written at the time of immense change in Bain’s life, including the end of a relationship, the album addresses challenging themes head-on, while also embracing the joy that the love of a dog can bring. 

In this new session, The Japanese House and her band perform tracks from the new album. Afterwards, Bain sits down for a conversation with host Mac Wilson, tracing the origins of the album’s songs, and reveling in their shared love of dogs — dachshunds in particular.

Watch and listen to the entire session above.
