Streetwise underdog Ichiban Kasuga returns as a central protagonist, only this time he\u2019s joined by Kazuma Kiryu, the hard-fisted mainstay of the series up to its seventh iteration. \n\nInfinite Wealth substitutes Japan\u2019s seedy underbelly for the tropical climbs of Hawaii too. With an emotional story the beating heart, and enough side distractions to fill lesser games, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is shaping up to be a massive undertaking, but quite possibly one of the best games of 2024.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKI6GfTInoE", "date_published": "2024-01-06T15:30:21+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/sKI6GfTInoE/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "15 NEW And Upcoming GTA 6 Like Games of 2024 And Beyond", "description": "Grand Theft Auto has proven itself so influential that it\u2019s become a shorthand description for any open world adventure game.
