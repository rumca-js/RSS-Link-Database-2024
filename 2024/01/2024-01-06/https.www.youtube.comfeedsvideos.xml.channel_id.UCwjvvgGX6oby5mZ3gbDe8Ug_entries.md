This fire makes one feel like the End Days are upon us. A huge fireball erupted from a three-story warehouse into the sky, reddening the entire sky and visible from a distance. It feels apocalyptic. The temperature at the scene was at least 30 to 40 degrees Celsius or 86°F-104°F, making it hard to get close.
