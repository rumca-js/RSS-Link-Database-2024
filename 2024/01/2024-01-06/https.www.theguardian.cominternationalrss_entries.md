Indeed, he spoke of the journey Farrell et al had been on at Saracens over the past decade. “I remember presenting to the board in 2015,” he said, “and we had Ernst Joubert and a gang of people who were leaving the club that year. We looked at this new generation who were going to come through and hopefully grab hold of the club. And they did. And that’s eight years ago. They’ve had a hell of a journey, and we’ve had a hell of a journey, but I

<p>For a long time, the actor was the most visible lesbian in Hollywood (not that she really wanted to talk about it). Now the True Detective star feels liberated – and is helping the younger generation follow suit</p><p>It is roughly 58 years since Jodie Foster’s first acting role and there are things she won’t put up with on set. She won’t be told how to get into character. She won’t tolerate what she calls “­voodoo” directing, that is am-dram, shake-your-body-out ­nonsense. She won’t respond to certain types of “alpha” interference from people up the industry chain. (The only time Foster submits to bossy producers, she says, is when they are “super passive-aggressive ­British ­people” – a type she just can’t resist.) In work mode, and outside interactions with the press, she is ­conscientious, matter-of-fact, with almost no performance anxiety or self-consciousness. “I approach a story or character in the same way I do a book report,” she says. “I like to make it pragmatic.”</p><p

<p>Though January may be a time for inner cleanliness, it’s only right to allow yourself one dirty little pleasure. Netflix is here to help – and some of these contestants are going straight to hell</p><p>There is something about January, is there not? You put a handful of parsley in a smoothie, you do more bending and stretching and running than usual, you eat lean proteins and complicated grains, you drink gallons of water, you begin to glow from the inside out. And – and this is a crucial step to the whole process! – you watch an evil little reality show from start to finish, crunched into such a short period of time that it feels like you are gasping for air.

Lean and bespectacled, known for his expensive suits, he was an unlikely spokesperson for American machismo. But the National Rifle Association leader’s willingness to defend Americans’ access to guns, no matter the cost, made him a powerful rightwing figure, whose relentless, paranoid rhetoric made him an important precursor, and then ally, of Donald Trump.</p><p>Today, LaPierre is facing a reckoning: he is expected to testify in a civil corruption case in Manhattan that will scrutinize allegations that he and other senior executives misused NRA donors’ funds, squandering millions of dollars on lavish personal trips and expenses, and treating the NRA as his own “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/07/nra-lawsuit-new-york-attorney-general-wayne-lapierre">personal piggy bank</a>”.</p> <a hre
