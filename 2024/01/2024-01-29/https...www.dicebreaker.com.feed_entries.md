Mythic Games undertook a restructure in December 2022, significantly reducing their staff and shrinking their portfolio to three main projects - the <a h

The news that the European leg of the Warhammer painting contest will make its way to Germany in October suggests a possible relocation from its longstanding home in the UK.</p><p>Golden Demon is hosted by Warhammer maker Games Workshop, which last year held the UK competition <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/events/warhammer-fest-2023/opinion/warhammer-fest-2023-event-report-loving-but-lacklustre">during its own Warhammer Fest celebration in May</a>, having held it as a separate event at Warhammer World in 2022 after a three-year break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A separate US painting contest is held at AdeptiCon, to whic

Time Tails is a delightful-looking RPG about hopping through history as a party of cats. More Bob &amp; Tom than Bill &amp; Ted, if you will.</p><p>Time Tails takes inspiration from the likes of Doctor Who, the Bill &amp; Ted series and Back to the Future in its eighties-inspired artwork and atmosphere, with players creating characters from ten classes spread across time and space to equip with magical items - yes, a Sonic Screwdriver is here - and straight-up spells, known as Powers that Alter Time (PATs) in the RPG&rsquo;s lingo and powered by Chrono Crystals.</p><p>The party of time-travellers can explore a variety of dif

Both games use boards that feature a grid of ethernet ports - the same as you might use to plug your computer into the internet, or to hook up a LAN server to banks of local PCs if you misspent your youth hosting Counter-Strike 1.6 parties using borrowed school IT hardware. For a non-specific example. Ahem.</p><p>Players will be plugging their ethernet cables - which are included with the game, but you could always use your own if you prefer - into those ports. The when, how and why depends on
