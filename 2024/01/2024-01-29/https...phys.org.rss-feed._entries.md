Global tree-planting campaigns have reached fad-like proportions over the past decade, and it's easy to understand their appeal. Healthy forests help in the fight against climate change by absorbing some of our excess carbon dioxide emissions, and they can provide wildlife habitat and quality-of-life benefits for local human communities too. So why not plant more trees? It seems like an easy win.

Oxygen is an essential element for survival. Ocean warming, circadian rhythm, eutrophication, high-density aquaculture, power failures and long-distance live animal transportation can all lead to low oxygen levels in water. This reduction in oxygen can affect the health of aquatic animals, potentially leading to consequent ecological damage or economic loss.

Wood quality is primarily determined by the properties of its secondary cell wall (SCW). Gaining insight into the molecular processes governing SCW development is crucial for the genetic enhancement of wood quality. Although it's established that a multilayered gene regulatory network, operating at the transcriptional level, orchestrates SCW development, our grasp of its response to environmental fluctuations, and the resultant diverse SCW structure, is incomplete.

Organic compounds in the field of chemistry range from simple hydrocarbons to complex molecules, with diverse functional groups added to the main carbon backbone. These functional groups impart distinct chemical properties to the compounds and participate in various chemical transformations, making them important precursors for the synthesis of more diverse compounds. Scientists have, therefore, actively engaged in creating molecules that feature novel and highly reactive functional groups.

How individual animals respond to climate change is key to whether populations will persist or go extinct. Many species are shifting their ranges as the environment warms, but up to now the mechanisms underlying this have been unclear. For Europe's most endangered seabird, the Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus), new research has revealed that individual behavioral flexibility and not evolutionary selection is driving this species' rapid migratory range shift.

With the upgraded GRAVITY-instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer of the European Southern Observatory, a team of astronomers led by the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics has determined the mass of a black hole in a galaxy only 2 billion years after the Big Bang. With 300 million solar masses, the black hole is actually under-massive compared to the mass of its host galaxy. Researchers suspect what is happening here.

In the beginning, the universe was so hot and so dense that light could not travel far. Photons were emitted, scattered, and absorbed as quickly as the photons in the heart of the brightest stars. But in time the cosmos expanded and cooled to the point that it became transparent, and the birthglow of the Big Bang could traverse space and time for billions of years.

The need to understand how to encourage people to adopt more climate-friendly behaviors is pressing, but "nudging" people to adopt behaviors such as recycling, taking public transport, and reducing their consumption of energy and water, is notoriously difficult. For example, the Behavioral Insights Team failed to find an effect of an advice and support campaign on energy consumption and interventions to reduce single-occupancy cars, and more recently found that the most successful arm of a large trial to reduce household water consumption only reduced it by 0.5%.

Similar to the way expanding companies increase their work forces, cells must boost their production of internal biomolecules when they grow in size in order to stay healthy. In the 1970s, biologists showed that this scaled-up biosynthesis hinges on faster rates of transcription—the process where genetic blueprints in DNA are copied over to RNA molecules. Yet in the half-century since, the mechanism behind the expedited transcription rates has remained unclear.

Scientists from Tokyo Metropolitan University have been studying the strength and toughness of sand columns made of a mixture of sticky and non-sticky grains. They have uncovered the mechanism behind how the strength changes as grains are mixed in different ratios, and how a mixture can help keep the column more resilient to deformation. Non-sticky grains are also easily replaceable with other materials, enabling the design of stronger, tougher, functional matter.
