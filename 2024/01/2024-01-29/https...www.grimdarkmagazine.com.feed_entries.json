Bluntly, whether you enjoy this movie will probably be decided purely on whether the prospect of Nicholas Cage as Dracula intrigues you. If you like the prospect of Nicholas Cage as the Prince of Darkness, know that he could have played the role in a subdued as well as dignified fashion. Nicholas Cage did not do this. Instead, he went the full Cage and everything enjoyable about this movie can directly be related to him going the full Cage. This is funny because Nicholas Cage is not the star. Allegedly. In fact, as the title implies, this is, technically, Renfield\u2019s (Nicholas Hoult) story. The movie is an unofficial sequel to the 1931 Universal Horror movie version of Dracula and even has CGI-ed footage inserting both Cage as well as Hoult. Here, Dracula survived or came back from the dead and has been carrying on with Renfield for the past century.
