<p>Bill to create panel with power to remove prosecutors accused of misconduct passes state house amid allegations against Fani Willis</p><p>Georgia legislators in the state house passed a bill on Monday to revive a panel that can punish or remove elected prosecutors, potentially adding to career headaches for the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis.</p><p>When creating the first version of the Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission last year, lawmakers cited the inaction of prosecutors in the Ahmaud Arbery murder case as its basis. They also referred to a decision made by the Athens-Clarke county district attorney to forgo charges on minor drug possession cases as an impetus for the law.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/29/georgia-bill-trump-prosecutor-fani-willis-removal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘We’d get big, rugby-playing men coming up to us in tears and saying “I miss my dad” – or “I love my dad and I’ve never told him”’</p><p>John and I started writing songs together when we were 13. After we finished at university, we both moved back in with our parents in the Midlands and started writing an album. One day I went downstairs and my dad was cooking. I said: “What should I write a song about?” And he was like: “I don’t know. Diggers.” He drove a Massey Ferguson digger in his own father’s groundworks company and would pick me up from school in it straight from a job. One kid a couple of years older than me at school would often pummel me, and my dad always felt so warm, loving and safe by contrast. The two worlds were a massive juxtaposition. I went upstairs and 90 minutes later more or less had the song exactly as it was recorded.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/jan/29/ed-sheeran-work-experience-drank-beer-nizlopi-jcb-song">Continue reading

He himself was a fine old fellow, a big, muscular black-and-white thing who looked like he had got into a fair amount of fights as a younger cat.

<p>As rightwing ‘chaos campaigns’ target schools across the country, queer Armenians are once again fighting for acceptance</p><p></p><p>On a gray afternoon last June, the school board in Glendale, California, was preparing to make what was once a routine vote to honor June as LGBTQ+ pride month.</p><p>School board meetings used to be pretty placid affairs. This year, however, cops in riot gear surrounded the building and helicopters hovered overhead. As Erik Adamian, an alum of the school district, waited in line to get inside the meeting, he heard demonstrators shout: “You are all a bunch of pedophiles!” “Stop grooming our kids!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/29/los-angeles-lgbtq-glendale-armenian">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My wife once pointed out that my white shirts were grey. Now, the way I dress brings joy – to me and to other people</p><p>A year or so ago, I was about to go out to a drinks party with my wife, when she said: “You do realise that shirt’s dead, don’t you?” I was wearing a clean, ironed number, I pointed out. But my wife explained that death was a syndrome particularly likely to affect white shirts, as she took me to my wardrobe and showed me that all but one of my four white shirts had irreversibly lost their snowy glow. “<em>Look</em> at them,” she urged. “They’re <em>grey</em>. You might as well chuck them out.”</p><p>I was, at the time, approaching 60, and my wife’s shirt critique felt particularly pertinent in that context. Mindful of the looming milestone, she had been proposing a series of prescriptions for me, including not drinking four glasses of wine every day, doing pilates and resuming learning French (which I had given up in protest against reflexive verbs).

<p>Trudging around the park can feel like a waste of time and energy. But what if the next time you laced up your shoes it was to put food on people’s tables or help preserve the environment?</p><p>It is a cold, dark winter evening – the kind of night that can have even diehard runners struggling to find the motivation to venture out. But there will be none of the usual “shall-I-shan’t-I?” dialogue going on in Sarah Donaghy’s head, because tonight is&nbsp;<a href="https://runr.co.uk/pages/foodbankrun">Food Bank Run</a>.</p><p>Donaghy, a teacher and the welfare officer for <a href="https://farehamrunningclub.com/">Fareham running club</a> in Hampshire, organised the first Food Bank Run in February 2018, along with the club secretary, James Musselwhite. “The idea was that, instead of our usual training run, we’d fill backpacks with food to donate to the local food bank and run there, where volunteers would be waiting to receive it,” she says. Donaghy was expecting about 20 memb

<p>Robust condemnation of toxic NSN extremism is heartening. But the broad powers police rely on should give us pause</p><p>Political condemnation of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Network who attempted to rally three times in Sydney at the weekend was appropriate.</p><p>But other elements of the New South Wales government’s response – with the premier, Chris Minns, proposing new laws after the NSN’s rally was pre-empted by police using their existing, arguably overbroad powers of arrest – may not make for a lasting solution.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/29/sydney-neo-nazi-rally-attempt-australia-day-comment">Continue reading...</a>
