This game, whatever similarities it may have [&#8230;]

Despite all evidence to the contrary, law enforcement officials continue to pretend being in the same room as dread drug fentanyl is enough to hospitalize officers, if not actually kill them. This myth has been irresponsibly perpetrated by a number of law enforcement agencies. To date, not a single case of contact overdose has been [&#8230;]

The Supreme Court is about to review Texas’ HB20 law, that (among other unworkable things) says that websites cannot moderate based on “viewpoint.” Of course, websites don’t moderate based on viewpoint, but rather whether or not they think you’ve violated their rules/terms of service. Should the law be allowed to go into effect, it’s not [&#8230;]

Bypassing restraints enacted by the Supreme Court, federal agencies (along with local law enforcement agencies) are hoovering up whatever domestic data they can from private companies all too happy to be part of the problem. Sure, the government can pretend [&#8230;]

Over and over again, we see politicians browbeat companies until they agree to support terrible legislation.
