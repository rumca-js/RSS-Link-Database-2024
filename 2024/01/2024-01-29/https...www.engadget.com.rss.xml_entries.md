<p>California will float a pair of bills designed to protect children from social media addiction and preserve their private data. The Protecting Youth from Social Media Addiction Act (SB 976) and California Children’s Data Privacy Act (AB 1949) were <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-assemblymember-wicks-senator-skinner-introduce">introduced</a> Monday by the state’s Attorney General Rob Bonta, State Senator Nancy Skinner and Assemblymember Buffy Wicks. The proposed legislation follows a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-ab-2273-children-social-media-230652145.html">CA child safety bill</a> that was set to go into effect this year but is now <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/19/california_kids_privacy_law_blocked/">on hold</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/japan/"><ins>Japan</ins></a> is an innovative country that leads the way on many technological fronts. But the wheels of bureaucracy often turn incredibly slowly there. So much so, that the government still requires businesses to provide information on floppy disks and CD-ROMs when they submit certain official documents.</p>
<p>That's starting to change. Back in 2022, Minister of Digital Affairs Taro Kono urged various branches of the government to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/japan-digital-minister-no-more-floppy-disks-fax-machines-123207491.html"><ins>stop requiring businesses to submit information on outdated forms of physical media.</ins></a> The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) is one of the first to make the switch. &quot;Under the current law, there are many provisions stipulating the use of specific recording media such as floppy disks regarding application and notification methods,&quot; METI said last week,

<p>To that end, Sony says two of the games profiled will be <em>Stellar Blade</em> and <em>Rise of the Ronin. Stellar Blade,</em> formerly called Project Eve, has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/project-eve-stellar-blade-release-date-143421300.html"><ins>on our radar for a while,</ins></a> and it’s been around 18 months since we got an update.

<p>Meta is teaming up with the Center for Open Science (COS) to <a href="https://www.cos.io/about/news/meta-partners-with-cos-to-share-data-to-study-well-being-topics"><ins>start a pilot program that studies</ins></a> “topics related to well-being.” It looks like the program will dive into our social media data, but on a voluntary basis, as COS says it will use a “privacy-preserving” dataset provided by Meta for the study. The agency says the study should help people understand “how different factors may or may not impact well-being and inform productive conversations about how to help people thrive.”</p>
<p>The specifics of the study remain opaque, but COS says it’ll use “new types of research processes” like pre-registration and early peer review. That last one is important, as it sends proposed research questions to peer review before being issued to study participants. This should help stave off bias and ensure the questions are actually useful. The agency also says that

<p><em>Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore</em> is getting a controller worthy of its inspiration — for better or worse. The <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.seedyeyesoftware.com/games/arzette-the-jewel-of-faramore">upcoming game</a>, a spiritual successor to the infamous 1993 Zelda titles for the Philips CD-i, will launch with a limited edition controller that resembles one of the largely forgotten system’s original remotes.</p>
<p>Developer Seedy Eye Software (a homophone for “CD-i software”) says using the controller on “Classic Controls” mode will let you “play Arzette, as it might have played back in 1993.” That’s when the title’s inspirations —&nbsp;<em>Link: The Faces of Evil</em> and <em>Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon</em> — arrived for Philips’ (brief) stab at a game-changing home entertainment system. (A third title in the series, <em>Zelda’s Adventure</em>, launched in 1994 with a top-down view, and Philips discontinued the system four years later.)</p>

We’ve all heard of game-breaking bugs, but this may be the first game-beating bug. Obviously, players want more than three minutes of playtime out of their $70 purchase.</p>
<p>The issue immediately locks players out of all story missions, including tutorials, in a race to reach the end credits. This also makes it impossible to receive trophies and achievements, though most purchasers will probably get hung up on the whole “the game is basically unplayable” aspect. Still, if you’re looking for the easy mode to beat all easy modes, this is it. We could have used this bug for

The Browser Company announced a beta of its Windows version <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ultra-customizable-arc-browser-is-now-available-on-windows-in-beta-200039901.html?guccounter=1">last month</a>, and today they're bringing the Arc experience to the iPhone <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://arc.net/blog/arc-search">with Arc Search</a>. As the name implies, the new app is focused on searching — when you open the app, you're met with a keyboard and search field, not your usual collection of tabs. And rather than just serving up simple search results from Google or your engine of choice, Arc scans the internet for various sources and creates a "page for me" that pulls together a bunch of info on your desired query.</p>

<p>Japan's lunar lander has regained power a full nine days after it landed on the moon's surface <a href="https://www.engadget.com/japans-slim-lunar-spacecraft-landed-upside-down-on-the-moon-202819728.html">nearly upside down</a> and was subsequently switched off, JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) <a href="https://twitter.com/SLIM_JAXA/status/1751766255810556340">announced</a>. A change in the sun's position allowed the solar panels to receive light and charge the probe's battery, allowing JAXA to re-establish communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things were looking dire shortly after the SLIM (Smart Lander for Investigating Moon) touched down. The agency immediately noticed a problem with power generation, but was able to launch a pair of probes onto the moon's surface. The Lunar Excursion Vehicle 2 (LEV-2) snapped an incredible photo of SLIM, showing it to be upside down with its panels pointing away from the sun. The cause was found to be a malfunction of the main engine.<

<p>As generative AI (and access to AI tools) continues to grow, expect to see more things like the tumult over “George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead.” Released on (then pulled from) YouTube, it’s framed as an hour of new “material” by the comedian, who died in 2008. Of course, it's not that.
