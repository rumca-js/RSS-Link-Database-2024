		Data leaks and identity theft have seen a record rise throughout 2023. The same trend may continue this year with several high-profile breaches hitting headlines in January. This includes the “mother of all breaches,” which hit platforms such as LinkedIn, Dropbox and Twitter, as well as a database of COVID-19 testing records.
<h2>ITRC: Identity verification can reduce crime</h2>
In the U.S., the number of data compromises during 2023 rose 78 percent compared to the previous year, reaching more than 3,200 incidents. The figure represents a new record, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), a nonprofit focused on victims of identity crime.

		Biometric POS terminals will handle 46 billion retail transactions globally by 2028, more than doubling transactions registered last year, according to a new market analysis. Last year’s total was 19.5 transactions.

Juniper Research <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/research/fintech-payments/fraud-identity/biometric-in-store-payments-market/">says</a>, in fact, that biometric terminals “are reviving retail.” Even if the market for the devices had not been soft for the last few years, the increases predicted by the analyst firm are notable.

		Fujitsu facial scanners will be used to perform age verification in UK supermarkets, despite the company’s involvement in a major IT <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/post-office-horizon-explainer-why-is-everyone-talking-about-the-scandal-1.2019207">accounting scandal</a> that saw hundreds of UK Post Office employees wrongly prosecuted for financial shortfalls caused by its point-of-sale system. The move illustrates the pervasive mood in the age verification space, in which new AI-powered biometric digital identity tools from Liquid, Bouncer Digital and ITL are driving implementation across industries and use cases, even as risks persist.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/smart-engines">Smart Engines</a> has upgraded its AI document analysis to enable the verification of holograms for forged document detection.

Holograms and other optical variable devices change their appearance based on variables like viewing angle or lighting. As such, their genuine presence cannot be confirmed through a single photograph, the company notes in its announcement.

Smart Engines says its software can extract data from ID cards and passports and verify their authenticity in seconds, and that is one of few offerings on the market that can perform document verification in real-time video streams.

The technology behind the proprietary document analysis method was patented w

		Tools for Humanity is updating the marketing of its Orb iris scanner. The five-pound chrome eyeball is being changed to make it look less intimidating.

In an interview with TechCrunch last week, Alex Blania, CEO of the company doing business as cryptocurrency firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a>, reportedly said new Orbs will look more like “an Apple product.” That probably doesn’t mean that each subsequent model’s chief new feature will be alternating large and small form factors.

		A committee in the U.S. state of New Jersey has sent a mobile driver’s license bill on to the full Senate for debate.

		The legal basis for police deployments of live facial recognition is being questioned by the Justice and Home Affairs Committee of the UK House of Lords.

A letter from the committee to Home Secretary James Cleverly calls for the public to be made aware of the potential for police forces to use live facial recognition surveillance over wide areas and large populations, and for scrutiny of the lack of regulation by Parliament.

The JHAC wrote to the government in March, 2022 with findings and recommendations from its investigation into police use of real-time facial recognition, highlighting a lack of strategy, transparency and accountability.

		<a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/96884-govt-confirms-introducing-expiry-dates-ids-here-are-changes">Kenyans</a>, a local news portal has cited a government official as confirming that new national ID cards to be issued by the Department of Immigration will henceforth expire after every ten years.

The unnamed official, working in the Ministry of Interior, is reported to have told the publication that the ID-issuing authority has configured the microchip to be embedded in the card to have a validity period of a decade from the date of issue.

The government source is further quoted as clarifying that the ID card expiration date plan has nothing to do with revenue generation as some citizens have claimed. It should be said that lately, there have been opinions shared

		Along the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean in southwestern Cameroon lies an oil-rich peninsular called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakassi">Bakassi</a>, a territory full of history. Once controlled by Nigeria for dozens of years, the disputed area is now under the control of the Cameroonian government. Most of its residents still lack legal ID.

The dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria over Bakassi, which saw bloodshed in some border communities in the 1980s and 1990s, was eventually settled following an <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/94/13803.pdf">October 10, 2002 ruling</a> by the International Court of Justice (ICJ).

		Poor Indians living in the Dharavi slum in Mumbai for the past 24 years will next month be biometrically registered for a housing redevelopment project.

According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/adani-start-data-collection-mumbai-slum-redevelopment-february-2024-01-26/">Reuters</a>, the registration is part of a survey to identify those who’ll be given new houses in the redeveloped area, as well as those to be relocated to other settlements.

The exercise, to be conducted by Indian commodity trading business <a href="https://www.adani.com/">Adani Group</a>, in collaboration with the state government of Maharashtra, comes after many years of failed efforts by authorities to redevelop the settlement which spans over 250 hectares.
