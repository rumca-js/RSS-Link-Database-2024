The Polish pianist and composer blurs the lines of ambient, classical and house \u2014 submerged beats pulse under ripples of piano, synths and her delicate voice. She regularly performs in concert halls across Europe, but during an American tour she brought the cinematic, yet intimate songs of her album Ghosts to the Tiny Desk. \n\nRani is conservatory trained, but like so many post-classical artists working right now, brings her own influences to centuries-old tradition. The way her fingers chromatically surge in a cascade of color suggest the later compositions of Mozart \u2014 somehow lush and sublime in their tension, on the brink of something different. But there\u2019s also a restlessness in how Rani, accompanied by Ziemowit Klimek on upright bass and synth, bounces between the piano and synths with ease and often within the same song. She is a wonder to watch. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cThin Line\u201d\n\u201cMoans ", "bookmarked": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "user": null, "comments": [], "language": null, "source_obj__id": 186, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcKtr5bGa4", "permanent": false, "page_rating_votes": 0, "artist": "NPR Music"}]
