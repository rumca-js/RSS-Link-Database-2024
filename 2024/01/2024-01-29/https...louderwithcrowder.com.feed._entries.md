<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=51214520&amp;width=980" /><br /><br /><p>A man with a history of violence tried to kidnap a poor girl who was walking to school. Thankfully, she got away from the evil predator. I would say “alleged” predator due to the fact he has yet to be convicted of this crime, but he was already found guilty of stabbing his mother in the neck. Therefore, he is already a predator and thus, the shoe fits. </p><p>That said, I have no idea why this man was set free by the “justice system” to once again commit atrocities in society, but he was. And to no surprise, he tried to harm an innocent person, except this time he went even further and tried to do unspecified evil acts to a child. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=51213859&amp;width=980" /><br /><br /><p>The left is constantly trying to redefine words to support their degenerate agenda. They do this because they have no way to condone their ideology without sounding like a bunch of deranged creeps. And Planned Parenthood is arguably the most guilty of this. </p><p>Planned Parenthood's new campaign is claiming that virginity is a "social construct" and the definition of “sex” is ambiguous; anyone can define it however they may please. </p><p>And the worst part about all of this is that not only is it degenerate and all lies, but it targets children. This ad campaign is meant for minors. There is no way to deny that. The morbidly obese woman is standing in a classroom in the video. It is meant for people young enough to not know what the word “virginity” is. Which is very, very young. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

	Pride comes before the fall. And <a href="https://www.met.police.uk/police-forces/metropolitan-police/areas/c/careers/police-volunteer-roles/special-constable/special-constable-overview/#:~:text=Special%20constables%20are%20volunteer%20police,giving%20back%20to%20the%20community." target="_blank">according </a>to the Metropolitan Police in the UK, volunteer police officers "will get a tremendous amount of pride" from "investing their free time." So it is no surprise that a volunteer police officer joyfully told a Christian singer that she was not allowed to sing church songs in public, and then disgustingly stuck her tongue out.

	And as much as the government would love to make that one day illegal, it appears the wannabe cop was mistaken. You do have freedom of religion in the U.K., at least somewhat.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class

Typically, that is through the implementation of degenerate policies that de facto cause destruction. And we all know there is no perfect example for that than San Francisco itself. What was once considered the Paris of the West has turned into a zombie apocalypse that the third world could not even dream of. And unfortunately, innocent residents are the ones to succumb to these policies by the very people meant to represent them. </p><p>San Francisco's oldest toy store, which is also known for inspiring Pixar’s “Toy Story”, is permanently closing. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

	News shocked both the political world AND the culture on Sunday. Snoop Dogg announces his support of Donald Trump. Well, kinda. There was one sentence in an interview in a UK newspaper, and the Internets are doing Internets things.
</p><p>
	The Sunday Times ran an interview with the D-O-Double-G titled <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/snoop-dogg-i-have-nothing-but-love-and-respect-for-donald-trump-k60k99phr" target="_blank">"</a><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/snoop-dogg-i-have-nothing-but-love-and-respect-for-donald-trump-k60k99phr">Snoop Dogg: ‘I have nothing but love and respect for Donald Trump’."</a> This one paragraph is the entirety of where Trump was mentioned by Snoop. One sentence.</p><blockquote>

## Kristi Noem, potential Trump VP, SLAYS CNN's feeble attempts to shill for Biden's border bill: "What has he done?"
