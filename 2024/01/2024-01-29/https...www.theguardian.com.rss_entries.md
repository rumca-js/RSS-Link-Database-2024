<p>The deaths of three US soldiers in Jordan this weekend will prompt retaliation.

Contradictory, antithetical, incompatible: Richter swerves from one way of working to another, in <a href="https://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions/2024/gerhard-richter">an exhibition that fills two floors of David Zwirner in London</a>.

But much of what she made ended up going to car mechanics as the small SUV kept breaking down.

<p>As she turns 75 and celebrates 60 years in showbiz, the Scottish singer, actor and TV presenter will take on your questions</p><p>Lulu has reached a milestone few musicians can claim: the 60th anniversary of her performing career. To mark it she’s going out on tour, and taking on your questions. Born Marie McDonald McLaughlin Lawrie, Lulu vaulted up the rungs of a singing career: professional at 12, signed at 14, and a Top 10 hit at 15 – namely her <a href="https://youtu.be/uSrBjHTCMFY">raucous version of the Isley Brothers’ Shout</a>. And she was still in her teens when she had her first US No 1, the theme song to the 1967 film To Sir, With Love – which she also acted in – and when she became the first British female singer to perform behind the iron curtain, touring Poland with the Hollies.</p><p>She extended her multi-hyphenate talent into being a TV host, with the likes of Jimi Hendrix passing through the studio, and won the Eurovision song contest in 1969 with Boom Ba

<p>We like to pretend that momentous events have big causes, but science says otherwise</p><p>When we contemplate travelling back in time, we’re always given the same warning: be sure not to touch <em>anything</em>. Even one squished bug could irrevocably change the future. You might even write yourself out of existence. Why, then, don’t we think like that about the present? If every tiny change from the past creates our present, then <em>every</em> aspect of our present creates our future, too.</p><p>Chaos theory is a definitively established scientific truth about how complex systems are sensitive to tiny changes – that small flukes can have enormous effects. It’s not really a theory; it’s been proved over and over again. It’s why we can’t predict the weather more than a week in advance. If our calculations are off by even a tiny amount, all bets are off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/29/the-big-idea-what-if-every-little-thing-you-do-changes-histor

<p>Bristol City suffer what could be a defining defeat, while at the top Arsenal and Manchester City keep in touch with Chelsea</p><p>“Ten cup finals” – that’s how Lauren Smith described her Bristol City side’s run-in as they fight for their WSL future. A 2-1 defeat at home to relegation rivals West Ham worsened the Robins’ plight as the visitors opened up a three-point cushion over the bottom-placed team. City have shown plenty of character and desire this season but remain with just one win to their name. All too often errors and a lack of concentration have cost them dearly. On Sunday, this was illustrated by the visitors’ first goal that came against the run of play. City dealt with the initial delivery but were slow to react to the second phase allowing Honoka Hayashi space to convert. Despite finding a way back into the game, they were then sliced open on the counterattack by Viviane Asseyi for the eventual winner. “Ultimately it’s been a very physical game,” Smith said

Right now, I ask myself whether people around the world witnessing and watching our misery have reached the stage where they think of us as merely news instead of children with dreams for the future; mothers and fathers who wanted a better life for their kids; teachers who wanted to inspire the coming generations; and workers and farmers and musicians who wanted to follow their passion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/29/gaza-diary-part-43-do-people-around-the-world-think-of-us-as-merely-news">

<p>A punchy vegetables and bean dip served with radicchio in an anchovy dressing, and crisp fried bread for dunking</p><p><strong><br /></strong>It is maybe the most frustrating utensil in the kitchen. Awkward to hang and too big to put in the spoon jug; it won’t sit in any of the piles of bowls and pans, but it is too important to put away. What’s more, it’s annoying to wash, dry and fit together and, invariably, three days later I notice that there is some dried tomato skin stuck on the base. Despite all this, I love my food mill with a passion.</p><p>Now, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Victor. While Jean Mantelet did patent his <em>moulinette presse-légumes</em> in 1932, which went on to sell by the million and make mouli a proprietary eponym, it turns out that an inventive Belgian called Victor Simon patented his very clever <em>passe vite </em>(pass quickly) four years earlier, in 1928, having designed it to aid his wife in making soups and purees.

He had watched his team concede five at home for the first time in more than 60 years, falling to a defeat against Villarreal which he called a portrait of their season, self-inflicted and absurd. Immediately after it finished, he had gone on TV and said he felt like he had been hit by a sledgehammer, his task now to lift footballers feeling low; and then, while those he sees as his executioners waited in the Montjuïc press room, he had disappeared.</p><p>Half an hour passed, an hour, an hour and a half.

<p>Stanley Kubrick’s sharp and persuasive comedy about nuclear war remains a hilarious act of provocation</p><p>Sixty years ago, Columbia Pictures released the first of two black-and-white movies with the exact same premise: what if American planes with hydrogen bombs were inadvertently ordered to drop their payload on targets in the Soviet Union, potentially triggering an all-out nuclear war that wipe out humanity? The Cuban missile crisis had pushed the superpowers to the brink of conflict less than two years earlier, and film-makers were unusually eager to face their cold war nightmares head on.</p><p>The release dates were like a reversal of Karl Marx’s famous line about how history repeats itself, “first as a tragedy, second as a farce”.

<p><strong>Barbican, London</strong><br />Antonio Pappano conducted the London Symphony Orchestra, Chorus and an excellent lineup of soloists in this superbly detailed and rousing performance</p><p>There are moments in Mendelssohn’s Elijah when the chorus roars suddenly into life, an explosion of massed voices. There are others when a single child’s voice is the counterbalance for the heft of a baritone and orchestra. Or when the whole musical apparatus stops dead as the chorus waits for a divine voice that never comes. Mendelssohn’s oratorio is based on a Bible story – but it’s also unmistakably a piece about the power of sound.</p><p>Like Elijah’s 1846 world premiere in Birmingham Town Hall, this was a performance without the acoustic plug-in of a cathedral’s vaulted roof. But the stage was stuffed (even more so than the sold-out auditorium) and the opening brass chords immediately set the tone: big, bold, expensively burnished. Not a period instrument in sight, of course,

<p>The Italian and Carlos Alcaraz will be the focal points of the sport in the coming years and will battle many times for the biggest titles</p><p>As recently as Wimbledon last year, six months ago, Jannik Sinner was simply not ready. As the Italian reached his first grand slam semi-final and sized up the challenge of facing Novak Djokovic, Sinner was unable to find his best form under the significant pressure. One of the most memorable aspects of his three-set loss was the groans of the Centre Court crowd as he continually fired errors in the third set tie-break.</p><p>Even for the special, precocious players who quickly rise to the top, success is a long process. For Sinner, his growth has been clear and easy to follow: he reconfigured his team, hiring Simone Vagnozzi and the famed Australian coach Darren Cahill, he changed his service motion and he began to embrace the biggest moments instead of cowering from them. He has taken numerous tough losses, but he handled his di

<p>The latest instalment in Abouet’s brilliantly illustrated series about the lives of three friends in Abidjan is as funny and sharp as ever</p><p>The <em>Aya</em> story began two decades ago, when Marguerite Abouet, a Parisian legal assistant with roots in Ivory Coast, got together with Clément Oubrerie, an animator and children’s book illustrator, to produce a graphic novel inspired by her African childhood. That book eventually became a bestselling series, one loved and acclaimed for its vivid portrayal of life in Ivory Coast in the 1970s, a period during which the country experienced an economic boom. Since translated into 15 languages, it made both Abouet and her creation, Aya, comics superstars.</p><p>And now they’re back. Twelve years after the last book was published, Abouet and Oubrerie have returned with <em>Aya: Claws Come Out</em>, in which our heroine and her crowd are now well on their way to adulthood. And the good news is that their adventures are as bewitchi

Yuzuru Tachikawa’s Blue Giant certainly begs to differ. Following three 18-year-old boys who doggedly pursue their musical dreams, the film hits the familiar beats of the coming-of-age anime, yet it also deviates from the format in interesting ways. There are trials and tribulations, quarrels and reconciliation, but what makes Blue Giant really shine is its masterly rendering of the physical ecstasy that emanates from live performance.</p><p>Jass, the band at the film’s centre, represents three different approaches to making music.

<p>George Elokobi inspires Maidstone while Tottenham’s forwards fail to fire in loss against Manchester City</p><p>Eight of the 20-man squad selected by Jürgen Klopp against Norwich were graduates of Liverpool’s academy. One of those, James McConnell, was making his first start for the senior team. The 19-year-old from Newcastle slotted in front of the defence, sitting behind Curtis Jones and Ryan Gravenberch. While progressing through the academy, having joined aged 15 from Sunderland, McConnell was a more attacking midfielder and his eye for an assist could be seen when he saw Jones in space at the back post and chipped the perfect cross for his colleague to head home the opener. Like Alexis Mac Allister, McConnell is not a traditional No 6 in the role of defensive midfielder but Klopp offers plenty of freedom to his players. The German earmarked McConnell for the role in pre-season and he has lived up to his manager’s expectations. There is plenty of competition in midfiel

<p>Got a beauty dilemma? Our expert is here to offer advice. This week, is a dry run the answer to Alex’s anxieties about getting inked?</p><p>They say you should never answer a question with a question; but if you think you’d regret it, why get a tattoo? I started getting tattooed at 18; some were impulsive decisions, others considered, but all of them have created a body tapestry that I have no regrets about. That’s because I had reasons for all of them (often to mark a milestone), so they’re not fashion-led, which is key if you’re prone to regret.</p><p>We live in a culture where tattoos aren’t seen as subversive any more, so if you’re worried about them being visible, it might be worth pondering: are they really your style or do you just feel pressured into getting one for some reason? If you’re concerned that they won’t age well here’s a heads up: <em>all</em> skin ages, so you can have sagging skin with or without ink on it, you choose. Wedding day photos tend to be ano

Scotland were in a similar position but then there was England and Wales, both teams were trying to play catch-up having recently appointed Steve Borthwick and Warren Gatland respectively.

<p>This sympathetic telling of the John Vassall affair is strong on the homophobic paranoia that wrecked British lives in the 1950s – and a reminder that the Kremlin’s use of blackmail is nothing new</p><p>In October 1954 a clerk working at the British embassy in Moscow, John Vassall, was invited to a party. Vassall got into a taxi with a “dark-haired stranger” and found himself in the Hotel Berlin. There, he had dinner with a group of Russian men in a private dining room. Soon, he was naked and lying on a divan. Two men raped him. Another took photographs. At 3.30am they brought him home in a taxi.</p><p>The episode – organised by the KGB’s second chief directorate – was a classic honeytrap. A few months later Vassall had a consensual sexual encounter with a uniformed Russian military officer. KGB operatives burst in on them. They showed Vassall photos taken previously and laid out his options. He could spy for Moscow, or be ruined and exposed.</p> <a href="https://www.thegu

As a major show explores this horror and more, our writer finds traces of the fallen by a forest near the Rhine</p><p>It is one of the most chilling passages in Roman literature. Germanicus, the emperor Tiberius’s nephew, is leading reprisals in the deeply forested areas east of the Rhine, when he decides to visit the scene of the catastrophic defeat, six years before, of his fellow Roman, Quinctilius Varus. The historian Tacitus describes what Germanicus finds: the ghastly human wreckage of a supposedly unbeatable army, deep in the Teutoburg Forest. “On the open ground,” he writes, “were whitening bones of men, as they had fled, or stood their ground, strewn everywhere or piled in heaps. Near lay fragments of weapons and limbs of horses, and also human heads, prominently nailed to trunks of trees.”</p><p>Survivors pointed out the spot where Varus had killed himself, and the pla
