With the right VPN, you don&rsquo;t need to play a cat-and-mouse game to access location restricted content from your streaming provider. That&rsquo;s why choosing your VPN carefully is essential while out of country. </p>

<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s set up a router probably understands that the IP address &ldquo;192.168.x.x&rdquo; signifies your local IP address. Anyone who hasn&rsquo;t&hellip;doesn&rsquo;t. And the global nonprofit which oversees the Internet&rsquo;s address space wants to remove the confusion with a new domain: .INTERNAL.</p>



<p>So what, you might be saying. Most routers handle this thing behind the scenes! But just as routers have begun taking this over, a new crop of AI apps have begun using local IPs as a server interface, making it relevant once again. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s likely that you regularly come across or work with PDF files&mdash;they&rsquo;re ubiquitous in our modern cross-platform world. Most of the time, when viewing a PDF, you can enjoy free software that allows you to read or comment on these files. But what if you need to edit them as well? That&rsquo;s where a PDF editor comes in.</p>



<p>The best PDF editors allows you to edit, create, alter, and convert PDF files just like you would with any other text document. Adobe Acrobat is the most famous option for most people. But while it&rsquo;s excellent both in features and utility, it&rsquo;s also pretty expensive. Thankfully, in recent years a whole host of third-party PDF editors have sprung up in order to provide less expensive alternatives.</p>



<p>Here at PCWorld we&rsquo;ve tested many of these top PDF editors and curated a list of the ve

<p>On paper, Intel&rsquo;s latest 14th-gen mobile Core HX processors don&rsquo;t offer laptop buyers much in the way of an upgrade over the previous generation. In the real world, that holds true as well. And, weirdly, that&rsquo;s some of the best news you&rsquo;ll hear all year if you&rsquo;re looking to pick up a gaming laptop without breaking the bank.</p>



<p>Intel&rsquo;s 14th-gen Core i9-14900HX is the fastest mobile PC CPU we&rsquo;ve ever tested, though AMD&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2162142/amd-announces-ryzen-8000-laptop-processors-with-a-renewed-ai-push.html">AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 8000 Mobile family of processors</a> are waiting in the wings.
