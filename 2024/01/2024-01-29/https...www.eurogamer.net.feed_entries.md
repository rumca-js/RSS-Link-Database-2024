## DF Weekly: Tekken 8 reminds us how important low input lag is to great gaming

This week's DF Direct Weekly - perhaps inevitably - kicks off with extended discussion on the Palworld phenomenon, while much time is spent mulling over the Horizon Forbidden West PC features trailer Sony 'dropped' last week. However, what caught my eye in putting this piece together was our discussion on input lag in the wake of John's Tekken 8 coverage, where it emerged that Namco had delivered the most responsive Tekken game in the modern era. We don't focus too much on input lag, but really we should, especially as we enter the next era of graphics technology.
</p><p>
Put simply, input lag is usually defined as the time taken between input from the player on his device of choice and that input playing out on-screen. Typically, the longer the delay, the more noticeable it is and the less enjoyable a game can be to p

## Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League players are switching on the game to find its story already completed

Some games can take forever to finish. Hours upon hours can be put into any given title, as players make their steady way to victory. When those credits ultimately roll, the sense of achievement can be a wonderful feeling. 
</p><p>
But, this isn't the case with Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, at least right now. In fact, many are finding they have 'completed the game' even before they take their first step. This is thanks to an issue that has seen those already with their hands on the game logging in to find they have full story completion from the off. 
</p><p>
Developer Rocksteady is aware of this unexpected narrative fast track, and is now in the process of sorting it all out.

Fighting and fantasy fans are desperate to see Final Fantasy 7's Tifa in Tekken 8, so much so Tekken boss Katsuhiro Harada acknowledged it.
</p><p>
Plenty of fans have noted how well suited Tifa would be to the fighting game series, but Harada's X (formerly Twitter) post about Rebirth and Tekken 8 booths being next to each other at the Taipei Game Show spurred on fan desires.
</p><p>
"All I'm gonna say... is what everyone else here is saying... but I'm gonna say it anyways... because 'Tifa Lockhart' would be absolutely INCREDIBLE if she made it into 'Tekken 8' this time Harada-San!!!," replied one fan.

Edmund McMillen has discussed a potential Fortnite collaboration with Epic Games, the celebrated indie designer has said. 
</p><p>
The maker of Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac, The End is Nigh and The Legend of Bum-bo confirmed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1751483944602935493">post</a> on X that he had chatted with the maker of Fortnite about a possible team-up in future. 
</p><p>
It's unclear from McMillen's response how far talks have got, though it wouldn't be the first time Fortnite has collaborated with an indie developer on some form of crossover.

Footage from a cancelled futuristic Call of Duty sci-fi game in development by Tony Hawk's studio Neversoft has leaked online. 
</p><p>
The footage was spotted by Call of Duty insider account <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1751440699990384991/photo/1">CharlieIntel</a>, and seemingly comes from a cancelled Xbox 360-era Call of Duty game known as Future Warfare (or "NX1" internally). The game was originally in development at Neversoft, which was ultimately merged into Infinity Ward in 2014.
</p><p>
Confirming the footage as legitimate, former Neversoft developer Brian Bright said this cancelled Call of Duty release would have launched in place of Ghosts. "Neversoft pivoted from Guitar Hero to make a futuristic COD game," <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianBright/status/1751439942935540055"

Sony will step up to the spotlight this week with a PlayStation State of Play broadcast, it's been reported.

Have you spotted the Killmonger dreads? They're everywhere these days. What started in Marvel's Black Panther film is now ubiquitous in gaming. And these dreads are not just on the heads of Miles Morales or Tekken's Eddy Gordo. They're in character creators too. The style began as fashion but has quickly become a stereotype.
</p><p>
Black players have noticed. "In general, we get stuck a lot of the time with the afro, the smaller afro, the buzz cut, or the gel braids going back, or nasty dreads that are symmetrical on either side. Or they all love the Killmonger dreads now," Twitch Ambassador and content creator Danielle Udogaranya (aka Ebonix) told me recently, all but ticking the same old options off on her fingers.
