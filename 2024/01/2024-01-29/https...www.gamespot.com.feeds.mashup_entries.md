Where Rocksteady aims to shake up this formula is by eliminating the limited-time design of its battle pass--Halo Infinite has a similar approach--as the studio will let players complete goals on the free and paid-for premium tracks at their leisure.</p><p>Typically, live-service battle passes are up for between one to three months, and once that time has expired, so will they. The best rewards are kept right until the end of a battle pass, forcing players to grind throughout the period to unlock cosmetics and gear. This has long been criticized by players, and in a QA discussion on the Suicide Squad Discord, Rocksteady said it wants to respect the personal time of its players instead.<

<p>Prime Video has introduced ads, even if you're already a paying subscriber. Amazon originally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prime-video-introducing-ads-will-charge-an-extra-3-to-bypass-them/1100-6517928/">announced that ads would come to Prime Video back in 2023</a>, but now the day has come.</p><p>As of January 29, Prime Video now shows ads during movies and TV programming. Users can get around the ads by spending $3/more per month. The next time you log in, you might see a message similar to the one below notifying you of the change and your options going forward.</p><p>Amazon said the aim is for Prime Video to have "meaningfully fewer" ads than traditional linear TV, and also fewer than other streaming TV companies that feature ads. Whether or not this is true is unknown at this point, given the ads rollout only just kicked off.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prime-video-now-has-ads-unless-you-pay-3-more-per-month/1100-6520654/?ftag=CAD-01-10

<p>A few more small--but useful--features are coming to Xbox Game Pass soon, focusing on quality-of-life tweaks. The first is a new prompt designed to inform users when an Xbox Game Pass title is leaving the library, and you can expect to see this one pop up whenever you start a game from the catalog that's on its way out.</p><p>This feature will also make it easier to purchase the game if you intend to keep on playing it, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/01/26/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-skip-ahead-2408-240123-2000/">according to Xbox</a>, and as a reminder, Game Pass subscribers get a discount toward these titles once they've left the service. Secondly, Xbox users can expect a "new experience" in certain sections of the Xbox Guide. This update will be available first to Alpha Skip-Ahead users through the Xbox Preview program, and the rest of the userbase can expect to see it roll out eventually.</p><p>If you're looking to add some new titles to your Game Pass

<p>Never-before-seen footage of an ultimately canceled Call of Duty game has emerged online, providing a glimpse at what was planned, at one stage at least, to be Call of Duty's first major jump into sci-fi and outer space. Footage from a "Future Warfare" game codenamed NXI was posted online recently.</p><p>Brian Bright, a video game industry veteran who worked on the game, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianBright/status/1751434604576112937">confirmed</a> NX1 was made after Infinity Ward "imploded," so that would have been around 2010. Neversoft, previously known for its Tony Hawk games, was making this game after pivoting from its work on the Guitar Hero series. The aim, Bright said, was to make a "futuristic Call of Duty game."</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">That‚Äôs all folks ü§† <a href="https://t.co/7TOg7JgdjE">pic.twitter.com/7TOg7JgdjE</a></p>  ‚Äî Josh H.
