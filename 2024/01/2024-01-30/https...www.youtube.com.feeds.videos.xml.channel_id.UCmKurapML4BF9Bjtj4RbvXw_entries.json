He came up with the primary melody to this tune a few years ago and we always hoped we\u2019d find a chance to develop it further. That chance came at the passing of Carl and Emily\u2019s precious two week-old baby, Thomas. We felt that this song was for him. The special privilege of being able to prepare and play this song for baby Thomas\u2019 funeral is a tender experience I will never forget. This song is dedicated to those of you who have lost a little one.\n\nDownload the Album \"Winter Serenade\" https://thepianoguys.com/products/winter-serenade\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Subscribe to our channel https://bit.ly/2XH4GCF for more heartwarming melodies that capture the spirit of the season. \n\nWE\u2019RE ON TOUR: https://smarturl.it/the10tour \nThe Piano Guys Christmas Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n543eKIdbUI&amp;list=PL606521018AE6D597\nLearn abou", "page_rating": 0, "date_published": "2024-01-30T13:00:08+00:00", "tags": [], "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao3TG5aewzI", "permanent": false}]
