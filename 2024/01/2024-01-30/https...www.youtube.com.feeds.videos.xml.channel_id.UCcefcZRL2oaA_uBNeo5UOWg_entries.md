There aren’t a ton of people in the world who can say they founded a billion dollar company. There are far fewer that can say they did it twice. YC Group Partner Tom Blomfield is one of them.

Each episode of our series Backstory will introduce you to one of YC’s Group Partners and the path they took to get here. If you aspire to change the world with your startup, Tom's story exemplifies the joys and trials of pursuing these ambitious ideas.
