When the only guarantees in life are taxes and hard times, only the strong survive here. They pay their dues with blood. For a better future, these fierce men and women have gone to war under the command of War Chief Ordan. But the revolution is not all that it seems. After all, the saying goes, \u201cThe gods have been unkind to the Reach.\u201d The Traitors We Are by Michael Roberti is an epic fantasy bursting with political intrigue and treachery. The worldbuilding in The Traitors We Are is something to obsess about. Michael Roberti\u2019s world is intricately detailed. The rich traditions from the Reach are particularly noteworthy.

Culture is further emphasized si", "page_rating": 0, "date_published": "2024-01-30T04:43:46+00:00", "tags": [], "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-the-traitors-we-are-by-michael-roberti", "permanent": false}]
