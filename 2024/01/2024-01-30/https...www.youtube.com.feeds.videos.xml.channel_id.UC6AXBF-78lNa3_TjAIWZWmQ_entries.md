Over the years we have captured a great number of beautiful shots, from all over the world. We will be bundling some of the best ones in our new 'collections' series: compilations a couple of shots per unique location, without music or narration so that viewers can truly be immersed in a beautiful environment for a while.

Collections will be comprised of shots in a similar type of environment, e.g.
Oceans, Forests, Mountains, City Parks and City Views.

They can be used for relaxation, meditation, or just to experience the beauty and wonder of pour planet earth.

Obviously best experienced with a VR headset!
