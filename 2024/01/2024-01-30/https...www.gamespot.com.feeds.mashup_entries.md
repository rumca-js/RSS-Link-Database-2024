It's based on the DKP system of loot distribution that was more popular back in the olden days of Blizzard's MMO but is still used by some guilds today. It's a system that doles out loot based on how much DKP players have accumulated, with guilds having different systems on how many points a player can accumulate for attending raids, downing bosses, and participating in various guild activities. Players can then essentially bid on rare items that drop using their DKP. The more DKP a player earns, the more DKP they have to "spend" on items.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">GDKP takes that system, and instead

<p>Daisy Ridley starred in the new Star Wars movie trilogy, and while plenty of people enjoyed the series, a lot of people had many negative things to say.</p><p>Ridley reflected on the backlash in an interview with Josh Horowitz on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h06b_eY_-es">Happy Sad Confused podcast</a> recently. She said the response is "still upsetting," even years later. 2015's The Force Awakens was more universally enjoyed than its sequels The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker, which some Star Wars fans had issues with.</p><p>"You don't want people to feel like you've not served the thing they're a fan of," she said (<a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/daisy-ridley-star-wars-backlash-upsetting-rey-kylo-kiss-earned-1235890401/">via Variety</a>). "But [The Last Jedi] was so divisive…it felt like the first one everyone was responsive in the same way. The second, super divisive. The last one, super divisive. It didn't change how I felt about it."</p

<p dir="ltr">Persona 3 is often called the darkest entry in its series, and within two minutes of starting it becomes clear why. Persona 3 Reload, remake of the 2006 classic, opens just like its previous versions: with a distressed young girl slumping to the floor as she attempts to work up enough nerve to place a gun against her temple. It's a shocking scene, made even more distressing when our protagonist is greeted by that same girl as he walks into his new school dorm. Her disposition does not betray what she was presumably doing just moments before, as she greets him in a charming, albeit slightly alarmed, manner. Yet, like Persona 3 as a whole, there's more to the situation than both we as players, and the protagonist, can see.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond a grim exterior is a beautiful balancing act--one that carefully weighs tension and relief, love and loss, mystery and resolution, and that aforementioned macabre nature against an unrelenting light. It's only fitting, then

<p>The European Union recently passed a new tech regulation called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), targeting digital "gatekeepers"--like Apple--and requiring them to allow third-party app stores, among other things. In complying with the new regulations, Apple has introduced even more fees, and the developers who publish apps on iOS aren't happy about it.</p><p>Xbox's Sarah Bond is the latest to comment on the fee structure, quoting a tweet from Spotify head Daniel Ek where he claims the new fees are simply a way of forcing developers to stick with the status quo, as picked up by The Verge.</p><p>"We believe constructive conversations drive change and progress towards open platforms and greater competition. Apple's new policy is a step in the wrong direction," Bond says in her tweet. "We hope they listen to feedback on their proposed plan and work towards a more inclusive future for all."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-head-is-not-happy-with-apples-new-app-
