		Digital identity and trust provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/trust-stamp">Trust Stamp</a> has released a white paper explaining the threat of quantum computing to biometric systems and making recommendations to minimize the risks.

Quantum computers will open opportunities to solve problems in biometrics, drug synthesis, financial modeling, and weather forecasting, among other areas, according to Trust Stamp. But they will also be able to decrypt most of the encryption systems used to secure the internet and protect data today.

While experts expect quantum computers will not be able to scale to defeat such systems for at least another ten years, the white paper claims, entities should address “harvest now, decrypt later” (HNDL) at

		The EU’s Court of Justice has given bloc nations flexibility to decide when criminals’ biometric identifiers can be destroyed.

Even convicted criminals should have at least the hope that their data will be erased prior to their death, which is when the information now is relinquished by the Bulgarian government.

The <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2024-01/cp240020en.pdf">decision</a> follows a referral from the Bulgarian Supreme Administrative Court. A Bulgarian man had been convicted of failing to be truthful as a witness to a crime.

The witness was given a one-year suspended sentence and he was deemed “legally rehabilitated.” Some time after that, he requested to be taken out of police records but was rebuffed. The records can hol

		Officials with Uganda’s Internal Affairs Ministry have requested a merger between government bodies responsible for issuing IDs and civil registration, reports local news outlet <a href="https://chimpreports.com/id-renewal-exercise-plan-to-merge-nira-with-dcic-revealed-as-cost-of-biometric-kits-shoot-from-shs-17m-to-shs-22m/">ChimpReports</a>.

The report cites unnamed sources as saying Internal Affairs has proposed that the National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA) be merged with the Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control (DCIC) to create a new National Citizenship and Registration Services. The proposal was reportedly made at a meeting of officials from both agencies last week.

Uganda is preparing to issue new digital ID cards, embedd

		The European Union is inching towards finalizing the <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-migration-policy/eu-migration-asylum-reform-pact/">European Asylum and Migration Pact</a>, a complex package of asylum and migration policy reforms that includes boosting the collection of biometric data in <a href="https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Activities/Large-Scale-It-Systems/Eurodac">Eurodac</a>. But non-governmental organization Statewatch warns that despite lawmakers reaching a political agreement on the key issues of the Pact in December, many of its details are to be decided in the following months.

Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) noted the “astonishingly low” rate of solved murder investigations in the United States, around 50 percent. Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) referred to a statement from the Major County Sheriffs of America and the Major Cities Chief Association in arguing that facial recognition can serve as an invaluable “investigative assistant to law enforcement rather than a replacement for the

		While the world’s travel destinations bounce back from the post-pandemic tourism slowdown, airports across the world are investing in new biometric tools to keep track of passengers.

Japanese giant <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/nec">NEC</a> has announced it will provide new kiosks for immigration and customs inspections, equipped with the NeoFace technology that is a part of the company’s Bio-IDiom portfolio of biometric authentication products. The kiosks use facial recognition and fingerprint scanning for authentication.

The kiosks will start piloting on January 31, 2024 at Haneda Airport, one of two international airports serving Tokyo. Haneda serves around 138,000 passengers a day – still a lower volume  than pre-Covid. Those figu

		Putting walls around adult or should-be-adult content online is enticing to U.S. culture warriors, but it’s not easy to do.

Absent guaranteed civil liberties, privacy rights, data breaches and IT-savvy children, age verification would be an easy way to control information access.

That isn’t the case in the United States and still regional governments curry favor with a motivated anti-pornography sector of the electorate by writing thin age-check legislation.

The results are state laws that raise <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202401/age-verification-laws-in-the-uk-and-us-reassessed">questions</a> and, in the cases of <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2024/01/25/florida-ban-minors-bill-law-what-is-social-media/7

		Football fans in Greece intending to watch games in stadiums may have to buy match tickets using a government digital ID app launched in 2022.

As <a href="https://apnews.com/article/greek-soccer-security-tickets-violence-b09444fb0020297618143bfa078fc1de">reported</a> by AP, this course of action is being taken by government as part of an offensive against fan violence during games. This step will be implemented in February alongside the deployment of surveillance cameras in all of the country’s 14 stadiums used for top tier football matches.

There are plans by football authorities in other European countries, including <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202401/facial-recognition-planned-for-all-stadiums-in-italys-top-football-league">Italy<

According to a government announcement, the Electoral Commission (IEC) has been preparing for the exercise in collaboration with the Department of Correctional Services (DCS).

The enrollment drive is scheduled to take place between Tuesday, January 30 and Thursday, February 1.

In preparation for the registration exercise, the IEC says it has been liaising with family members of inmates at correctional centers to ensure that their national ID documents reach them. This is because inmates are not allowed to keep personal identification documents
