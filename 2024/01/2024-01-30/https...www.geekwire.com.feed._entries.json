The company&#8217;s revenue overall increased 18% to $62 billion, with profits of $21.9 billion and earnings per share of $2.93, up 33% by both measures, topping Wall Street&#8217;s expectations across the board on the key metrics. &#8220;We\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,&#8221; said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in the company&#8217;s earnings release, citing the growing adoption of Microsoft&#8217;s AI tools across different industries and technologies.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-azure-revenue-up-30-with-help-from-ai-as-tech-giant-beats", "page_rating": 0, "date_published": "2024-01-30T21:33:08+00:00", "tags": [], "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-azure-revenue-up-30-with-help-from-ai-as-tech-giant-beats-overall-expectations", "permanent": false}, {"title": "Washington governor signs executive order to develop guidelines for generative AI use", "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "user": null, "dead": false, "album": "", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "language": "en-US", "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "page_rating_visits": 0, "artist": null, "vote": 0, "source_obj__id": 338, "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"1130\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jay-inslee-1260x1130.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Washington became the latest state to issue an executive order related to generative AI as government agencies try to keep up with the rapidly developing technology that is causing both optimism and concern over its potential impact. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed the order on Tuesday, directing state officials over the next year to identify potential generative AI initiatives for internal operations and set guidelines for how the tech is procured, used, and monitored. The order also asks the state to examine the impact of generative AI on vulnerable communities; on the state&#8217;s workforce; and on potential education-related opportunities. \u201cIt\u2019s&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/washington-governor-signs-executive-order-to-develop-guidelines-for-generative-ai-use/\">Read More</a>", "page_rating": 0, "date_published": "2024-01-30T20:03:39+00:00", "tags": [], "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/washington-governor-signs-executive-order-to-develop-guidelines-for-generative-ai-use", "permanent": false}, {"title": "Microsoft AI engineer says company  thwarted attempt to expose DALL-E 3 safety problems", "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "user": null, "dead": false, "album": "", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "language": "en-US", "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "page_rating_visits": 0, "artist": null, "vote": 0, "source_obj__id": 338, "description": "<img alt=\"microsoft\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/microsoft1-1260x852.jpeg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />A Microsoft AI engineering leader says he discovered vulnerabilities in OpenAI&#8217;s DALL-E 3 image generator in early December allowing users to bypass safety guardrails to create violent and explicit images, and that the company impeded his previous attempt to bring public attention to the issue.
