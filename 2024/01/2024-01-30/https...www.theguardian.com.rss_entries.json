Then you\u2019ll love the Conti Cup (or Women\u2019s League Cup if you prefer). And it has been a slightly farcical few days for a slightly farcical competition. First, the background. Last week Aston Villa hammered Sunderland 7-0 in their final group game, securing top spot in Group A and a place in the quarter-finals. Second-placed Sunderland were out, their points-per-game record (more of which later) not quite good enough, so Manchester United and Tottenham reached the last eight as the two best runners-up in the five groups.
