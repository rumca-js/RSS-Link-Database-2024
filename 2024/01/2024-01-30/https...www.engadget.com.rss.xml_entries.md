<p>An MIT biotech researcher has been able to run the iconic computer game <em>Doom</em> using actual gut bacteria. Lauren Ramlan didn’t get the game going on a digital simulation of bacteria, but turned actual bacteria into pixels to display the 30-year-old FPS, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-play-doom-using-gut-bacteria-but-the-framerate-is-atrocious">as reported by <em>Rock Paper Shotgun.</em></a></p>
<p>Specifically, Ramlan created a display inside of a cell wall made entirely of E. coli bacteria. The 32x48 1-bit display may not win any resolution awards, but who cares, right? It’s <em>Doom</em> running on bacteria. The researcher dosed the bacteria with fluorescent proteins to get them to light up just like digital pixels.</p>

It’s also more expensive than ever.</p>
<p>It’s the AI features not hardware that mark this year’s S23 series, though. AI tools range across text and translation, photography and search. A lot of these AI abilities are already available from other services, like ChatGPT and Bard, but this is crammed into the S24 series at the base level, so from the Notes app you can summarize, auto-format, spellcheck or translate your missives, on the go. (Transcription is also, apparently, very impressive, but that might be the journalist in me getting excited.)</p>

<p>Gogoro is best known for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gogoro-launches-its-battery-swapping-tech-in-china-080359215.html">battery swapping tech</a>, but its new scooter may be one of the quickest and highest-tech models available. The flagship Pulse can accelerate from 0 to 32MPH in just 3.05 seconds thanks to the company's &quot;Hypercore&quot; tech that delivers 378nm of torque to the back wheel. At the same time, it's fitted with a 10.25 HD touch display that offers turn-by-turn navigation and more.&nbsp;</p>
