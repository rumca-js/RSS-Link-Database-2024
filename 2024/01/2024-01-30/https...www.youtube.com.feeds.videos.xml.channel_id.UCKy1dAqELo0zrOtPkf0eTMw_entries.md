The Ministry Of Ungentlemanly Warfare is an action-comedy about the untold true story about an unorthodox special forces unit distributed by Lionsgate and a Guy Ritchie Film.

Based upon recently declassified files of the British War Department and inspired by true events, The Ministry Of Ungentlemanly Warfare is an action-comedy that tells the story of the first-ever special forces organization formed during WWII by UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill and a small group of military officials including author Ian Fleming. The top-secret combat unit, composed of a motley crew of rogues and mavericks, goes on a daring mission against the Nazis using entirely unconventional and utterly “ungentlemanly” fighting techniques. Ultimately their audacious approach changed the course of the war and laid the foundation for the British SAS and modern Black Ops warfare.

The Ministry Of Ungentlemanly Warfare stars Henry Cavill, Eiza González, Alan Ritchson, Alex Pettyfer, Hero Fiennes Tiffi

The Killmonger haircut in video games needs to end! Since the Black Panther movie released in 2018, video game developers seemingly fell in love with Killmonger’s hairstyle. So much so that it has been overused on Black characters in video games ever since. From Miles Morales in Spider-Man 2, Eddy Gordo in Tekken 8, Sargon in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Phoenix in VALORANT, and the list goes on. Akeem goes in-depth on BEYOND to call out game developers for falling back on the one Black hairstyle they seem to be obsessed about, seemingly refusing to explore the various different hairstyles and haircuts within the Black community. Hopefully this’ll be a wake up call to the video games industry to try something different, new and diverse when it comes to head pieces.

While the game isn't officially out until tomorrow, people who paid extra for early access were left staring at error screens when the game was supposed to go live for them. In Sony news, a new PlayStation State of Play has been announced, and it's this Wednesday, January 31st. Expect some closer looks at some big games coming to PS5 later this year.
