Over the years, my very good friend Carl Sandquist has come up with some wonderful melodies (e.g. Morning Light) which he has asked me to help develop into songs.  He came up with the primary melody to this tune a few years ago and we always hoped weâ€™d find a chance to develop it further. That chance came at the passing of Carl and Emilyâ€™s precious two week-old baby, Thomas. We felt that this song was for him. The special privilege of being able to prepare and play this song for baby Thomasâ€™ funeral is a tender experience I will never forget. This song is dedicated to those of you who have lost a little one.
