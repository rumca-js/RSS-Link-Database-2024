Plasmonics are special optical phenomena that are understood as interactions between light and matter and possess diverse shapes, material compositions, and symmetry-related behavior. The design of such plasmonic structures at the nanoscale level can pave the way for optical materials that respond to the orientation of light (polarization), which is not easily achievable in bulk size and existing materials.

One of the many effects of global warming is sea-level rise due to the melting and retreat of the Earth's ice sheets and glaciers. As the sea level rises, large areas of densely populated coastal land could ultimately become uninhabitable without extensive coastal modification. In order to stave off this possibility, carbon emissions need to reach net negative, a state that is hard to achieve under current circumstances.

Plant removal experiments are recognized as effective methods for understanding ecosystem functions of plant species under vegetation change scenarios. To minimize disturbance, the most prominent method of plant removal is to repeatedly cut off the aboveground parts of plants and leave roots in the soil. However, how the remaining roots affect soil organisms remains to be investigated.

Black holes are powerful gravitational engines. So you might imagine that there must be a way to extract energy from them given the chance, and you'd be right. Certainly, we could tap into all the heat and kinetic energy of a black hole's accretion disk and jets, but even if all you had was a black hole in empty space, you could still extract energy from a trick known as the Penrose process.

As Canadians share more and more genetic data with service providers such as insurance companies or databases like Ancestry.com, the potential for discrimination based on this data is growing. Known as genetic discrimination (GD), this practice is broadly defined as the differential treatment of an individual compared to the rest of the population based on actual or presumed genetic information. Although the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act (GNDA) was passed in 2017 to protect Canadians from GD, a team at the Centre of Genomics and Policy of McGill University has found that many life insurance companies have found ways to circumvent these rules.
