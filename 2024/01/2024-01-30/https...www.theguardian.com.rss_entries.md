<p>Thanks to the party’s boycott, public services are collapsing and there has been no government at Stormont for nearly two years</p><p>Two years ago, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) collapsed the power-sharing institutions at Stormont in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements. At the time, I chatted to somebody with insight into unionist thinking. I remarked: “Surely they’re not that stupid?” They replied: “Yes, they [bleep] are.”</p><p>On Monday night, it seemed to come to an end. At about 1am, a bleary-eyed Jeffrey Donaldson announced that his party would be ending its boycott after examining the UK government’s latest offer to end the impasse. Donaldson said the deal would remove checks on goods moving within the UK, restore the UK’s internal market and end Northern Ireland’s automatic adherence to EU law. The details haven’t been confirmed yet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/30/dup-boycott-northern-ireland-stormont">Continue rea

<p>First released in 1951, this endlessly entertaining film is an absorbing tale of an American arriving in postwar Britain looking for answers about his slain younger brother</p><p>This 1951 drama-thriller from director Jacques Tourneur and veteran genre writer Philip MacDonald, which sees Ray Milland coming to grimy postwar Britain demanding answers about his brother’s death, is a gem: focused, fast-moving and a little eccentric. It is a British-set movie that takes us on a travelogue tour from the coast of Tampa, Florida, to London – and from there to Wales, the Scottish Highlands and Birmingham. There is a lovely scene shot on location in London’s Covent Garden, in the days of the fruit and veg market, with crowds of real people looking on.</p><p>There are no explicit action sequences: no shootouts, not even a punch-up.

<p>Michelle Yeoh, Henry Golding and Sandra Oh are among the all-star voices in this likable but generic story of a San Francisco teen and a posse of animal shapeshifters</p><p>This perky, likable but profoundly derivative animated feature arrives just in time for both lunar new year and the February half-term school holidays. Like a shop-bought char siu bao, it’s over-sweetened but moreish: Chinese-flavoured comfort food in cinematic form. The story, based on a novel by Laurence Yep, revolves around teenage Tom (voiced by Brandon Soo Hoo) who lives in San Francisco with Amah (which means “grandmother”), voiced by Tan Kheng Hua; the latter is an eccentric old dear who insists on slathering their 19th-century house in so many good luck charms that people leave oranges on the doorstep thinking it’s one big shrine.</p><p>It turns out that Amah is the guardian of a purple stone that can be turned into a phoenix; it is your basic magical MacGuffin that the film’s shapeshifting vill

I just hope it will be appreciated in its next home</p><p>My bike got nicked last week, which initially presented itself as an experiment in consciousness, a magic realist problem: it had to be there, because that’s where I’d left it. And yet it wasn’t there. I spent a shamefully long time just staring at the place it had been. Later, I tried valiantly to insert some false memories, where I’d moved it somewhere else; then I went to look over there, where it still wasn’t. I gazed around for security cameras, as if I would have a clue what I would do next if there were any.

In <em>The Lodgers</em>, an unnamed narrator returns to a town where she has arranged to sublet a flat. It’s less than ideal: the living room is “an absurdly awkward corner shape” and the whole place smells of “men’s shower gel and repeated nights of instant noodles”. The woman has chosen this flat because it overlooks her mother’s house, though her mother, whom she calls Moffa, is absent when she goes to check in on her. Another person who should be around but isn’t is Kav, the narrator’s flatmate. She grows anxious, though Pester’s first-person prose remains crisp and playful despite her escalatin

<p>A filling pumpkin, sage and barley stew, plus a mushroom and kidney bean winter warmer</p><p>In January I inevitably turn to whole foods: dark, leafy brassicas, whole grains, beans simmered slowly on the stove top. Here are two nourishing dishes that put them all to work – both are vegan and both are very freezer-friendly, if cooking ahead is your thing. One takes inspiration from the herby Persian classic <em>ghormeh sabzi</em>, albeit a pared-down version of what is traditionally a luxurious dish. The other, a pumpkin, ale and barley stew, is a chance to raid your store-cupboard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/30/pumpkin-sage-barley-vegan-stew-recipe-tamal-ray">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Editors Margaret Atwood and Douglas Preston round up 36 big literary names for a spirited Decameron-style collection of shaggy dog stories and tales of lost love</p><p>Even our nimblest and most rococo flights of fantasy are rooted in the tiresome constraints of our everyday lives; indeed, the more mundane our immediate concerns, the more beguiling the world of make-believe. The stories we tell ourselves and one another are a tussle with time, a little fist shaken at a world of simultaneously alarming impermanence and grinding daily demands. So when the residents of the Fernsby Arms, a down-at-heel Manhattan apartment block, begin to gather on its roof in the early days of the pandemic, it is unsurprising that the yarns they spin are filled with as much death, separation and loss as diversion and entertainment; the stories’ tellers are killing time just as they are terrified that time will kill them.</p><p><em>Fourteen Days</em> may take its cue from Boccaccio’s <em>Decame

But as the risks get bigger, the questions do, too</p><p>The Combin de Valsorey is a rocky Alpine peak that stands nearly 4,200&nbsp;metres above sea level near the Swiss-Italian border. Its north-west face rises 670 metres, at a gradient of&nbsp;about 50 degrees, steep enough that you can stand on the slope and touch the higher ground beside you without bending down.</p><p>In May 2016, when Jérémie Heitz climbed the Combin for the first time, the north-west face of the mountain looked like a vertical curtain of white, fringed by bands of dark rock. In several places, smears of greyish ice darkened the snow cover. Heitz’s ascent was nothing extraordinary in mountaineering terms: this face was first ascended in 1958, by Egbert Eigher and Erich Vanis. But Heitz was not climbing the Combin because he cared about going up – his plan was to ski down it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/20

<p>The trillions of microbes living on and inside the human body are an important part of who we are, from mediating all of our interactions with the environment to determining our cancer risk and influencing who we fall for. And scientists are only just beginning to decipher the species of bugs we share our lives with, and how they shape us.</p><p>In the final part of this Science Weekly mini-series, Ian Sample meets Julie Thornton, academic director of the Centre for Skin Sciences and professor in cutaneous biology at the university of Bradford. Julie tells Ian how the skin microbiome varies across our bodies, how it helps with everything from wound healing to immunity, and how we can protect it from the disruptive impact of modern life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2024/jan/30/secrets-of-the-microbiome-the-skin-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It took 13 years of dreaming, peril and hard graft before the first residents moved into Cannock Mill – an eco-village that tackles both the climate crisis and loneliness</p><p>‘Look at this – can you see what it is?” The architect Anne Thorne is showing me around Cannock Mill, the eco-village on the outskirts of Colchester, Essex, that she designed in collaboration with a group of her friends who had grown tired of London life. We are standing behind a terrace of terracotta and honey-toned houses; even on a dreich day, the 1-hectare (2.4-acre) site has a distinctly Mediterranean vibe. There are well-tended grounds, a communal allotment and a fire pit.</p><p>Thorne is gesticulating at a tiny path. “It’s a frog passerelle,” she enthuses. I have no clue. “So that frogs can get safely to the mill pond down there.” I can’t see any amphibious commuters, but Claudine and Piaf, the community chickens, are scrabbling around. There are three buzzing beehives, too.</p> <a href="http
