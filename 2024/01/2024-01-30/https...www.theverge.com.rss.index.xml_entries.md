  <p id="cLhPan">Yelp is joining the wealth of platforms expanding their use of AI, as it’s <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/news/winter-product-release-2024">rolling out a new feature</a> on iOS that rounds up and summarizes user reviews in a blurb that appears near the top of a company’s Yelp page.</p>
<p id="bV9X8O">The new feature uses large language models (LLMs) to parse through user feedback to highlight “what the business is best known for based on first-hand reviews,” Yelp says. That may include a mention of a location’s atmosphere, popular dishes, amenities, and more. One example (as shown in the image at the top of this article) describes a restaurant as a “retro diner well known for its classic cheeseburgers and affordable prices.”</p>

  <p id="zJ7eLC">TikTok Shop links could soon become a lot more common across the social media app. <a href="https://archive.ph/lWCAu"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that the company is testing a new feature that automatically identifies products in the platform’s videos before offering a link to “Find similar items on TikTok Shop.” A spokesperson for the company was not immediately available to respond to <em>The Verge’s</em> request for comment, but it confirmed to <em>Bloomberg</em> that the feature is an early test.</p>
