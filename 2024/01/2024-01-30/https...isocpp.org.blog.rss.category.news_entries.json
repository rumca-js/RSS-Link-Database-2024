The goal is to simplify the code by eliminating the need for cumbersome constructs like enable_if and introduce further improvements in C++23.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<h3>\n\t\t<strong><a href=\"https://andreasfertig.blog/2024/01/cpp20-concepts-applied/\">C++20 Concepts Applied - Safe Bitmasks using Scoped Enums</a></strong></h3>\n\t<p>\n\t\tby Andreas Fertig</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFrom the article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIn 2020 I wrote an article for the German magazine iX called <em>Scoped enums in C++</em>. In that article, I shared an approach of using class enums as bitfields without the hassel of having to define the operators for each enum. The approach was inspired by Anthony William's post Using Enum Classes as Bitfie", "page_rating": 0, "date_published": "2024-01-30T20:30:48+00:00", "tags": [], "link": "https://isocpp.org//blog/2024/01/cpp20-concepts-applied-andreas-fertig", "permanent": false}]
