There are many reasons as to why that is. This story is one of those reasons. </p><p>Ohio State is planning on holding a “sex week” to warn students to stay away from pregnancy centers and also encourage them to write Valentine's Day cards to abortion providers. </p><p>It is unclear what the point of all that is but you would think that a publicly funded university should not be allowed to politicize a very political topic. We all know very well the level of outrage that would occur had they encouraged Valentine's Day cards to pregnancy centers, while also warning of the dangers of Planned Parenthood. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

He is trending again because he made some incredibly self-evident comments, as he claimed a big problem in society is the “declining masculinity.” </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

I can not think of any time in history where we “affirmed” illness. But subsequently, because this is the only acceptable approach when dealing with gender dysphoria, parents are now faced with the ultimatum of medical intervention to change their kids' bodies to fit the diagnosis in the mind or lose custody of their child. And if someone even thinks about changing their kid's mind to accept the body, you better say goodbye to any rights you once had as a parent. </p><p>At least that is what has happened in Montanna. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
