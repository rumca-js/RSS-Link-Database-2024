Ubisoft's upcoming open world Star Wars game Outlaws looks to be set for a "late" 2024 release. 
</p><p>
Until today, the Ubisoft game held a much wider ranging 2024 release window. However, a <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2024/01/24-oooh-worthy-things-at-disney-experiences-in-2024/">Disney Parks blog post</a> promoting a variety of events and such for the next 12 months has Star Wars Outlaws listed as arriving towards the tail end of the year. 
</p><p>
"Star Wars Outlaws, the open world Star Wars game, is set to release late this year," the post reads (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-arrives-late-2024">IGN</a>). "The game lets you explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new. You can risk it all as Kay Vess, an emerging scoundrel seeking freedom and the

Resident Evil 4 was one of the most accomplished remakes of 2023, a modernised, bold reinterpretation of Capcom's 2005 action-horror classic. It looked great too across current-gen platforms as well as PS4, with great lighting detail and excellent art design. As the year closed out, Capcom delivered RE4's first mobile port. As a part of Apple's recent triple-A gaming push, Resident Evil 4 is now available on iPhone 15 Pro and M1 and M2 based iPads, representing the fastest of Apple's mobile hardware. So is the game hung up on performance and configuration issues like Resident Evil Village? Or is RE4 a capable conversion of the console code?
</p><p>
Resident Evil 4 was for the most part a current-gen console and PC experience, but Capcom also shipped the game on PS4 console systems. The visuals were mostly preserved on Sony's eighth-g

Rebellion co-founders Chris and Jason Kingsley have been recognised for their services to the economy as part of the King's New Year Honours list. This recognition has seen the brothers each being awarded a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire).
</p><p>
The Kingsley siblings co-founded Rebellion, which is best known for the Sniper Elite series, in Oxford all the way back in 1992. Since its conception in the early 90s, the company has since expanded to include comic, book, board game, film and TV work under its umbrella.

Rebellion CEO <a href="https://rebellion.com/rebellion-co-founders-chris-and-jason-kingsley-awarded-cbe-in-new-year-honours-list/">Jason Kingsley</a> called it an "incredible honour" to be awarded a CBE. "It, in part, reflects the growth and success of Rebellion bu

Steamboat Willie is now in the public domain, so as has come to be expected, someone has made a horror game starring a grotesque villain inspired by the original Mickey Mouse.
</p><p>
Known as Infestation 88, this upcoming release is following in similar footsteps of slasher film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-cant-believe-winnies-hole-is-a-real-video-game">horrifying Winnie's Hole</a>. Developer Nightmare Forge Games has taken an innocent and beloved children's character and given it a sinister makeover.

Microsoft president Brad Smith has changed his tone somewhat towards UK regulatory body the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), admitting its initial plan to block the company's Activision Blizzard buyout was "tough and fair".
</p><p>Speaking with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67839205">BBC's Today Program</a> earlier this week, Smith said it actually "pushed Microsoft to change the acquisition that we had proposed, for Activision Blizzard to spin out certain rights that the CMA was concerned about with respect to cloud gaming."</p><p>
Smith continued: "I think the CMA vindicated its position but still created a pragmatic path forward for innovation and investment. I think that is good for everyone."

VR studio First Contact Entertainment has shut down. The company, which is behind PSVR and PSVR2 games Firewall Zero Hour and Firewall Ultra, said the "lack of support for VR within the industry" was a factor in its decision.
</p><p>
First Contact Entertainment shared the news just before Christmas, via a statement on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/firstcontactent">Facebook</a>. "After almost 8 years of working with the most amazing team I've ever had the pleasure of being part of, I'm sad to announce that we will be closing our company First Contact Entertainment by the end of the year," reads the statement.

"The lack of support for VR within the industry has eventually taken its toll. As a AAA VR game developer, we are just not able to justify the expense needed [going] forward. We are a team of fearless innova
