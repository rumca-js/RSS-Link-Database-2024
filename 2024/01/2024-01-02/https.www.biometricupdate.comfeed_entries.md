		New <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202311/next-up-with-an-age-verification-plan-to-keep-us-kids-off-porn-sites-is-alabama">age verification laws</a> are directly and indirectly blocking access to the U.S.' major sex-related entertainment sites.

The states of Montana and North Carolina lost access to Canada-based Pornhub this week when it shut down service to relevant IP addresses. Pornhub was acting before age verification bills in each state became law.

The regulations are intended to only allow access to online adult material to those at least 18 years old.

Pornhub executives have said the rules infringe on the First Amendment and privacy rights of adult customers. As well, they say, the laws put children at risk because available processe

		The top U.S. tech standards agency wants to start 2024 off briskly when it comes to digital identity. It has put out for feedback a draft report intended to bridge the gap between <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/us-wants-word-from-vendors-that-can-speed-digital-id-security-standards-creation">domestic</a> and EU efforts.

It could be said that the National Institute of Standards and Technology should equally push commonality between U.S. states organizing their own ID programs. Of course, officials could be going after the easier tasks first.

		International travel continues to be a major catalyst in the uptake of biometric travel IDs, with governments in the Middle East, Asia and Africa implementing <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/biometric-passport">ePassports</a> for airport security, fraud prevention and access to public services.
<h2>Biometric ePassports to be mandatory in Pakistan, more convenient in Israel</h2>
Citing rising concerns about foreigners using forged passport documents for entry, Israel’s Population and Immigration Authority (PIBA) has updated its policy for border control at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv to favor travelers using biometric passports.

Israel National News <a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/382890">reports</a> that, under

		The advantages of biometric surveillance by police in the U.S. remain subjective and still not universally <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202205/tally-of-facial-recognition-bans-being-overturned-keeps-growing">accepted</a>.

For example, a pair of moderate Democrats and tech investors in liberal-leaning California are generously funding ballot measures that would deregulate to a significant degree police use of facial recognition in San Francisco.

Meanwhile, legislation likely to be introduced in the far northeast state of New Hampshire would ban most uses of biometric surveillance by all state agencies. New Hampshire typically votes moderately Democratic, though its residents include a very small but very energetic Libertarian population.

		The United States Department of Veterans Affairs plans to pilot facial recognition tools at VA hospitals in 2024. One plan is to implement face biometrics to replace personal identity verification (PIV) cards for authenticating healthcare workers in ICUs and other VA clinical settings, according to <a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/va-leveraging-cutting-edge-tech-to-upgrade-cyber-deliver-for-veterans/">MeriTalk</a>.

Around 95 percent of the VA workforce uses PIV cards to log in to the VA network. Workers who are trying to care for veterans currently need to manually take out their PIV card and plug it into their workstation to verify their identity, but this can be difficult to do when a worker is in the middle of administering a shot or exam.

Applicants wishing to change their listed date of birth must write to the Director General and CEO of NIMC, and possess a certificate of registration to the electronic Civil Registration and Vital Statistics System (eCRVS) operated by the National Population Commission.

		The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced it has reached 90 percent of its registration target for the PhilSys digital identity system and that it is pushing to improve registration access for more remote areas of the Agusan del Norte province. As of December 18th, 2023, over 82.8 million Filipinos are already registered in the system, the government says in an announcement.

As of December 22nd, the PSA has printed and dispatched for delivery over 50 million PhilIDs for registrants. The authority is now targeting more remote areas with limited access.

PSA used motorcycle taxis to travel on rough roads and wooden rafts to cross rivers to bring access to geographically-isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA) in Manila de Bugabus, Bu

UK Border Force Director-General Phil Douglas says the new face biometrics system will reduce friction, compared with the previous system, which also uses facial recognition.

The new implementation is based on the way face biometrics have been deployed in places like Dubai and Australia, Douglas says. It will tie in with the UK’s incoming Electronic Travel authorization (ETA) scheme and provide faster passenger processing with enhanced security, officials say. Douglas also noted the
