When Rooney was brought in to replace John Eustace, Birmingham were above Leeds in the table and dreaming of promotion. Now, they are 20 points behind them, and just six above third-from-bottom Sheffield Wednesday. The Owls had <em>two points<strong> </strong></em>when Rooney arrived at St Andrew’s on 11 October, but made the bold decision two days later to appoint Danny Röhl, a coach who seemingly knows a bit of what he’s doing.</p><p>Sacking a perfectly competent manager to bring in a big name with a dubio

<p>The Israel-Hamas war could broaden, and many developing countries are on a path to crisis </p><p>Recession, stagflation, a cost of living crisis, damaged public finances and higher interest rates. The four years since a new deadly virus spread around the world from the Chinese city of Wuhan has been a catalogue of woe for the global economy. 2023 has been the first year since 2019 to be relatively shock-free, in the sense that there has been no repeat of the pandemic of 2020, the supply-chain bottlenecks of 2021 or the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The financial repercussions of conflict in Israel have, until this point, been limited to the region. But that may change. The global economy is still not in a good place as 2024 dawns. Here are a few things to look out for in the year ahead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/02/six-things-to-watch-in-2024-global-economy-from-tax-cuts-to-ai">Continue reading...</a>

It was a unique grindhouse slash alt-cinephile repertory house which inspired generations of film-makers, artists and musicians, and its notional “club” status allowed it to show all sorts of outrageous and transgressive material: horror, sex, satire, drugs, vampires and bikers. The Scala also championed progressive, LGBT and pro-union causes.</p><p>The cinema was housed in a wonderfully stately building with a cupola dome in London’s scuzzy and pre-gentrified King’s Cross between 1981 and 1993; the building in fact now survives and thrives as a nightclub.

<p>From Pedro Pascal sneakily nabbing his Game of Thrones part to Charlie Hunnam dancing around a shoe shop, the route to mega-fame isn’t straightforward</p><p>A story about Pedro Pascal recently resurfaced, describing how he was able to get his big break on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones</a>. The short version is that he stole it. The longer story is that Pascal had taken to mentoring young actors after seeing his career stall a little. One of them told him that he was auditioning for the role of Oberyn Martell in the fantasy epic and wanted help to secure the role.</p><p>But, as Pascal told the US talk show host <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/seth-meyers">Seth Meyers</a> in 2016, the young actor didn’t seem right for the part: “He’s, like, a 25-year-old kid, really, really talented, good-looking … He’d never seen the show.” Knowing he could do better, Pascal waited for his mentee to leave, taped his own audition

<p>Director William Brent Bell turns in a poor man’s reworking of the Brit-horror classic that can’t work up a proper head of suspense</p><p>In a quaint village somewhere in the north, judging by the accents, the new vicar Rebecca Holland (Tuppence Middleton) seems to think she’s made some progress connecting with the locals. Mind you, turnout for Sunday services yields barely enough souls for a game of five-a-side. But the community seems friendly enough to her and her husband Henry (Matt Stokoe), and they seem to have paid the family a compliment by choosing the Hollands’ pre-pubescent daughter Grace to be some kind of angel with wheat sheaf wings for the upcoming harvest festival.</p><p>Alas, it seems Rebecca has never watched <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wicker-man">The Wicker Man</a> because, if she had, she would have understood exactly what’s going on once Grace mysteriously disappears. Much of what follows is nearly a beat-for-beat rehash of director Robin Ha

<p>The index grabbed attention from the start, but shows its age as 21st-century tech stocks go elsewhere</p><p>Here is a poor prediction from 40 years ago, 1984, when the FTSE 100 index was born. There is “no question of the FT 30 index disappearing,” opined the deputy chief executive of the Financial Times, arguing that the new-fangled creation would sit happily alongside the paper’s own FT 30, the pre-eminent barometer of the UK stock market since 1935.</p><p>It did not work out that way. The FTSE 100 grabbed attention from the off, just as its designers intended. It was created by the London Stock Exchange and the early players in the futures and options market for the then emerging era of electronic trading and derivative products.

It was an experience that sharpened the senses and offered rich rewards</p><p>How best to rejuvenate? Many opt for doing less: loafing, lounging, luxuriating. The problem with this is that modern life is lived mostly in the mind. Even if you don’t have a job that requires control of an inbox, the exhausting PR project of modern social interaction is inescapable. If you&nbsp;simply stop working, the same processes still whir on, even if in the background. By contrast, actively <em>doing</em> something entirely different, something requiring energy and devotion, draws voltage away from tired wires, lets them cool. That’s why I chose to do the GR20, the path that travels the length of Corsica. People call it the hardest trek in Europe, and that’s what I wanted: to descend from brain into body and restore myself through physical effort.</p><p>On the map, the challenge didn’t seem too daunti

Giving up certain things may be good for us, and yet the idea of someone just giving up is never appealing. Like alcoholics who need everybody to drink, there tends to be a determined cultural consensus that life is, and has to be, worth living (if not, of course, actually sacred).</p><p>There are, to put it as simply as possible, what turn out to be good and bad sacrifices (and sacrifice creates the illusion – or reassures us – that we can choose our losses).
