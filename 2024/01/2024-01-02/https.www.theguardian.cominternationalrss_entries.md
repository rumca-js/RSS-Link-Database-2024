<p>Rising temperatures have spurred an influx of beavers to Alaska and northern Canada ‘on a huge scale’</p><p>The stream through western Alaska never looked like this before. In aerial photography from the 1980s, it wove cleanly through the tundra, thin as thread. Today, in satellite images, it appears as a string of black patches: one large pond after another, dozens of metres apart.</p><p>It’s a transformation that is happening across the Arctic, the result of landscape engineering on an impressive scale. But this is no human endeavour to reshape the world. It is the work of the North American beaver, and there is no sign of it stopping.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/02/global-heating-beavers-alaska-northern-canada">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this underappreciated comedy series, Robinson and Sam Richardson play best friends who make bad adverts for hot tub salesmen and dodgy wig companies</p><p>Pinning down why Tim Robinson is funny is very difficult. The closest I have come to deciphering the humour in Netflix’s sketch comedy series I Think You Should Leave is that it follows the logic of dreams: no one in the sketches acts entirely human, with tiny slights and jealousies provoking mind-melting terror and rage, in scenarios and settings one step to the left of reality as we know it.</p><p>Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFj3tuNukTs">the baby of the year competition</a>, which has been going for “a gruelling three months”. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLfAf8oHrMo">The infamous hotdog guy</a>, who pretends he didn’t crash a hotdog-shaped car into a shop and is now internet shorthand for people trying to dodge blame.

British director and screenwriter who enjoyed huge success with his 1987 hit film Wish You Were Here<p>Grittiness and compassion were the twin hallmarks of the writer and director David Leland, who has died aged 82. He scripted a clutch of uncompromising films that launched the screen careers of Cathy Tyson, Emily Lloyd and Tim Roth. Leland’s writing was distinctly British in flavour but without the parochial sensibility that might have limited its appeal.</p><p>His early draft of Mona Lisa (1986), an underworld thriller about the relationship between a sex worker (Tyson) and her driver (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/30/bob-hoskins" title="">Bob Hoskins</a>), was tougher and nastier than the finished film. Leland shared the screenplay credit with its Irish director, Neil Jordan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/02/david-leland-obituary">Continue reading...</a>
