Throughout the history of RNA research, one can immediately notice a significant breakthrough during 2007 and 2008, in which several groups independently reported the discovery of intact noncoding RNA (ncRNA) sequences in extracellular space. Later on, the discovery of these extracellular ncRNAs led to a scope switch of RNA study, from their regulatory roles within the cells to signaling properties in cell-to-cell communications.

Plants have to be flexible to survive environmental changes, and the adaptive methods they deploy must often be as changeable as the shifts in climate and condition to which they adapt. To cope with drought, plant roots produce a water-repellent polymer called suberin that blocks water from flowing up towards the leaves, where it would quickly evaporate. Without suberin, the resulting water loss would be like leaving the tap running.

Infectious diseases pose a huge problem in poultry farming. Poultry farmers are often forced to rely on antibiotics to tackle this issue. However, this can sometimes result in germs developing resistance to these drugs. These resistant pathogens then find their way into our food via animal products. The frequent use of antibiotics can therefore pose potential health risks to both animals and humans.

This is particularly true of propulsion technologies beyond conventional chemical rockets and engines. One promising technology is the rotating detonation engine (RDE), which relies on one or more detonations that continuously travel around an annular channel.

However, this analysis can be difficult when there are multiple tissue slices that need to be analyzed jointly using state-of-the-art toolkits. It is challenging for researchers to assemble the slices and build the 3D structure manually.

If we could travel far beyond our galaxy, and look back upon the Milky Way, it would be a glorious sight. Luminous spirals stretching from a central core, with dust and nebulae scattered along the spiral edges. When you think about a galaxy, you probably imagine a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, but spirals make up only about 60% of the galaxies we see. That's because spiral galaxies only form when smaller galaxies collide and merge over time. Or so we thought, as a new study posted to the arXiv preprint server suggests that isn't the case.

Light pollution ruins dark skies. It's a scourge that ground-based observatories have to deal with in one form or another. Scientists used a small observatory in Japan to measure what changed when a nearby town improved its lighting practices. They also noted the challenges it still faces.

A recent study published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters investigates the potential existence of Mars-sized free-floating planets (FFPs)—also known as rogue planets, starless planets, and wandering planets—that could have been captured by our sun's gravity long ago and orbit in the outer solar system approximately 1,400 astronomical units (AU) from the sun. For context, the farthest known planetary body in the solar system is Pluto, which orbits approximately 39 AU from the sun, and is also part of the Kuiper Belt, which scientists estimate extends as far out as 1,000 AU from the sun.

Monitoring glucose levels is one of the key elements in health monitoring. A research team from the University of California, Berkeley, has now developed a battery-independent fluorescent nanosensor based on single-wall carbon nanotubes and an inactive form of the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx).

## TRAPPIST-1c isn't the exo-Venus we were hoping for, but don't blame the star

A recent study posted to the arXiv preprint server and accepted to The Astrophysical Journal uses computer models to investigate why the exoplanet, TRAPPIST-1c, could not possess a thick carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere despite it receiving the same amount of solar radiation from its parent star as the planet Venus receives from our sun, with the latter having a very thick carbon dioxide atmosphere.

Synthetic biology offers the opportunity to build biochemical pathways for the capture and conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2). Researchers at the Max-Planck-Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology have developed a synthetic biochemical cycle that directly converts CO2 into the central building block Acetyl-CoA.

Just like a doctor adjusts the dose of a medication to the patient's needs, the expression of therapeutic genes, those modified in a person to treat or cure a disease via gene therapy, also needs to be maintained within a therapeutic window. Staying within the therapeutic window is important as too much of the protein could be toxic, and too little could result in a small or no therapeutic effect.

## New high-speed video system uses sensors, infrared illumination to track insects in large wild areas

The newfound system is an ultrashort-orbital-period binary consisting of a subdwarf star and a white dwarf companion. The finding was reported in a paper published December 21 on the preprint server arXiv.
