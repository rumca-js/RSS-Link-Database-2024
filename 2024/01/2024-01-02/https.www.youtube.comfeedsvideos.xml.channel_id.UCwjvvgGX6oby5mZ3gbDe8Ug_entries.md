On December 26, 2023, the Shanghai Municipal People's Court publicly sentenced Hu Wenming, the commander-in-chief of China's first domestically built aircraft carrier, the Shandong, and former chairman of the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC). The court ruled that during his 20 years in office, he received bribes of about US$8.4 million. 
This number is much smaller than the information revealed by insiders. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison and fined 10 million yuan for taking bribes and abuse of power as an employee of a state-owned company. However, the sentence handed down by the Shanghai Intermediate Court made no mention of leaks, which had been widely rumored before.
