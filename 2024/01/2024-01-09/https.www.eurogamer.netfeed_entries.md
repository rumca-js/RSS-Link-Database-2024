Palworld, the open-world survival and crafting adventure from developer Pocketpair that looks a lot like Pok&eacute;mon with guns, is launching into early access on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass next Friday, 19th January.
</p><p>
Pocketpair describes Palworld as a "monster-catching, survival and crafting game" over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/">its Steam page</a>, but notes it also features "a variety of mechanics from other genres in order to provide a completely new experience for everyone." And while harmonious living alongside the Pals you catch (initially totalling over 100) is certainly possible - with the likes of idyllic farming, land and sea exploration, dungeon crawling, battling, building, and breeding all featured - it also looks to have a d

## Helldivers 2 PC specs and crossplay revealed ahead of February launch

Arrowhead Game Studios has shared more information on the PC version of its satirical sci-fi shooter sequel Helldivers 2 ahead of its PlayStation 5 and PC launch on 8th February, alongside confirmation of crossplay support between platforms.
</p><p>
Helldivers 2 follows the same basic template as its well-received predecessor (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-review">earned a Eurogamer Recommended badge</a> back in 2015), sending players - either working solo or in teams of up to four - on procedurally generated missions across hostile alien worlds to complete objectives, subjugate the locals, and orchestrate their escape. The likes of customisable loadouts and stratagems return in the sequel, but the major difference is a shift from a top-down perspective to third-person one this time around.

HBO has cast the role of Abby for its second season of The Last of Us. 
</p><p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-reportedly-close-to-casting-its-abby">previously suspected</a>, Kaitlyn Dever has secured the part. Dever was originally considered for the role of Ellie before the adaptation became a TV show, and the actress had aged out of consideration. 
</p><p>
The Booksmart and Dopesick actress will join Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsey's Ellie when filming begins next month.

Cult of the Lamb players asked, and the developer listened. The evil sheep-fronted management game is getting a 'sex' update.
</p><p>
This free update is known as Sins of the Flesh, and is coming (no pun intended, but, hey, as it is there anyway let's just roll with it) to platforms on 16th January.
</p><p>
Developer Massive Monster calls the upcoming content its "biggest and most wicked" update yet. It will include new progression systems, which will add more complexity to the gameplay. The Cult of the Lamb team also boasts about the arrival of "shiny poop, baneful brooms, and bigger, better buildings," so plenty to keep an eye out for.

## The Finals on PC: genuinely awesome destruction tech without sacrificing performance

Founded and staffed by many ex-DICE Frostbite tech gurus in 2018, the studio has exhibited a hardcore tech focus since its inception with tech demos and presentations into machine learning for animation and AI, open-source code repositories and of course ray-traced graphics. I always wondered what kind of game they were really making with all of this technology, and now I have the answer with The Finals. </p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given the heritage of its designers, this is a class-based FPS in the vein of Battlefield with objective-driven combat, released free-to-play on current-gen consoles and PC shortly before the holiday break in 2023. Its focus on level-busting destruction makes it a rather unique game from a tech perspective, so it seemed only natural

## Pacific Drive is a gloriously horrible trip into the cursed wilderness

It's sort of an extraction looter, in which you tumble into horrible worlds and try to emerge with something worth stealing. It's sort of a blend of Roadside Picnic, the novel about scavengers who explore a strange area of wilderness that's been thoroughly messed up by passing aliens, and My Summer Car, the Steam outsider art classic about building and maintaining a real junker and then tooling it through the woods. These are all fine ways of approaching the game, but for me it's much simpler - and much more thrilling. Pacific Drive is a series of bad things waiting to happen to you.</p><p>Let's make this clear: it's a science fiction game at heart. You cobble together an old station wagon and then drive it through the Zone, an expansive chunk of the Pacific

A handheld Sega Mega Drive, known as the Mega 95 and which plays original carts, has been announced by accessory maker Hyperkin.
</p><p>
As reported by to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24029916/sega-genesis-emulator-cartridges-handheld-hyperkin-95-mega-drive">The Verge</a>, this portable device is based on the company's MegaRetroN HD Gaming Console, which is also compatible with the Sega Mega Drive.
</p><p>
The Mega 95 is equipped with a five-inch display, which users can toggle to switch between 4:3 and 16:9 modes. As for its battery life - an ever important question for any handheld device - according to Hyperkin, it should last for 10 hours per charge.

The forthcoming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will be a tribute to the late Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy.
</p><p>
That's according to game director Axel Rydby who spoke to Eurogamer at a recent preview event at Rocksteady.
</p><p>
Indeed, the game includes a plaque in the Justice League base "in loving memory" of Conroy, along with a similar plaque for Arleen Sorkin who was the inspiration behind Harley Quinn.

Fans of Apex Legends are outraged at the cost of cosmetic items in the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth crossover event, that they fear will total over &pound;300.
</p><p>
The event begins later today in celebration of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth arriving next month, and includes a number of themed items, skins, and events. 
</p><p>
This is the first in-game crossover of its kind in Apex Legends and the potential cost of items is eye-watering for fans. On social media, the high cost has sparked fury in the game's community, although this is based on the current cost of packs that could be reduced once the event launches.

Akka Arrh is making the jump from the flat screen to virtual reality, via its upcoming arrival on PS VR2. 
</p><p>
Akka V-Arrh, as I am now dubbing it (it is still officially just called Akka Arrh) will be heading to Sony's PlayStation set in March. A more specific date is yet to be announced. However, when it does arrive, Jeff Minter's psychedelic head-banger promises to "transcend" its former contrastrains, and give us all an "unparalleled sensory odyssey" on its VR release.
</p><p>
"Here, players don't just witness the chaos; they step inside it," the PR proclaims. "In this surreal VR world of cascading shapes, colours, and sounds, every element of Minter's vision comes to life with an intensity and clarity that was once unimaginable."

Pok&eacute;mon TV, the app and website that let you watch episodes from the long-running Pok&eacute;mon anime for free, has been removed from app stores. 
</p><p>
For years, Pok&eacute;fans have been able to follow the saga of Ash Ketchum - and beyond - without needing to subscribe to a streaming service. But now Pok&eacute;mon TV is no longer able to be downloaded, and the service itself will go dark for good on 28th March. 
</p><p>
The situation highlights the fact that if you do want to go watch the Pok&eacute;mon series in order, you'll need access to multiple streaming services and a couple of paid subscriptions.

In a message posted to Instagram, Jones said one fan had left multiple voicemails "wanting to speak with me and requesting I call back" on the answering machine of her workplace.
</p><p>
Jones said the behaviour was "unacceptable" and amounted to stalking.

At its recent CES 2024 press conference, Sony took the chance to show off the company's future tech possibilities by driving a car onto the stage. Admittedly, that in itself isn't all that remarkable, but what makes this little stunt more interesting is that the car was being controlled by a PlayStation DualSense controller.
</p><p>
During a segment hosted by Honda's president Toshihiro Mibe talking about the car manufacturer's work with Sony, the exec spoke about "the joy of expanding life's potential". </p><p>Its vision expands beyond just your regular cars and motorcycles, with talk of the sky, ocean and outer space being shared. Sony's technologies will help Honda expand its "field of mobility", the company president explained. Then, the president and COO of Sony Honda Mobility Inc Izumi Kawanishi then joined his coll

Sony has provided a very brief first look at its Gravity Rush film project, courtesy of a quick clip shown during the company's CES 2024 press conference.
</p><p>
Around five seconds of footage, including a behind-the-scenes motion capture shot, can be glimpsed in the video below - it shows a blonde-haired character leaping from a rooftop, then soaring down through the buildings of a floating city.
</p><p>
At the end of the clip, the character then flies towards what looks like a red, dragon-like beastie. All of this takes place in rather realistic-like surroundings - a far cry from the anime-inspired visuals of the original games. Intriguing!

A The Last of Us spin-off TV series focusing on survivors Bill and Frank has been pitched.
</p><p>
The news comes from Nick Offerman, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">recently won an Emmy</a> for his portrayal of Bill in HBO's series.
</p><p>
Speaking backstage after the awards, the actor was asked about whether viewers could see more from Bill and Frank in the future. "Oh, great question but I would have to ask somebody with a higher pay grade than myself," he replied (thanks, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/01/nick-offerman-the-last-of-us-creative-arts-emmys-1235697069/">Deadline</a>).

Unity has announced a further round of layoffs, less than two months after its previous job cuts, that'll see it eliminate roughly 25 percent of its total workforce - around 1,800 employees - as part of a "company reset" it initially announced at the end of last year.
</p><p>
Unity <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-likely-to-announce-layoffs-to-cut-costs">confirmed additional layoffs</a> at the company were "likely" back in November, when it revealed it was assessing its portfolio "to focus on those products that are most valuable to our customers". Shortly after, it announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-makes-further-job-cuts-as-it-ends-agreement-with-weta-fx">ending its agreement with Weta FX</a>, resulting in the loss of 265 jobs - the company's fourth round of layoffs since the start of 2022.
