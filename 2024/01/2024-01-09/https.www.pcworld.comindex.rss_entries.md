<p>Here&rsquo;s a quickie but a goodie I wanted to pass on. At the Asus booth at CES 2024, I witnessed a simple, yet stunning motherboard innovation that, in retrospect, I&rsquo;m <em>shocked</em> I&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s all about making sure your PC&rsquo;s RAM is properly seated.
