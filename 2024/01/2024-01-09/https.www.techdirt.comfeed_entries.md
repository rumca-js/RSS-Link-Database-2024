It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s even a close question about who&#8217;s doing this and why. A slew of bills targeting drag shows and LGBTQ+ writing have been tossed into legislatures all over the [&#8230;]

We&#8217;re back from the holidays, and it&#8217;s time for a new episode of the Techdirt Podcast!

There’s plenty of hypocrisy and bad faith to go around in the ridiculous Claudine Gay plagiarism scandal. While Gay’s accusers are right that she technically violated Harvard’s plagiarism rules by copying phrases either without quotation marks or required attribution, they don’t actually care about plagiarism, only “scalping” Gay. What’s more, their own plagiarism accusations have [&#8230;]

It was a busy December for the Copia Institute (and me), even just at the U.S. Supreme Court.

Go NetChoice go. The trade group has been going around the country and blocking all the bad state level social media laws. Early on (with CCIA) it sued to stop Texas and Florida’s problematic laws. Last year it sued successfully to stop laws in Arkansas and California. Just a few weeks ago it sued Utah [&#8230;]

Finkelstein claimed he wanted to build “an alternative to a national [&#8230;]

Nearly four years ago, we discussed the online superhero game City of Heroes, which had been shut down officially by NCSoft, but which had survived in the shadows due to some fan-run servers.
