More than 65,000 men fall ill with prostate cancer each year in Germany. Twelve thousand of them develop a treatment-resistant form which eventually ends in death. Now, a team of researchers has developed an active substance that might in future represent a new treatment option. This substance, known as KMI169, targets an enzyme that plays an important role in the development of prostate cancer.

Felspar dust in the air can create clouds. The feldspar particles act as nucleation sites to which water molecules can attach extremely efficiently. Why this is the case has remained a mystery for a long time. Scientists have now studied feldspar using a special atoimic force microscope and managed to explain this remarkable property of feldspar on an atomic level. The atomic structure is just right to create a layer of OH-groups which in turn can connect to water molecules perfectly.

Researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery regarding the origins of non-meteoric water in natural spa waters located in central Japan. Based on numerical modeling, their results suggest that this water has been confined within the lithosphere for an extensive period of 1.5-5 million years. They identified three primary sources for this ancient water: the Philippine Sea Plate, the Pacific Plate, and ancient seafloor sediments, particularly in the Niigata and southwest Gunma regions.

From a wartime spread of antimicrobial resistant disease in Ukraine, to superbugs in China causing 'white lung' pneumonia in children, 2023 brought no shortage of new evidence that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to be a pressing problem globally, and this pattern shows no sign of abating in 2024 unless a radical shift occurs. To truly tackle the issue of AMR, researchers with the Global Strategy Lab (GSL) argue it needs to be understood as a socio-ecological challenge that accepts AMR as a phenomenon stemming from natural evolutionary processes. In other words, the war on bugs can't be won; what's needed is a major change in how people live with it.

Shuttlecocks, also known as birdies or birds, are traditionally made from duck feathers, but nylon shuttlecocks have become more widely used because of their superior durability. Their flight behavior, however, is far different from that of traditional feather birdies. Scientists have now explored the aerodynamic performance of nylon shuttlecocks at various flight speeds. Through computational analyses based on two-way fluid-structure interactions, the team coupled equations governing air flow with equations determining skirt deformation of a shuttlecock in flight.

Researchers used various sequencing technologies to explore the molecular characteristics of myeloid/natural killer cell precursor acute leukemia (MNKPL). They observed activation of the NOTCH1 and RUNX3 genes, with lower expression of the BCL11B gene. MNKPL cells were also highly sensitive to a drug called L-asparaginase. Collectively, these qualities make MNKPL distinct from other leukemia types. These insights will assist with more accurate clinical diagnoses and therapeutic development for MNKPL.
