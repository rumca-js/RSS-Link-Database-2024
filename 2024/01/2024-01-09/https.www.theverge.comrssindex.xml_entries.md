  <p id="I5uIZs">A few months after Intel’s CEO announced plans <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/27/23810360/intel-pat-gelsinger-ai-every-platform-promise">to put AI into “everything,”</a> we’re starting to get a clearer picture about where it will go first. Today, the company announced its AI-focused chip for the automotive sector or, as Intel describes it, “the first-generation AI-enhanced software-defined vehicle system-on-chip.” Intel also announced the acquisition of an energy management company and a new effort to standardize battery power for electric vehicles. </p>

<p id="rDZcaf">Walmart thinks it can make this happen, with the help of AI. The company announced a new feature of its InHome replenishment service that aims to automatically order the right stuff at the right time, and hand it off to a delivery person who can drop things off in a fridge in your house. Shoppers with the $20 monthly InHome membership already get the seamless drop-off, but they still have t
