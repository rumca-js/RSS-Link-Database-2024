Deadpool 3 looks like it’s gonna be big, which is great because it has to be! Who’s in Deadpool 3? Wolverine, almost certainly, even though we’re waiting on a big Deadpool 3 trailer still. Deadpool 3, 2024 ‘s ONLY MCU film, is a major opportunity for Marvel. Deadpool 3 has a big job ahead of it, many hopes and dreams may or may not be made real afterall, in Deadpool 3. Official word is scant, but there are several rumors and images from the set of Deadpool 3, Hugh Jackman the best known of all. What could this mean for Marvel?
Can the studio even carry off Deadpool as a character? Can Deadpool do the job of widening the MCU? Will we finally see in Deadpool 3, X-Men?! If we did, it could significantly impact Secret Wars, Loki, and more, but X-Men in the MCU is definitely on most fans’ wishlists. Is DP3 is Kevin Feige’s funnel to the Avengers: Secret Wars people want? If so, it puts Kang into question, and whether we really will work up to The Kang Dynasty for the rest of Marvel Phase

In a Good Morning America exclusive interview, Jonathan Majors addressed whether he’ll work in Hollywood again. Jonathan Majors gave his first interview since being found guilty of 3rd degree assault and harassment back in December, with sentencing happening Feb. 6th. As for the charges, they carry with them a sentence of up to one year in jail. He was, however, found not guilty of both intentional assault in the third degree and aggravated harassment in the second degree. As you might remember, the charges stem from March 25th, when Majors made a 911 call informing authorities he found his ex-partner, Grace Jabbari, unconscious in their apartment. He was subsequently arrested after police found Jabbari had bruises and other injuries on her body. Also updates on a Five Nights At Freddy’s sequel, plus a whole lot more in today’s fix.
