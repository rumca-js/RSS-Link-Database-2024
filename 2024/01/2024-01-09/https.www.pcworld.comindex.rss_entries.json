At the Asus booth at CES 2024, I witnessed a simple, yet stunning motherboard innovation that, in retrospect, I&rsquo;m <em>shocked</em> I&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s all about making sure your PC&rsquo;s RAM is properly seated. As veteran PC builders no doubt know &mdash; and new PC builders no doubt curse &mdash; improperly seated memory kits can cause all sorts of pesky issues and can be very difficult to notice in the moment. Worse, depending on the type of CPU cooler you&rsquo;re using, getting to your installed RAM to check if it&rsquo;s properly inserted can be a massive headache while troubleshooting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asus PR manager Juan Jose Guerrero told me that many of the support calls the company receives can be traced back to this singular annoying issue.

I mean, it&rsquo;s impressive as hell just off pure specs alone: This 32-inch, 4K, 240Hz OLED monitor with DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification and 99 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color spectrum is already better than everyone owns except the 0.01 percent of PC enthusiasts while the integration of OLED Care 2.0 (which automatically dims the black line between two open windows as well as shortcut icons if you spend lengthy time on the desktop) should help reduce two irritating causes of potential burn-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stop there, and this beast rocks.
