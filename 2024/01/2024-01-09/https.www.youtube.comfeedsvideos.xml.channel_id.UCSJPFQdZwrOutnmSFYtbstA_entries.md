Normally January is the dumping ground for terrible movies that nobody wants to see, but One Life, starring Anthony Hopkins and Helena Bonham Carter, might be the exception. A gripping and poignant true story about the man who helped rescue hundreds of children from German-occupied Europe, its definitely a recommendation from me.
