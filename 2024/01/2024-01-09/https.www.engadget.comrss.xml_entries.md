<p>Imagine being at a crowded convention or noisy bar and trying to have a conversation with someone across from you. It's tough enough for people with hearing to focus on what the person is saying, not to mention those with hearing loss. Assistive technology company OrCam has rolled into CES 2024 with a host of new products including a set of devices and an iPhone app designed to help those with hearing loss deal with auditory overload. The platform is called OrCam Hear and after a quick hands-on at the show in Las Vegas, I'm pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>OrCam Hear consists of a pair of earbuds and a dongle that plugs into any phone, and you'll use the app to control who you want to listen to. The system listens to voices for a few seconds (via the dongle) and uses AI to create speaker profiles for each person that then allows you to "selectively isolate specific voices even in noisy environments." This targets the issue sometimes known as the "cocktail party problem" that's a chall

<p>The official X account belonging to the Securities and Exchange Commission was briefly “compromised,” the regulator said, after an apparently rogue post on X temporarily juiced bitcoin prices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the SEC’s official X account tweeted that bitcoin ETFs had been approved “for listing on all registered national securities exchanges.” The tweet included an official-looking graphic featuring a quote from SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, Gensler himself quickly clarified from his X account that the post from @SECGov was the result of a "compromised” account.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted,” Gensler <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1744833049064288387">wrote</a>. “The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.”</p>

It had multiple sizes of transparent OLEDs (the show's theme appears to be transparent displays) and a gaming monitor capable of 480Hz refresh rates – double what we’re used to seeing. Perhaps the most interesting things at its showroom were LG Display’s most advanced OLED panels yet, featuring its META technology 2.0. While it sounds like promotional fluff (and there’s some of that here), the company is trying to address arguably OLED’s biggest weakness.</p>
<p>While the company revealed its META technology last year, version 2.0 features advanced microlens arrays (now called MLA+). These are micrometer-sized lenses with a Dragonfly eye design that improves the viewing angle of OLED displays up to 160 degrees.

<p>SAG-AFTRA, the union representing thousands of performers, has struck a deal with an AI voice acting platform aimed at making it easier for actors to license their voice for use in video games. Under the deal, which was announced during a press event at CES 2024, SAG-AFTRA members will be able to work with Replica Studios to license their voice to game studios.</p>
<p>Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union's top negotiator, said that the agreement “paves the way for professional voiceover artists to safely explore new employment opportunities for their digital voice replicas.” The agreement comes as Hollywood is still grappling with the use of AI. Last year, SAG-AFTRA reached a deal with Hollywood studios that included AI protections following a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sag-aftra-ends-strike-after-securing-a-deal-that-protects-members-from-the-threat-of-ai-035253314.html"><ins>months-long strike</ins></a>.

<p>The modern classic mystery game <em>Immortality</em> is finally coming to PS5 on January 23 and it’ll cost $20, which is in line with the price on other platforms. It already exists on PC, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/immortality-arrives-on-ios-android-225120433.html"><ins>Android and iOS.</ins></a> The game was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/immortality-delayed-august-30th-213206816.html"><ins>originally released back in 2022.</ins></a></p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Immortality</em> is more of an interactive film trilogy than a video game, recalling full-motion titles from the 1990s. The surreal narrative tasks you with solving the disappearance of an actress named Marissa Marcel. You do this by scrubbing through video clips and gathering clues. Creator Sam Barlow has likened the gameplay to a “mental Metroidvania”, in that you return to previously-viewed clips once you have a new understanding of some aspect of the mystery.</p>

<p><em>Palworld</em>, often described as “Pokémon with guns,” finally has an Early Access release date. In addition to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/palworld-second-trailer-not-pokemon-we-swear-220536745.html">violent battles</a>, the game tackles labor exploitation themes with a sardonic sense of humor while adding (perhaps) just enough changes to evade <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-29-pokemon-essentials-nintendo-takedown.html">Nintendo’s lawyers</a>. It launches in Early Access on Steam and Game Pass on January 19.</p>
<p>At first glance, <em>Palworld</em>’s trailers make the game look like a simple and charming 3D open-world riff on Pokémon. You’ll see battles with strange monsters, vaguely resembling those in the creature collecting franchise, including players capturing them inside a sphere after a victory.</p>

The movie, appropriately titled <em>The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu,</em> will be helmed by Jon Favreau, who created the Disney+ streaming TV show.</p>
<p>Fans have been speculating why there hasn’t been a renewal announcement regarding a new season of <em>The Mandalorian,</em> and this could be why. The film’s going into production this year, which is likely when a new season of the show would have been created. Beyond Favreau, the producers include franchise luminaries Kathleen Kennedy and Dave Filoni. There’s no plot synopsis, but Kennedy says the “new story is a perfect fit for the big screen.”</p>

<p>Amazon says this tool offers a “more natural way of getting to know your new car.” You can ask how various features work, like the parking assistance system, and get conversational answers. Both companies suggest that this voice technology will “strip away complexity and minimize distractions in the car.”</p>

<p>Formlabs has rolled up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-what-we-expect-in-las-vegas-this-year-140040145.html">CES 2024</a> in Las Vegas with its customary bundle of announcements for its class-leading 3D printers. The company unveiled several new tools and materials at this year's show, but the most interesting has to be its Premium Teeth Resin, yet another foray into the dentistry world. It’s intended to be used to create 3D-printed dentures as well as for temporary restorations that sit on implants like All-On-X. The company says it’s already been registered with the FDA as a Class II biocompatible material, and has had its longevity validated.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first step the company has made into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-11-texas-3d-printed-dentures-inmates.html">dentistry space</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-12-formlabs-ces-2019.html">already offers the tools to make dentures</a>.

<p>Laptop RAM is facing a conundrum. The SODIMM standard — which is basically a shrunken form of desktop RAM modules — is almost 25 years old and facing an upcoming speed wall. With the demand for thinner machines, laptop makers have also started soldering LPDDR RAM directly onto motherboards, or bundling it into mobile SoCs like Apple Silicon, both of which make upgrades impossible. At <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-live-coverage-from-las-vegas-000021405.html">CES 2024</a> in Las Vegas, Micron says it's the first to market with a compelling alternative: LPCAMM2 RAM modules using LPDDR5X.</p>
<p>Sure, it's an acronym salad, but there's a chance that Micron's technology, along with other LCAMM2 offerings, could be a huge memory upgrade for laptops. The news comes after the JEDEC standards body officially <a href="https://www.jedec.org/news/pressreleases/jedec-publishes-new-camm2-memory-module-standard">published the CAMM2 standard in December</a>, and <a class="rapid-with-

<p>Smart plugs are key members of any connected home setup. They add smarts to otherwise “dumb” devices like lamps, coffee makers, fans and anything else with a simple on/off switch. Once connected, you can set a schedule to have a lamp flick on just before sunset, or power on your humidifier an hour before bedtime. You can also program routines, like having all lights go out when you say goodnight to Alexa. But as we’ve learned in our tests, some are better than others at maintaining connectivity and working with a variety of voice assistants, and some are complicated to set up. Based on months of testing, these are our top picks for the best smart plugs worth your money.</p>
<h2><br />What to consider when buying a smart plug</h2>
<p>Before you buy one, it helps to know what a smart plug can and can’t do. They work best with things that have an on/off switch, making them great for lamps and other lights. If you want a plug-in fan to move some air around before you get home, a smart

<p>OpenAI and its biggest backer, Microsoft, are facing several lawsuits accusing them of using other people's copyrighted works without permission to train the former's large language models (LLMs). And based on what OpenAI told the House of Lords Communications and Digital Select Committee, we might see more lawsuits against the companies in the future. It would be &quot;impossible to train today's leading AI models without using copyrighted materials,&quot; OpenAI wrote in its <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/126981/pdf/">written evidence</a> (PDF) submission for the committee's inquiry into LLMs, as first reported by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/08/ai-tools-chatgpt-copyrighted-material-openai"><em>The Guardian</em></a>.</p>

<p>CES 2024 may not have officially started yet, but the news is already in full swing. The show’s official dates are January 9th to 12th, with the 8th usually being a day of press conferences ahead of the convention centers opening to attendees. Which makes this… Day 0 of CES 2024.</p>
<p>The announcements on this day usually gives us an idea of what to expect for the rest of the week, and this year we’re already seeing some emerging trends. Samsung and LG both brought us transparent display tech, we saw a slew of pet and kitchen gadgets, while vibrating and massage chairs have taken over the showfloor.

<p>I don't like talking on the phone in public. Often, I'm gossiping about something I have no business discussing around other people, or I'm talking about some tech product that has yet to be launched. That's why a product like Skyted's Silent Mask entices me. The company <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skyted/skyted-stay-connected-in-silence/posts">launched its Kickstarter campaign today</a> at CES 2024 for its noise-reducing wearable that would allow you to speak freely about confidential information anywhere without worrying about people around you hearing. It's already broken its $8,800 goal many times over, and as of this writing it's raised $54,000, meaning it's a concept that resonated with many people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm skeptical of most Kickstarter projects, given the high likelihood they're vaporware, but the Skyted prototype I checked out here at the show felt solid. It didn't have an elastic head strap for me to put it on my head, so I had to hold it to my

<p>I've always been curious how easy it is to work while you're using one of those under-desk bikes and, thanks to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-what-we-expect-in-las-vegas-this-year-140040145.html">CES 2024</a>, now I know. My jaunt to Las Vegas has taken me to visit LifeSpan, who was showing off its recently-released Ampera standing desk bike. Unlike some desk bikes, Ampera is designed to capture your energy and use it to charge your phone via its 15W Qi charging plate. And, if you feel your legs have more power in them, you can re-juice your laptop via the 65W USB-C port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't even need to plug it in, since it operates entirely under its own power, or at least the power it has once you've given it some. The company's official estimates suggest you could get a phone up to 50 percent charge in half an hour. And, if you cycle at speeds over 60 rpm, you'll be able to produce 65 watts per hour, enough to put some decent charge in your laptop or USB batter

One company that's added a dash of AI to its spice rack is Seergrills, a UK-based startup comprised of engineers and product developers. Its flagship model, <a href="https://seergrills.com/">the Perfecta</a>, can cook a one-inch-thick ribeye steak in 90 seconds.

<p>MSI has introduced a handheld gaming device called Claw at CES 2024 in Las Vegas. And unlike its biggest rivals the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-oled-review-its-just-better-180038030.html">Steam Deck</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-review-the-steam-decks-most-powerful-rival-specs-price-080029032.html">ASUS ROG Ally</a>, it's powered by Intel's processors instead of AMD's. The Claw runs on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-unveils-core-ultra-its-first-chips-with-npus-for-ai-work-150021289.html">Intel's new Core Ultra</a> chips and comes integrated with Intel's XeSS technology, which uses advanced AI upscaling algorithms to boost FPS for a smooth gaming experience. MSI says that will allow users to enjoy even resource-intensive AAA games on a handheld device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device also uses MSI's thermal technology design called the Cooler Boost Hyperflow that redirects airflow to cool internal components so that it doesn't overhea

The company has unveiled an at-home digital urinary tract infection (UTI) testing kit that provides what it calls "gold standard accuracy results" via a two-minute test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use it, just pee on the provided UTI test strip and scan it to obtain results via Vivoo's app in "seconds," the company says. If the result is positive, customers can then connect with a doctor to obtain a prescription if required. The company says the product "saves customers time, prevents confusion in readings, and digitalizes the data so customers can share results with healthcare providers via the app, if instant treatment is desired." From the looks of it, the results are

Sadly, it’s hard to talk about what it is and what it does without robbing it of its mystery, so apologies in advance: It’s essentially a system that pulls data from the car’s suite of sensors, which then helps control a specially-deconstructed music file. But, as joyless as that description sounds, once you’ve experienced it, you’ll wonder why it hasn’t been done before. Not to mention that, at the risk of gushing, it really does deepen the emotional connection between driving and the music yo

<p>Sony's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-live-coverage-from-ces-unveiled-000021968.html">CES 2024</a> presentation didn't have much news for the first 25 minutes, but then the company revealed a new virtual reality creation headset with... no name so far, aimed at "spatial content creation." With a matte gray finish, the headset looks like a stripped-down PSVR2, and there appear to be two cameras facing out from the front. There is also a controller-wand and a smaller peripheral similar in size to a ring. The new hardware is apparently aimed at creators and artists who manipulate and craft products in virtual spaces.</p>
<p>Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said it would offer a "crisp viewing experience" and "intuitive interaction for 3D design", teasing a device aimed at professionals, similar to its professional-level cameras and devices.&nbsp;</p>

These vehicles are still in the concept stage and aren't the kind of cars you're going to go out and buy to get around town or go on vacation — at least, not yet. Instead the PV5, the first vehicle Kia is planning, will focus on business utilities like ride-hailing, delivery and other business utilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably the coolest thing about the PV5 is how modular it is. Kia showed off four different configurations. The standard is a small van, but you can swap in an extended roof if you need more space. You can also swap the back two thirds out entirely and have it in a pickup truck configuration, and finally there's a taxi configuration focused on transporting passen

<p>For years, ROG Phone users had to put up with average camera quality for the sake of mobile gaming experience, and ASUS blamed it on cost reasons. To put it bluntly, it was either ROG Phone for gaming, or Zenfone for photography. Now that we've entered 2024, the Taiwanese tech giant finally has a change of heart. Announced at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2024-live-coverage-from-ces-unveiled-000021968.html">CES 2024</a>, the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/phones/rog-phone-8/">ROG Phone 8</a> and <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/phones/rog-phone-8-pro/">8 Pro</a> essentially blend together the best of both worlds, featuring the usual trove of gaming aids in — at last — a brand new design, along with a set of significant camera upgrades derived from the Zenfone line.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, NUC stands for Next Unit of Compute and refers to a line of ultra-portable desktop PCs and barebones computer kits. These are complete systems that you can hold with one hand, and the ROG NUC is no different.
