<p>Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act is at the heart of the court’s latest blockbuster abortion case, which comes<strong> </strong>out of Idaho</p><p>Mylissa Farmer’s pregnancy was doomed. But no one would help her end it.</p><p>Over the course of a few days in August 2022, Farmer visited two hospitals in Missouri and Kansas, where doctors agreed that because the 41-year-old’s water had broken just 18 weeks into her pregnancy, there was no chance that she would give birth to a healthy baby. Continuing the pregnancy could risk Farmer’s health and life – yet the doctors could not act.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/09/emergency-abortion-supreme-court-case-emtala-idaho">Continue reading...</a>

Italian artist whose idiosyncratic sculptures and installations were part of the ‘arte povera’ movement of the late 1960s and 70s<p>The most formative experience in the life of the Italian artist Giovanni Anselmo, who has died aged 89, came during a dawn visit to Stromboli, one of the Aeolian Islands off the coast of Sicily, in August 1965. Standing near the summit of the volcano, above the rising sun, he saw that he had no shadow. He realised then that it had been cast not on to the ground but invisibly into the ash-laden air. “My own person,” he later said, “via the invisible shadow, came into contact with the light, the infinite.”</p><p>This extraordinary expression of an ordinary event led to the work <a href="https://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/269-giovanni-anselmo/works/image2275/" title="">Shadow Towards the Infinity of the Peak of Stromboli During Dawn, August 6, 1965</a>, whereby Anselmo drew geometric lines emerging from his image into the whiteness of a blank sheet o
