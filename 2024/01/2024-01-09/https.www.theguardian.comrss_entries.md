Some of the positions are, of course, up for debate but this is too short a tea-timely email to get into that discussion. There are, however, half-a-dozen players who are automatic picks. Lev Yashin, Paolo Maldini, Diego Maradona, Leo Messi, Pelé and Franz Beckenbauer. They are The Untouchables or The Non-Negotiables, to give them their slightly less catchy nickname. No Greatest XI can be built without these six, nor shall it be. Regrettably, Cruyff, CR7, R9, Xavi, Ronaldinho, Zidane, Di Stéfano, Puskas, Charlton and co are all going to have to fit around them. And no, you can’t have Zizou as a holding midfielder.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/09/football-daily-fare

The director’s first two features, 2013’s Coast of Death and 2020’s Red Moon Tide, showed the coastal landscape of his native Galicia in sweeping, spectral glory. Myths, ghosts and spectres of death swirl as locals recall stories of shipwrecks, fishermen lost at sea, and rumours of a legendary sea monster.</p><p>“I’ve been digging into contemplative cinema,” says Patiño, 40, of his earlier work, “and wanted to go further into this idea of an introspective, meditative experience.” He began thinking about “the idea of the invisible in cinema. Suddenly, this very literal idea of making a film to watch with your eyes closed appeared.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com

<p>Germany and Bayern Munich could not quite fathom where to play the young Beckenbauer, so he effectively invented a role for himself</p><p>“For me,” Helmut Schön said of Franz Beckenbauer in February 1965 after calling him up to the West Germany team for the first time, “he is the player of the future. Maybe not in midfield, perhaps up front.”</p><p>People were always looking at Beckenbauer and seeing in him a being from another age, and that meant that, for a long time, nobody really knew what to make of him. He was handsome, charismatic and languid, a player of effortless elegance guaranteed to enrage those who believed the game was about industry, sweat and graft. He was technically gifted. He saw things others didn’t. He had grace and intelligence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2024/jan/09/franz-beckenbauer-was-a-player-out-of-time-who-made-football-evolve-with-him">Continue reading...</a>

Stone age artists were too awed by mammoths to notice the tiny rodents.

One of their favourites is the artist’s studio: a messy setting with lots ofmaterials, from the smelly to the potentially edible.</p><p>The tidying mouse in wildlife photographer Rodney Holbrook’s film has gone viral after being caught by a night vision camera.
