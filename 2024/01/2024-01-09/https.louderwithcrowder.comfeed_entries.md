But when you start a debate with insults, it probably means you have no justification for your claims to begin with. That is why PBS produced a documentary about reparations, but rather than trying to use evidence-based claims to back up their stance, they went straight to the insults, alleging that anyone who disagreed with their illogical claims was just radiating “white privilege.”</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
