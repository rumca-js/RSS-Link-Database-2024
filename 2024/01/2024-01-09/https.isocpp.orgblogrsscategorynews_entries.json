Callable Concepts enable the compiler to check if a given callable meets specific requirements, such as having certain member functions or satisfying particular type traits, before allowing it to be used in a template or function. This helps improve code readability, maintainability, and error detection, as it provides clearer and more structured ways to define the expected behavior and capabilities of callabl", "link": "https://isocpp.org//blog/2024/01/breaking-down-cpp20-callable-concepts-john-farrier", "date_published": "2024-01-09T17:55:28+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en", "thumbnail": null, "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://isocpp.org/blog/rss/category/news", "title": "Easily Protect Your C++ Code Against Integer Overflow With SafeInt -- by Giovanni Dicanio", "description": "<p>\n\tInteger overflows can be hidden inside your C++ code and can cause subtle nasty bugs.</p>\n<p>\n\tFortunately, it's easy to guard your code against those subtle bugs, thanks to an open-source easy-to-use library:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<h3>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://giodicanio.com/2023/11/13/protecting-your-c-plus-plus-code-against-integer-overflow-made-easy-by-safeint/\">Protecting Your C++ Code Against Integer Overflow Made Easy by SafeInt</a></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\tby Giovanni Dicanio</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFrom the article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIn previous blog posts I discussed the problem of integer overflow and some subtle bugs that can be caused by that.
