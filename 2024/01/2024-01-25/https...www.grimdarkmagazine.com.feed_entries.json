Barnes", "page_rating_visits": 0, "description": "<p>S.A Barnes\u2019 Ghost Station follows Dr. Ophelia Bray, a psychiatrist who needs time to let fervor over the public suicide of one of her patients subside.

The crew includes Severin, the commander of the mission, Kate, the engineer and second in command, Birch, the pilot, Liana, the scientist, Suresh, in charge of inventory and whose jokes serve largely to irritate everyone, and Ava, who has recently died by wandering outside on a mission without telling anyone.
