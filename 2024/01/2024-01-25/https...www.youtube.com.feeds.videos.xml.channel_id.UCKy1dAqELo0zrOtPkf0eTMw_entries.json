Performance is obviously worse, the audio issues are glaring, you won\u2019t be able to nickname your beloved Pals, and you\u2019re limited to a much smaller group of friends. All of that adds up to an experience that is indisputably worse, but I was at least able to look past the vast majority of these bumps in the road with relative ease, because underneath it all is the same awesome survival game that I haven\u2019t been able to put down. Given time, I fully expect the Xbox-specific issues to get cleaned up as this Early Access dark horse continues to evolve \u2013 until then, Xbox players still have a solid game on their hands.\n\nNote: This review is specifically for the versions of Palworld available on Xbox and through the Microsoft Store on PC", "artist": "IGN", "source_obj__id": 210, "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/B3-5JrOsoHo/hqdefault.jpg", "album": "", "dead": false}, {"tags": [], "vote": 0, "age": null, "language": null, "bookmarked": false, "permanent": false, "page_rating": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "date_published": "2024-01-25T23:00:10+00:00", "page_rating_contents": 0, "user": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwO8GTil5NI", "page_rating_votes": 0, "title": "Tekken 8 - Heat Mode Guide", "page_rating_visits": 0, "description": "The Heat System is a new mechanic in the Tekken series, and represents Tekken 8's more aggressive playstyle.

The company is continuing its password sharing crackdown and doing away with its $11.99 ad-free option. That means the ad-free tier will now be limited to Standard and Premium. And as we reported with its previous price hikes, if you have the premium subscription plan, you\u2019ll be paying $23 dollars a month in the U.S. With the lowest priced ad-free subscription plan being $12 dollars a month. Those tiers saw a $2 dollar increase from their previous monthly fees. Netflix\u2019s move to an ad-supported subscription model might be inspired by YouTube, whose videos are laden with 2 sometimes 3 ads in a row before you get to the content you want to watch. If you don\u2019t have an ad-blocker installed, of course. Regardless, #Netflix obviously sees the value in an ad-supported model which is likely increasing revenue for the streaming giant.", "artist": "IGN", "source_obj__id": 210, "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/uveEEFRaGus/hqdefault.jpg", "album": "", "dead": false}, {"tags": [], "vote": 0, "age": null, "language": null, "bookmarked": false, "permanent": false, "page_rating": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "date_published": "2024-01-25T00:00:09+00:00", "page_rating_contents": 0, "user": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoVAlwuISZE", "page_rating_votes": 0, "title": "Diablo 4 - Official Season of the Construct Battle Pass Trailer", "page_rating_visits": 0, "description": "Watch the latest trailer for Diablo IV to see what to expect with the Season of the Construct battle pass, featuring the clockwork equid mount, spheral barding mount armor, awoken clockwork equid mount, awoken spheral barding mount armor, new portals and armor, and more.", "artist": "IGN", "source_obj__id": 210, "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/GoVAlwuISZE/hqdefault.jpg", "album": "", "dead": false}]
