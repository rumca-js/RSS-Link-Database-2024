<p>Deno 1.40, the latest version of the JavaScript runtime positioned as a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3668660/deno-vs-nodejs-which-is-better.html">rival to Node.js</a>, has been launched with a Temporal API for advanced date and time operations.</p><p>The update was <a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.40" rel="nofollow">announced January 25</a>. Deno can be accessed from <a href="https://deno.com/" rel="nofollow">deno.com</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.40#temporal-api" rel="nofollow">Temporal API</a> is intended to address shortcomings of the existing <code>Date</code> object in JavaScript. It’s available with the <code>–-unstable-temporal</code> flag. Temporal acts as a top-level namespace that brings a modern date/time API to JavaScript. Temporal provides separate classes for date-only, time-only, and other scoped use cases, making code more readable and preventing bugs caused by incorrectly assuming 0, UTC,

<p>Back in the early 1990s, I worked in a large telecoms research lab, as part of the Advanced Local Loop group. Our problem domain was the “last mile”—getting services to peoples’ homes. One of my research areas involved thinking about what might happen when the network shift from analog to digital services was complete.</p><p>I spent a great deal of time in the lab’s library, contemplating what computing would look like in a future of universal bandwidth. One of the concepts that fascinated me was ubiquitous computing, where computers disappear into the background and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent" rel="nofollow">software agents become our proxies</a>, interacting with network services on our behalf. That idea inspired work at Apple, IBM, General Magic, and many other companies.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3712423/building-ai-agents-with-semantic-kernel.html#jump">To read this article in full, please clic

<p>When we build database-backed enterprise applications, we generally want to isolate our entity models, the DbContext, and the logic for database initialization and migration to maintain a clean architecture. We can do this by taking advantage of the Code First approach in Entity Framework Core.</p><p>This article presents a discussion of the Code First approach in EF Core with code examples to illustrate the concepts. To use the code examples provided in this article, you should have Visual Studio 2022 installed in your system.
