In a brazen confession, Davis explains that he defies the stated goals of DEI – to give every family an equal chance of admission – because in practice, he has blocked “hundreds” of families from admission due to their differences in perspective on the value of DEI.

Journalist: “How many people have you deterred away from the school because they weren't aligned with DEI?” 
Quincy Davis, DEI Director, Mount Tamalpais, CA: “It’s in the hundreds.”
