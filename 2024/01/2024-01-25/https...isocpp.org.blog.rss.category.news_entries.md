	From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		The Decorator Pattern allows developers to seamlessly decorate or wrap objects with new behaviors or responsibilities, ensuring that the enhancements are scalable, manageable, and, most importantly, interchangeable. This capability is crucial in an era where software requirements are constantly evolving, demanding adaptable and resilient systems to change.</p>
	<p>
		Let&rsquo;s illustrate this with a basic C++ example. Consider a window in a user interface as the Component. You want to add functionalities like scrollbars or a border without redesigning the windo

<p>
	About the video:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		We released a new video which compares Generic and Meta Programming and how they are used in various computer languages like C++, Rust, and Go. In this video we also explain the definition of Template Meta Programming and when TMP is actually Reflection.</p>
	<p>
		Simply using a template does not imply you are doing template meta programming and using a code generator does not mean you have implemented reflection.</p>
