<p>Party believes Trump has lock on nomination and he wants to accuse Biden of being weak on immigration – meaning deal that linked aid to border security appears doomed</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. The fallout from <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s win in the New Hampshire primary has reached the US Capitol, where reports have emerged that the top Senate Republican is ready to walk away from a deal to send military assistance to Ukraine and Israel.

Republicans now believe Trump has a lock on the party’s presidential nomination, and, on the campaign trail, the former president wants to be able to accuse <strong>Joe Biden</strong> of failing to stop a surge of migrants crossing the southern border. The agreement under discussion in Congress would have changed immigration policy to discourage migrants, while also unlocking GOP support for military assistance to Israel and Ukraine, a country whose cause the party’s far right has turned against.</p><p>I
