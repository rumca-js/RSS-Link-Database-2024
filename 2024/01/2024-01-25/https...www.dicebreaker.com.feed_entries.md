Evil Genius Games found itself at odds with the giant streaming platform after Netflix accused the studio of breaching its confidentiality agreement at GAMA in 2023.</p><p>Evil Genius Games&rsquo; owner D. Todd Scott released a joint statement with Netflix on January 24th claiming that both parties have buried the litigious hatchet, and the tabletop maker would reach out to retailers about issuing pre-order refunds &ldquo;within the next 7-10 days&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;The parties are pleased that they were able to amicably resolve this dispute. Netflix thanks Evil Genius for their hard work and professional

Publisher Steamforged Games announced an officially sanctioned line of print-on-demand files and will release updated rules that support this new version for free.</p><p>Fans hoping for a full-throated rededication to the Blood Bowl-esque skirmish sport will need to temper their reservations. Steamforged co-founders <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZLhaEsFOHs&amp;ab_channel=SteamforgedGames">Mat Hart and Rich Loxom said</a> that the studio would love to eventually &ldquo;actively support development&rdquo; if &ldquo;people rediscover [Guild Ball] again&rdquo;. Translation: once it becomes financially viable.</p><p>In the meantime, Steamforged will release free STL files for Guild Ball&rsquo;s Kickoff Set that players ca

Having played a preview copy several years ago, it was a largely forgettable experience that felt overly complicated purely because it was based on a video game series that&rsquo;s known for its complexity.</p><p>Fast forward to Essen Spiel 2023 and a representative from Larian Studios, the company behind the board game and last year&rsquo;s D&amp;D video game Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3, describes how the design team for the Divinity board game chose to scrap the original version and redesign it from the ground up.</p><p>Though there was no negative feedback from the Kickstarter backers of the <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/board-game/best-games/upcoming-board-games">upcoming board game</a>, th

## Yu-Gi-Oh!'s next set is apparently packed with Dark Souls references

Molten dragons, pelt-covered knights and a certain blindfolded maiden are only the start of the references.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/trading-card-game/best-games/best-trading-collectible-expandable-card-games">popular TCG</a> loves to pack its card designs with allusions to pop culture - Super Sentai, Star Wars, Godzilla, Skyrim and publisher Konami&rsquo;s other properties such as Metal Gear and Castlevania all have their own slightly altered homages. Now, it seems as though Lordran and the lands of the Eternal Flame will enjoy a little cardbo

## How an unassuming Magic: The Gathering token overtook one of its priciest star cards

The best stats for cost, the biggest meta share, the most iconic deck, the most demanded reprint, the highest price: Tarmogoyf was all five. During the Fate Reforged Pro Tour in 2015, it was the most played creature in Modern and, shortly after the tournament, commanded a price tag in excess of $200 - which is unheard of these days for a card still able to be reprinted. Since then, though, Tarmogoyf has fallen from the limelight - so far, in fact, that it was recently <a href="https://twitter.com/CCR_Grindcast/status/1744753536498287040">outpriced by a Goblin Shaman token creature</a>. What is this Goblin Shaman thing? Why doesn&rsquo;t it have a mana cost, or a real
