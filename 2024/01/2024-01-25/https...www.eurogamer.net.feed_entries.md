Fortnite maker Epic Games says it'll be launching a native iOS version of the Epic Games Store - and bringing Fortnite back to iOS devices - following today's announcement that Apple will soon allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices to comply with new EU rules. That's as Epic boss Tim Sweeney calls Apple's revised guidelines "hot garbage".

PC players who've been patiently awaiting the arrival of Horizon Forbidden West on their platform of choice now have a date to mark in the calendars: the action-adventure sequel is coming to Steam and the Epic Games Store in its Complete Edition guise on 21st March.
</p><p>
Horizon Forbidden West - which continues the adventures of protagonist Aloy in an lush open world populated by majestic robot wildlife - originally launched for PS4 and PS5 back in February 2022, with its Burning Shores expansion arriving the following year.
</p><p>
As you might imagine, the Complete Edition (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-forbidden-west-complete-edition-announced-for-pc-playstation-5">launched for PlayStation last October</a>) bundles the base game and expansion together, along with a variety of in-g

With new EU rules against anti-competitive practices looming, Apple has announced it'll soon be permitting developers to release Game-Pass- and storefront-style catalogue apps, containing multiple streamable and installable games and programmes, onto its App Store.
</p><p>
These new apps can include "streaming games, mini-apps, mini-games, chatbots, and plug-ins", and Apple says developers "will be able to" incorporate its In-App Purchase system to offer users paid digital content or services "such as a subscription for an individual chatbot."
</p><p>
Its initial announcement doesn't highlight the cut Apple will want from this new style of app (currently it charges developers a 30 percent fee for paid apps and in-app purchases) - or if the use of its In-App Purchase system is mandatory - but it'll likely get into the speci

But it also feels inevitable, due to Palworld's enormous spike in interest - seen by its Steam success, and also the sizable controversy swirling around it. The game had simply become too big to ignore.</p><p>So, what happens next? On the one hand, you'd think The Pok&eacute;mon Company wou

A new Five Nights at Freddy's game leaked online, but rather than getting upset about it, series creator Scott Cawthon has said we can all chat about it. 
</p><p>
The game is called Into the Pit, and is being developed by Mega Cat Studios. When the upcoming release first leaked, the Five Nights at Freddy's Reddit feed said it was going to remove any discussion on it. However, Cawthon himself piped up, and said as it was out there already, the community was welcome to talk about it. 
</p><p>
"No need to keep it all hush-hush. It's okay! Yes, I was trying to keep it a secret for a bit longer, but now that it's out, that's fine," <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/19e4niv/reminder_and_warning_that_the_into_the_pit/kjafhqu/">Cawthon wrote</a>.

An upcoming comic series will continue the story of The Witcher 3's Geralt.  
</p><p>
<strong>Please note, a small spoiler for The Witcher 3's Blood and Wine DLC expansion lies below.</strong>
</p><p>
This upcoming Dark Horse comic series, made in collaboration with game developer CD Projekt Red, is known as The Witcher: Corvo Bianco - a name which will be familiar to those who have played Blood and Wine. Corvo Bianco is a vineyard given to the series' legendary witcher in the expansion, and at the end of the day he settles down there. Ah, peace at last. Or is it?

Microsoft is laying off 1900 people across the video game teams, including Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax and Xbox, equating to approximately eight percent of its gaming workforce.
</p><p>
In an internal email seen by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">The Verge</a>, Microsoft's gaming head Phil Spencer called this a "painful decision". 
</p><p>
"It's been a little over three months since the Activision, Blizzard, and King teams joined Microsoft," Spencer wrote in his email to staff. "As we move forward in 2024, the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business. Together, we've set priori

A video that showed Legendary Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma standing alongside Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto in a very fetching high-vis vest and hard hat combo at Universal Studios Orlando has been pulled from the internet - prompting speculation he was there because a Legend of Zelda attraction is in the works. 
</p><p>
Aonuma could be seen in a behind-the-scenes video from Universal designed to show employee life at the park, and highlight how it will grow in future. Aonuma's inclusion appears to be an accident, however, as the post has since been <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2fgaCstL8z/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=invalid&amp;ig_rid=21164f01-db0b-408d-9e0f-9fc6a3490cd3">removed</a> from Instagram.

Nintendo Switch Online game F-Zero 99 has a fresh update today that adds the ability to create private lobbies. 
</p><p>
The update also includes a number of mysterious "secret tracks", which Nintendo says will "occasionally appear in F-Zero 99" when playing. Intriguing!
</p><p>
Private lobbies are now available as an option for any game mode. These let you set a four-digit passcode so you and your friends can join an individual lobby. But private lobby races won't be reflected on leaderboards, and you'll receive less EXP and fewer ticket points.

The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-type-chart-strengths-weaknesses-every-element-9409">Palworld</a>-wide domination continues. Along with some truly monumental numbers on Steam, the open world survival and crafting game - which the internet has dubbed 'Pok&eacute;mon with guns' - has seen its US numbers on Xbox briefly surpass those of perennial favourite Fortnite.
</p><p>
As noted by NPD's <a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1750186330074890404">Mat Piscatella</a>, Circana's Player Engagement Tracker showed that Palworld surpassed Fortnite's Xbox numbers in the US on 22nd January.

The Pok&eacute;mon Company has issued a rare statement addressing the smash hit PC and Xbox game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-type-chart-strengths-weaknesses-every-element-9409">Palworld</a>, after claims the latter has directly copied its designs.
</p><p>
In the statement, released this morning via its Japanese <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/335.html?s=31">website</a>, The Pok&eacute;mon Company said it now intends to "investigate" Palworld for any content it believes may "infringe on intellectual property rights related to Pok&eacute;mon".

Earlier this week, fans pointed not just to the familiar designs of some Palworld creatures, but to the close similarity seen in Palworld's in-game models to Pok&eacute;mon data in November 2022's Switch games Pok&ea

Ever since Netflix took its first tentative steps into video games back in 2021, the company has reported a relatively modest response from subscribers, but new figures suggest its recent partnership with Rockstar to bring GTA to the streaming service has paid dividends, with monthly mobile game downloads nearly tripling to 28m in December 2023.
