When he arrived at NPR headquarters, Sam Houston, aka BLK ODYSSY, pulled out a lifelike severed human head made of silicone and placed it on the Desk. It's the same head seen in the hands of a woman on the cover of his latest album, DIAMONDS & FREAKS, a project that depicts love and lust as addictive vices.\n\nThe visual components are just as compelling and help specify that BLK ODYSSY is the modern personification of funk. I love where the current state of R&amp;B music sits, but it can always use more funk. This Tiny Desk is an 18-minute flex, highlighting the best of DIAMONDS & FREAKS, plus the premiere of a new song, \"I WANT YOU,\" and a set that climaxes with 2021's \"FUNKENTOLOGY.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"ODEE\"\n\"JUDAS & THE HOLY MOTHER OF STANK\"\n\"ADAM & EVE\"\n\"WANT YOU\"\n\"FUNKENTOLOGY\"\n\nMUSICIAN", "artist": "NPR Music", "source_obj__id": 186, "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/_pvzTlmSK0s/hqdefault.jpg", "album": "", "dead": false}]
