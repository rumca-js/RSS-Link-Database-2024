Speed is another factor&mdash;privacy and security are crucial, but you don&rsquo;t want the service to cripple your internet speed either. And if you&rsquo;re concerned with anonymity, you should seek out a VPN with data collection policies that are clear and transparent.

Below you&rsquo;ll find a couple of our top picks for upgradeable laptops. Not only have we personally tested these machines, carefully evaluating them based on performance and build quality, but we&rsquo;ve also awarded them high scores.
