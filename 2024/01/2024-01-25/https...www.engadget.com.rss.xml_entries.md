<p>After three years of service, NASA's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ingenuity/"><ins>Ingenuity</ins></a> Helicopter has flown on Mars for the last time. Earlier this month, during its 72nd flight, Ingenuity <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-has-gone-silent-on-mars-195746735.html"><ins>stopped communicating</ins></a> with the Perseverance rover.

The helicopter is upright and is still in contact with ground controllers, but it's no longer capable of flight.</p>
<p>Ingenuity far outlasted its original planned lifespan. NASA designed the helicopter to carry out up to five test

<p>Shortly after Japan’s space agency became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the surface of the moon, its scientists discovered the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) unfortunately touched down upside down. The <a href="https://global.jaxa.jp/press/2024/01/20240125-1_e.html">Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)</a> said that the SLIM landed on the lunar surface on January 20 but it knew it might have bigger problems due to an issue with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/japans-slim-lunar-lander-made-it-to-the-moon-but-itll-likely-die-within-hours-195431502.html">power generation.</a> Just hours after making landfall, JAXA expected the power to run out, before it ultimately did.</p>
<p>SLIM met the moon’s surface about 55 meters east of the original target landing site, JAXA said. The agency did get all of the technical information related to its navigation prior to landing and ultimately becoming stationary on the lunar surface. JAXA <a href="https://tw

<p>Researchers at MIT have <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/researchers-demonstrate-rapid-3d-printing-liquid-metal-0125"><ins>developed a rapid 3D-printing technique</ins></a> that uses liquid metal to allow for extremely fast prints. The process can manufacture large aluminum components in minutes, whereas many pre-existing techniques would take hours to finish the same build. The technology has already been used to create table legs, chair frames and related furniture parts.</p>
<p>It’s called liquid metal printing (LMP) and involves directing molten aluminum along a predefined path into a bed of tiny glass beads. These beads quickly harden into a 3D structure. Researchers say the new process is at least ten times faster than comparable metal manufacturing techniques.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission is launching an inquiry into massive investments made by Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet into generative AI startups OpenAI and Anthropic, the agency announced on Thursday. The FTC said that it had issued “compulsory orders” to the companies and would scrutinize their relationships with AI startups to understand their impact on competition.</p>
<p>“History shows that new technologies can create new markets and healthy competition,” FTC Chair Lina Khan <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/01/ftc-launches-inquiry-generative-ai-investments-partnerships">said</a> in a statement. “As companies race to develop and monetize AI, we must guard against tactics that foreclose this opportunity. Our study will shed light on whether investments and partnerships pursued by dominant companies risk distorting innovation and undermining fair competition.” The companies have 45 days to respond to the agency.&n

<p>New York City has officially become the first city in the US to designate social media as a “public health hazard.” During a State of the City address, Mayor Eric Adams shared that Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan determined apps like Tik Tok and Instagram are considered “environmental toxins” that impose harm onto <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-and-instagram-will-block-dms-to-teens-unless-theyre-from-a-friend-130552718.html"><ins>young teens</ins></a> and adolescents. “We are going to correct this crisis that is facing our children,” Adams said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmWW7IXBQvg"><ins>during the address</ins></a>.</p>

<p>When I first <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review-instagram-worthy-shades-070010365.html"><ins>reviewed</ins></a> the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, I wrote that some of the most intriguing features were the ones I couldn’t try out yet. Of these, the most interesting is what Meta calls “multimodal AI,” the ability for the glasses to respond to queries based on what you’re looking at. For example, you can look at text and ask for a translation, or ask it to identify a plant or landmark. The other major update I was waiting for was the addition of real-time information to the Meta AI assistant. Last fall, the assistant had a “knowledge cutoff” of December 2022, which significantly limited the types of questions it could answer.</p>

<p>Apple's app platform is finally opening up a bit. Today, the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/news/">company said</a> that it will allow developers to utilize new in-app experiences, including streaming games, accessing mini-apps, and talking with chatbots. That means devs can create a single app that houses an easily accessible catalog of their streaming titles. Perhaps we'll finally see a usable Game Pass app from Microsoft (or even its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-head-says-microsofts-mobile-game-store-could-arrive-next-year-180007168.html">long-awaited mobile game store</a>).</p>
<p>The new in-app experiences, which also includes things like mini-games and plug-ins, will also get new discovery opportunities. Apple isn't being clear about what that means, but it could involve new sections of the App Store pointing to specific features. It wouldn't be too surprising to see a collection of apps feature chatbots, for example. Apple a

<p>The Mac turned 40, putting Apple’s longest-running product squarely in middle age. But like someone who sees the back half of their life approaching and gets in marathon-runner shape, the Mac is in the strongest place it’s been for decades. While (its own) smartphones have chipped and undercut PC revenues for Apple, it follows years of growth and a major milestone for personal computers: the introduction of Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>But before all that, let us take you on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mac-turns-40-how-apple-silicon-cured-its-midlife-crisis-161520642.html">a journey through Macintosh, Macs, MacBooks and more</a>, with Nathan Ingraham… who has also turned 40. (A few years ago.)</p>
