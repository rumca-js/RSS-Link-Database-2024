Chinese people can’t really assemble but they often have to defend their rights. Once the New Year is over, what’s supposed to be a new beginning turns out to be a new wave of protests. 
This was on January 10th in a city in northeastern China. People shouted " We want to see the mayor" in front of a government building. Officials wanted the protestors to pick a representative to negotiate, but the united protestors refused.
