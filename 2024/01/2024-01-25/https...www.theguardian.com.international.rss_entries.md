<p>The death of the 88-year old artist, known for his ‘pile of bricks’ artwork, demands we also remember dark allegations</p><p>In 1976, the Tate published in a biannual report that it had purchased Carl Andre’s Equivalent VIII, a 1966 sculpture consisting of an arrangement of 120 plain fire-bricks. Stacked two deep in a neat rectangle, six bricks across by 10 long, the pale bricks sit directly on the gallery floor. Tate still occasionally shows them as a classic example of minimalist art. If viewers look down as they skirt their terse, unyielding, low-slung presence, there isn’t much there to give them pause. It is a statement, if not a particularly deep one.</p><p>Neither particularly confrontational, nor enveloping, the familiarity of the materials and their arrangement are unlikely to provoke a shrug, much less argument. If there was once a mystery as to why they were there at all, it has long gone. This is what certain kinds of artists did then, and they still do such th
