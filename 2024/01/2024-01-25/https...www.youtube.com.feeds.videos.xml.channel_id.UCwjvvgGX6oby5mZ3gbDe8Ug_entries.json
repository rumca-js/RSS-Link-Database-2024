Once the New Year is over, what\u2019s supposed to be a new beginning turns out to be a new wave of protests. \nThis was on January 10th in a city in northeastern China.

Officials wanted the protestors to pick a representative to negotiate, but the united protestors refused.\n\nHave questions? Do you have something to share with us about China?
