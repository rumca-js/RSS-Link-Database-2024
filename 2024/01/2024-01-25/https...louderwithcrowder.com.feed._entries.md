So it is not shocking that we are seeing mass layoffs across the industry with the highest amount of offenders. But Taylor Lorenz is surprised. She is losing her mind over the fact that she is working in one of the most despised industries in the world. </p><p>The Los Angeles Times just <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/los-angeles-times-announces-it-will-layoff-at-least-115-people/" target="_blank">announced </a>it will be laying off 20 percent of its newsroom. The Washington Post announced plans to cut 240 jobs, and at least 2,700 jobs have been cut in newsrooms across the country since the Panny D. This is because of people like Lorenz. COVID shuttered any doubt about the amount of fake news out there. </p><p><br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-t
