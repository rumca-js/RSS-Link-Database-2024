Governments around the world are increasingly enacting legislation to ensure that there are adequate safeguards to protect children from accessing adult related content online. One of the first countries to pass legislation was the UK with the Online Safety Act coming into law in September 2023.

		Researchers in the United States say they have created a statistical method for “rigorous statistical comparison” for spotting differences among demographic groups. Their math would be applicable to fighting bias in biometric algorithms.

Having one or more standard ways to measure bias would be a boon for many AI sectors, but particularly facial recognition, where biases are known to lurk.

		Facial recognition is being implemented as an option for foreigners seeking to register for a business license in China. According to <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202401/23/WS65af8cc2a3105f21a507de9b.html">China Daily</a>, the streamlined process using mobile face ID scan went into effect on January 18 2024, and has reduced the time required for registration from several months to under ten minutes.

The change eliminates the need for foreign nationals applying to register foreign-funded enterprises in Beijing to supply proof of identity issued by their home country or region, or to be physically present for registration.

Previously, foreign business owners seeking a license also had the option to verify their <a href="https://www.biometricu
