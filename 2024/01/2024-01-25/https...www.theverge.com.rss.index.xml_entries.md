  <p id="tts5E4">We’ve seen the original <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> in white dip below the $249.99 mark over the past several months. But if you missed out on those opportunities, <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=verge012523&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fapd%2Fab365493%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dell presents another with a sale</a> that brings Microsoft’s entry-level gaming console down to $229.99. That’s a $70 discount compared to its retail price. We’ve seen it as low as $199.99, but it’s possible we won’t see it

  <p id="vOYhrD">Apple sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points. The offerings start with the 13-inch MacBook Air from 2020 at $999 and go all the way up to the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro starting at $2,499. But finding a deal on a current Mac with an M1, M2, or even the new M3 chip — as well as the higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max — is actually not that difficult.</p>
