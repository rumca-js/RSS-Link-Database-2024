From <i>The Economist</i>:

"Our back-of-the-envelope calculations show how many books you can still hope to read&#8212;and how to make time for the best ones.
<br /><br />
We started by asking 1,500 Americans about their reading habits with help from YouGov, a pollster. Only 54% of respondents said they read or listened to a book in 2023. Of those who did, the average was 11 books. By that count, if a seven-year-old began reading in 2023, they would get through roughly 770 books in their lifetime, according to actuarial tables. A 30-year-old might have around 500 left to read. And someone in their 70s might be down to their last 100."
