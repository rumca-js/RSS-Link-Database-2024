<p>In a major policy reversal, Apple has announced it is opening its App Store up to game-streaming services. This marks a big win for companies like Microsoft and Nvidia--both of which offer game streaming services that were previously only accessible on iPhones via browser--as well as consumers, who will theoretically be able to access programs like Xbox Cloud Streaming through a designated app.</p><p>Apple shared the announcement in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/">developer blog post</a>, writing, "Developers can now submit a single app with the capability to stream all of the games offered in their catalog." The change is effective immediately and will be implemented worldwide, according to the company.

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-24/">Madden 24</a> team deployed a patch that was meant to address the in-game player fatigue system in such a way that it would disrupt the competitive meta of frequently blitzing defenders to cause chaos for opposing offenses. Unfortunately, the patch didn't work nearly as intended and players have been left with a worse system for a few weeks and counting as a result.</p><p>On January 10, EA Tiburon deployed the patch, targeting players who aren't dedicated pass rushers and thus likely undersized to suffer more severe stamina penalties when engaging with bigger offensive lineman. In short, blitzing defenders from groups other than the defensive line needed to be nerfed.

<p>At first glance, United 1944 looks like just another shooter about European war. However, it's much more of a survival game than just a multiplayer FPS like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/">Call of Duty</a>. It blends traditional first-person gunplay with systems you'd see in a game that emphasizes exploration and building like Rust. Developer Novarama just announced a formal demo for the game, so interested players can squad up with other players (regardless of if they have early access or not) or experiment solo.</p><div>          </div><p>In United 1944, you can either play a more straightforward FPS mode or a sandbox one. It has two main game modes: Domination and Survivor. Domination is a multiplayer mode that challenges players to take control of maps based on World War II locations. On the other hand, Survivor is the hybrid shooter mode that encourages players to build bases and craft weapons instead of just gunning each other

<p>Beginning development in 2013, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skull-and-bones/">Skull and Bones</a>, conceptually, was a spin-off of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a>, which launched that same year. Both are games where you play as a pirate and engage in naval warfare, improving your ship over time as you gather resources and unlock new crafting recipes. I hoped Skull and Bones would build and iterate on Black Flag--one of my favorite games--to be its own thing. Although naval combat was a pillar of Black Flag, it wasn't the entire focus of an Assassin's Creed game, so a game like Skull and Bones--built from the jump to be an entirely pirate-focused adventure at sea--could make some big swings with its deeper naval combat and presentation, free from the quasi-realistic world and the sneaking and stabbing focus of Assassin's Creed. Having now had a chance to play Skull and Bones, however, tha
