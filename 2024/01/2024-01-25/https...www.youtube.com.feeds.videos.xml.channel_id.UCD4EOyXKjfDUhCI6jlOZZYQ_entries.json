When a user makes a request from OpenAI the request and the response is inserted into a SQLite table.  The script checks the if a request is already stored in the database and if it is then the database is read from instead of doing an API call.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n05:25 How the System Works \n14:17 Why Cacheing Matters\n24:28 SQLite Overview\n29:14 Explaining the Code \n46:52 Final Thoughts\n\nPrevious Classes:\nVoice Controlled Computer with Python and AI - https://youtu.be/2UmYq9MJa1E\n\nAI Powered Decision Tree for Talking Computer (Python, OpenAI API, Google Speech) - https://youtu.be/b4BRcs", "artist": "Eli the Computer Guy", "source_obj__id": 316, "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/QRdxtO1PU3w/hqdefault.jpg", "album": "", "dead": false}]
