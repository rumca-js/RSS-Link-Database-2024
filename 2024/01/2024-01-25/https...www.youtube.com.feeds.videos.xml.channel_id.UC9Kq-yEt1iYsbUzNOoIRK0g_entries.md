Disney has been going all-out with Marvel TV shows on Disney+ over the past few years - with seemingly dwindling interest from audience. Their latest show “Echo” is a spinoff of one of those shows, centred around a character who was kind of in it!

Echo definitely raises some questions. Like how did Kingpin survive that? Why are we rooting for a character that puts her family and innocent people’s lives in danger? What are her powers exactly? Did she just speedrun Kingpin’s therapy?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Echo!
