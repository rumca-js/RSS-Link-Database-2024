Things were ludicrously comfortable for the home side, so much so that Andoni Iraola had the luxury of withdrawing Dominic Solanke, among those on the scoresheet, at the interval. Solanke capped the scoring after strikes by Lloyd Kelly, David Brooks, Alex Scott and Luis Sinisterra.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/25/bournemouth-swansea-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report">Continue readi

In full kit and on live TV, Boban flattened the officer with a flying kick in an act of violence that is credited as a spark that would light the fire of Croatian independence, declared just over a year later. “I don’t regret it at all,” Boban said in an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7bf11a4-f61f-4523-95d7-ff5e8404a39b">interview with the Financial Times</a> in 2021. “It was a fight for freedom against the regime,” added the man who cl

<p>Ahmed Ali, 23, from London, started carrying a blade at 16, lost a friend to a stabbing and was knifed himself. This is his story</p><p>When I was 16, me and my friends used to hang around the estate youth club. We were good kids, not from bad backgrounds. We’d rap about the road lifestyle and the youth worker would say “you’re trying to be something you’re not”. He was right. Most of our parents were together, we used to go to Qur’an school and we had good grades. But we’d go as a group into an abandoned block of flats where the police wouldn’t come and we’d smoke some weed. It would get into our heads to start a problem with this guy, rob this, carry knives, that sort of thing. It was a gateway to the hood lifestyle. You hang around your area, think you’re cool and gradually it leads on to worse things.</p><p>We started to deal cannabis. Low-class drug dealers at the bottom. We didn’t have real-life problems like our friends dying, becoming drug addicts, going to jail. B

Given it exceeded all but one of their totals during a harrowing 3-1 loss here three years ago, featuring a good number of the same players, it can be viewed as progress of sorts

<p><strong>Marylebone theatre, London<br /></strong>Samantha Spiro conducts listeners urgently through this horrifying story of a baby thrown in desperation from an Auschwitz train</p><p>If writing a poem after Auschwitz is barbaric, as the philosopher Theodor Adorno famously said, how about a fairytale? Can the consoling archetypes of a simple story address the Shoah? That’s the challenge in this evening drawn from a 2019 novella by Jean-Claude Grumberg, a rapt piece of storytelling delivered by Samantha Spiro.</p><p>Spiro settles on a faded armchair, opens up a big red story book and begins: “Once upon a time.” Here is a wintry forest, a childless woodcutter and his wife, a baby separated from her twin and raised as another’s. It might all lead to happy ever after if it wasn’t for the unyielding context. A train passes the forest, speeding French Jews to a concentration camp. The baby is flung from the train by her father in a desperate bid to save her. The woodcutter’s wif

Props to Guz Khan, then, whose closing routine addresses the Daily Mail’s recent objection to his stance on Israel/Palestine. It’s an outlier, mind you: the Man Like Mobeen star’s set is more about his private than public life, a tale of parenthood before and after he hit the big time, and of the delinquent tendencies he just can’t suppress in his new role as a respectable father.</p><p>That role has come about because Khan has travelled a long way – economically if not geographically – from his working-class youth.

<p>A writer appointed as visiting professor eavesdrops on gossip for inspiration in the follow-up to Such a Fun Age</p><p>Reading Kiley Reid’s fiction feels a bit like watching a prestige TV&nbsp;series. There are expansive casts of characters, many of whom happen to be good-looking. The plots are pacy and compelling, motored by flashbacks and cliffhangers and twists, while also dealing with social issues – particularly race and class – that add intellectual heft. Dialogue is hyper-realistic, often written out phonetically (“Ohmygod” is a favourite) so that you can hear it aloud in your head. No wonder the screen rights for Reid’s debut novel, the Booker-longlisted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/02/such-a-fun-age-kiley-reid-review-white-liberals-black-people">Such a Fun Age</a>, were snapped up before it hit the shelves in 2019.

Or daffodils just weeks after Christmas. At seeing catkins dangling from trees that are still bathed in dark from about 4.30pm. It is an uncanny sense that something here isn’t right. I get it, too, in August, when the blackberries have already ripened into dust, before the new school term starts. Or when I hear birdsong under a yellow streetlamp.</p><p>Perhaps this is just the outdoors equivalent of moaning about Easter eggs being in the shops in January. As in, it happens every year but we are somehow shocked anew each time. Maybe daffodils have always pushed up their spears as students fill in their Ucas applications.

(You’d be told to take if off.) What if – the big one – I went to school in makeup and false nails, as some nine-year-olds in their school do? (I would probably get a call from the office and quite right, too.) “What about self-expression?” they complain, like diligent Americans, and I explain that this is not a priority in the English school system, besides which, wearing Air Jordans because “Ava does” isn’t what self-expression means.</p><p>These differences are, obviously, all uniform-based and elsewhere the two systems are clearly more aligned.

But with their peers facing prison sentences for speaking out, they know they are the lucky ones</p><p>‘We can say what we feel,” says Nadya Samodurova, “but we needed to move to another country to do so.” Half of the acclaimed Russian psych-rock band Lucidvox are speaking to me, via video link, from a modest room in the Serbian capital Belgrade. It’s where Samodurova and Anna Moskvitina, the group’s drummer and bassist, have moved to since the war against Ukraine began because, as Samodurova puts it: “It’s really dangerous to speak out in Russia.”</p><p>“I felt like I needed to move,” adds Moskvitina, “because I don’t want to pretend that I’m someone else.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/25/russian-musicians-starting-again-abroad-lucidvox-inturist">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Controlling the Arctic has long been an ambition of Soviet and Russian leaders. And it's not hard to see why: the Arctic contains vast deposits of untapped fossil fuels, it is of huge strategic importance militarily and represents an emerging trade route between Asia and the west to rival the Suez canal.  But Russia is not the only country with designs on the Arctic. Canada and Denmark have also staked a claim and, in military terms, Nato is bearing down on all sides. Yet Vladimir Putin is closer than any of his predecessors to gaining control of the polar region. Josh Toussaint-Strauss explores how Russia has managed to circumvent the west and further entrench its claim to the Arctic</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2024/jan/25/how-russia-is-taking-control-of-the-arctic-video">Continue reading...</a>

Even the cast seem to lack enthusiasm for this spinoff to the Ray Winstone-starring gangster film</p><p>One of the pithiest pieces of dialogue of Steven Spielberg’s entire oeuvre is Jeff Goldblum’s remark in Jurassic Park that the dinosaur-resurrecting scientists “were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should”.

<p>How many people did DS Derek Ridgewell fit up? The sheer scale of his depravity, and his targeting of men of colour, is only now becoming clear</p><p>In the modest-sized court seven at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London, the children of Saliah Mehmet and Basil Peterkin squeeze into the rows of benches alongside journalists, campaigners and friends. It is the morning of 18 January 2024, almost 47 years since their fathers were imprisoned for conspiracy to steal goods from the Bricklayers Arms depot in south London, where they worked. Three years later, in 1980, the officer who arrested them, along with two of his team, was convicted of the same crime, in the same depot, which they policed.</p><p>Mehmet and Peterkin – both now dead – always said they were framed. Even now, their families refuse to believe that their fathers will have their convictions quashed until they hear the judge say the words.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/25/i-ju

<p>The team behind Netflix’s hit drama turn their gaze to a terrifying female drug lord – and it’s a pulpy, stylish ride. It’s almost too entertaining, given the real-life suffering she caused</p><p>A quote from Pablo Escobar appears on screen: “The only man I was ever afraid of was a woman named Griselda Blanco.” How, then, could you not tell her story? The team behind Narcos – writer Doug Miro, producer Eric Newman and director Andrés Baiz – which told Escobar’s own story, has seized the opportunity and run with it in the new six-part Netflix miniseries Griselda. It stars Sofía Vergara (who also executive produces) as the woman who would become a terrifying drug lord known as the Cocaine Godmother. It is the kind of bold, meaty, dramatic part that she has surely been hankering for after long ago proving her comic chops in Modern Family.</p><p>Miro plays a little fast and loose with the real-life Griselda’s narrative. The first episode opens in 1978 while she is injured and
