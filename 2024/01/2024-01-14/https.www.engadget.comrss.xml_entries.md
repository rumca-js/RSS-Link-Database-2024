<p>FedEx is planning to launch an ecommerce platform called “fdx” later this year. The shipping  company <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://newsroom.fedex.com/newsroom/global-english/fedex-announces-first-of-its-kind-data-driven-commerce-platform"><ins>announced</ins></a> the move on Sunday, describing fdx as an end-to-end online shopping hub that aims to provide sellers with solutions for everything from reaching potential customers to order fulfillment and returns. Sounds… familiar. FedEx says it’s targeting fall 2024 for the official launch.</p>
<p>The details are so far pretty scant, but fdx is being billed as a “data-driven” platform that will use FedEx’s insights to optimize basically every part of the buying and selling process.

The doomed spacecraft, which <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/peregrine-spacecraft-experiences-anomaly-that-could-threaten-moon-landing-191221991.html">experienced an anomaly shortly after launch</a> and has been leaking propellant ever since, is expected to burn up in Earth’s atmosphere, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/astrobotic/status/1746260132269379995">Astrobotic</a> wrote in an update on X this weekend. The company plans to host a press conference with NASA on Thursday January 18 at 12PM ET to discuss the lander’s fate.</p>
<p>Peregrine has so far hung on much longer than anyone thought it would after the leak was first detected on January 8, and Astrobotic has been posting round-the-clock status updates.

But don’t expect the process to be quick and easy. In the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-14/how-to-buy-apple-vision-pro-3-499-device-to-go-on-sale-feb-2-lrdjtdm7?srnd=technology-vp"><em><ins>Power On</ins></em></a> newsletter this week, <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman says customers hoping for a demo will each have to go through face scans and the subsequent assembly of a custom Vision Pro, a walkthrough of the interface and all the controls, and device calibration — all before a 25-minute demonstration of the Vision Pro experience.</p>
