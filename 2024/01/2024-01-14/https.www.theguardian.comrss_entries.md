<p>The model of outsourcing public services is broken. Charities, councils and ministers need to find new ways of collaborating </p><p>Cheap, efficient and entrepreneurial: these were the characteristics that politicians hoped the voluntary and private sectors would bring to the provision of public services. First under New Labour, then under the Conservatives during a period when councils and government departments had far less money, a radical reshaping of the state’s role also led to a reshaping of charities. In 2009, under Gordon Brown, charities received <a href="https://www.ncvo.org.uk/news-and-insights/news-index/uk-civil-society-almanac-2022/financials/where-do-voluntary-organisations-get-their-income-from/">37%</a> of their income from the government.

In 2009, it was inscribed on a commemorative plaque at the opening of the new Cardiff central library, at which the Manics were invited to perform. “The weight of those almost Orwellian words became intertwined with an idea about what the miners had given back to society when they built municipal halls and centres across the country – beautiful looking institutes that they proudly&nbsp;left for future generations,” <a href="

<p>Chan skilfully weaves the different perspectives of a family torn apart by colonialism, occupation and betrayal in this hugely satisfying novel</p><p>Set in Malaysia between 1935 and 1945, Vanessa Chan’s impressive and assured debut offers a little-told perspective on a turbulent period of history. Inspired by her own grandparents’ experiences under British colonial rule and Japanese occupation during the second world war, Chan – who lives in the US – captures the hope and the hardships of this extraordinary decade.</p><p>In 1930s Kuala Lumpur, Cecily is a bored wife and mother seduced by the personal allure of a Japanese general, Fujiwara, and by his vision of “an Asia for Asians”. It’s a stark contrast to her husband’s middle-manager obsequiousness towards the British, and Chan captures the silky racism within the hierarchies of colonial rule, where Malaysians could only ever be second-class citizens in their own country.</p><p><em>The Storm We Made</em> by Vanessa Chan is publi

At under £7, the full English is accessibly priced.</p><p>But a blackboard points to things you won’t find in a traditional English cafe – feijoada (black bean stew), vaca atolada (beef and cassava stew) and picanha (rump beef).

<p>Tehran’s allies help it project power – and risk causing a wider conflagration in the Middle East</p><p>The “axis of resistance” is a network of autonomous militant Islamist groups through which Iran can project power, determine the course of events and deter attack by Israel or the US. The axis is so central to the current conflict that on 7 October, as the bloody attack on Israel was still under way, Hamas’s military commander called on the network to join the struggle. “Our brothers in the Islamic resistance in Lebanon, Iran, Yemen, Iraq and Syria, this is the day when your resistance unites with your people in Palestine,” Mohammed Deif said in an audio message.</p><p>Since then, those allies have joined a much broader regional conflict, with varying enthusiasm. Together they constitute a very potent and unconventional coalition.

A vivid mix of spices to add heat on a cold afternoon<p>In the oven, the deep green leaves had crisped at the edges and peeled apart to reveal a cargo of baked white cheese and a smudge of rust-coloured spice paste. We scooped up the salty feta within and its hot harissa-style spread and mashed it on to bread torn from a crisp loaf. Tiny glasses of cold beer were more than welcome to quell the vibrant heat.</p><p>There is no real need to make your own spice pastes – the market is flooded with them. But sometimes a cook just wants to play. The spice cupboard is the biggest toybox of all and there is much fun to be had on a cold winter’s afternoon, grinding and pounding, mixing and toasting. I’m not sure there should be any rules, and if you wish to stick at the milder, gentler end of the spectrum, then you should stay with mixtures of coriander and cinnamon, aniseed and ginger, juniper and dried thyme.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/14/nigel-slater-recipes-for-

<p>More than 400m people around the world have diabetes, and many control the condition using insulin. But science writer Gary Taubes believes it’s this very treatment that is behind the current epidemic. Does his controversial case for a&nbsp;diet-based alternative to&nbsp;medicine have any bite?</p><p>Gary Taubes is probably the most single-minded person I have ever met. In 2002, when he was a little-known science journalist and author of two books on scientific controversies, an article of his was published in the <em>New York Times</em>, headlined: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/magazine/what-if-it-s-all-been-a-big-fat-lie.html">What If It’s All Been a Big Fat Lie?</a> In it, he argued that the low-fat dietary advice of the previous couple of decades wasn’t only incorrect, but actively dangerous and the reason for, as he put it, the “rampaging epidemic of obesity in America”. For Taubes, dietary fat wasn’t a problem at all. Instead, the real danger was carbohydrate,

As the film is released, she reveals why she wanted a more female-centred take on disaster survival movies</p><p>At an unknown point in the near future, a woman is giving birth. As her contractions start, her home in London is flooded and, as her baby is born, it becomes clear that a climate catastrophe of biblical proportions has begun. A sea of water invades the city as the woman takes her first postpartum, post-apocalyptic pee, then flees for higher ground with her newborn in a car seat.</p><p>So begins the story of a new survival film starring the British actor Jodie Comer.

<p>Bring the gloss and shine back to your hair</p><p>‘I would like dull skin,” said no one ever. The desire for a good glow is universal. The same goes for hair, but we don’t give it half as much attention. Age, pollution, hard water, product buildup and chemical treatments all make your hair more susceptible to dullness. Still, medical issues aside, getting your shine back needn’t be complex. Cleanse your hair more often (with gentle products), get a trim, give your hair and scalp regular treatments and, when styling, add a gloss or oil that won’t weigh your locks down.

More is known about a sheep’s rhythms than a woman’s, he said, setting the tone in our first tutorial, presumably because ewes drive a healthy profit. I was disappointed. I felt that menstruation and pregnancy shouldn’t be narrated to us like they would be for any other animal. These aren’t just biological events, but experiences coloured by memory and anticipation.

<p>Snow, a bowler hat and an old-fashioned HMV storefront combine to create a yearning for the past in ​street photographer Stephen Leslie’s 2018 shot</p><p>Stephen Leslie has an occasional YouTube channel on which he talks about photographs he likes – some his own, some by photographers he admires. In one recent episode he featured this picture, which he took on Oxford Street in London in February 2018. The theme of that YouTube chat was the idea of anemoia, a niche form of nostalgia that prompts a yearning for a historical time and place that you have never actually experienced. Photographs can be perfect anemoia triggers, and this one works by layering retro longing from several different eras.</p><p>The snow sharpens those emotional cues, of course. But it is the combination of the self-consciously vintage HMV sign – with all its vinyl associations – and the bowler-hatted man at the kerbside (a now redundant Oxford Street “greeter”) that properly opens up those possibilities.
