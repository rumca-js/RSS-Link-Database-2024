<ul><li>Real Madrid 4-1 Barcelona</li><li>Vinícius hat-trick overwhelms Barça in one-sided final</li></ul><p>By the end, Barcelona just wanted to go home, any hope long since having left them. Real Madrid would have happily stayed out there for a little longer: first playing, which they did so well here, and then celebrating their success. A first half hat-trick from Vinícius Júnior carried them to victory over Barcelona and the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia which was a destruction.</p><p>Only three players have scored a clasico hat-trick that this century – Luis Suárez, Lionel Messi and Karim Benzema – and even Cristiano Ronaldo hasn’t, which didn’t stop Vinícius paying tribute. At the Al Awwal Park, he celebrated his goals the way the Portugal forward did, a nod to history on the night when he made his own.

<p>They were fast, brightly dressed, sometimes earned decent money and rarely obeyed the Highway Code</p><p>A brightly coloured fashion-forward tribe had invaded the streets of London. ‘Cycling has never held so much romance,’ the <em>Observer</em> claimed on 6 December 1987. ‘Stop to daydream on any street corner and a well-endowed messenger will cut across your path.’ But they weren’t just there to look good: this new breed of cycle couriers were ‘challenging the dominance of the greaseball motorbike dispatch trade’. Shot in their shiny finery with chamois-reinforced crotches ‘to protect the credentials’, it was time to meet the Lycra Lads.</p><p>‘Style and bravado are part of the job,’ said Swas. Riding was ‘the first time I’ve ever done any <em>real</em> work… You start to make money when you stop getting lost.’ He loved how messengers raced each other along routes: ‘As soon as you sling a courier bag over your shoulder you can bend the Highway Code and no one hoots at you.’</p>
