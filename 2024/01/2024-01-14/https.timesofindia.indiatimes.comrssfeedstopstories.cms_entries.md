It came only two days after an identical resolution was moved by independent lawmaker Hidayatullah Khan in the upper house, urging the electoral watchdog and Supreme Court to postpone the polls for 3 months.

Ordering the Board to reconsider the woman’s request, Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya said the petitioner’s husband has already spent a considerable period behind bars and there cannot be a double punishment by refusing to reintegrate him into mainstream society.

The initial deadline for DRDO’s Tapas project was August 2016, but there were multiple problems with the increase in the UAV’s “all-up weight” to an unwieldy 2,850kg as well the imported engine and payload issues, which led to several time overruns and cost revision to Rs 1,786 crore. The Tapas-BH (tactical aerial platform for advanced surveillance-beyond horizon) or Tapas-201 drone did clock around 200 flights, which also saw at least two crashes, but could not meet the preliminary services qualitative requirements (PSQRs) that specified “essential and desirable” parameters.

Opposition in Maharashtra slammed Union minister Narayan Rane on Sunday for his comments on Shankaracharyas. They sought BJP's apology and Rane's dismissal from the Modi government. Rane, while speaking to reporters in Palghar on Saturday, had said that Shankaracharyas should bless the Ram temple instead of criticising some aspects of it. On Sunday, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said Rane has insulted Hinduism by questioning the contribution of Shankaracharyas. "BJP should apologise before January 22 (when idol consecration ceremony of Ram temple will take place in Ayodhya) and the PM must sack Rane from the Union cabinet," Raut said.

Thirty-two years after vowing to return to Ayodhya only after construction of the Ram temple, PM Narendra Modi is set to be in the holy town once again to lead the consecration ceremony. It was on January 14, 1992, when Modi, during his visit to Ayodhya, had taken a vow to return only when the temple dedicated to Lord Ram was completed. Modi was part of the 'yatra' for the integration of Kashmir with India, which was accomplished when Article 370 was abrogated in 2019.

While Govindan welcomed the probe, he remained resolute that it would not intimidate CPM. He accused NDA government of exploiting central agencies for political gain and urged government entities involved to expedite the inquiry.

BJP on Sunday took a swipe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' and said opposition party should first look at doing justice with its own party leaders and refrain from divisive politics before talking about "uniting" the country. "Rahul Gandhi's campaign is not to unite but divide the country. This is another attempt to launch Congress's famous crown prince Rahul Gandhi, who has failed in every test. This is Rahul Gandhi's second journey of hatred and disintegration. Congress seems to be filled with hatred after construction of Shri Ram temple in Ayodhya," said Anil Baluni.

Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of chanting the name of Lord Ram for political gains, while ignoring the real issues of the country like the Manipur crisis and joblessness — a frontal jibe that appeared to target BJP’s overdrive over the upcoming consecration of the Ayodhya temple for which the Congress brass has declined the invitation. Hurled at the rally to flag off Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, the attacking words on BJP and its mascot provided the ideological contrast with the welfarist-justice agenda of the Gandhi scion’s 6,500 km.

Milind Deora, recently appointed joint treasurer of the AICC, said it was "a very difficult decision" to quit the party, but Congress had turned against businessmen whereas the "path of development" lay under PM Modi and Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde. Deora's disenchantment with Congress, particularly Rahul - whom he was once considered to be close to - is said to have been growing for a while now. Initially, he had planned to join BJP, said sources, but it appears the party was unlikely to consider him for an LS seat ticket.

The departure of Milind Deora from Congress marks a significant chapter in Rahul Gandhi's political journey, as it nearly completes the exodus of the original band of young "dynasts" who came to be identified with the Gandhi scion during his initial days.
