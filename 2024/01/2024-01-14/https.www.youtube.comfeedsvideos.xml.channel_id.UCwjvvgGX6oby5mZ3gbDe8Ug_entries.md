On January 8, 2024, Xi Jinping addressed the third plenary session of the 20th CCP Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. He called on the Party to be fully aware of new developments in the fight against corruption, as well as breeding grounds and conditions for corruption, as he urged targeted and sustained efforts to win the battle. He called for severe punishment for collusions between political and business circles, strengthened disposal of corruption in such areas as finance, state-owned enterprises, energy, medicine, and infrastructure construction, and prevention of power abuse.
