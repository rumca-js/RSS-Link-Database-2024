PlayStation has built its reputation on its capacity to deliver a steady and consistent stream of exclusive games that can’t be played on any other platforms, and though we do still have a few of those lined up for the coming months, we actually don’t know much about what the future is going to look like where PlayStation Studios releases are concerned- in an official capacity at least.

Here, we’re going to take a studio-by-studio look at all upcoming first party exclusives, both officially confirmed and otherwise, before going on to spend some time talking about second and third-party exclusives as well.
