Our next game documentary is almost here! Check out the trailer for The Turbulent Story of Skull and Bones, coming February 4, 2024 only on IGN.

For years, many assumed Skull and Bones was a ghost ship; the Ubisoft pirate game that would never make it to harbour. Having suffered six public delays, it is one of the most frequently postponed games of all time. 

Now, almost seven years since it was first revealed, Skull and Bones is ready to set sail. But this final version is very different to the game we first saw in 2017. The naval battler has changed forms multiple times, with its final design emerging from a major reboot that prolonged development and left several prototypes shipwrecked. This is the IGN Inside Story of Skull and Bones’ many delays, and the challenges that caused them.
