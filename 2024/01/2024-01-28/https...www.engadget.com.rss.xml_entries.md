<p>I'm not gonna pretend I've figured you, the Engadget reader, out. Trying to predict what is gonna get your little nerd hearts all a flutter is kind of a crapshoot. But, I'm pretty confident that a Tamagotchi in a guitar pedal is right up your alley. Ground Control Audio showed up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/namm-2024/">NAMM 2024</a> with the <a href="https://www.groundcontrolaudio.com/store/p/uwu-virtual-pet-buffer">UwU virtual pet buffer pedal</a>.</p>
<p>Now buffer pedals are about the least exciting piece of gear you can buy for your pedal board. Probably even less so than a tuner. But, if you've got a particularly large board or long cables, a buffer can dramatically improve your tone. Basically all it does is take the signal coming in and give it a little boost so you don't lose precious high end to tone suck. Like I said, not exciting.</p>

<p>X’s head of business operations Joe Benarroch said the company plans to open a new office in Austin, Texas for a team that will be dedicated to content moderation, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-27/musk-s-x-pledges-100-person-office-in-texas-to-police-content?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a> reports. The “Trust and Safety center of excellence,” for which the company is planning to hire 100 full-time employees, will primarily focus on stopping the spread of child sexual exploitation (CSE) materials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>X CEO Linda Yaccarino is set to testify before Congress on Wednesday in a hearing about CSE, and the platform at the end of last week published a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2023/an-update-on-our-work-to-tackle-child-sexual-exploitation-on-x"><ins>blog post</ins></a> about its efforts to curb such materials, saying it’s “determined to make X inhos

<p>X has confirmed it’s preventing users from searching Taylor Swift’s name after pornographic deepfakes of the artist began circulating on the platform this week. Visitors to the site started noticing on Saturday that some searches containing Swift’s name would only return an error message. In a statement to the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/x-halts-taylor-swift-searches-after-explicit-ai-images-spread-06ef6c45?mod=followamazon"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> on Saturday night, Joe Benarroch, X’s head of business operations, said, “This is a temporary action and done with an abundance of caution as we prioritize safety on this issue.” This step comes days after the problem first became known.</p>
<p>X’s handling of the issue from the start has drawn criticism that it’s been slow to curb the spread of nonconsensual, sexually explicit images. After the images went viral on Wednesday, Swift’s fans took matters into their own hands to limit their
