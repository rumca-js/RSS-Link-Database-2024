Private Hudson : [after the drop ship crash]  Well, that's great. That's just fuckin' great, man! Now what the fuck are we supposed to do? We're in some real pretty shit now, man!

Corporal Hicks : [grabs him by the shirt]  Are you finished?

Newt : I guess we're not gonna be leaving now, right?

Ripley : I'm sorry, Newt.

Newt : You don't have to be sorry. It wasn't your fault.

Private Hudson : That's it, man. Game over, man. Game over! What are we gonna do now? What are we gonna do?

Burke : Maybe we can build a fire, sing a couple of songs, huh? Why don't we try that?

Newt : We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly.
