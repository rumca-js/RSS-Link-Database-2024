Endnight Games' Sons of the Forest launched in early access last year to exceptional success, selling over two million copies in the first 24 hours. It had several issues but received multiple updates since then, adding new features, polishing performance and expanding on the story.

With Version 1.0 arriving on February 22nd, adding actor Shawn Ashmore to play a central character, it's time to reflect on all the changes and new content made over the past year. What new structures are available to build? Were there any enemies or bosses? Did companions like Kelvin receive updates? How much crazier did the game get?

Check out some of the changes to Sons of the Forest from early access to now as we prepare for Version 1.0's launch.
