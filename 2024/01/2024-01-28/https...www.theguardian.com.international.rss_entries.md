<p>Do artificial sweeteners encourage bloating, raise insulin levels and encourage obesity? We asked the experts</p><p>Depending on whom you listen to, diet soft drinks are either nutritional science’s greatest achievement or its most magnificent Trojan horse&nbsp;– a deliciously sugar-free indulgence or a wolf in calorie-free clothing, set to ruin your health in other ways. Yes, you can drink them without adding much to your energy intake, but are you playing tricks on your appetite or insulin levels that might backfire? Is whatever has taken the place of all that sugar worse?</p><p>It makes most sense to start with insulin. In case you are unfamiliar, this is a hormone, usually produced in the pancreas, that helps your body to use sugar for energy. It has been theorised for a while that your body has just as much trouble distinguishing between regular and diet soft drinks as your tastebuds, leading to overproduction of insulin that could cause everything from increased bloo

<p>A new study suggests a fashionable hobby could help with hot flushes and other symptoms</p><p>In a climate that often feels hostile to middle-aged women, maybe it’s a sign of progress that an only faintly convincing contribution on menopause management can become, as one did last week, a cause for national rejoicing.</p><p>That’s if it doesn’t just confirm suspicions that, where women’s health is concerned, any visionary, antique or drug-repudiating theory can still become mainstream.
