<p>Expect plenty of explosions, shouting and TV that isn’t exactly subtle. It may be nonsense, but it’s gripping nonsense</p><p>The first season of Trigger Point did not so much stretch credulity as blow it to smithereens, which is appropriate, I suppose, for a series that can be boiled down to the concept of “big bomb go boom”. It was infuriating, largely nonsensical and made Line of Duty look like Ibsen. Yet – and there is a yet – every time I watched explosives officer Lana Washington (Vicky McClure) ignoring the very reasonable orders she was given, in order to approach an IED and somehow wriggle out of the situation alive only because someone else got blown up instead, I held my breath, and couldn’t look away.</p><p>Amazingly, given the extent of the havoc wreaked in the first season, the considerable body count and her post-traumatic stress disorder, Lana is back in the job, having spent six months in Estonia, training Ukrainian explosives experts on how to disable bomb

<p>It was a bumpy, disconcerting ride for Erik ten Hag and that was long after the Manchester United manager negotiated more questions about Marcus Rashford’s apparent indiscipline. Rashford was conspicuous by his absence, not in the United squad that flew into Cardiff owing, Ten Hag said, to an internal matter, days after the forward reported ill for training, hours after allegedly being pictured in a Belfast nightclub. On the pitch, United avoided an ignominious defeat at Newport County, with Antony and Rasmus Højlund, late on, scoring to prevent the League Two side from recording a historic result and forcing a replay. Newport rallied from 2-0 down, after early strikes by Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo, his first senior goal, to level in the second half and make for an enthralling encounter.</p><p>Until Bryn Morris’s strike deflected in off Lisandro Martínez on 36 minutes, it seemed this tie would be something of an anti-climax, after all. Newport ensured anything but.

<p>(Rough Trade)<br />Lyrical diatribes against the government, the monarchy and property developers are rendered in lush instrumentation on the Welsh musician’s 25th album</p><p>S<em>adness Sets Me Free</em> is, by his own estimate, about the 25th album from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/jan/11/gruff-rhys-we-sold-the-super-furry-animals-tank-to-don-henley-from-the-eagles">Gruff Rhys</a>, if you include his work with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/mar/04/super-furry-animals-10-of-the-best">Super Furry Animals</a> and all of his various side projects.

<p>Author, editor and Guardian columnist who served 20 years for murder and wrote about his life in prison</p><p>In 2004 Erwin James, who has died suddenly aged 66, came out of jail after serving 20 years of a life sentence for murder. For six of those years behind bars, he had been writing for the Guardian, latterly a column called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/aug/12/prisonsandprobation.erwinjames">A Life Inside</a>, which painted a picture of the prison world. He described his feelings on re-entering society: “All my life I had been a liar, a thief and a cheat. Now I had to face the rest of my life as a convicted murderer.”</p><p>Determined to show the public that change is possible, he shared his experiences and insights in newspapers and magazines, in talks, interviews and three books. Eventually, in 2016, he became editor of the national newspaper for prisons, <a href="https://insidetime.org/">Inside Time</a>, which he described as “his dream job”.</

Although most of the evidence presented by South Africa in support of its claims that Israel is violating the convention was merely circumstantial in nature (relying heavily on inferences drawn from the high death toll in Gaza, the dire humanitarian situation on the ground and statements by Israeli officials which could be read as eliminationist in nature), most judges were not willing to determine, at this early stage of the proceedings, that the case was implausible.</p><p

<p>The Oscar-nominated film is a biting satire of the publishing industry’s obsession with stereotypical ‘Black’ stories. It’s eerily true to life, says author Otegha Uwagba, who speaks to the film’s creators ​about how they brought Percival Everett’s book Erasure to the big screen</p><p>A few years ago, I walked into a large central London bookstore to find a book I’d written, planning to sign a few copies before its imminent publication (as authors are often encouraged to do). The book was about money – as both title and jacket copy made abundantly clear – and yet the bookseller I approached to ask where I might find copies informed me he’d placed them in… race studies. When I challenged him on that categorisation, he grew defensive, while one of his colleagues standing nearby visibly cringed. Over time, I grew to see the encounter as so on the nose as to render it absurd, almost comical – a perfect allegory for how the book industry views Black writers and yet so ludicrous

Eighteen glacial gorges separated the 19 peaks, each carved by a running stream. Ever since moving there, I had fantasised about standing on top of that mountain. Reaching its summit had become an objective I fixated on. Scaling it would be healing, I had convinced myself.</p><p>I wasn’t alone in that outlook.

<p>Director Abel Ferrera’s attempt to place Pio’s story in the context of postwar Italian elections misfires badly</p><p>Padre Pio, real-life monk, mystic and one of the big holy hitters of 20th-century Italian Catholicism (Shia LaBeouf), lends his name to this chest-beating, teeth-gnashing period drama from Abel Ferrera. But Pio’s story feels oddly sidelined in a picture that attempts to balance the monk’s ecstatic spiritual suffering with the events surrounding the first free election in a provincial Italy still reeling from the first world war. In effect, this results in a film composed of two barely connected story strands, cobbled together in a way that undermines the dramatic power of both. Ferrera draws inspiration from Italy’s neorealist tradition in the fractious energy of the crowd scenes and the agitated handheld camera. But any authenticity is skewered by the decision to shoot in Italian-accented English, meaning that much of the dialogue sounds as hammy as a leg

So when her estranged father (Peter Mullan) dies, leaving her a dilapidated tavern in Berlin, Iris dismisses the fact that it’s a glowering wreck of a building that soaks up light like blotting paper and moves straight in. Unfortunately, the place has a sitting tenant: a malevolent entity in the basement known as Baghead. And as we learn through extended chunks of unwieldy exposition, Baghead has the power to shapeshift and channel the dead, a service for which recently bereaved strangers such as Neil (Jeremy Irvine) are prepared to pay handsomely.

Residents are kept behind locked doors, rarely granted a walk outside, instead stuck in armchairs in front of blaring televisions, surrounded by equipment redolent of medical rather than domestic spaces, deprived of the ability to make decisions about almost anything. A care home might be a big old house awkwardly converted, or a new-build as ruthlessly cost-efficient as a distribution centre or a budget hotel. Even where staff and management are genuinely committed to the wellbeing of residents (and there are reported instances where this is not the case), it seems hard to escape the pervasive deadening formula.</p><p>This, even if you are not yet old and don’t

Even there, his singing skills were appreciated by his captors and he was given a relatively privileged position in what Blankfeld calls “the camp’s balmy disinfecting station” – known to prisoners as “the sauna”. It was here that he met Zippi Spitzer, eight years his senior, and they became l

<p>The spotlight is rightly falling on the power of businesses with few competitors to exploit employees</p><p>Competition policy normally focuses on the dangers of big companies exploiting consumers. Thus, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-launches-formal-investigation-into-vodafone-three-merger">announced last week</a> that it was investigating a proposed Vodafone and Three merger. The firms say this will boost investment; opponents say creating the UK’s largest mobile operator will reduce competition and push up bills. The CMA must decide.</p><p>But there’s pressure to broaden competition policy: to make it about protecting workers as well as consumers. After all, if we have little choice about who to work for, the chances of us coming off badly are pretty high. Firms can have what economists call monopsony over workers, just as they can have monopoly over customers. Lower wages, rather than higher prices, are the r

Now Crystal Hefner has written a memoir revealing all the tawdry truths and toxic powerplays behind the ‘glamour’ of living in his Playboy Mansion</p><p>There was this bathroom in the Playboy Mansion, just off Hugh Hefner’s bedroom, that was clad in black marble, with a black marble tub, black toilet and heavy curtains to shut out the light. The way Crystal Hefner (née Harris) describes it, this room sounds like a manifestation of the darkest part of Hefner’s mind. When she moved into the mansion as one of his three live-in girlfriends (she became his third wife in 2012, when she was 26 and he was 86), she’d work out which nights he expected sex because, instead of his regular dinner of tinned chicken noodle soup, crackers and cream cheese, he’d order a BLT. He took so much Viagra it made him deaf. Afterwards, the girlfriends and any other blonde guests Hef had invited up from the party would showe

Against such competition, Malcolm fields a cast that includes lustful Turkish potentates, predatory Catholic priests, corruptible scullions and smooth-cheeked choristers, together with two English kings who allegedly fooled around with virile young favourites. But mostly the sodomites, as Malcolm grimly insists on calling them, are left to satisfy their desires in private; the historian’s concern is the forbidding religious commandments that the same-sex cou

<p>Try a skin tint for a more natural finish without the effort of a full-on foundation</p><p>A lot of people are averse to foundations. Even so they still want something on their skin – something to provide a little bit of colour or smoothness (I’m not talking about ironing out wrinkles here, but more to even out skin tone and texture), but without the commitment of a full-on foundation. I’d argue that there are excellent modern foundations that are akin to skincare, but if that is still too much coverage, a skin tint is your answer. They are essentially lightweight, moisture-boosting products that come with a touch of colour. Perfect for the very natural skin finish.</p><p><strong>1.

<p>Manager’s rejuvenation of Reds’ squad has been successful but there is no obvious Bob Paisley-like figure in the wings</p><p>The similarities between the unexpected departures from Liverpool of Jürgen Klopp and Bill Shankly are unavoidable. Shankly also spoke of weariness, although he perhaps felt, after a brilliant performance in the FA Cup final a couple of months earlier, that there were no more worlds to conquer.

If you are anything like me, upon reading that phrase your mouth will have formed a sort of figure of eight shape and you will have made a sound like a bear. Wait, let’s rewind.</p><p>A combination of soaring childcare costs and the bottomless “cost-of-living crisis” (I refuse, sorry, to write this dystopian phrase without quote marks that ensure it is read with appropriate horror) means grandparents are doing a lot more babysitting than ever before.

The stones on this 19 year old, seriously.</p><p><strong>81st over: England 333-6 (Pope 156, Ahmed 24) </strong>India continue with the old ball, I can’t see signs of reverse swing, perhaps they are slightly concerned with how fast the new nut could fly off the bat.

Pope opens the face and purposefully guides a length ball in the gap at third for four. Class. More than a hint of Ian Bell in his pomp with that shot. Perky start for England this morning. The same can’t really be said for me, I’m hooked up to a Kenco drip.</p> <a href="https
