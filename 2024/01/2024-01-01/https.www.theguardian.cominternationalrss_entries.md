<p>End of Decreto Crescita will make it more costly for Serie A clubs to sign foreigners, but should they look closer to home?</p><p>The year ended with news that many within Italian football had been dreading. After a heated debate between government ministers on Thursday, the <em>Decreto Crescita</em> (growth decree) that granted tax breaks to foreign professionals was allowed to lapse.</p><p>Introduced in April 2019, the decree had a profound effect on Serie A, reducing the tax burden for teams signing players from abroad by as much as 50%. It made transfers possible that otherwise may never have happened. The football finance website <a href="http://calcioefinanza.it/">calcioefinanza.it</a> estimated Roma and Milan are each saving more than €20m annually on their wage bills, with Juventus, on €17.55m, <a href="https://www.calcioefinanza.it/2023/12/29/quanto-risparmia-la-serie-a-con-il-decreto-crescita/">not far behind</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/20

<p>After losing four of five games from a 10-1 start, the once-mighty Philadelphia Eagles look finished. But a fellow mid-Atlantic club is still very much in the Super Bowl hunt</p><p>With 2m40s left in the fourth quarter and the 11-4 Philadelphia Eagles and 3-12 Arizona Cardinals knotted at 31-all, a disgusted AJ Brown walked off the field shaking his head at his team’s lackluster offensive playcalling. The Eagles, already in field goal range a reckless onside-kick attempt gifted them winning field position, went soft. On 1st-and-20 they dialed up a designed run for quarterback Jalen Hurts despite having one of the league’s most effective rushers in D’Andre Swift. Four-yard gain. Hurts ran it again on second down, this time for a three-yard loss. Even saddled with a 3rd-and-19, most teams closing in on an NFC East title and eying return Super Bowl appearance with last year’s MVP runner-up under center, would take a shot. Not the Eagles.
