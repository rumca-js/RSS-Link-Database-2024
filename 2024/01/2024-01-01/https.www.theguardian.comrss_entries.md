<p>Well, he was never going to go quietly. Mohamed Salah signed off for the Africa Cup of Nations with two goals and an assist as Liverpool moved three points clear at the Premier League summit with victory over an obstinate Newcastle. Jürgen Klopp will be counting the days until he returns already.</p><p>Salah’s final Liverpool appearance before representing Egypt in Ivory Coast was a test of the leaders’ composure as well as their resources at the end of a demanding festive schedule. They passed convincingly. It was a hard-fought slog at times with Eddie Howe’s visitors defending desperately and drawing level through Alexander Isak but, not for the first time this season, Liverpool’s leading goalscorer and their options off the bench made the difference.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/01/liverpool-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Ministry of Justice is planning to scan tens of millions of wills and destroy most of the originals. Does it realise what will be lost?</p><p>In the 1980s, as sales of video recorders boomed, a trade sprang up in converting grainy old 8mm home movies of festive celebrations and first steps to VHS tapes. Later, camcorder footage of family holidays was transferred on to DVDs. Those, too, have had their day. But even those who now hold their childhood memories in digital files on their laptops know they face the risk of obsolescence. Conversion to more modern formats can prove more complicated than it looks.</p><p>Digitising archives brings huge benefits – even more so when they are public rather than private.

Campaigning journalist, film-maker, author and fervent critic of US and British foreign policy<p>John Pilger, who has died of pulmonary fibrosis aged 84, was a journalist who never shirked from saying the unsayable. Across half a century, in newspapers and in his documentary films – many for ITV, but later also in the cinema – he became an ever stronger voice for those without a voice, and a thorn in the side of those in authority.</p><p>He was a fervent critic of US and British foreign policy. In 2006, on a panel at Columbia University, New York, to discuss Breaking the Silence: War, Lies and Empire, Pilger asserted that “journalists in the so-called mainstream bear much of the responsibility” for the devastation and lives lost in Iraq, by not challenging and exposing “the lies of Bush and Blair”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/01/john-pilger-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

I started to take care of him around the clock, hand-feeding him and taking him into the vet to hydrate him with injections.

I wouldn’t buy a three-star welly, even though it’s not clear how much anyone should expect from a rubber boot.</p><p>The American psychologist Barry Schwartz observed that faced with apparently endless consumer choice, people respond in two ways. “Satisficers” are happy to pick a good enough option and are unlikely to spend their free time reading hundreds of product reviews, but “maximisers” feel compelled to

<p>Film about actor who played the father of Neville Longbottom feels like The Office meets Withnail, though doesn’t really dig deeply into its subject</p><p>Who is James Payton? The simple answer is that James Payton is a jobbing actor. You’ve probably seen him in something. His two claims to some kind of fame are blink-and-you’ll-miss-em parts in a couple of franchises: Neville Longbottom’s dad in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and Hitler in the first Captain America movie. Payton’s other credits include “geography lecturer” in The Crown and “wasted guy” in a terrible Jonathan Pryce thriller from 2005. The two franchises, however, have opened the door to a nice little side hustle: regional fan conventions where Payton sells signed photos of himself for £10.</p><p>The film follows him around the “cons”, where franchise fans queue to get a selfie with Harry Potter’s mate’s dad. Payton wonders how his life got to this? “There was me thinking that one day I’d get nominated

<p>Arsenal left exposed by Mikel Arteta, Nicolas Jackson is no Timo Werner and Lyle Foster overcomes his problems in style</p><p>In bouncing back from three straight defeats Fulham were excellent. Arsenal were as pallid as against West Ham. When even Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice, two of the most durable footballers in the game, are running on fumes it may be time to consider the rotation policy. The recent links with Ivan Toney are centred around the Brentford striker being the final piece in the jigsaw but a heavy workload has blown other holes in the squad. Arteta’s chasing of the game by loading up on forwards to leave Rice fighting alone in midfield against the excellent, superior João Palhinha and Tom Cairney was a risk too far. Arteta was restrained on the sidelines as defeat neared but his team have a tendency to panic when the pressure is on. He did them few favours by leaving them shapeless rather than keeping faith in their quality to dig themselves out. <strong>John Brewin<

<p>Islands and mainland towns south of Lefkada are perfect for a relaxed mooch between idyllic beaches and pretty port towns</p><p>There’s this place I know. It’s at the southern end of a flamingo-flanked canal winding through the wetlands that separate Lefkada from the Greek mainland. The canal is unremarkable, but bear with me. You cruise past the wading birds and the old guys fishing, through the channel markers, by a ruined Venetian fort. Look ahead, breathe it all in. This spot, for me, holds a promise of adventure.</p><p>To port are the Acarnanian Mountains, looking barren and beautiful. Before you, the Ionian islands are lush and green from winter rain, their edges white with sand and lapped by turquoise sea. The sailing here is forgiving: the conditions are moderate, there’s a reliable afternoon breeze, shelter is plentiful and the water is as clear as glass.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/jan/01/my-greek-sailing-adventure-across-the-ionian-sea-to-ithaca

<p>Emilija Škarnulytė’s hypnotic documentary zooms into the science of uranium and radioactivity, as well as cold war politics </p><p>Occupying the liminal space between a geological excavation and speculative realism, Emilija Škarnulytė’s hypnotic documentary effortlessly moves between the micro and the macro. Zooming into a 3D-configuration of uranium ore, the film’s opening cuts to X-ray-esque renderings of radioactive household objects, all cast in an eerie shade of sickly green. These abstractions soon give way to something seemingly concrete yet equally mysterious: the camera plunges underwater, bringing us face to face with the remains of a 1950s uranium mine in Poland, once dug out in secrecy under the Soviet Union. Slithering through the wreckage is a water python, whose glistening presence serves as a kind of cosmic counterpart to the exploitation of natural resources.</p><p>Such slipperiness, both in terms of the imagery and the camera’s point of view, recurs throughout Šk
