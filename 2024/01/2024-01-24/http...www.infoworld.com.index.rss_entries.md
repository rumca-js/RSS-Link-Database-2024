<p>If there's any one tool a software developer needs, it's an editor. An editor can be as simple as Notepad++, or as full-blown as the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. But wouldn't it be great if you could choose as much or as little editor as you need, depending on the project, and not have to switch programs?</p><p>In 2015, Microsoft launched its answer to that question: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a>. At heart, VS Code is a text editor, based on GitHub's cross-platform Electron framework. But its open-ended design allows it to easily adapt to development work in any language, or with any code syntax.</p><p>If all you need is a text edtor with a good selection of modern features, Visual Studio Code can do that as-is. Where VS Code shines, though, is in how its galaxy of extensions can turn it into an environment for any number of languages, frameworks, data types, or services: not just C#, Go, or
