<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was surfing Facebook as I do every day, when I came across an Ender 3 s1 for $70, I knew when I clicked on it that there HAD to be something wrong with it. The seller stated the printer was throwing a &quot;temp too low&quot; every time they tried to run it. He suggested it was the thermistor but I knew that wasn't it, I had a gut feeling. I took 10 minutes looking here and 2 videos on Youtube where I learned it was most likely the ribbon cable. I picked the printer an hour ago, opened up the bottom of the printer and disconnected the ribbon cable, removing the cable mesh for further inspection. 2 minutes later I confirmed there were multiple shorts in the ribbon cable- when I flattened the cable out after reconnecting it, I was able to get it too temp but it failed soon after. Replacements for all cables and wires are now on their way and I've got a second printer that will be in operation before next weeks!</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>Summary:
