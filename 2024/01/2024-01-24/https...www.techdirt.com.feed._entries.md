On February, 19, 2021, the government &#8212; taking the form of Nevada State Troopers (and an assist via phone by the DEA) &#8212; stole former Marine Stephen Lara&#8217;s life savings. Lara was traveling from Texas to California in a rental vehicle to visit his daughters. He had $86,900 in his car with him, along with [&#8230;]

Going back nearly 15 years, we had a story raising the question of whether or not legal filings were (or should be?) covered by copyright. As we noted at the time, it seems pretty clear that, under today’s somewhat absurd copyright, it is entirely possible that such filings are technically covered, though they really shouldn’t [&#8230;]

Texas is in a close race with Florida for the title of &#8220;Most Unconstitutional Laws Enacted.&#8221; Florida&#8217;s legislators will probably end up taking this title because they seem crazier/more productive than their counterparts in Texas. But let&#8217;s not encourage those Texas underachievers! These are bad laws written by worse people. They&#8217;re almost universally incapable of [&#8230;]

One of the dumber things we’ve seen over the last couple of years is the supposed “war on woke” and (more recently) attacks on “diversity, equity, and inclusion” efforts (often shortened to the acronym DEI). In almost every case, these attacks misrepresent reality to generate culture war bullshit, and make a bunch of false claims [&#8230;]

It’s equal parts annoying and bizarre that we’ve normalized the fact that scammers, scumbags, debt collectors, partisan operatives, and marketers have made the U.S.’ primary voice communication platform largely unusable. Americans received 3.8 billion robocalls last month, and despite some modest inroads in fighting the problem, it continues to grow for reasons we&#8217;ve already well [&#8230;]

There can&#8217;t really be much doubting the fact that the fracturing of streaming content and the silos that are being built around that content are not a good thing. Examples of what was an ecosystem that mostly consisted of Netflix and Amazon being ruptured into streaming services offered by content producers themselves, such as Disney [&#8230;]
