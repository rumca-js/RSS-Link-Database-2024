Like many tabletop game companies, they also released tie-in novels to further explore the characters and world. The tie-in novels started with Dark Prince by Keither Herber and ended with the Time of Judgement novels that brought an official end to the campaign setting before its reboot (and later revival with Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition). Over a hundred novels were published during this time and, until recently, all of them have been out of print.

The novel takes place at Sunshire Chateau, an enormous, labyrinthine mansion sitting atop a hill in New York state, replete with secret passages and a mysterious past. Rumored to be haunted, the estate offers the occasional tour to brave (or perhaps foolish) groups of visitors. Six Rooms opens with one such tour, featuring a hodgepodge of nosy neighbors and unsuspecting tourists. Sunshire Chateau\u2019s unnamed tour guide is imposing and mercurial, displaying abrupt flashes of anger that show no mercy toward uncompliant guests. The tour guide keeps everyone on their toes, although not necessarily on their best behavior, with his sudden alternations between scripted history and vulgar outbursts.
