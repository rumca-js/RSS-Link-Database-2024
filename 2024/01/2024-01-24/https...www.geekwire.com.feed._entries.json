The Bellevue, Wash.-based startup raised $1.5 million to help power its new focus on using artificial intelligence to simplify and manage inventory data collection. Using an iPad or iPhone rather than relying on manual counts by employees using pencil and paper, Nomad Go&#8217;s Metashelf combines edge AI computer vision, spatial computing and augmented reality to scan inventory and get instantaneous counts of items. &#8220;They can do it anywhere (shelf, walk-in-freezer, cabinet, warehouse) without having to change anything about their environment (no scanners, antennas, etc.),&#8221; Nomad Go co-founder and CEO David&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/nomad-go-raises-1-5m-to-power-computer-vision-software-that-automaticall", "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 338, "thumbnail": null, "album": "", "dead": false}, {"tags": [], "vote": 0, "age": null, "language": "en-US", "bookmarked": false, "permanent": false, "page_rating": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "date_published": "2024-01-24T17:17:02+00:00", "page_rating_contents": 0, "user": null, "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ring-ends-feature-that-let-police-ask-users-for-videos-via-neighbors-app", "page_rating_votes": 0, "title": "Ring ends feature that let police ask users for videos via Neighbors app", "page_rating_visits": 0, "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ring-request-for-assistance-1260x709.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Police and other public safety agencies will no longer be able to request and receive videos from users of Amazon&#8217;s Ring devices via its Neighbors app, the company said, ending a feature that has stirred controversy in the past. Ring announced the plan to discontinue the voluntary &#8220;Request for Assistance&#8221; tool in the app as part of a broader update Wednesday morning. The change means that police and fire departments will need a warrant to request footage from Ring users, unless they can show it&#8217;s an emergency, Bloomberg News reported.

The Redmond tech giant reached a milestone Wednesday as its market capitalization reached $3 trillion for the first time ever, reflecting investor confidence in the company as it takes a leading position in the AI race. Microsoft stock was up 1.5% on Wednesday, hitting more than $404 per share, a record high. Shares are up more than 7% this year and more than 66% over the past 12 months. Microsoft briefly passed Apple earlier this month as the world&#8217;s most valuable company. Apple hit the $3 trillion mark in June of last year.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-hits-3-trillion-market-valuation-for-the-first-time-ever/\">Read More</a>", "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 338, "thumbnail": null, "album": "", "dead": false}, {"tags": [], "vote": 0, "age": null, "language": "en-US", "bookmarked": false, "permanent": false, "page_rating": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "date_published": "2024-01-24T15:46:54+00:00", "page_rating_contents": 0, "user": null, "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/an-inside-look-at-tableau-whats-the-future-of-the-datafam-at-salesforce", "page_rating_votes": 0, "title": "An inside look at Tableau: What\u2019s the future of the \u2018DataFam\u2019 at Salesforce?", "page_rating_visits": 0, "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"841\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ryan-atay-tableau-2c-1260x841.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Walking into the &#8220;Data1&#8221; building in Seattle&#8217;s Fremont neighborhood, it&#8217;s not easy to tell it&#8217;s the home of Tableau, with the big Salesforce sign behind the reception desk, and a lack of obvious branding for the data visualization company. This symbolizes one challenge that Tableau CEO Ryan Aytay has faced in his first nine months in the role: ensuring that Tableau can maintain its unique approach, identity, and focus \u2014 catering to its intensely loyal community of data professionals and analysts, while also serving Salesforce&#8217;s broader base of business customers. &#8220;The community is a bunch of raving fans.

At the time, their hypothesis was based on previously published research, computer modeling and lab experiments. But now the same scientists say they&#8217;ve found a shallow lake that just might fit the requirements &#8212; and it happens to be just a few hundred miles north of their home base in Seattle. Their findings, focusing on Last Chance Lake in British Columbia, were published this month in Communications Earth&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/soda-lake-canada-origin-life/\">Read More</a>", "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 338, "thumbnail": null, "album": "", "dead": false}]
