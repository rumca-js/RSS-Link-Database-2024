Graven is a first-person action-adventure game that takes ideas from several different genres, ranging from RPGs to boomer shooters and even immersive sims. The game puts players in the shoes of an exiled protagonist that finds himself in a strange swamp shrouded in darkness and beset by enemies, and things only get weirder and darker from there.

Sadly, while Graven looks absolutely wonderful, especially if you’re a fan of classic shooters from the 90s, the game’s different gameplay ideas never feel like they come together in a satisfying way.

The game is strangely strict but inconsistent about what environmental objects can be interacted with and the enemies never really react to whatever you might do, making combat incredibly unsatisfying.
