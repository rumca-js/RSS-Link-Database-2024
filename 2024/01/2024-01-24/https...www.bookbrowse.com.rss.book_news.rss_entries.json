Volunteers will assist Zooniverse by annotating stories to better understand the complex lives of fictional characters. \n<br /><br />\nZooniverse writes:\n<br /><br />\n\"The proliferation of stories today is astounding. There is simply no way to account for the breadth of human creativity without relying on AI. But these systems are often trained in biased or unknown ways. By enlisting the help of readers like you, we can build better, more transparent AI systems to surface the intricate patterns upon which human stories are based. All of the data and models we generate will be open to the public, setting an important standard for transparent and inclusive AI. <b>Our goal is not to build robot storytellers. With your help, we want to gain a deeper understanding of human storytelling.</b>\"", "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 600, "thumbnail": null, "album": "", "dead": false}]
