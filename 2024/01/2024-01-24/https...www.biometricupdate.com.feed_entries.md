Someone sent robocalls as part of disinformation tactic in the United States purporting to be President Joe Biden. It sounded like Biden telling people not to vote in a primary election, but it could have been AI. No one, not even vendors selling deepfake detection software, can agree.

		New legislation has been introduced in Cambodia to establish a new digital civil registration, vital statistics and identity management system it can use to issue legal identity to all residents, according to reporting from the <a href="https://www.ibanet.org/New-cambodian-law-seeks-to-provide-thousands-with-a-legal-identity">International Bar Association</a>.

Few countries have comprehensive laws for civil registration and vital statistics, according to the report, and many have no legal backing for CRVS at all.

Cambodia is attempting to pass such a comprehensive law, covering registration of births, deaths, marriages and divorces for citizens and non-citizens, including stateless residents of Cambodia.

The government hopes to implement the new law this coming

		Italy’s top professional soccer (aka football) league will deploy facial recognition at all stadiums in order to enforce bans of fans violating league rules, its chief executive says.

Luigi De Siervo, CEO of Lega Serie A, said in an interview reported by <a href="https://www.thestadiumbusiness.com/2024/01/23/serie-a-ceo-calls-for-league-wide-facial-recognition-tech/">The Stadium Business</a> that the league plans for video surveillance systems at stadium entry points to be connected to facial recognition systems to identify fans who break racial discrimination rules. The comments follow the announcement of sanctions against Udinese and one of its fans after a visiting player was subjected to a torrent of racial abuse from the stands.

		Stakeholder country consultations have been ongoing within the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (<a href="https://www.oecs.org/en/">OECS</a>), an 11-member regional grouping, on a wide range of initiatives intended to improve integration within the region and to enhance the general wellbeing of citizens in several domains of life.

One of the initiatives being looked at is the establishment of an OECS ID, a digital identification system that will utilize biometrics and collate personal information from all the different types of government-issued IDs to create an individualized ID number for each citizen, according to a press release.

Stakeholders say such an ID would be a big step forward toward unblocking travel barriers within the sub-region, and i

It’s hard to say because only a minority of municipalities, states, counties and universities have actually debated purchases of biometric- and object-recognition tools.

Of course, among the comparatively few that have discussed policies are major population centers like New York City, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Here the trend is getting clearer every year: Law enforcement wants AI and more often than not, it’s getting the algorithms and cameras.

Here’s a look at what’s happening this week.
