For many, the worst season of Community is Season 4, also known as The Gas Leak Year.  Many Community fans would like to forget that Season 4 exists all together after creator Dan Harmon was not involved, but there is one season of Community that is far worse.  When NBC decided not to pick up the hit sitcom, it transitioned to another streaming service, only to fail miserably.   Did they green light a final season just to meet the in-joke of "Six Seasons and a Movie", or did they actually think they could reignite the fire?
