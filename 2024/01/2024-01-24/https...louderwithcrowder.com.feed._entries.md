That is how tall she is. No one in the world cares. No one. But she has it in her lack of a brain that the world is purposely miscalculating her height to make her seem smaller.

	Rule 69-420 states that if it's something Americans enjoy, there is a progressive somewhere who wants to ban it. And/or call it racist. The same is true on a global scale, as we see at the annual globalist CPAC conference in Davos put on by the World Economic Forum. If there is something citizens enjoy anywhere -- like freedom -- the WEF wants to take it away and claim you'll never be happier.

	The latest thing on the list? Coffee.
