The single-player DLC--called Side Order--focuses on replayability as players fight their way up the Spire of Order.</p><p dir="ltr">Side Order sees Inkopolis Square missing its colorful aesthetic as well as its residents, so it's up to Agent 8 and a helpful drone (apparently Pearl) to figure out what's happening. This means taking on waves of fishy foes and using color chips to enhance Agent 8's skills. The newest trailer for Side Order is below:</p><p dir="ltr">On top of the video, Nintendo also shared new art for Splatoon 3's Side Order DLC <a href="https://twitter.com/SplatoonNA/status/1750141592655073711">on X (formerly known as Twitter)</a>.

This year's crop of RPGs includes big names like Final Fantasy VII and League of Legends, along with cult favorites like the return of Dragon's Dogma and a new entry in the Mana series, across PC, Playstation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch.
