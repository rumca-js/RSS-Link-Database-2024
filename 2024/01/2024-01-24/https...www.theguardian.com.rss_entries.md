She was 32. The only suspect was her ex-husband, research scientist Christopher Harrisson, but at the time there was insufficient evidence to pursue him. The case was reopened in 2015, with the hope of utilising advances in DNA technology; Harrisson was duly charged, and his trial took place in February 2023.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/24/trial-the-killing-of-dr-brenda-page-review-all-tru

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> The Worst Person in the World’s Renate Reinsve leads a dour film about families dealing with the reappearance of deceased loved ones</p><p>The dead are returning in the chilly Norwegian drama Handling the Undead, a sad, somber attempt to guide the zombie genre from midnight movie to arthouse. It works in parts, as a study of the ache and irrationality of grief, asking its characters how much they’re willing to accept and deny in order to see their loved ones again. But the first-time director Thea Hvistendahl’s patience-insisting slow burn can be testing, like watching a block of ice slowly melt, a story told in the smallest of drips, some of which sink in deeper than others.</p><p>On a summer’s day in Oslo, three different dynamics are upended by this confounding re-emergence.

The fact that the film gives June Squibb – the type of actor most people know as scene-stealing characters rather than by name – her first leading film role at the age of 94 is reason enough to see it. Even more so that Thelma, from first-time writer-director Josh Margolin, pitches Squibb as perhaps the year’s least likely action hero: a nonagenarian of ordinary abilities who gets phone-scammed out of $10,000 and, inspired by Mission Impossible, embarks on a quest to retrieve it.</p><p>Margolin, a veteran of improv comedy, has a keen eye for the rhythms of daily life as a ninety-something.

<p>With a sublime, star-studded cast and the backing of Hollywood royalty, this extravagant, thrilling series is finally here – and it’s worth the wait</p><p>There has been a strange lack of hype around Masters of the Air.

Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are executive producers and Dee Rees and Cary Fukunaga are among its directors. Yet it is has arrived quietly and politely.</p><p>Why? It’s on Apple TV+, for one.

<p>In many ways, the long 21st century began when Apple launched the Macintosh with its ‘1984’ Super Bowl ad</p><p>On Sunday, 22 January 1984, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Washington (then) Redskins 38-9 in Super Bowl XVIII. With the exception of a few aging Raiders’ fans, what we all remember better from that evening 40 years ago was one advertisement that set the tone for a techno-optimism that would dominate the 21st century.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/ErwS24cBZPc?si=BztUvQQjmlxhXpPO">The ad</a> showed an auditorium full of zombie-like figures watching a projection of an elderly leader who resembled the Emperor from 1980’s The Empire Strikes Back. A young, athletic woman in red and white (the colors of the flag of Poland, which had been engaging in a massive labor uprising against the Soviet-controlled communist state) twirls a hammer and throws it through the screen framing the leader’s face, just as armored police rush in to try to stop her.</p><p>Siva Vaidh

<p>India have won all 14 home Test series since this 2-1 defeat, making the tourists’ achievement all the more remarkable</p><p>When it comes to picking England’s finest Test achievement abroad this century, the initial pull is towards an Australian outlier. Sandwiched in between two ugly whitewashes, a 3-1 away victory 13 years ago remains staggering, each win completed by an innings. Even if the opposition weren’t at their best these were names to put some respect on: Ricky Ponting, Mike Hussey, Michael Clarke and Mitchell Johnson. Outside that tour, England’s record in Australia this century is 22 losses, two draws and one win, making those few weeks all the more extraordinary.</p><p>But even with the vast outfields that swallow you whole, all-timers in their attack and the presence of Steve Smith, Australia hasn’t been unconquerable in recent years. England’s victory was followed by two series wins for South Africa, and India have had a couple of their own.</p> <a href="h

<p>Jamie Child’s directing debut follows a former motocross champ through tedious scrapes and strident geezer movie cliches </p><p>It could theoretically be an enticing proposition: a moody crime thriller set in the north-east, with proven TV talent Jamie Childs making his feature directing debut. But this lands with a sickening thud: what we get is a charmless anti-Get-Carter of dullness, with all the strident geezer movie cliches that somehow stay stubbornly alive in British cinema. The action sequences are lifeless and often simply tedious, the characters are inert and unconvincing and there is some catatonically wooden acting.</p><p>Oliver Jackson-Cohen plays Jack Dawson, nicknamed “Jackdaw”; he is a biker and former motocross champ who has come back to his home town after a spell in the army. In need of cash, he rashly accepts a dodgy job from a criminal acquaintance in the club scene to pick up a hidden package. But this guy tricks Jack out of his payment and then kidna

<p>A family history that lays bare the brutal treatment of Ireland’s unmarried mothers</p><p>In 2014, the bodies of nearly 800 babies and small children were found in the septic tank of a former mother and baby home in Tuam, Galway. They had been deposited over four decades, a practice that only ended in 1961. This grisly discovery, made by a local historian, forced a long overdue public reckoning in Ireland.</p><p>Why was it considered necessary, by individual families as well as the Catholic church and the Irish state, to place unmarried pregnant girls in brutal institutions, to subject their babies to coerced adoption, often abroad, and to treat the children that remained with such indifference or active malice that in Bessborough, one of the largest homes in the country, the infant mortality rate in the early 1950s was five times the national rate? Why was there such extreme shame and secrecy about sex and reproduction outside of marriage?</p> <a href="https://www.theguar

I want no part of it</p><p>It’s still dry January, and if you’re running out of ideas for alcohol-free alternatives, TikTok has some … erm, <em>curious</em> offerings. Introducing the “sleepy girl mocktail”, a beverage enjoying viral fame. It may sound like an old-fashioned euphemism for a valium and a Diet Coke, but it is, in fact, a juice-based concoction that looks like red wine and is supposed to help you sleep better.</p><p>The recipe is simple: tart cherry juice, some fizz such as sparkling water and magnesium powder. It was popularised by the wellness influencer Gracie Norton, who last year hyped the drink as a cure for poor sleep brought about by her menstrual cycle. Since then, countless videos from fans have featured variations such as cranberry juice instead of cherry, lemonade instead of soda water, and – my favourite – just magnesium pills with cherry juice, in a kind

<p>Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s influence can be traced in Spanish film-maker Lois Patiño’s whimsical meditation on the Buddhist cycle of life</p><p>Lois Patiño’s film is a delicate, exotic contrivance, a docu-realist diptych spectacle using nonprofessional actors, about the Buddhist concept of “Samsara”, the cycle of birth, death and life, and the transmigration of souls.

Kate Connolly reports</p><p>A secret meeting between the far-right political party the AfD and neo-Nazis has shocked Germans.

The AfD leader has fired one aide who attended the meeting and insisted they were not planning mass deportations. For more than a week Germans have been rallying in protest about the meeting – yet it has had a surprisingly small effect on the poll ratings of the AfD.</p> <
