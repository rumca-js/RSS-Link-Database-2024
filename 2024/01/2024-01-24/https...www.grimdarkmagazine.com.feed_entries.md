Rumored to be haunted, the estate offers the occasional tour to brave (or perhaps foolish) groups of visitors. Six Rooms opens with one such tour, featuring a hodgepodge of nosy neighbors and unsuspecting tourists. Sunshire Chateauâ€™s unnamed tour guide is imposing and mercurial, displaying abrupt flashes of anger that show no mercy toward uncompliant guests. The tour guide keeps everyone on their toes, although not necessarily on their best behavior, with his sudden alternations between scripted history and vulgar outbursts. The Sunshire Chateau also employs a book antiquarian devoted to the meticulous study and preservation of thousands of historic and one-of-a-kind volumes contained in the sprawling mansion. Although he would ra
