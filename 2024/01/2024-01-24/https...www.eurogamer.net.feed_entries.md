People Can Fly, the developer behind the likes of Outriders and Bulletstorm, has reportedly laid off "over 30 people" working on a currently unannounced game - codenamed Project Gemini - that's set to be published by Square Enix.
</p><p>
As <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">reported by Kotaku</a>, People Can Fly development director Adam Alker announced the layoffs in an email sent to all staff working on the project, explaining the cuts were being made due to budget limitations and its shrinking scope. An additional 20 people are also due to leave Project Gemini, but will be shifted to other titles within the company.
</p><p>
"We understand that this decision impacts each of you," Alker wrote in the email, "and we want to express our gratitude for your har

## Nexus Mods "not comfortable" hosting Palworld Pokémon mods due to potential Nintendo legal action

Nexus Mods - one of the biggest modding sites on the internet - has confirmed it won't be hosting Pok&eacute;mon-themed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-type-chart-strengths-weaknesses-every-element-9409">Palworld</a> mods, saying doing so would "almost certainly... put us at risk of legal action" given Nintendo's history of litigiousness.
</p><p>
Palworld's big hook, of course, is the Pok&eacute;mon-like Pals that roam its open world, all of which can be caught (in a very Pok&eacute;mon-like manner) to assist in exploration and survival. The sometimes startling similarity between Pals and Pok&eacute;mon's creature designs has been a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">major talking point</a> since its early access launch

## The Day Before developer resurfaces to blame failure on "hate campaign"

You might have thought the The Day Before's sorry saga had ended last year when developer Fntastic, amid claims of misleading marketing and Overwhelmingly Negative Steam reviews, yanked the game from sale and promptly shut its doors just four days into its early access launch. But no, the studio has now reemerged with a lengthy statement blaming the whole thing on a "hate campaign" orchestrated by "certain bloggers".
</p><p>
It's not entirely clear why the anonymous voice behind Fntastic's social media account has chosen now to resurface and defend the supposedly defunct studio, but its <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1750076648798785989?s=20">newly published tweet</a> offers a lenghty, ten paragraph rebuttal to what it calls "a lot of misinformation... on the internet from supposedly anonymous sources."

Twitch is expanding its Partner Plus programme to allow more streamers to benefit from its higher revenue share.
</p><p>
The programme was introduced last June and offers a 70 percent revenue split on subscriptions rather than the standard 50 percent. However, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-introduces-new-revenue-split-for-partners-but-theres-a-catch">criteria was particularly stringent</a>, meaning many streamers did not qualify.

</p><p>
From 1st May, a lower threshold will be introduced and Affiliates will also be eligible - it will therefore now be known as the Plus Programme.

Supermassive's hugely entertaining PS4 slasher horror Until Dawn is reportedly making its way to PS5 and PC, with an official announcement said to be happening within the next two weeks.
</p><p>
That's according to reliable leaker billbil-kun who, writing <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/until-dawn-cette-exclusivite-playstation-beneficiera-bientot-dune-toute-nouvelle-version-sur-ces-plateformes-39651">for Dealabs</a>, says the PlayStation 5 and PC release will be a "brand-new version" of Until Dawn that's been in development for at least a year. Billbil-kun says they were unable to ascertain if this new release is a remaster or full-on remake, or if the PlayStation 5 and PC versions will launch simultaneously, but says the official reveal is likely to take place "within 15 days".

Planet Coaster studio Frontier Developments will host a new monthly showcase beginning next week, on 31st January at 6pm UK time, with updates on the what's next from the company. 
</p><p>
Frontier Unlocked, as the showcase will be known, will look ahead at the coming year for the studio - so expect to hear more about Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters' console edition, and what may be on the horizon for Elite Dangerous.
</p><p>
We're also expecting to hear of an all-new project, but what could it be? An all-new game in the studio's Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo series, perhaps? A sequel?

Described as a 'co-op survival action RPG', this is a game stuffed to the gills with different mechanics and systems. It boasts NPC quests, mining, crafting and farming; combat skill trees and intricate base-building - and of course, a vast open world filled with dozens of hand-crafted dungeons and castles. All of which can be explored with the help of a grapple and glider, in a way very reminiscent of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p><p>As a melting pot of different genre influences, Enshrouded is certainly an ambitious project in terms of scope, made all the more impressive by the fact it's still only in Early Access. Yet after 27 hours with Enshrouded in its current form, I've f

The Bulletstorm VR team is "committed to improving the quality" of its recent, really rather broken, release. To do this, it will be prioritising fixes based on severity.
</p><p>
In a joint statement, publisher People can Fly and developer Incuvo said they had heard the community's feedback since Bulletstorm VR launched in pretty bad shape. Players have complained about the VR port's botched physics and censorship, among a myriad of other issues.
</p><p>
 People can Fly and Incuvo have since been taking note of each issue flagged by players, and plan to address each one by "triaging their severity". </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-vrs-broken-launch-being-addressed-one-step-at-a-time?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed">Read more</a></p>

Nintendo will stream its previously planned Legend of Zelda and Splatoon live concerts. 
</p><p>
These concerts were initially meant to be part of 2024's Nintendo Live event. However, towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-live-2024-tokyo-event-cancelled-after-threats-to-staff">Nintendo made the decision to cancel the event</a> due to safety concerns following threats to staff and visitors.
</p><p>
In a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/live/index.html">post</a>, Nintendo said it had heard from many looking forward to the event's Legend of Zelda and Splatoon concerts. The company thanked those who had been in touch, and said it will now stream pre-recorded videos of the live music instead.

On paper, the specs look good, but in reality, Nvidia needs to strike a balance here: we can't expect the card to be within striking distance of the existing RTX 4080, because the specs suggest that 4080 Super won't be much better. Push too hard on 4070 Ti Super and there'll be no market for the next Super.</p><p>The specs do look good, however. The RTX 4070 Ti Super is based on the same AD103 silicon as the RTX 4080, automatically giving it an advantage over the RTX 4070 Ti non-Super, which used the lower-perform

Titled Deep Sleep, the third chapter of the horror series will arrive on Steam on 31st January. There's no word yet of other platforms.

CatNap, as the name suggests, is a giant fluffy cat who puts players to sleep - but with this being Poppy Playtime, it's far from cuddly. Check out the new trailer below for the full reveal.

Following the end of Overwatch League, Blizzard has unveiled new plans for its competitive Overwatch esports circuit. 
</p><p>
The company sunsetted Overwatch League at the end of its 2023 season. "We will be focusing on building our vision of a revitalised esports program," the Overwatch esports social media team said at the time. "We're eager to share more with you as details are finalised."
</p><p>
Those details have since been finalised, and this week Blizzard announced a partnership with ESL Faceit Group (EFG), an esports company owned by Saudi Arabia's controversial Savvy Games Group. The two companies aim to welcome a "new era of Overwatch 2 esports" in an "open and inclusive competitive ecosystem", as part of a multi-year agreement. It will all be known as the Overwatch Champions Series, or OWCS.

Four employees of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam were suspended due to misconduct during its Pok&eacute;mon exhibition last year.
</p><p>
Though the museum did not confirm the number of employees involved, it confirmed security guards and public service employees were suspended in mid-December for not adhering to the procedures and codes of conduct for staff.
</p><p>
Sources at the museum told Dutch site <a href="https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/vier-medewerkers-van-gogh-museum-weg-na-wangedrag-bij-pokemonexpo~be629fc7/">Het Parool</a> that at least four employees were involved. One employee allegedly embezzled a box of Pok&eacute;mon cards, while others informed visitors of when they could purchase tickets to the exhibition.

Valve likely made over $1bn last year from loot boxes in Counter-Strike 2.
</p><p>
That's according to data from <a href="https://csgocasetracker.com/blog/2023-Year-Review">CS2 Case Tracker</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/counter-strike-cases-top-almost-1-billion-in-sales-for-valve-in-2023-2489041/">Dexerto</a>), which released a 2023 year in review.
</p><p>
The most striking statistic is that $980m was spent by players on keys for cases, the free-to-play game's loot box equivalent.
