<p>Like many major tech companies, Amazon is looking to cut costs. Its Twitch division recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-is-reportedly-laying-off-35-percent-of-its-workforce-085946333.html"><ins>laid off 35 percent of its head count</ins></a> (just over 500 employees) and now it's reducing how much streamers make from each Twitch Prime subscription.</p>
<p>Every Amazon Prime member can toss a Prime subscription in the direction of their favorite Twitch streamer at no extra cost. Since that program debuted in 2016, streamers have received the same amount from Twitch Prime subs as they do from a base paid subscription. That's changing, though.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Starting on June 3, Twitch is moving to a fixed-rate model that bases Prime payouts based on the location of a Prime subscriber (and how much they pay for Amazon Prime)."We believe this is the right structure for the program going forward and are making this change to ensure tha

## Aviate Audio Multiverse Player Edition is a $349 'pedal store in a stomp box'

<p>Last year Aviate Audio launched the Developer Edition of its <a href="https://aviateaudio.com/products/multiverse-pedal">Multiverse pedal</a> — basically a plug-in host in guitar pedal format. Now, just in time for NAMM 2024, the company has announced the Player Edition of the Multiverse. The pedal is, for all intents and purposes, unchanged. Same basic design, same processor under the hood (a 600MHz Cortex M7), it's just cheaper now at $349, and presumably won't have access to some of the developer focused tools.</p>
<p>The pedal itself has a small 1.3-inch OLED screen to navigate the UI. There are four programable push encoders, plus two programable foot switches. There's stereo 1/4-inch TRS ins and outs, an 1/8-inch TRS midi input on the side, two expression jacks and a USB-C port. While the Multiverse can be used with a standard AC adapter, it can also be powered over USB-C, which is pretty handy when loading new effects or testing out a patch.</p>

<p>It’s been over seven years since Apple found the “courage” to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-08-bloomberg-iphone-7-gets-new-home-button-drops-headphone-port.html">remove the 3.5mm headphone jack</a> from the iPhone, in turn forcing wireless headphones into the limelight. To this day, listening to hi-res lossless music on a phone usually means a hunt for a rare handset with a 3.5mm jack or accepting your new dongle life. As if from nowhere, a new breed of wired headphone has emerged, and it promises audiophile quality on any phone with no need for a dongle. Of course there’s a marketing term to go with it: True Lossless Earphones (TLE).</p>
<p>You might not have heard of Questyle, but the company has been making hobbyist HiFi gear for years. Last November, the company tried something different with its NHB12 Lightning headphones. The IEM-style buds incorporate a digital audio converter (DAC) capable of handling Apple Music’s top-tier Hi-Res Lossless files (192kHz

## The Mac turns 40: How Apple Silicon cured its midlife crisis

<p>The Mac, formerly the more austere Macintosh, turns 40 today, putting Apple’s longest-running product squarely in middle age. But like someone who sees the back half of their life approaching and gets in marathon-runner shape, the Mac is in the strongest place it’s been for decades. From a revenue perspective, Mac sales declined precipitously in 2023, but that came on the heels of four years of growth that was likely the product of pent-up demand for an improved Mac lineup.</p>

<p>In 2020, Apple finally started delivering on that, thanks in large part to Apple Silicon arriving in the Mac, ushering in the era we’re in now. While the Mac was on shaky ground prior to Apple Silicon, it would now be pretty silly to suggest the Mac won’t make it to its 50th birthday. That wasn’t always a given, though. While the Mac is Apple’s oldest product, it’s also gone through numerous moments where it appeared to be on the brink of irrelev

<p>Remember the Apple car rumors? Project Titan, as it’s apparently called, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-car-apparently-still-exists-could-debut-in-2028-with-reduced-autonomy-203458008.html">is still progressing</a>, with perhaps, a dose of reality. <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman says the company’s decade-old project has shifted from creating a fully self-driving car to an EV more like Tesla’s. The car’s autonomous features have reportedly been downgraded from a Level 5 system (full automation) to a Level 4 system (full automation in some circumstances) — and now to Level 2+ (partial automation). For context, Tesla’s Autopilot is Level 2. Level 2+ doesn’t have a formal description yet.</p>

The audio streaming service says EU residents will finally be able to purchase a Premium subscription or upgrade from Individual to a Duo or a Family plan from within the app itself. Spotify hasn't allowed users to pay for a subscription through Apple's in-app payment system since 2016 and has long been a vocal critic of the 30 percent cut the iPhone-maker takes from app developers. Last year, it even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-stops-accepting-payments-that-were-set-up-through-apples-app-store-211722624.html">stopped accepting Apple payments</a> altogether — it used to let iOS users who've had a subscription since before 2016 to keep paying through Apple's in-app system.&nbsp;</p>
