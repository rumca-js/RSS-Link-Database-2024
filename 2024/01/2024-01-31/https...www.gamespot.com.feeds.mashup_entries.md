<p>Kevin Conroy's passing in 2022 left a bat-shaped void in a generation of fans' hearts as he defined Batman for 30 years. A few weeks after his passing, it was announced that he would reprise his Arkham Batman one last time in Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. It was theorized that would be Conroy's final time as Batman, but a recent report says otherwise. </p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-isnt-kevin-conroys-final-batman-performance">IGN</a> reported Wednesday that Conroy actually recorded two more roles before his passing. One is the highly-anticipated Batman: Caped Crusader series that was shelved at Max but bought by Prime Video. It's unsure if Conroy is Batman this time around for another series by Batman: The Animated Series co-creator Bruce Timm, however, the actor will be Batman in DC's Crisis On Infinite Earths: Part 3.</p><p>The first part of the Crisis on Infinite Earths trilogy was released earlier this month

Now one of the busiest months on the calendar, February 2024 is a <em>stacked </em>month full of high-profile releases and smaller niche games looking to monopolize your precious free time. The most romantic month on the calendar isn't pulling any punches with early releases like Persona 3: Reload, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and Jujutsu Kaisen: Cursed Clash.</p><p>Then there's the rest of the month to brace yourself for as well, as Mario rekindles an epic rivalry with Donkey Kong, Ubisoft's long-delayed Skull and Bones finally ships out, and Pacific Drive explores an exclusion zone full of assorted homicidal nastiness.
