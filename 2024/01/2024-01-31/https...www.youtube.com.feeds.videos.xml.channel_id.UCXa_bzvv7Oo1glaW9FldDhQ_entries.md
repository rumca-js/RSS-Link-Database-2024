Given how expensive gaming tends to be a as a hobby, it’s no surprise that as a group, we all tend to place as much value on games’ length and the breadth of their content as we historically have.

It's hard to believe that Granblue Fantasy: Relink was first announced in 2016, with development handled by another developer before shifting to Cygames Osaka. As an action RPG spin-off to Cygames' successful free-to-play title, it feels like a slam-dunk concept, especially with its setting of boundless skies and floating isles.

Instead of retelling the base game's setting, it offers an original campaign with Gran/Djeeta and friends dealing with new threats. Other characters join you for the ride, whether it's missions with suitably world-threatening stakes or garnering precious materials for the many upgrades.

However, despite the fast-paced and fluid nature of combat, clean visuals, solid voice-acting and plentiful content (with an endgame that frequently recycled content), Granblue Fantasy: Relink leaves something to be desired.
