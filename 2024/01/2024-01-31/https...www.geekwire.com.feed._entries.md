Gordon Brothers, a 121-year-old global firm that orchestrates liquidations and restructuring, announced this week that it is auctioning off $85 million of Zulily&#8217;s unsold shoes, clothes, accessories, housewares and other items. It&#8217;s also selling the inner workings of two 775,000-square-feet fulfillment centers, which includes more than 7 miles of conveyor belts, racks and shelves, furniture, hundreds of barcode scanners, lifts and trucks, and other warehouse miscellany. “This is a great opportunity to acquire a&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/more-than-85m-in-zulily-inventory-and-fulfillmen

Wall Street expects earnings of $0.80 per share and record revenue of $166 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Analysts will be watching growth rates for Amazon Web Services and advertising; potential impact from faster shipping times; and updates related to generative AI, which was the big theme at the AWS re:Invent conference in November. Wedbush said in a recent report it expects Q4 operating income to exceed company guidance. &#8220;Operating margin expansion is supported by rising fulfillment utilization, easing inflation, limited corporate headcount growth, and continued mix shift to higher-margin advertising&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazon-earnings-preview-aws-advertising-ai-in-the-spotlight-for-holiday-quarter-results/

Revenue from Microsoft&#8217;s video-game business surpassed its Windows division for the first time in the December quarter, with a big boost from the company&#8217;s $69 billion acquisition of game publisher Activision Blizzard. That&#8217;s one of the takeaways from numbers included in Microsoft&#8217;s 10-Q filing with the SEC in conjunction with its earnings report Tuesday afternoon for the second quarter of its 2024 fiscal year: The milestone is a jaw-dropper for those who have followed the company historically, given the ways that Windows defined Microsoft for decades, from the debut of Windows 1.0 in the mid-1980s&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-milestone-games-business-tops-windows-for-first-time-with-addition-of-activision-blizzard/">Re
