Readers learned the inner workings of a machine learning algorithm and walked through the process of developing and training a model. This article picks up where that one left off. You'll get a quick introduction to Weka, a machine learning framework for Java. Then, you'll see how to set up a machine learning data pipeline, with a step-by-step process for taking your machine learning model from development into production. We'll also briefly discuss how to use Docker containers and REST to deploy a trained ML model in a Java-based production environment.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3454363/machine-learning-for-java-developers-machine-learning-data-pipeli", "permanent": false, "language": "en-us", "source_obj__id": 563, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3454363/machine-learning-for-java-developers-machine-learning-data-pipelines.html#tk.rss_all", "bookmarked": false, "vote": 0}]
