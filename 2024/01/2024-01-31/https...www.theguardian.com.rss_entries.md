<p><strong>Dominion theatre, London</strong><br />Bartlett Sher’s gingerly feminist take on the problematic mid-century musical has superb dancing but is ponderously paced</p><p>‘Stories of the east have seldom reached the western stage with any semblance of reality,” Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote shortly before the premiere of The King and I in 1951. Or, as one of the musical’s Siamese characters sings of westerners, “they feel so sentimental / about the oriental.”<br /><br />Like so many mid-century classics, The King and I is problematic. If you were treating this story today, you probably wouldn’t centre a white British woman speaking loudly and bossily to foreigners until they thank her.

<p>Whether in the Irish Sea or the Channel, the legacy of separation from the single market is pointless friction and economic pain</p><p>The first fallacy of Brexit was that leaving the European Union would be a one-off event. It was bound to be an open-ended process.

<p>The new Northern Ireland plan is inescapably a compromise. Both the details and the repercussions will be aggressively contested</p><p>Start with the positives, for they are hard to dispute. The new Northern Ireland plan unpicks some of the economic and political damage inflicted by Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal. It makes the return of devolved power-sharing government possible. It ends the DUP’s two-year democracy boycott. It compels the rival parties to work together again, in line with the 1998 Belfast Good Friday agreement. It also releases a £3.3bn sweetener from the UK Treasury that Northern Ireland’s battered public realm badly needs.</p><p>All of that is long overdue. But is it really a new dawn in the north? Some have been seduced into describing this week’s deal in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68146217">these terms</a>. Maybe they will be proved right. Let us hope so.

<ul><li>BHA panel states trainer is ‘not a fit and proper person’ </li><li>Evidence of WhatsApp messages to former employees</li></ul><p>The turbulent career of Milton Harris appeared to reach an abject conclusion on Wednesday when the Grade One-winning trainer’s licence was removed indefinitely by the British Horseracing Authority’s Licensing Committee, due to multiple breaches of its conditions including significant financial mismanagement, initiating a campaign of bullying and intimidation against fellow trainer Simon Earle, who shared some of his facilities, and serious concerns around safeguarding issues at his yard.</p><p>The panel’s decision that Harris is “not a fit and proper person” to hold a licence marks the end of his second spell as a trainer. The first, between 2000 and 2011, ended when the trainer was made bankrupt over an unpaid tax bill, and he spent seven years out of the sport until the BHA, which had turned down two applications in the intervening period,

The plucky Hatters hadn’t played in the top flight since 1992, when they were relegated just a few months before Sky Sports invented football in England and records officially began, but on that fateful day at Wembley they became the first team in history to return to the top tier of English football after suffering multiple relegations into what these days is known as the National League. Indeed, on Football Daily’s only ever trip to Kenilworth Road a little more than 13 years ago, we saw them play Forest Green on a freezing night in a match partly soundtracked by the chattering of our own teeth and the defiant chants of 14 (yes, we counted them) tr

<p>‘This re-enactment of the gunfight between Wyatt Earp and the outlaws takes place in Tombstone twice a day, every day. But of course the story is fake. Earp was no golden superhero’</p><p>Tombstone was a gold rush boom town in Arizona, famous today for a little piece of American history that happened there: a gunfight between law-maker Wyatt Earp and outlaws that has since been represented in films, on TV and in <a href="https://www.ok-corral.com/">a theatre performance</a> that takes place twice a day every day in Tombstone itself. The show is the story of an all-American hero loved by the US audience – but of course it’s a fake story. Earp wasn’t a golden superhero and, like so many famous historical figures, the events surrounding him and the gunfight are unfocused and blurred. For me, this is a metaphor for how US culture rewrites its history in a way that has little to do with the facts.</p><p>My girlfriend – also a photographer – and I went to the theatre show in Tom

<p>Ivy, Florence, George and Arthur are all the rage right now. But you can’t keep that 70s spirit down for ever</p><p>Would you like to call your baby Prince? Then don’t live in New Zealand, where five sets of parents were denied the chance in 2023. Every year, the Department of Internal Affairs releases a list of baby names rejected by the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, with Prince topping the <a href="https://www.dia.govt.nz/press.nsf/d77da9b523f12931cc256ac5000d19b6/18330eddac3d14c6cc258aae00020b4c!OpenDocument">latest chart</a>. Names that sound like titles are prohibited, as are those that use special characters or could be deemed offensive. It is bad luck for Jane Austen fans, as Mansfield Park’s Fanny is now on the banned list. And, for any Egyptologists considering naming their child after the goddess of wisdom, Isis is not allowed, either.</p><p>In total, 64 name registrations were rejected, including Bishop, Major, King, Empress, Queen and Princ

<p>The team that had to flee after the return of the Taliban is pushing hard for a return to international cricket</p><p>It’s 4pm, and 19-year-old Ekil Latifi has been at the indoor cricket centre at Lord’s for eight hours. Nor is she planning on going home any time soon. Having finished her day job with the MCC schools and community team – she arrived two hours early to get in some net practice – she’s now heading for a training session at the gym, which is, to her, one of the perks. How is she not exhausted already? She shrugs. “It’s just my passion.”</p><p>Growing up in Afghanistan, Latifi was always sporty. She wanted to be a professional footballer until her early teens, when an injury caused her mother to announce there would be no more kickabouts. She enjoyed volleyball and basketball, but her lack of height held her back. In 2015 she watched her compatriots play Scotland at the men’s Cricket World Cup. There was a bat in her house, and she picked it up with a new purp

Hello? Sorry. Ker-ching! Ker-ching! Sorry again. A metronome beat is becoming a machine-gun burst of hammering and clanging, interspersed with Big Ben chimes and distant echoes from other rooms. This is Barbara Kruger’s Thinking of <s>You</s>. I Mean <s>Me</s>. I Mean You, at the Serpentine. The title is anything but an equivocation. This is a show filled with switchbacks, reversals, reworkings and visual and verbal plays, as Kruger, nearing 80, lifts us up and grinds us down, second to second, minute to minute, through room after room of a show that refuses to quieten down into a conventional retrospective.</p><p>Greeting the viewer immediately on arrival at the London gallery, this onslaught – a mix of spec

In his 70s, this most secretive of men burned old letters, diaries and manuscripts on a bonfire in his garden. His paranoia had been stoked by the publication of a&nbsp;critical biography. “Too personal, and in bad taste, even supposing it were true, which it is not!” he wrote indignantly in the margin.</p><p>His solution was to seize control of&nbsp;the narrative with a sleight of hand designed to make it seem as if he wasn’t there at all. He&nbsp;wrote his own life story in the third&nbsp;person, to be published as a posthumous biography purportedly authored by his second wife, Florence. In it he made his position clear: “Poetry is emotion put into measure. The emotion must come by nature, but the measure can be acquired by art.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/31/hardy-women-by-paula-byrne-review-where-love-and-fiction-collide">Contin

<p>In this dazzling follow-up to the International Booker-winning The Discomfort of Evening, an abuser addresses his teenage victim</p><p>My Heavenly Favourite, the second novel from acclaimed Dutch author <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/marieke-lucas-rijneveld">Lucas Rijneveld</a>, belongs to a tiny, controversial subgenre: novels about child sex abuse rendered in exquisite prose. It is all the more transgressive in that it’s narrated by the abuser, who addresses his victim in an incantatory, unflinchingly graphic second-person rant about his eternal love. Such a book has to clear a very high bar not to seem like a cynical exercise. Rijneveld’s novel leaps effortlessly over, with room to spare.</p><p>The narrator is a 49-year-old vet serving a small farming community in the Netherlands, and his “heavenly favourite” is the troubled 14-year-old daughter of a dairy farmer. Neither is given a name: he calls her “Little Bird” or “Putto”; she calls him “Kurt” for Kurt C

<p>As a disabled woman, I knew I would face barriers. I pushed through them – all the way to the Commonwealth Games and Paralympics</p><p>I’ve always had big plans for my future. At 16, my head was filled with ideas and my heart was brimming with ambition. This was fuelled by my parents’ encouragement – nothing was impossible if I worked hard and didn’t give up.</p><p>A year earlier, I had been diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome, a very painful condition, in my feet. The pain started when I was 11, usually after exercise. By 13, I was in pain all the time, and it reached the point where I couldn’t walk unaided. I assumed that once doctors could figure out what was wrong, they’d be able to give me some medication or an operation, and I’d get better. But after I was referred to Great Ormond Street children’s hospital, and diagnosed, I learned that there was no cure – it was about managing it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/31/a-moment-

<p>Guillermo del Toro, Nicolas Winding Refn and more sing the Italian director’s praises in this dexterous look back over his career – but his dark side still shines through</p><p>There’s a revealing moment at the end of this sturdy documentary about the Italian film-maker Dario Argento, when his daughter Asia remembers his state of mind when he came home from the David di Donatello awards, Italy’s version of the Oscars, in 2019. Over the course of his career – which is still ongoing – 84-year-old Argento had never won a David for any of his strange, unique films, such as Profondo Rosso (1975), Suspiria (1977) or Tenebre (1982) to name just three of his best known. But that year, the Italian Academy gave him a lifetime achievement award. Asia recalls that when they got back from the ceremony, he shrugged and said “sticazzi” – “who cares?”. He only really cares about the work itself, she explains, not the acclaim it might or might not generate.</p><p>And yet this film feels ee

When I complained, I was sent a photo of the package on my front doorstep. This was in spite of the fact that I had requested it be left out of sight at the back. Moreover, the app had given me a delivery date for the following week, so there was no one at home to sign for it. Amazon repeatedly told me that I was not eligible for a refund under the A-to-Z guarantee because I’d reported an “unusually high number” of missing orders. I’ve only ever made two other claims, both for low-value items, over the course of 13 years and hundreds of orders. Amazon’s customer services told me to submit an online appeal, which generated a message directing me to its help pages, which would tell me to contact customer service.

It stimulates reward receptors in the brain that light up with satisfaction at a job well done. The addict registers its absence as an agony of incompletion. The next dose bathes the aching brain in a glow of bogus accomplishment. This makes tobacco great business. The customer can’t stop coming back for the product.</p><p>As an ex-smoker, I can testify that many of those purchases <em>feel</em> rational. Cravings are unpleasant. Making them go away by the most efficient means available seems like an obvious, necessary course of action.

<p>AI-generated porn, fuelled by misogyny, is flooding the internet, with Taylor Swift the latest high-profile casualty. Victims say social media platforms are failing to take it down – will they now start taking it seriously?</p><p>For almost a whole day last week, deepfake pornographic images of Taylor Swift rapidly spread through X.
