But it turns out that some government employees in Sangamon County are too stupid to make that easy connection. </p><p>A man, with 42 previous arrests/charges, was arrested for criminal trespassing and was issued a Notice to Appear before he was released from custody. That very same day, within 15 minutes, he was arrested AGAIN for throwing a pole through a county building.</p><p><a href="https://www.wandtv.com/news/man-with-42-previous-arrests-charges-throws-pole-through-sangamon-county-building/article_107e01e0-bef4-11ee-806f-bf4071032083.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to <em>WAND</em>: </a></p><blockquote>“A man who has been arres

He still is, in my opinion. But the issue is <em>not </em>that he is no longer Liberal, it's that the Democrats have gone mad. And because of how much the left has progressed its insane ideology, he now aligns more towards the center of the political spectrum. </p><p>On “The Joe Rogan Experience” comedian Bobby Lee and Rogan discussed why they both no longer consider themselves to be "Liberal". But what is more surprising is that Lee agrees with Rogan since he has always presented himself as pretty progressive, in my opinion. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
