<p>AMD may have just launched the Ryzen 8000 series of mobile processors, but company executives confirmed that its next mobile processor, Strix Point, will make the leap to the next-generation Zen 5 architecture.</p>



<p>The disclosure was made by Dr. Lisa Su, AMD&rsquo;s chief executive officer, during <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1180/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial&amp;xcust=2-1-2223510-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the company&rsquo;s fourth-quarter 2023 earnings report</a>.

<p>4K resolution is going mainstream&mdash;even among PC monitors. Delivering a pixel count four times higher than a 1080p display, 4K provides a massive and obvious improvement to image quality. It&rsquo;s useful not only in games and movies but also when editing documents or browsing web pages. The extra pixels make text look clear and crisp.</p>



<p>After extensive testing, I&rsquo;ve determined that these are the best 4K monitors available today, covering a variety of budgets and use cases. If you&rsquo;re looking for additional options, see our roundups of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">the best monitors overall</a>, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813301/best-gaming-monitors.html">best gaming monitors</a>, and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394751/prime-day-monitor-deals-2023.html">be

<p>Noctua is a brand that seems to have the love and admiration of PC gamers and system builders, as much for its distinctive brown and tan livery as for the excellent performance and low noise of its fans and coolers. And they love the hard-to-find <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448154/asuss-noctua-branded-rtx-4080-graphics-card-is-shockingly-gorgeous.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Asus graphics cards with custom Noctua fans</a> pre-installed at least as much.

<p>By default, logging into a Windows 10 or 11 computer using your Microsoft account is something you have to do every time you start using the computer. Filling in some sort of password is, of course, important for security reasons. The password makes it harder for a thief to get into your computer and it&rsquo;s a must for laptops that you take with you to other places. On the other hand, for computers that are stationary on your desk at home, having to type in a password every time you use your computer can be unnecessary. </p>

<p>Are you sure you want to use Google Chrome on your Windows PC? Are you <em>really </em>sure? Don&rsquo;t worry, if you&rsquo;re not, Microsoft will <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1807165/microsoft-is-pushing-edge-with-dirty-tricks-again.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">find a way to ask you again</a>. In fact, it&rsquo;ll ask you even if you are. And you might find yourself using Edge even if you&rsquo;ve explicitly told Windows that yes, in fact, you are sure that you want to use Chrome. That&rsquo;s what a growing number of irate Windows 11 users are reporting with some recent updates, after they found Edge launching with their last-open Chrome tabs. </p>
