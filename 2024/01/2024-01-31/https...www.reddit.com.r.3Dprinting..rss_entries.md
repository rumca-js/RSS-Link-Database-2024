My favorite 64oz Tal brand water bottle fell off my car last week and the handle broke. So today I decided to try to fix it. It didn’t take me long to measure with a caliper and then model it in Fusion 360 and print with PLA. Definitely excited for my new hobby (obsession)!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com
