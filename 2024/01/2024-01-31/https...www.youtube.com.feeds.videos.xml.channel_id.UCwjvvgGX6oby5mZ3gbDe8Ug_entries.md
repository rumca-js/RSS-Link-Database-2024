Renowned British pianist Brendan Kavanagh has become more popular than ever after his recent encounter with a group of Little Pinks. As the news spread on social media platform X, netizens identified these "Little Pinks," realizing they were part of the CCP's overseas propagandists. Kavanagh, who has gone completely anti-communist now, brought Winnie the Pooh to St. Pancras train station in London on the afternoon of January 26, 2024, to show his support for Hong Kong and Taiwan in their fight against the CCP hegemony. Will the CCP take further action?
