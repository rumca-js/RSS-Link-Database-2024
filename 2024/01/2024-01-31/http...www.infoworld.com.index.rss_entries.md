<p>Microsoft Visual Studio Code is a flexible, cross-platform editor that can be transformed into a full-blown IDE for most any language or workflow. Over the past few years, it has exploded in popularity. Thanks to Microsoft's Python extension for Visual Studio Code, VS Code has also become one of the best tools for working with Python. The Python extension provides not only syntax highlighting, but linting tools, environment management, and lots more, all tailored for the Python programming language.</p><p>In this article, we'll walk through how to get started with VS Code's Python tools, whether for new projects or existing ones.</p><h2 class="toc">Install VS Code and the Python extension</h2>
<p>If you haven't already set up and familiarized yourself with Visual Studio Code, that's your first step. <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3213674/get-started-with-visual-studio-code.html">Check out InfoWorld's guide to setting up VS Code

<p>The article, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3224505/machine-learning-for-java-developers.html">Machine learning for Java developers: Algorithms for machine learning</a>, introduced setting up a machine learning algorithm and developing a prediction function in Java. Readers learned the inner workings of a machine learning algorithm and walked through the process of developing and training a model. This article picks up where that one left off. You'll get a quick introduction to Weka, a machine learning framework for Java. Then, you'll see how to set up a machine learning data pipeline, with a step-by-step process for taking your machine learning model from development into production. We'll also briefly discuss how to use Docker containers and REST to deploy a trained ML model in a Java-based production environment.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3454363/machine-learning-for-java-developers-machine-learning-data-pipeli
