During this evening's State of Play, we were all treated to a brand new and rather surreal look at Death Stranding 2, officially now known as On the Beach (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-death-stranding-2-details-reportedly-being-revealed-in-next-15-days">as suspected</a>). 
</p><p>
The sequel was first announced to be in development back in 2022 during the Game Awards, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-officially-revealed-by-hideo-kojima">rather bamboozling trailer</a> featuring L&eacute;a Seydoux and Norman Reedus.
</p><p>
Tonight's trailer has now given us another slice of Kojima-infused pie, and once again it is as perplexing as you would expect. It includes a rather epic looking battle that I won't spoil by trying to describe it here. We also got a brief look at Elle Fannin

## Kojima making new Metal Gear Solid-style game, and movie, for PlayStation

PlayStation has announced Physint, a major new project with Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima, to "reinvent" the genre he is most famous for. 
</p><p>
This new "next-generation action espionage game" will be a fresh, original IP - as Metal Gear Solid remains owned by Konami - and will also be a movie as well.
</p><p>
"Preparations are udnerway, but production will begin in earnest at Kojima Productions after Death Stranding 2," Kojima said tonight during Sony's PlayStation State of Play - during which we also learned Death Stranding 2 is set to arrive in 2025.

Supermassive Games' hugely entertaining PS4 slasher horror Until Dawn is - as was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-reportedly-heading-to-ps5-and-pc-with-an-announcement-due-within-15-days">widely reported</a> prior today's PlayStation State of Play showcase - getting a PlayStation 5 and PC remaster, and it'll be launching later this year.
</p><p>
The original Until Dawn released for PlayStation 4 back in 2015, offering up an atmospheric, knowingly cheesy spin on the teen slasher genre whose branching narrative could be nudged in different directions depending on the choices players made - with their actions determining who lived and who died, even what sort of threat they might be facing. 
</p><p>
Supermassive later returned to the well with its similarly styled Dark Pictures Anthology series,

Shift Up's upcoming release Stellar Blade has secured an April launch date.
</p><p>
It will be arriving on PlayStation 5 on 26th April. Those interested in the studio's action-adventure game can pre-order from the 7th February. 
</p><p>
The official blurb from Stellar Blade's most recent trailer (which you can see via the embed below) asks us all to "reclaim Earth for humankind", so no pressure, but the threat of extinction is real here. You will play as Eve, and her companions include Lily. Lily has plenty of engineering knowlegdge, which will come in handy as Eve makes her way through the world.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-gets-april-release-date-along-with-a-shiny-new-trailer?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed">Read more</a></p>

Tonight brought a fresh look at Judas, the first new game from BioShock creator Ken Levine in over a decade, and the first ever to come from his studio Ghost Story Games.
</p><p>
A new trailer shown during Sony's PlayStation State of Play suggested Judas was set in a futuristic world where everyone's thoughts are recorded - and shown off on a series of screens. 
</p><p>
All these thoughts are "planted in your brain like weeds in a garden", a character who looks slightly similar to BioShock Infinite's Elizabeth suggests, revealing that she's going to help free people from this.

Silent Hill: The Short Message - Konami's oft-leaked "contemporary psychological horror" spin on its long-dormant series - has finally been given its official unveiling, along with confirmation it's free and out today on PlayStation 5.
</p><p>
The Short Message - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-game-rating-spotted-in-south-korea">first surfaced in September 2022</a> via a South Korea ratings board listing - made its formal debut during tonight's PlayStation State of Play showcase, with its announcement trailer revealing a first-person experience focusing on a young woman and featuring heavy interactions with her mobile phone.

Sonic x Shadow Generations was officially announced at tonight's PlayStation State of Play.
</p><p>
A remastered version of the 2011 game was rumoured to appear, but Shadow adds a welcome twist.
</p><p>
Generations featured 2D and 3D levels in a nod to both modern and classic Sonic. Now we'll get Shadow levels on top with this new release in autumn this year.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> - you know, the open-world survival game with the definitely-not-Pok&eacute;mon you might have heard about once or twice lately - has, less than two weeks after its early access release, officially surpassed 19m players on Xbox Series X/S and PC, with Microsoft now touting it as the biggest third-party launch in Game Pass' history.
</p><p>
We've known known developer Pocketpair has had a hit on its hands with Palworld for some time now, of course; its early access launch on 19th January got off a bumpy start as an initial influx of players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-servers-struggle-as-players-pile-on-via-steam">brought the game's servers to their knees</a>, and just 24 hours later Pocketpair rev

But what's underneath is very much worth your time. This is a deep tale of parental abuse, and the struggles of the child to claw their way out from under the shadow of their parent and re-establish their own life - and, naturally, it has a cracking combat system to go alongside it.</p><p>That story's really the driving force in Granblue Fantasy: Relink, especially towards the end of the game. The overarching antagonist Lilith is trying to bring about the end of the world, manipulating her adopted child, Id, into putting down anyone who stands in her path. Id's st

Essentially, it's a value play at the top and bottom of the new stack, with the RTX 4070 Ti Super landing a touch awkwardly in the middle. The RTX 4070 Super offered the biggest proportionate increase in compute power, delivering a nice performance bump over the vanilla 4070 for the same money, while 4070 Ti Super bumped up VRAM nicely, but delivered less of a frame-rate upgrade. RTX 4080 Super? There are some minor spec bumps, but the reality is that for the most part, you're looking at nigh-on identical performance to the outgoing RTX 4080. You do, however, get a significant price drop - but once again, the feeling is that this is the <em>maximum</em> price the RTX 4080 should have h

Stellar Entertainment is working on a fresh AAA arcade racing title, and not-so-subtly hinting it could be a new Burnout.

The studio previously worked on Burnout Paradise Remastered, as well as Need for Speed: Remastered and Need for Speed Unbound.
</p><p>
According to its <a href="https://stellarentertainment.software/games/">website</a>, the studio is currently hiring for a AAA arcade racing title built in Unreal 5 for Gen 5 consoles and PC, which is set to disrupt the racing scene.

Capcom's Resident Evil 4 Remake has sold another 1m copies over the past three months, for a total of 6.48m units sold worldwide.
</p><p>
This makes it the fastest selling Resident Evil title "by far" - a stat <a href="https://twitter.com/cvxfreak/status/1752582531659214929">tracked</a> by Alex Aniel, writer of Itchy Tasty: An Unofficial History of Resident Evil - although the game still sits behind the likes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Village in terms of total sales to date.
</p><p>
In its recent consolidated financial results, <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240131a.html">Capcom</a> said these more recent Resident Evil 4 sales have been supported by "ongoing promotional measures" such as free updates for the PlayStation VR2 version.

The boss of Apex Legends and Battlefield maker EA has been asked about Nintendo Switch 2, ahead of the unannounced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-successor-reportedly-due-late-2024">console's widely-expected launch later this year</a>.
</p><p>
Quizzed on how Switch 2's arrival will impact EA, the company's CEO Andrew Wilson said he could "absolutely not comment on anything that has not been announced or acknowledge it in any way", before going on to say the company was pumped for "new platforms" in general.
</p><p>
"What I would say," Wilson told investors, "to the extent that platforms over the course of the last 20 years have come out and offered improved CPU, GPU, memory, battery life, screen resolution... where we're able to deliver more immersion for our players, particularly aroun

Rocksteady has gifted 2000 LuthorCoins of in-game currency to owners of the &pound;100 Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League deluxe edition, following repeated server downtime over the past few days. 
</p><p>
One of the main draws of spending &pound;100 on the game's deluxe edition was its ability to play from Monday this week, before the game's general release on Friday.

A mobile version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> has appeared on the Apple App Store, said to be coming soon - but it is not the real deal. 
</p><p>
The app, which you can see below in screenshots taken by Eurogamer, appears at first glance to be affiliated with Palworld developer Pocketpair and uses the same promotional images as on PC and Xbox. But this app has nothing to do with Pocketpair, and has instead been published by someone known as Oleksandra Kryccun.
</p><p>
Pocketpair has now said it is aware of this app's existence, and warned players not to be fooled by its arrival on the App Store (we've checked, and can't see it on the Google Play store at present).

Square Enix has finally updated the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series on Steam to offer feature parity with the console versions.
</p><p>
In a new update, assistance features have been added across all six games that allow players to modify the amount of EXP, gil or magic AP they receive, or turn off enemy encounters entirely.
</p><p>
Further, players can switch between the original or newly arranged soundtracks, plus the font type can be switched between modern and classic versions.

Its original incarnation was stranded on the PS2 for over 15 years, but now Persona 3: Reload offers a top-to-bottom remake for modern consoles and PC - including 4K 60Hz gameplay with RT on PS5 and Series X. The 2024 release aims to revitalise and revamp the title for contemporary expectations - but is it the fully actualised remake that fans have been waiting for? And are the graphics an evolution beyond other recent Atlus efforts? </p><p>I'm going to work through the console comparisons quickly, because Persona 3 Reload runs with only minor differences to distinguish the Series X and PS5 versions. Both run at what appears to be a native 4K without anti-aliasing, although some UI elements app
