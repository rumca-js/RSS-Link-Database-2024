<p>We are starting off the year feeling energized and supported, thanks to each of you who shared or donated to our year-end fundraiser and membership drive. We raised a whopping $43,000 through our <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" target="_blank">PyCharm</a> partnership with <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank">JetBrains</a>–that’s more than double last year! With over 150 individual donations, new Supporting Memberships, and JetBrains’ generous partnership, we raised $134,175 total for our work supporting Python and the Python community! All in all, during the period of the fundraiser, we raised close to $200K, which includes donations from <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/" target="_blank">our sponsors</a>, donations to <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/" target="_blank">our Fiscal Sponsorees</a>, Membership renewals, and proceeds from the special replay of our Humble Bundle, thanks to <a href="https://nostarch.co
