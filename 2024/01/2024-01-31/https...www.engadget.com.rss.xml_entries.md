<p><em>Dave the Diver</em> is coming to PS5 and PS4. The 2023 breakout hit won Indie Game of the Year at The Game Awards — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-game-awards-raises-an-old-question-what-does-indie-mean-205211035.html">stretching the definition of “indie”</a> — and was included in Engadget’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-games-of-the-year-2023-150053925.html">Best Games of 2023</a>. It arrives on Sony’s consoles in April, and a Godzilla crossover DLC (sure, why not!) follows it in May.</p>
<p>The game has you exploring a vast underwater world full of mysteries during the day, and helming a sushi restaurant at night. As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dave-the-diver-plunges-to-nintendo-switch-on-october-26th-154515365.html">Engadget’s Lawrence Bonk wrote</a>, “The daytime adventures are sort of like an underwater Metroidvania while the nighttime restaurant management is a combination of a Kairosoft sim and the arcade classic <em>Tapper</em>.” It d

<p>Hideo Kojima is a busy, busy man. Not only does he have <em>Death Stranding 2,</em> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a24-will-help-bring-the-death-stranding-movie-to-life-171735945.html">a movie based on the first game</a> and Xbox horror title <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hideo-kojimas-xbox-game-is-the-cinematic-horrorfest-od-024342457.html"><em>OD</em></a> on his plate, he's developing a brand new game for PlayStation. He'll be going back to his roots, as it's an action-espionage title codenamed <em>PHYSINT</em>.</p>
<p>Head of PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst said during <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-sonys-latest-state-of-play-here-at-5pm-et-183713629.html">today's State of Play stream</a> that the project is in a genre he's been encouraging Kojima to "reinvent for years." Kojima, of course, found fame as the creator of the Metal Gear series. This upcoming endeavor won't be a Metal Gear Solid game, however. Kojima says this will be a "brand new, original

## 'Death Stranding 2: On the Beach' looks even more baffling than the original game

<p>As expected, the PlayStation State of Play today featured <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/deathstranding2_otb_new_trailer#m-scroll-target">an in-depth look at the latest</a> from famed developer Hideo Kojima, in the form of an exceedingly creepy and cinematic preview of <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. </em>Sam, played by Norman Reedus, is back in a trailer that makes very little sense if you haven't played the first game — and even if you did, the contents of this preview might not make a ton of sense. Rest assured, you'll still be running around wildly impressive landscapes with your giant yellow backpack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it sounds like you won't actually have to run around delivering things, because bots are able to do that in this world. The real surprise is when Sam gets captured and runs across his brother, played by the ubiquitous Troy Baker... who pulls out a guitar/gun and starts shredding to take on some enemies? Sure.

<p>It's an awkward time to be a PC player. The platform has more games covering more genres than ever, and even standard PC hardware can deliver pristine, photorealistic graphics. At the same time, some of the biggest titles in recent memory have been absolute messes on PC at launch, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-bugs-playstation-xbox-refund-removed-183051405.html"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-and-the-year-of-disappointing-pc-ports-141551209.html"><em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em></a>, <em>Redfall</em>, the <em>Dead Space</em> and <em>Resident Evil 4</em> remakes, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-i-for-pc-is-a-buggy-mess-144036281.html"><em>The Last of Us Part I</em></a>. Unfortunately, it looks like we can add <em>Cities: Skylines II</em> to this list — which means I'm eagerly looking forward to the day when we can look back and say, &quot;Man, remember when this game w

<p>Yamaha has a new audio mixer for gamers and streamers. Nearly three years after the launch of the company’s first gaming-specific soundboard, the company’s new ZG02 adds a dedicated USB-C port for gaming consoles, a more streamlined profile and a lower price ($200 compared to the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/gaming/zg01/index.html">ZG01’s</a> $300).</p>
<p>Yamaha wants to establish its ZG line as more straightforward and accessible than offerings from rival audio companies with gazes similarly fixed on the Twitch and Discord sets (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-streamer-x-combines-an-audio-interface-with-an-external-capture-card-221321424.html">Rode</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-bridge-cast-audio-streaming-interface-220058414.html">Roland</a> also court gamers and streamers). “While other game mixing solutions can be cumbersome and complex, the ZG02 offers a more tactile, compact and intuitive m

<p>MIT biotech researcher Lauren “Ren” Ramlan has run the iconic computer game <em>Doom </em>using gut bacteria. It’s not doing the running of the game, per se, but it is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/heres-a-video-of-doom-running-on-gut-bacteria-proving-you-really-can-play-the-game-on-anything-184629896.html">running</a> (barely) on a display inside a cell wall made entirely of E. coli bacteria.</p>
<p>The researcher dosed the bacteria with fluorescent proteins to ensure they lit up like digital pixels, reaching a heady 32x48 resolution. In their <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SFm1dS6myqq7psBKttP7CVYN4jO66lOp7ZMA829c_hc/edit">paper</a>, Ramlan says “To run <em>Doom</em>, all one needs is a screen and willpower,” mentioning <em>Doom</em> running on the digital display for a pregnancy test.</p>
<p>However, this is not playable. It takes 70 minutes for the bacteria to illuminate one frame of the game and another eight hours to return to its starting state. So,

<p>Universal Music Group (UMG) is threatening to pull all of its music from TikTok today following a breakdown in negotiations over royalties, the company wrote in an <a href="https://www.universalmusic.com/an-open-letter-to-the-artist-and-songwriter-community-why-we-must-call-time-out-on-tiktok/">open letter</a>. That would mean TikTok creators would lose access to songs from stars including Taylor Swift, Billy Eilish, The Weeknd, Drake and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With UMG's deal with TikTok set to expire, the sides have reportedly been in negotiations for the past year. Such deals are worth billions annually to music publishing firms and are typically negotiated every few years. Universal is the world's largest record label, and if does pull it's music from TikTok, it would be the first time this has happened in recent memory.</p>

In its <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fy-2023-results">latest earnings report</a>, the Korean company has reported KRW 258.94 trillion ($194 billion) in annual revenue and KRW 6.57 trillion ($4.9 billion) in operating profit for the fiscal year of 2023. Those are markedly smaller numbers than the previous fiscal year's, especially the latter's — Samsung posted an operating profit of KRW 43.38 trillion ($35 billion) for 2022, which was already $6.9 billion smaller than the year before due to the weak demand for its chips and smartphones.

<p>In 2018, Tesla awarded Elon Musk a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-elon-musk-700-million-performance-payout-074048172.html">$56 billion pay package</a> that helped propel him to the top of world's richest lists. Now, a judge in Delaware has rendered the deal between the company and the CEO to be invalid and called the compensation an &quot;unfathomable sum&quot; that's unfair to shareholders. As initially seen and reported by <a href="https://www.threads.net/@chancerydaily/post/C2vW4eKx8VE">Chancery Daily on Threads</a>, the court of Chancery in Delaware has released its decision on the lawsuit filed by Richard Tornetta. The Tesla shareholder accused the automaker of breaching its fiduciary duty by approving a package that unjustly enriches its chief executive.</p>
<p>Judge Kathaleen McCormick wrote in the decision that Musk &quot;enjoyed thick ties&quot; with the directors who were in charge of negotiating his pay package on behalf of Tesla, which means there &quo
