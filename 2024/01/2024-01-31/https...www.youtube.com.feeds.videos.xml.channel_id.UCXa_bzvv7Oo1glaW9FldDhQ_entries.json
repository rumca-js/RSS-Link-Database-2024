Currently, there\u2019s no shortage of incredible single player games out there that have dropped down to such price points, from AAA megatons to indie darlings.

As an action RPG spin-off to Cygames' successful free-to-play title, it feels like a slam-dunk concept, especially with its setting of boundless skies and floating isles.\n\nInstead of retelling the base game's setting, it offers an original campaign with Gran/Djeeta and friends dealing with new threats. Other characters join you for the ride, whether it's missions with suitably world-threatening stakes or garnering precious materials for the many upgrades.\n\nHowever, despite the fast-paced and fluid nature of combat, clean visuals, solid voice-acting and plentiful content (with an endgame that frequently recycled content), Granblue Fantasy: Relink leaves something to be desired.", "permanent": false, "language": null, "source_obj__id": 208, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HVdwtasAGA", "bookmarked": false, "vote": 0}, {"thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/JmOP-daFG4w/hqdefault.jpg", "tags": [], "page_rating_visits": 0, "title": "Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth - 15 NEW THINGS To Know Before You Purchase", "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": null, "date_published": "2024-01-31T11:00:15+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "user": null, "page_rating": 0, "description": "Unsurprisingly, the hype for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is ridiculously high, and each time we learn more about the game, it grows higher still.
