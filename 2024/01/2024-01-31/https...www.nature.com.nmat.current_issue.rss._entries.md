<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 31 January 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-023-01796-7">doi:10.1038/s41563-023-01796-7</a></p>Soft building blocks tend to be near spherical, limiting their packing structures to those found in metallic systems. Here the authors report the spontaneous generation of highly deformed mesoatoms using molecular pentagons and observe Frank–Kasper phases not found in metal alloys.
