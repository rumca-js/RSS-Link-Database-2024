<p>We&rsquo;ve been recommending that most Windows users have at least 8 gigabytes of RAM if they want their PC to operate smoothly for a while &mdash; which is a shame, because a lot of budget laptop sellers still seem to think that 4GB is acceptable in the Year of Our Lord 2024. But a new research report, quoting Microsoft no less, says it might be time to bump up that baseline if you want to access the latest &ldquo;AI&rdquo; features, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2200853/microsoft-copilot-adds-a-premium-subscription-copilot-pro.html">the newly expanded Copilot tool</a> in Windows. </p>
