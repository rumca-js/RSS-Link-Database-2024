<p>TSMC, the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, will delay the opening of the second of its two US-based foundries, the company announced today during its quarterly earnings call.</p><p>The first such foundry, announced in 2020, has already been delayed past its initial opening date of late 2024 — thanks, in part, to labor disputes over safety issues, workers imported from overseas, and workforce development programs. The labor dispute was resolved in December after the company reached an agreement with local unions, but TSMC had already pushed the initial production date for that facility to 2025.</p><p>The second foundry, whose opening was delayed today, is designed to produce some of the company’s most advanced chips, which use a 3nm process. TSMC has said it expects a wide range of uses for the chips, including high-performance computing and automotive customers. In an earnings call early Thursday, TSMC Chair Mark Liu said t

<p>Intel's fight against a $1.2 billion (1.06 billion euros) antitrust fine from the European Union (EU) got a boost Thursday when a top court advisor in Europe pointed out errors in the EU regulators' economic analysis.</p><p>The dispute started in 2009 when the European Commission penalized Intel for attempting to impede a competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, by giving rebates to Dell, Hewlett-Packard, NEC, and Lenovo for favoring Intel's chips. The Intel decision is one in a series of increasing antitrust actions in Europe targeting technology companies.</p><p>Regulators usually challenge rebates from leading companies due to their potential to restrict competition. However, companies have argued that authorities should demonstrate how these discounts are anti-competitive before imposing sanctions. In 2022, a subordinate court overturned the fine, prompting the EU competition commissioner to seek a review from the Court of Justice of the Eu
