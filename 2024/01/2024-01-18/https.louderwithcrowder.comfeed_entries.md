But they don’t just do that, they try and force the rest of society to join in on the insanity. And when we refuse, we are considered intolerant. But when one compassionate lawmaker has decided to condone their behavior, they go off the walls. At least they did with this story. </p><p>A state lawmaker from Oklahoma has proposed a bill that would make it so that “students who purport to be an imaginary animal or animal species, or who engage in anthropomorphic behavior commonly referred to as furries at school" could not participate in school activities, according to the <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2024/01/17/oklahoma-bill-targets-furries-in-schools-threatens-animal-control/72256727007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oklahoman</a>.</p><blockquote

After the win, Stroud said something so appalling and inappropriate, that while it aired live, NBC Sports made it a point to edit his incendiary comments before posting the clip to X. What vile filth came out of his mouth? Stroud... said nice things about Jesus.</p><p>Yes, Jesus Christ.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

"Sports" is only their vessel for "the message." These journalismers then go out and prove my friend right over and over and over again. My favorite is the hockey journalismer <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nhl-network-analyst-lashes-out" target="_blank">who told a player to GO BACK TO RUSSIA</a> if he didn't want to wear the Pride shirt. So it's no surprise a Canadian one would dig up a "homophobic" 2021 tweet for his question to UFC's Sean Strickland.</p><p>Side note: Strickland is the new middleweight champion and is set to make his first title defense against Dricus du Plessis at UFC 297 in Toronto. That's what the press conference was for. But UFC, Schmufc.
