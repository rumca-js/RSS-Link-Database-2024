<p>Pakistan has struck a village inside Iran, using rockets to attack what it said were Baloch militant separatist bases in response to strikes by Tehran that targeted sites within Pakistan’s borders. The decision to respond to Iran with retaliatory strikes raised concerns of further escalation in the tension that has been spreading across the Middle East and neighbouring areas since the 7 October attacks by Iran’s ally Hamas and Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza. The instability has also been increasing since the US and western allies began attacks on Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen, strikes which continued on Thursday</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jan/18/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-latest-news-us-military-strikes-houthi-rebels-yemen-pakistan-attack-iran">Middle East crisis – live updates</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/18/pakistan-launches-retaliatory-strikes-in-iran-aimed-at-separatis

Her beloved Scunthorpe United had moved to the edge of the abyss under the ownership of David Hilton; in a death roll with more than £1.2m of debt, facing a winding-up petition from HMRC and eviction from their Glanford Park stadium, which remained in the hands of Hilton’s predecessor, Peter Swann. It was the subject of a bitter dispute between the pair.</p><p>Now, as the club counted down to the home game against Brackley Town on 7 October 2023 in the National League North – English football’s sixth tier and a level far removed from where Scunthorpe have always seen themselves – there was another problem and it surely spelled the end. The players were about to go on strike.</p> <a href=

One night at a party in another writer’s hotel room, I got talking to an American guy called Zach Kelly. Zach, it turned out, wrote for Pitchfork. As a 22-year-old music journalism freak, I could only imagine this was how it must feel to meet a member of your favourite football team. He kindly let me pin him into a corner to probe him about life there – he had started as an intern at their Chicago office – and the kind of work he did. That would have been thrill enough, meeting someone from a publication I perceived as so untouchable it was hardly worth aspiring to. Shortly after I got back to the UK, I got an email from an editor there, Mark Richardson: Zach had recommended me, and would I like to review albums for them? NME said no. But Mark p

If it wasn’t for some bloke called Harry Kane, there’s a fair chance he would be Gareth Southgate’s No 1 striker, and with what one could imagine as a very fruitful (albeit disrupted) qualification campaign behind him – during which, in this imagined scenario, Toney struck up a chemistry with Bukayo Saka that made Mikel Arteta and every Arsenal fan go weak at the knees – one could imagine the forward spearheading England’s charge towards this summer’s Euros. The reality is not much more farfetched. Despite playing for a bus stop in Hounslow, Toney scored more Premier League goals last season than Mohamed Salah, with only Erling Haaland and Kane topping him. And he has risen to be among this company via Northampton, Newcastle, then Barnsley, Shrewsbury, F

As she answered questions about her strengths, weaknesses and goals, it hit her. “I had no idea what product this company actually made,” said Romo, who is 26 and lives in New York. “Then they asked me this one question about it. I took literally five minutes to answer it, and what I said wasn’t coherent.” The employer never called her back.</p><p>Why wouldn’t Romo take the time to Google the company’s name? “Job interviews give me anxiety,” she said. Well, sure, they do for us all. Forced small talk, uncomfortable work clothes, prolonged eye contact … job interviews are stressful. But the youngest members of America’s workforce are especially floundering.

<p>The days of the all-powerful manager are over so Manchester United’s search for a sporting director is crucial for the club</p><p>When I was playing for England, Dan Ashworth was always there. He sat in the back of meetings, attended matches and came to training sessions in his role as director of elite development at the Football Association but he never openly interjected, keeping himself to himself. At the time I wondered what he was doing but gradually you could see the effect he had when everything around England improved.</p><p>Ashworth has gone on to have great success at Brighton and Newcastle in his understated way as a sporting director. The role was often misunderstood in the UK, more often used abroad, but it is a valuable part of a club’s structure. Ashworth is one of many who are showing the importance of employing someone with oversight of what is happening, giving a club a long-term vision that can bring success on the pitch.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.co

<p><strong>Royal Opera House, London<br /></strong>Kenneth MacMillan’s journey into a world of darkness is performed with consummate craft by a superb company</p><p>In the 1970s Kenneth MacMillan snatched ballet from the land of myths and fairytales and thrust it into worlds of psychological darkness, with complex, unsympathetic characters that dancers love to get their teeth into. Does Manon, a ballet about prostitution and sexual violence, come dangerously close to misery porn? In the lower rungs of 18th-century Paris, women are bought and abused, the society on show is an ugly one, but this is ballet so it’s also beautiful: I think that’s called cognitive dissonance.</p><p>Manon is full of dislikable characters, and its success hinges on whether the dancers can engross us in their journey. Opening night features two of the Royal Ballet’s strongest actors, Francesca Hayward and Gary Avis, as well as Marcelino Sambé making his debut as pure-hearted Des Grieux, so the answer is yes.<

But then I saw&nbsp;the&nbsp;superyachts.</p><p>The first one I noticed was the 105-metre Lady Moura, which, according to its Wikipedia page, was the ninth-largest private yacht in the world when it was launched in 1990.

## The many faces of Falstaff: Shakespeare’s tragicomic knight is as complex as Hamlet

<p>Ian McKellen follows in the footsteps of David Warner and Antony Sher as he takes on a character who has been played as wittily jovial and cruelly cunning</p><p>When asked why he had never played Falstaff, Charles Laughton said: “We had to throw too many of his kind out of our family’s hotel in Scarborough.” Undeterred by such niceties, Ian McKellen will shortly be taking on the “fat knight” in Player Kings, Robert Icke’s conflation of the two parts of Henry IV. Great actors of the past, such as David Garrick and Edmund Kean, chose to play Hotspur rather than Falstaff. But today most actors would bite your arm off for the chance to have a go at the role – and you can see why.</p><p>Falstaff, as a dramatic character, is as complex, contradictory and multilayered as Hamlet. At one extreme WH Auden saw him as a figure of supernatural, Christ-like charity: at another, he is viewed as the embodiment of Vice as portrayed in the medieval morality plays. He can entice audiences with his w

<p>Fishing nets churn up carbon from the sea floor, more than half of which will eventually be released into the atmosphere</p><p>Scientists have long known that bottom trawling – the practice of dragging massive nets along the seabed to catch fish – churns up carbon from the sea floor. Now, for the first time, researchers have calculated just how much trawling releases into the atmosphere: 370m tonnes of planet-heating carbon dioxide a year – an amount, they say, that is “too big to ignore”.</p><p>Over the study period, 1996-2020, they estimated the total carbon dioxide released from trawling to the atmosphere to be 8.5 to 9.2bn tonnes. The scientists described trawling as “marine deforestation” that causes “irreparable harm” to the climate, society and wildlife.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/18/carbon-released-by-bottom-trawling-too-big-to-ignore-says-study">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An award-winning verse novel of two families vividly captures the plight of the Sami people </p><p>This lyrical and ambitious verse novel won the August prize, Sweden’s most prestigious literary award, and has now been translated into English by Saskia Vogel. It tells the story of two Sami families across three generations of the 20th century. The Sami are the EU’s only Indigenous people, and they live in lands north of the Arctic Circle, which are now part of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia.</p><p>Ædnan contains echoes of epic poems and Norse sagas but also feels contemporary and accessible. There are no gods or heroes but, instead, a polyphonic chorus of storytellers who jointly narrate the lineage and history of their people. The central hero of the old texts is replaced by Ædnan itself – a Sami word meaning land, ground or earth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/18/dnan-by-linnea-axelsson-review-an-arctic-epic-from-sweden">Continue reading...</a>
