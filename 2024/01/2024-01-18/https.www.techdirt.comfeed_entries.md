We’re back with another post in our ongoing series on web monetization, the Error 402 series. Before the holidays, we had talked about some of the earlier attempts at monetizing content, which included paywalls, banner ads, search ads, and eventually concepts around upselling into premium services under the banner of “freemium.” I originally was going [&#8230;]

There&#8217;s nothing more urbane than omnipresent surveillance, apparently. London is considered one of the classiest places on earth, what with its wealth of history, iconic landmarks, and&#8230; thousands and thousands of surveillance cameras. It&#8217;s also home to knife crime, pervasive racism, and soccer hooligans, with plenty of residents exhibiting all three of these traits simultaneously. [&#8230;]

Ron DeSantis continues to govern Florida as though the Constitution doesn&#8217;t exist. It may froth the voting base a bit, but it&#8217;s doing almost nothing for DeSantis, much less the people he&#8217;s supposed to be serving. Law after unconstitutional law has been passed by the legislature, followed almost immediately by lawsuits and injunctions blocking the [&#8230;]

The Florida legislature (with the support of goon-in-chief Ron DeSantis) really has a thing for unconstitutional bills that piss on the 1st Amendment. I mean, the state is still in a 1st Amendment fight with Mickey Mouse, which should tell you something. The Florida legislature is only in session at the beginning of the year, [&#8230;]

We&#8217;ve long established that U.S. broadband is expansive, patchy, and slow thanks to mindless consolidation, regulatory capture, regional monopolization, and limited competition.

Regional giants like Comcast, [&#8230;]

Field drug tests often seem to be more a triumph of imagination than a triumph of science. They&#8217;re cheap. Some popular tests run less than $3/per. That&#8217;s the literal selling point. When in doubt, a cop can get probable cause by grabbing a substance, dumping it into a field test, and deciding whatever results are [&#8230;]
