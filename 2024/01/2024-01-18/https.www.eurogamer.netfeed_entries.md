Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/join-us-for-the-xbox-developer-direct-1">January Xbox Developer Direct</a> has been and gone, bringing first looks and long-awaited release news for some of the company's most highly anticipated titles. MachineGames' Indiana Jones was the biggie of course, showcasing first gameplay and bringing confirmation of a 2024 release, but there was more besides, with Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, Avowed, and Oxide Games' Ara: History Untold all putting in an appearance.
</p><p>
And if you missed the showcase - which included a surprise appearance from Square Enix to offer another look at this year's Visions of Mana - you'll find a brisk round-up below.

MachineGames has given us our first look at its Indiana Jones game, now officially called Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-believe-they-know-what-machinegames-indiana-jones-game-is-called">as suspected</a>). And that's not all! We officially now know it is coming this year. Get your fedoras at the ready, our beloved professor will be whipping his way onto Xbox Series X/S and PC, including Game Pass, in 2024.
</p><p>
Thanks to the new footage, which was shared at this evening's Xbox Developer Direct, we also have some nice background bits about the upcoming game, which we will play through the eyes of Indy as it is first person (it's the "ideal perspective," the developer said). Oh, and Todd Howard also popped up to compliment how accommodating Lucasfilm has been

Alternate history strategy title Ara: History Untold will launch for PC in autumn 2024, developer Oxide Games announced tonight during the Xbox Developer Direct presentation. 
</p><p>
Via a deeper dive into the game, Oxide showed some of its world leaders and infamous players in history whose skills you'll be able to use as you build your own version of history on an alternate Earth. Jeanne d'Arc, Boudica and Genghis Khan are all on the list.
</p><p>
You win games by competing against rivals, taking turns simultaneously while trying to gain Prestige - such as by constructing Triumphs, monuments from throughout history such as the Great Pyramid of Giza.

</p><p>
Announced at tonight's Xbox Developer Direct, the game will be released across Xbox Series X/S consoles and PC, arriving on Game Pass on day one.
</p><p>
During the Direct, we heard more from developer Ninja Theory and saw some fresh snippets of gameplay. The studio aims to "craft life changing art with game changing tech" - for Senua's Saga, a new motion capture studio has been built for enhanced realism and binaural audio is now used not just for voices but music and sound effects too. This is definitely one to play with headphones!</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hellblade-2-finally-gets-may-release-date?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed">Read more</a></p>

Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate &ndash; Daemonhunters, the acclaimed turn-based tactics game from Complex Games, is launching for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Series X/S on 20th February.
</p><p>
Daemonhunters originally launched for PC back in 2022, delivering what Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called a "brutal but graceful and comprehensible mix of ideas from Warhammer, XCOM and Gears Tactics". Also, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lord-of-the-rings-star-andy-serkis-plays-a-space-marine-in-warhammer-40-000-chaos-gate-daemonhunters">Andy Serkis is in it</a>.

The whole thing is focused on the Grey Knights, a mysterious Chapter of the Space Marines, who go up against the Death Guard and the forces of Chaos god Nurgle in a story told across a cinematic, narrative-driven campaign.

Rockstar has announced it's removing Grand Theft Auto Online's clips editor on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from 20th February this year, explaining it's making the move as it approaches the "limits of what's possible" on previous-generation consoles.
</p><p>
The clips editor - officially known as the Rockstar Editor - was introduced back in 2015, enabling players to create, edit, and share videos of Grand Theft Auto 5 and Grand Theft Auto Online. However, from 20th February, the editor, including all clips and projects saved within, will no longer be available to PS4 and Xbox One users.
</p><p>
"As we begin to approach the limits of what's possible within the technical capacity of previous-generation consoles," Rockstar explained in a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/89721333o81a12/dou

This was the question UK series one contestant Ivan Brett had in mind when he joined the show last year, keen to beat the odds for as long as he could while playing as one of the game's Faithful. The author of The Floor is Lava and Bored? Games!, a professional D&amp;D Dungeon Master and long-time fan of social gaming, Brett's own pitch to the series' producers was that he could beat them at their own format. Of course, things didn't entirely go to plan.</p><p>Still, he believes there's a method to the series' format, a meta to follow to avoid being murdered, and several social game design tweaks he would make to keep the series feeling fresh for years to come. I sat down with Brett this week ahead of a big week of episodes in the show's hit second season to disc

Several Call of Duty games will now shut down for mouse and keyboard players who activate aim assist.
</p><p>
Activision has updated its anti-cheat system, Ricochet, to detect aim assist usage for PC players across Modern Warfare 3, Modern Warfare 2, and Warzone.
</p><p>
"Our security detection systems now target players using tools to activate aim assist while using a mouse and keyboard. The Call of Duty application will close if detected," reads a new post on X, formerly Twitter.

After eight years of weekly releases, Rock Band 4's last dollop of song DLC will arrive next Thursday, 25th January, developer Harmonix has announced.

The move follows Harmonix's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-the-big-bang-event-was-a-blast-of-marketing-for-the-games-multi-genre-future">launch of Fortnite Festival, a Rock Band-like mode playable within Fortnite</a>, at the end of last year - and the beginning of weekly track releases for that.
</p><p>
Rock Band 4 now features a library of nearly 3000 songs - and access to these isn't going anywhere to anyone who has bought them. But no more will launch after the end of this month.

An oddball DS game was always something to pay attention to, but this was one in which the main character had their own DS inside the game too. Or rather, they had a DAS, an in-game gadget that just happened to look exactly like that gorgeously angular first design of the DS. "Is it product placement when it's your own product being placed?" asked Edge, or words to that effect. New worlds and new wonder. I miss the early 2000s.</p><p>If my memory is correct, Two Memories came out at the start of the DS's lifespan. Now, it's back with us, to bustle the Switch off to its own personal Grey Havens. I've been playing the new remake this week and it's been a real journey. There's loads it turns out I've

Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker, the duo that co-founded  acclaimed Batman Arkham studio Rocksteady before departing in 2022, have set up a new AAA London development studio, Hundred Star Games.

Hundred Star Games' existence certainly isn't a secret - it already <a href="https://www.hundredstar.games">has a website</a> and a detailed Great Place to Work to work listing - but its connection to Hill and Walker has only just come to light in a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24040541/rocksteady-studios-founders-new-studio-hundred-star-games">report by Polygon</a>.
