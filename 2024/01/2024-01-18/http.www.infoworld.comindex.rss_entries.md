<p>When working on applications, you will often need to convert one type to another. Object mapping is the process of mapping a source object to a destination object, where the types of the source and destination objects might differ.</p><p>For example, you might need to create an instance of one class from an instance of another class, then copy the data from the source object to the destination object.
