		When will the U.S.' chief standards organization reach a limit in what it can do to give the facial recognition industry a coherent foundation on which to grow?

That might be unknowable, but the AI community has begun asking if the National Institute of Standards and Technology is becoming overly saturated with <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/innovatrics-ranks-number-one-in-world-in-nist-latent-fingerprint-testing">priorities</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/nist-unmasks-results-of-presentation-attack-detection-and-image-defect-software-testing">new</a> <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/rank-one-computing-launches-iris-biometrics-with-fastest-speed-in-nist-test">lab work,</a> <a href="https://www.biome

		Considerations for businesses to ensure their use of biometrics is responsible and ethical begin with an assessment of whether the technology is really needed, and if the answer is “yes,” continue after it has been implemented. This emphasis on careful and cautious policy creation was a central theme of a webinar on “Responsible and ethical commercial biometrics” hosted by <em>Biometric Update </em>on Wednesday.

The presentation featured an all-star lineup of professionals representing the academic, business and legal communities.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-schuckers-13a44a9b/">Dr. Stephanie Schuckers</a>, director of CITeR, noted that biometric authentication typically carries different risks than remote identity proofing. T

		Some UK councils are refusing to recognize biometric residence permits (BRP) which may be putting newly recognized refugees at risk of homelessness, refugee rights groups are warning.

Refugees arriving in the UK who are granted refugee or <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/humanitarian">humanitarian</a> protection status receive biometric residence permits (BPR) within five to seven working days. Relying on fingerprint and facial biometrics, a BRP can be used to confirm a person’s identity, their right to study in the UK and their right to any public services or benefits. Once they receive it, refugees are expected to move out from government-provided asylum accommodation within 28 days.

		Stina Ehrensvard wants to make cybersecurity as popular as chess. The co-founder of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/yubico">Yubico</a>, the company hardware authentication device YubiKey, is helping to create a miniseries centered around cybersecurity.

The show was inspired by the runaway success of Netflix's hit The Queen’s Gambit, which <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/06/us/queens-gambit-chess-popularity-trnd/index.html">sparked a surge</a> of interest in the game.

“I learned things about chess because I watched that series and because it was an intriguing story,” Ehrensvard tells <em>Biometric Update</em>.

The show is just one part of Ehrensvard’s work as the new chief evangelist at Yubico, which for the last 17 years has b

		A group of researchers is breathing life into a new biometric system that could identify a person  by measuring the way they breathe, specifically their exhalations.

Each of us breathes in a different way. During exhalation, air passes from the lungs through the complex internal structures of our airways which creates turbulence signatures – a unique biomarker. Scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in India have now created a biometric algorithm based on measuring the turbulence in an exhaled breath which can be used to authenticate and identify a user, according to research <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02447">published</a> in open-access repository arXiv.

To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, scientists measured exh
