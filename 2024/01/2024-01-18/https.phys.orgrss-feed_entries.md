Unemployed people often need not only a financial safety net but also a stimulus to look for work. Ph.D. candidate Heike Vethaak researched the effects of incentives used by benefit agencies, such as compelling people to widen their job search. And what happens when the application process is unintentionally long? "The effects are often contradictory."

The general theory of relativity is based on the concept of curved space–time. To describe how the energy and momentum of fields are distributed in space–time, as well as how they interact with the gravitational field, a special mathematical construct is used—the energy–momentum tensor. This is a kind of analog of energy and momentum in ordinary mechanics.

In Dante Alighieri's epic poem The Divine Comedy, the famous words "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here" adorn the gates of hell. Interestingly enough, Dante's vision of hell is an apt description of what conditions are like on Venus. With an average temperature of 450°C (842°F), atmospheric pressures 92 times that of Earth, and clouds of sulfuric acid rain to boot, Venus is the most hostile environment in the solar system. It is little wonder why space agencies, going all the way back to the beginning of the Space Age, have had such a hard time exploring Venus' atmosphere.

Electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established method for treating disordered movement in Parkinson's disease. However, implanting electrodes in a person's brain is an invasive and imprecise way to stimulate nerve cells. Researchers report in Nano Letters on a new application for the technique, called magnetogenetics, that uses very small magnets to wirelessly trigger specific, gene-edited nerve cells in the brain. The treatment effectively relieved motor symptoms in mice without damaging surrounding brain tissue.

We tend to separate the brain and the muscle—the brain does the thinking; the muscle does the doing. The brain takes in complex information about the world and makes decisions, and the muscle merely executes. This has also shaped how we think about a single cell; some molecules within cells are seen as 'thinkers' that take in information about the chemical environment and decide what the cell needs to do for survival; separately, other molecules are seen as the 'muscle,' building structures needed for survival.

Congressional funding for this Drug Abuse Resistance Education program surged to over US$10 million per year by 2002, despite studies published in the prior decade demonstrating the original program was ineffective at preventing substance use. Following mounting political pressure and declining government investments, the DARE program was retooled.

The transport of ions to and from a cell is controlled by pore-forming proteins embedded in the cell membrane. In particular, voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) govern the transfer of sodium (Na+) ions, and play an important role in the regulation of the membrane potential—the voltage difference between the cell's exterior and interior.

Now, researchers at the University of Buenos Aires and the University of Regensburg have discovered that these ants can evade the most ecological friendly and effective control method we have—toxic baits—by rapidly abandoning them before the ants can be killed.

Strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) is one of the most important concepts in heterogeneous catalysis. Triggered by pretreatment or reaction processes, the supported metal nanoparticles may be partially or completely encapsulated by support-derived overlayers, which impact the catalytic performance of supported metal catalysts. However, the formation mechanism of the SMSI state is still unclear.

For many years, most astrophysical models assumed that planets beyond our solar system, known as exoplanets, are heated at similar depths by their host stars (i.e., stars like the sun around which planetary systems are formed). Analyses of recent observations by several collaborations using different telescopes, however, suggest that some exoplanets could absorb heat much deeper into their atmosphere than originally thought. Such exoplanets could display a weather pattern very different than has been expected from past modeling.
