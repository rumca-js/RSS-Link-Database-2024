Niemann\u2019s problem is that his switch to LIV Golf and subsequent world ranking decline means he faces a battle to feature at all in golf\u2019s four prime events.</p><p>Niemann was a top 20 player in the world when he left the PGA Tour for golf\u2019s rebel circuit, which is not recognised by the sport\u2019s ranking system. Niemann slipped to 87th before being invited to play two events in Australia in December. He won the second of them, the Australian Open, which earned him an invite to the Dubai Desert Classic. The 25-year-old makes no secret of the fact he is here at the Emirates Club trying to break into the world\u2019s top 50, which would provide a spot at Augusta National in April. Niemann has joined the DP World Tour with major pursuit in mind.</p> <a href=\"https://www", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/18/joaquin-niemann-majors-dubai-desert-classic-golf", "date_published": "2024-01-18T12:34:16+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89098024df4bd6c8b965f684090bc756149d9588/381_758_3789_2273/master/3789.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9eb95814319c9386152677c049949d8", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "English National Opera employees: share your view on the strike", "description": "<p>We want to speak to musicians, performers and music staff in the English National Opera after they voted to strike</p><p>Musicians, performers and music staff in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/17/english-national-opera-strike-cuts\">English National Opera have voted to strike</a> over planned cuts to the workforce.</p><p>It will be the first time that Musicians\u2019 Union members have taken full strike action in 44 years.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/18/english-national-opera-employees-share-your-view-on-the-strike\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/18/english-national-opera-employees-share-your-view-on-the-strike", "date_published": "2024-01-18T12:33:27+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-gb", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2bd0c0ffeecaa91f9115fa2e74a06b6014ea42b/0_107_4138_2484/master/4138.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c35adf85e27f0d92ee4dca5015ff1df", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Dining across the divide: \u2018He came with a list, papers, diagrams.
