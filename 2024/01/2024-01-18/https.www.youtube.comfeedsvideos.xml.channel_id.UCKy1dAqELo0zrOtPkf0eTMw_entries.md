In today's Daily Fix:
Rockstar will be disabling some features from Grand Theft Auto Online from the PS4 and Xbox One versions. Those last-gen consoles are more than a decade old now, and in order to keep feature updates coming to those platforms, some other features need to go, namely the Rockstar Editor. In other news, Microsoft is prepared to be a "good publisher" on Sony and Nintendo consoles, now that their blockbuster deal with Activision Blizzard has gone through. So can we expect first-party Xbox titles on the PS5 or Switch? Time will tell. And finally, Call of Duty has been dethroned as the de facto best-selling game of the year, according to Circana. WB Games' Hogwarts Legacy is the best-selling title of 2023, beating out other games like Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur's Gate 3.

While both are fun, there is one clear winner when it comes to which is the more complete experience. Here's why Kratos and his story-driven action comes out on top of Ellie's combat-centered efforts.

In today's Daily Fix:
Activision's anti-cheat software, Ricochet, which runs alongside popular games like Call of Duty: Warzone and Modern Warfare 3, will know if you turn on aim assist while using a mouse and keyboard. The punishment: it will shut your game down. No, not just boot you from the server, the whole application will close. Oh, and repeat offenders may get banned permanently. In other news, Larian Studios has again confirmed that Baldur's Gate 3 will not be coming to Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, or other game subscription services. The head of the studio has voiced support for traditional methods of selling games, like actually buying physical copies, as opposed to relying on a service where access to your game could be pulled at any time. And finally, the GTA 6 trailer was views tens of millions of times already. Hundreds of millions, even. But it's still a far cry from the actual most-viewed game trailer on YouTube. Bet you can't guess what it is.
