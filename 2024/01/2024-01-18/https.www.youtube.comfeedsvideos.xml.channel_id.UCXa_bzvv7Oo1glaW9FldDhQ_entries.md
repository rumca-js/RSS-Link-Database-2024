Few would have expected a Pokemon-like title with cute creatures running around with submachine guns and assault rifles, but Pocketpair's Palworld offers that and much more. On the surface, it's all about exploring a massive 3D world and collecting Pals to add to your collection.

There's a lot of resource gathering and crafting involved, along with leveling up your Pals and improving their abilities.

Palworld launches into early access on January 19th. Here are 15 things you should know before jumping in.
