Retro Video Games and Consoles are back and bigger than ever but it’s hard to play them on your 4k OLED TVs. The Retrotink 4k might solve that problem, and we’re going to test if you even need to keep your CRTs. Trinitron? More like Trini-GONE! This UHD scaler has HDR, 120hz, advanced phosphor emulation and an HDMI input. But is it worth adding to your collection?
