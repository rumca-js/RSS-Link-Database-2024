In other news, Larian Studios has again confirmed that Baldur's Gate 3 will not be coming to Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, or other game subscription services. The head of the studio has voiced support for traditional methods of selling games, like actually buying physical copies, as opposed to relying on a service where access to your game could be pulled at any time. And finally, the GTA 6 trailer was views tens of millions of times already. Hundreds of millions, even. But it's still a far cry from the actual most-viewed game trailer on YouTube.
