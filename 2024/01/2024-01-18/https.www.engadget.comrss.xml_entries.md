It also confirmed the game's title —<em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>— and revealed that it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PC and Xbox Cloud Gaming later this year.</p>
<p>No prizes for those who guessed that it's an action-adventure game that will see Indy try to stop some bad guys who are in pursuit of a mysterious power. The story takes place in 1937, between the events of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> and <em>The Last Crusade. </em>The <del>McGuffin</del> powerful force in question is connected to something called The Great Circle — a perfect circle around the globe that links human-built ancient sites of "great spiritual sign

<p>Meta is <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C2QB4NGRVHn">reorganizing</a> its AI teams as it joins the growing ranks of companies trying to create artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Mark Zuckerberg, who has been increasingly focused on the company’s AI research, said the change would help the company “accelerate” its research and, eventually, improve the metaverse.</p>
<p>Meta currently has two teams pursuing AI research: the Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team, started in 2013, and a team solely focused on generative AI experiences for users of its apps. With the change, Zuckerberg said, the company would bring the two “closer together” as it looks to expand both groups. Meta’s CEO didn’t say how many workers it might add to its AI efforts, but the expansion is notable considering the company has shed more than 20,000 jobs since 2022.</p>

<p>We finally have a release date for Ninja Theory's <em>Hellblade</em> sequel: May 21, 2024. It's been over four years since <em>Senua's Saga</em> was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-12-xbox-series-x-hellblade-2-senuas-saga-in-engine.html">announced at the 2019 Game Awards</a> alongside Microsoft's (then next-gen) Xbox Series X console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first game in the series, <em>Senua's Sacrifice</em>, focused on the main character's journey to the realm of the dead, and her battle with mental health issues. <em>Saga </em>will focus on Senua tracking down the Vikings who have been raiding her home town. Expect more &quot;perception puzzles led by her experiences of psychosis,&quot; along with some pretty standard video game combat, but this time, in Iceland!</p>

<p><em>Avowed</em>, the fantasy roleplaying game from <em>Outer Worlds</em> studio Obsidian Entertainment, is due to hit Xbox and PC in the fall. This is a slight update from the game's original release window, which was just &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/obsidian-fantasy-rpg-avowed-release-date-sgf-2023-174259416.html">2024</a>.&quot; Specifically, <em>Avowed</em> will hit Xbox Series X/S, PC via Xbox and Steam, and it'll be available through Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p><em>Avowed</em> is an expansive first-person RPG with old-school fantasy vibes. Players will set off on a journey across the Living Lands, on a mission for the kingdom of Aedyr. A plague is spreading across the island of the Living Lands and players have been sent to investigate what's going on — along the way, they'll discover how they're personally tied to the region and its mysteries.</p>

<p>Just like death and taxes, you can usually rely on a Call of Duty game to top the sales charts each year. The various entries in Activision’s warfare simulation franchise have mostly done just that, going all the way back to 2009. This year’s a bit different. <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III </em>has fallen to second place, as reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1747982965458772368">media research firm Circana.</a></p>

And, like many of its social media peers, the company’s 2024 efforts will closely resemble what it’s done in the past.</p>
<p>To start, the company is introducing its in-app election guide, which will point users to information about voting, including how to register and how to vote by mail. While the election guide will look similar to years past, the company is introducing it earlier than it has in past elections (its election resources <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-election-guide-150058696.html">for 2020</a> and <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-elections-center-2022-midterms-100047874.html">2022</a> debuted much closer to their respective contests than this year’s, which comes just as the

<p>Black holes are one of the most powerful forces in the universe, but we had never seen one until the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-06-the-first-ever-black-hole-image-lands-scientists-3-million-priz.html">released the first image</a> back in 2019. Now, the EHT Collaboration has released the most <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/M87-one-year-later-proof-of-a-persistent-black-hole-shadow">detailed image yet</a> of the same M87 black hole, created with the aid of an additional telescope and independent data from 2018, that better displays the insane physics behind these supermassive objects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first image was captured in 2017 (it takes a long time to process the data) using eight high-altitude telescopes from locations including Chile and Antarctica. The complex technique required the synchronization of atomic clocks, use of the Earth's rotation and processing of petabytes of RAW telescope data. The result was sli

<p>Samsung’s big Unpacked event yesterday unashamedly focused on the company’s annual flagship phone refresh. No smart speakers, no tablets, no wearables (pretty much…) just three more phones, each with entirely different unique features. Just kidding: It’s mostly just changes to cameras and screen size. Same as it’s been since the Galaxy S20.</p>
<p>While introducing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-s24-and-s24-plus-hands-on-samsungs-ai-phones-are-here-but-with-mixed-results-180008236.html">Galaxy S24, S24+</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-hands-on-a-fresh-titanium-frame-combined-with-a-big-bet-on-ai-180050005.html">S24 Ultra</a>, the company wheeled out streamer and YouTuber Pokimane to cheerlead the even brighter screens, while MrBeast — who <em>Samsung</em> couldn’t afford to have there in person? — showcased some of the camera tricks and specs of the flagship S24 Ultra.</p>
<p>However, beyond the predictable spec bumps, Samsung went

It put a lot of focus on the headset's entertainment features and is most likely hoping that they could help convince tentative buyers to take the plunge. But one name was clearly missing from the list of streaming apps arriving on the platform, and it's the biggest one of them all: Netflix. Now, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-17/watching-netflix-on-apple-vision-pro-you-ll-have-to-use-the-web?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> is reporting that Netflix currently has no plans to release a special application for the Vision Pro.</p>

<p>Social media apps tend to offer the convenience of their very own camera tools, but on the flip side, these are limited by the few shooting options. Understanding our modern-day pain point, Samsung has teamed up with Instagram and Snap to integrate some of its handy native camera features into their apps, in order to up our social media game via the brand new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2024-all-the-latest-news-and-updates-170011338.html">Galaxy S24 series</a> smartphones — namely the titanium-framed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-hands-on-a-fresh-titanium-frame-combined-with-a-big-bet-on-ai-180050005.html">S24 Ultra</a> with its 200-megapixel main shooter. Specifically, you'll be able to leverage Samsung's &quot;Super HDR&quot; option, upgraded &quot;Nightography&quot; power and video stabilization within Instagram and Snapchat's in-app cameras. The only caveat here is that for video stabilization, you'll need to have it e

<p>If you're in the US, any Watch Series 9 or Ultra 2 model you buy from Apple will no longer have a functional blood oxygen monitoring feature. Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-ban-part-two/">failed</a> to convince the court to allow it to keep selling the aforementioned models while it's appealing a ruling by the US International Trade Commission (ITC). If you'll recall, the commission <a href="https://www.engadget.com/itc-rules-against-apple-in-patent-dispute-setting-up-potential-ban-181123636.html">found that Apple had violated patents</a> owned by medical technology company Masimo, which accused the iPhone-maker of infringing on its intellectual properties related to light-based blood-oxygen monitoring. The ITC ordered the company to stop selling the contested watches.</p>
