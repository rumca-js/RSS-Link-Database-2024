Code and Notes -- https://github.com/elithecomputerguy/AI-Powered-Decision-Tree-for-Talking-Computer-Python-OpenAI-API-Google-Speech-

In this class we create an OpenAI powered decision tree so that users can communicate with our computer/ robot using their own language and linguistic style.  You send your entire file of functions to OpenAI, and then request the function that most appropriately corresponds to what the user is asking for.

This means you no longer have to hard code specific trigger words for events.
