It's a wonderful record that's buoyed by impeccably chosen guests \u2014 MUNA's Katie Gavin, Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, two members of The 1975 \u2014 and a pervasive mood of low-key dreaminess.\n\nAt the Tiny Desk, Bain recasts four of In the End It Always Does' songs in fresh arrangements that swap out the synths while highlighting the more organic sounds of brushed drums, a violin, a spare piano and the occasional baritone sax. And, though she closes with the album's effervescent lead single \"Boyhood,\" Bain also uses her set to center the album's softer material \u2014 particularly the lush gem \"Baby Goes Again,\" which has no business languishing ", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3gwRr_54cE", "date_published": "2024-01-18T10:00:28+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "NPR Music", "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/h3gwRr_54cE/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
