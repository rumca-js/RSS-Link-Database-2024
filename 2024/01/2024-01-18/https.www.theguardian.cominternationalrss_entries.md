Gabetta’s cello soars through Mendelssohn’s long melodies, in conversation with the buoyant but mellow tone of Chamayou’s mid-19th-century fortepiano. That softer keyboard sound doesn’t lead to any loss of definition: on the contrary, those restless, rippling accompaniments seem to bounce from Chamayou’s fingers, clear and transparent.</p><p>

<p><strong>18 January 1964</strong>: The group receives a strong but not hysterical ovation after  performing the first of 18 days of concerts at the Olympia music hall</p><p>Following hard on the heels of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim%C3%A9_Duval">Père Duval</a> – who, the previous night, had a sedate audience singing popular religious songs – Les Beatles made their entry to Paris on Thursday at the Olympia music-hall. “There are too many hairdressers invited to Parisian galas these days for such badly combed people to have a triumph,” sniffed the critic of Le Figaro.

<p>How to speak about our bond? This extraordinary pact, this astonishing communion</p><p>In September my longstanding therapist died. I hadn’t seen her in a professional capacity for several years but I’d bumped into her in our local pathology clinic and known in an instant that she was ill. I could see the shadow of death hovering. I waited for her to speak of it – this illness – but she didn’t.</p><p>For months afterwards I fretted about her, wondering how she was, wondering if I would be told when the end got close, wondering if I needed to try to say goodbye.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/18/vale-varda-the-gentle-unflinching-therapist-who-with-three-words-unlocked-my-life">Continue reading...</a>
