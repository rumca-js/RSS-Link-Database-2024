China's population declined by 2.08 million in 2023, with a record-low fertility rate of 6.3 births per 1,000 people. The death rate reached its highest level since 1974, and the population aged 60 and over increased to 296.9 million. China now ranks second behind India in population, and experts predict a further decline of 109 million by 2050. The efforts aren’t working. Chinese women have been shunning marriage and babies at such a rapid pace that China’s population in 2023 shrank for the second straight year, accelerating the government’s sense of crisis over the country’s rapidly aging population and its economic future.

These incidents, while unique to the Indian market, could easily fit into a funny-fail video. One standout claim involved a buyer unintentionally driving a car right through a showroom window, adding a touch of unexpected humor to the list of insurance headaches.
