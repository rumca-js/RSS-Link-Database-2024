<p>As Sean Dyche put it, any distraction is welcome at Everton right now amid the risk of a second points deduction, legal cases, financial disputes and not knowing exactly what they are playing for in the Premier League this season. The FA Cup and André Gomes provided one with a narrow, gruelling win over Crystal Palace in the third-round replay.</p><p>Gomes, who spent last season on loan at Lille and the first half of this campaign injured, illuminated a scrappy tie with a superb free-kick beyond Sam Johnstone shortly before the interval. It was Everton’s first goal direct from a free-kick since Lucas Digne’s at Lincoln in August 2019 and ended a run of six games without a win for Dyche’s team, who will play Luton at home in round four.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/17/everton-crystal-palace-fa-cup-third-round-replay-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Now in his 80s, his paintings are an unpeopled theatre of objects and allusions. For a long time they have intrigued me. There is something insistent, disturbing and highly individual about his art.

(Think High School Musical: the Musical: the Series, but more lucrative.) Despite harsh-to-middling reviews and several trailers noticeably avoiding any of the film’s musical numbers, the new Mean Girls topped the MLK holiday weekend box office with $33m, <a href="https://ew.com/mean-girls-tops-weekend-box-office-8426202">out-earning the original</a> in absolute terms (adjusted for inflation, the first Mean Girls would have made around $40m on opening weekend).

The Chinese-American film-maker talks about ditching a law scholarship – and being one half of a movie power couple</p><p>What does the word expat mean? Its traditional association is with wealthy outsiders lounging around pools in exotic locations, while being waited on hand and foot by the locals. But for Lulu Wang, whose parents migrated to the US from China when she was six years old, it is more complicated. “When I go back to visit my family, I’m not Chinese any more. Not really. But I look Chinese. I’m also not fully an American, but I’m not an immigrant, right? They don’t even understand what that is. And so I’m like, ‘Wait up. Am I an expat here?’ You know, I studied abroad in college, and I went back, and people thought I was the tour guide, because all my friends were white.”</p><p>This was the sensibility that animated her name-making 20

<p>A parrot provides a vital connection to life when a woman moves into a penthouse apartment during the pandemic</p><p>Sigrid Nunez’s ninth novel, The Vulnerables, emerges from the words of others. The first line comes not from the narrator herself, but from another work she now barely recalls. From there it’s a deluge.

In a single paragraph, Sylvia Plath, Rainer Maria Rilke, Elizabeth Bishop.</p><p>Nunez has long been an allusive writer, attuned to the literature that shapes her outlook. Her narrators – Nunez standins – frequently suspend their train of thought, seeking guidance from the writers they admire. The effect is ruminative, charming, a touch eccentric.

<p>Comer plays a young woman whose baby arrives just as environmental crisis begins to break the society around her</p><p>Here is a post-apocalyptic drama of survival, a fiercely acted and unnerving real-time demonstration of law and order breaking down. It is all the more disturbing, credible and immediate in that, unlike other examples of genre, the narrative isn’t heading for an abyss of unknowable chaos. Rather, it envisions society’s grim normalisation of disaster and loss, an evolutionary leap downwards but one in which a kind of rebirth is not ruled out.</p><p>In contrast to the American post-apocalypse of John Hillcoat’s The Road, or the European apocalypse of Michael Haneke’s Time of the Wolf, this film is a very British world-ending – because the populace are unarmed, or mostly.

<p>‘Essex man’, ‘Stevenage woman’, ‘red wall’ – labelling voters like this is seductive but, in today’s world, completely misguided</p><p>When I think about the state of British politics, I keep returning to a man named Tom Skinner. He is not a politician, but a jocular Essex businessman and media personality who found fame through an appearance on The Apprentice. Not only do I admire his positivity and social media updates about seemingly eating a fry-up every day, he also usefully personifies some of the complexity of where we find ourselves today.</p><p>After a Just Stop Oil protest in 2022, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ismP1bNA1yE">Skinner went on GB News</a>, where he accused the group of ruining people’s lives.

At the end of every trial that does not go the barrister’s way, he has to sit down and write an “adverse verdict report”; his best guess at the reasons why. With a rape case, the reasoning is more obscure than with any other type of crime. Physical evidence and witnesses are rare. A tendency to doubt the complainant is still a factor. To some extent, Silcott says, “the jury have to choose who they believe”. Do they identify with the accused? Do they see in him a son, a brother – someone who doesn’t deserve a minimum of four years in jail? Do they find the accuser just a little too calm on the stand?</p><p>When I first meet Silcott, in March 2
