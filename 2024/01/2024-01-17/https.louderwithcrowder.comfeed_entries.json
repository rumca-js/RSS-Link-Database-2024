That is done to make sure the debt is repaid, obviously. But for some reason, the Government woke up one day and decided to make student loans a thing. Not only is your credit not checked before these are handed out like candy, but it is given to very immature drunk college students whose brains have yet to be fully developed. Subsequently, we now have a bunch of brats with useless degrees refusing to pay their debts because they feel as if they were entitled to it and should be rewarded for their idiotic choices.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1747560082638794974\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/01/17/news/some-student-lo", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/student-loan-protest", "date_published": "2024-01-17T22:45:04+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": "", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=51109579&width=980", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "John Kerry Snaps At Reporter When Confronted About HIS Carbon Footprint In Davos: \u201cThat's a stupid question!\u201d", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=51108651&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=76%2C0%2C53%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>The number one reason that you should not believe the climate prophets is because none of them even <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/john-kerry-scorched-misleading-private-jet-use-democrats-standard-hypocrisy\" target=\"_blank\">believe </a>in the impending doom they preach.
