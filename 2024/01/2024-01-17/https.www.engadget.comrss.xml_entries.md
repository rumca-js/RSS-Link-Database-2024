<p>Notion <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.notion.so/blog/introducing-notion-calendar">launched</a> a calendar app Wednesday, built and reskinned from Cron, the calendar startup the company <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.notion.so/blog/notion-acquires-cron">bought</a> in 2022. Tight platform-wide integration will be the appeal for Notion’s “tens of millions” of users. Notion Calendar includes a built-in scheduler and makes it easy to merge content from the productivity ecosystem’s notes, docs and project dates.</p>
<p>Notion Calendar lets you link Notion notes and other documents to meetings, transforming the calendar invite into an all-in-one hub for participants to add or view supporting content. It also integrates with external tools like Google Calendar, Google Meet and Zoom.</p>

<p>Sony is continuing to mine its back catalog of games for movie adaptations while persistently forgetting that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/bloodborne/"><em>Bloodborne</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is <em>right there. </em>Its next game that's bound for the big screen is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-24-until-dawn-faces-cinematography-gallery.html"><em>Until Dawn</em></a><em>, </em>a 2015 interactive horror title that Supermassive Games developed and Sony published.</p>
<p>David F. Sandberg (<em>Lights Out </em>and the Shazam! movies) will direct the adaptation, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/until-dawn-video-game-movie-in-the-works-1235790911/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>. Gary Dauberman, who previously worked on <em>Annabelle: Creation </em>with Sandberg, is taking a fresh stab at a script originally written by Blair Butler (<em>The Invitation</em>).</p>

<p>Near the end of Samsung's Unpacked event today, the company started talking about its health-focused software, Samsung Health. After touting the Galaxy Watch 6's sleep-tracking features and software tools like medication management and an upcoming update to its health software Samsung gave us a quick tease of an upcoming health-focused piece of hardware, the Galaxy Ring. It... looks like a ring, with a host of sensors clearly visible on the inside of the ring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that is literally all we know. No idea of when it'll come out, what it'll do or how much it'll cost. Your guess is as good as mine as to whether it is actually released, but right now I feel like we're <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/09/samsung-galaxy-home-bixby-smart-speaker/">very much in Galaxy Home territory</a>.

<p>Rode, the Australian audio company that enjoyed breakthrough success with the Wireless Go and GO II, has unveiled a dual transmitter version of the more affordable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-wireless-me-squeezes-a-second-mic-into-its-receiver-000009619.html">Wireless ME mic</a>. If you can do without onboard recording, the dual transmitter version could save you from buying extra gear for a multi-mic setup.</p>
<p>As wireless clip-on digital mics have exploded in popularity with creators, the (single transmitter) Rode Wireless ME has been a popular budget ($149) alternative to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-wireless-go-ii-unveiled-150043322.html">$299 GO II</a>. This dual-transmitter model is otherwise the same as the single-mic version. So, you’ll get the same Series IV 2.4GHz digital transmission, Rode’s GainAssist tech and “universal compatibility” with cameras, phones and computers.</p>

<p>Google pitches Circle to Search as “a new way to search anything on your Android phone without switching apps.” You can activate the feature by long-pressing the home button or navigation bar. Then, circle something on your screen with your finger and see the results pop up at the bottom.

<p>Like clockwork, the new year has brought new Samsung Galaxy smartphones. The company announced the new Galaxy S24 lineup today, which includes the flagship <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-hands-on-a-fresh-titanium-frame-combined-with-a-big-bet-on-ai-180050005.html">S24 Ultra</a> along with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-s24-and-s24-plus-hands-on-samsungs-ai-phones-are-here-but-with-mixed-results-180008236.html">Galaxy S24+ and S24</a>. The handsets will look familiar to Samsung diehards, and the company spent most of its launch event hyping AI features rather than hardware upgrades. The new phones boast AI perks like an enhanced photo editor, a “circle to search” feature, quick summarization tools and more.

<p>I own a jacket that’s eerily similar to Tess’ in <em>Open Roads</em>. It’s a blue bomber with yellow and burnt orange accents, and it’s not the only thing that Tess and I have in common. As she leisurely explores her childhood bedroom in the first few minutes of the game, Tess comes across set pieces that ground her environment in the early 2000s. There’s a chunky black television set and scattered DVD cases, little bottles of bright nail polish, a black-and-white strip from a photo booth, newspapers remembering 9/11 and hunting for bigfoot, and a bright pink tube of sickly sweet lip balm. These are the leftovers of her adolescence — the room is disheveled and largely empty, with most of her possessions packed away, ready to move. Tess picks through the room’s remaining photos and yearbooks, her hand-drawn fingers reaching out to interact with 3D objects, revealing more of her backstory with each touch. The cuff of her jacket is jarringly familiar every time it enters the frame.</

<p>It can also travel up to 65 MPH, which is pretty darned fast. The onboard battery allows for a 12 mile round trip, which is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wing-and-walmart-will-offer-six-mile-drone-deliveries-over-dallas-204501938.html"><ins>in line with previous metrics,</ins></a> so that translates to an under six-minute delivery time. That certainly beats pizza delivery. Speaking of, most pizzas are well under five pounds. Just saying.</p>

<p>WhatsApp has introduced new features Channels can use to interact with their followers. The biggest one, perhaps, is voice updates. Channel admins and owners, such as celebrities, can now send voice messages to their group. Meta says Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny was the first celebrity to test it out, but it's rolling out the feature broadly today. Voice updates is one of WhatsApp's most popular features, probably because it allows users to send messages without having to type, even while they're driving or doing something else. Apparently, WhatsApp users send 7 billion voice messages on the app every day, so it was most likely a very easy decision for Meta to bring the feature to Channels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to voice updates, admins can now also share polls in chat that their followers can answer. Plus, WhatsApp now allows Channels to have as many as 16 administrators if they want to make sure that their followers are always up to date with the latest news. As for fans, th

<p>Achieving your fitness goals doesn’t have to be expensive or complicated. Keeping tabs on your daily movement can make you conscious of your activity level and motivate you to stay on top of your gym sessions, or at least hit your steps. That rings especially true if you spend most of your day sitting at a desk like I do. Having a device handy that can keep you accountable can be a game changer. While many smartwatches on the market are decked out with fitness tools, the average affordable tracker might offer just enough to help kickstart your health journey.<br /><br />You might be surprised by how much a $100 (or less) wearable can do. They go well beyond just counting steps, providing in-depth reports on how you're sleeping at night or giving you a breakdown of your heart rate variability during a workout. But given their price, there are tradeoffs: don’t expect a plethora of features or third-party app integrations. To help you decide which cheap fitness tracker to get, I test

<p>For many, &quot;new year, new me&quot; includes finding a new job. Scouring sites like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/linkedins-latest-premium-perk-is-an-ai-job-coach-120044855.html">LinkedIn</a> and Indeed for opportunities can feel like a full-time role in and of itself. This process could potentially improve moving forward, with LinkedIn announcing its latest feature: Job Collections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, instead of searching for a specific industry or role, LinkedIn is using generative AI and large language models to analyze each job posting and categorize it into groups such as IT, pro sports, remote and top startups. Along with saving time, LinkedIn indicates that this feature can benefit people who aren't sure what their next step looks like. The company compares it to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-27-airbnb-to-expand-experiences.html">Airbnb Experiences</a> — you might not know what you're searching for, but you could find something great.

<p>When users open an Incognito browser on Chrome, they'll see a notification warning them that other people using their device won't be able to see their activity but that their downloads, bookmarks and reading items will still be saved. Now, Google has updated that disclaimer in Chrome's experimental Canary channel, shortly after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-agrees-to-settle-5-billion-lawsuit-accusing-it-of-tracking-incognito-users-042435935.html">agreeing to settle</a> a $5 billion lawsuit accusing it of tracking Incognito users. As first noticed by <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://mspoweruser.com/google-updates-chrome-incognito-disclaimer-amid-5-billion-lawsuit-settlement/"><em>MSPowerUser</em></a>, the company has tweaked the disclaimer in Canary to add language that says Incognito mode won't change how websites collect people's data.</p>

<p>If you own a copy of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/minecraft/"><em>Minecraft</em></a><em>: Bedrock Edition</em> or <em>Minecraft: Education Edition</em>, you can now grab a <a href="https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/resources/minecraft-climate-and-sustainability-subject-kit/Planet-Earth-III">free expansion pack</a> based on the BBC's <em>Planet Earth III</em>. Much like the previous <a href="https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/discover/frozen-planet-2"><em>Frozen Planet II</em></a> experience, this new wildlife documentary DLC lets players explore five scenarios through the lens of animals — arctic wolves, ocelots, musk oxen, leopards, Cape fur seals, great white sharks, impalas and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, be the hunter or be hunted; you get to play both sides on locations ranging from the Arctic tundra to the Okavango Delta. In the case of the lily-trotter, you're either the father protecting your chicks from crocodiles, or you're one of the chicks following y
