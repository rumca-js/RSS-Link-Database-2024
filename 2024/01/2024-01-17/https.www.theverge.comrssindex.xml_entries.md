People are increasingly getting their news from social media and digital media (hello), which means the big cable news channels are seeing declines in viewership and subsequent declines in ad dollars. Now, a memo from CNN CEO Mark Thompson outlines some of the early plans to try to save CNN from cable — and grow its presence on the phone.</p>

  <p id="6J1ggT">Apple is expected to include a new security feature in iOS 17.3 next week called Stolen Device Protection that will make it far harder for would-be phone thieves to hijack your Apple ID and any financial information stored on the device. Right now, your lock screen passcode is enough to access or change sensitive personal and financial data, but with the update, thieves would need to use Face ID or Touch ID, and may have to wait an hour, to make certain changes. While Apple hasn’t announced specifically when this feature will come, it’s been testing it in the 17.3 beta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23998665/apple-stolen-device-pro

  <p id="p27cKx">Samsung’s Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus don’t have the bigger screen or 5x telephoto camera of the more expensive Galaxy S24 Ultra, nor do they have its stylus. But in a year when “Galaxy AI” is almost all Samsung wants to talk about, it feels like those differences will matter a little less than usual when these phones start shipping on January 31st.</p>
<p id="R8t4g2">Yes, Samsung’s suite of new AI-infused features is here, and perhaps the single most important thing to know about Samsung’s new S24 lineup is that these are the same whether you opt for the <a href="https://howl.me/clrs5MUAbP8">$799.99 Gal
