That is done to make sure the debt is repaid, obviously. But for some reason, the Government woke up one day and decided to make student loans a thing. Not only is your credit not checked before these are handed out like candy, but it is given to very immature drunk college students whose brains have yet to be fully developed. Subsequently, we now have a bunch of brats with useless degrees refusing to pay their debts because they feel as if they were entitled to it and should be rewarded for their idiotic choices.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

Because if they did, they would not be doing everything they tell you not to do. If they truly thought the sun would explode because of carbon emissions, the last thing they would do is take planes for something that could be held virtually or possibly even an email. </p><p>A reporter in Switzerland confronted John Kerry, who essentially called him out on his hypocrisy. Kerry did not like that because most people on the left get mad when you tell the truth. Subsequently, he snapped at the reporter who was only trying to show the world how much of a n

## Studio Defends ‘Mommy And Me’ Pole Dancing, Claims It's Okay Because Kids Don't Understand What Strippers Are

Yes, the same poles that they use at strip clubs. And the owner of this studio claims that as long as you tell the kids it's “fitness,” there is no problem whatsoever because they won’t know that what they are doing is inappropriate, to say the very least. </p><p>The infuriating part about that justification is that she essentially claims that as long as she lies to the children, then it is okay because they will stay ignorant of the situation. </p><p>That is about as logically equivalent as teaching your kid that stealing is okay, as long as you tell them it's not stealing. </p><p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2024/01/17/atlanta-studio-defend-mommy-and-m

Republicans despise open borders. The ‘no human is illegal’ movement is solely pushed by the left. If you were to blame anyone but the Biden administration on the border crisis, you would be lying. There is no way you can blame anyone but the White House. But KJP walked into today’s press briefing braver than ever.

But somewhere down the leftist line, freedom of thought was thrown out and replaced with Progressive ideology. Subsequently, camps where people are re-indoctrinated into the regime's way of thinking is the status quo. Well, at least for Dr. Jordan B Peterson it is.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

Harvard professor Naomi Oreskes took the stage at the WEF Forum to blast what a toxic place X-Twitter has become. As I'm sure you can imagine, Elon has a response.</p><p>Let's first set the stage. The theme for this year's WEF Forum, CPAC for globalism, is "rebuilding trust." And the way they are going to rebuild trust is with a "global collaboration" to combat "misinformation."

Think CPAC, but for globalists. A group of elitists get together every year to discuss their terrifying plans to control every aspect of your life and claim you will never be happier letting them do so. Then the media gets dispatched to claim any video we share quoting globalists verbatim is "misinformation." That must be why this year, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wef-global-crisis" target="_blank">they declared "misinformation" is the number one global threat</a>.</p><p>One batshit crazy idea from J.
