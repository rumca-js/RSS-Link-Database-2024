<p>Documentary on June Carter Cash who was born into music royalty and a tough, funny trailblazer star – and the co-writer of Ring of Fire</p><p>The title is “June” – no surname. Which is surely director Kristen Vaurio making a point, since her documentary about June Carter Cash makes a convincing case that the country singer has for too long been under-appreciated and overshadowed by her husband Johnny. The stereotype of June is that she was the wifey-for-lifey who saved Cash from his demons, but the woman who emerges here is tough and funny, blazing a trail for herself as an artist. As Reese Witherspoon, who portrayed her in the movie Walk the Line, points out – still indignant – it was June who wrote Ring of Fire (with Merle Kilgore), one of Cash’s most famous songs.</p><p>Carter was born into country music royalty, the Carter family, and was touring by her teens.

<p>A bride-to-be is forced to confront the ugliness of her desires in this food-filled debut of class and ambition</p><p>The premise is this. Piglet is in her early 30s and engaged to the ostensibly perfect Kit. The couple have recently moved into a new-build in Oxford, not far from Kit’s parents. During the week Piglet commutes to London, where she works as an editorial assistant for a cookbook publisher. Life, 90 days from the wedding, presents as an idyll. Things, inevitably, must fall apart. Thirteen days before the wedding, Kit confesses to a betrayal and, on cue, cracks begin to show in Piglet’s scrupulously curated life. There is her shame at the wealth disparity between her family and her fiance’s, as her Derbyshire parents enjoy Viennetta unironically and check prices on menus, while Kit’s subsidise the couple’s mortgage and nuptials. There is the growing gulf between Piglet and her best friend, Margot, whose pregnancy heralds the end of girlish fun. There is the strain to s
