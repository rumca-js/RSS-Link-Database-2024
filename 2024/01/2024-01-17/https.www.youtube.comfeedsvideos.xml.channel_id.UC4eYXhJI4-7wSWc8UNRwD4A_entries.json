The pathos of the band and the country\u2019s recent history permeates the duo\u2019s existence and its music.\n\nAdrian Kazigira and Janvier Havugimana were taught music by the latter\u2019s older brother, who then perished during the country\u2019s brutal genocide. They formed a band as a way to process their nation\u2019s trauma and also bring together Rwanda\u2019s three tribes: Tutsi, Hutu, and Abatwa.\n\nFrom the start, the simple guitar fingerpicking style and very sparse rhythm guide the plaintive vocals into a trance-like meditation. The music is a fascinating mix of guitar strumming that combines the kind of cyclical song form you hear on the West African kora and vocal harmonizing common to many African musical traditions.\n\nThe group\u2019s origin story may be tragic, but The Good Ones\u2019 determination to spread its musical message is an inspiration.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cThe Farmer\u201d\n\u201cMon Cheri\u201d\n\u201cS", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_P4UjbkSJk", "date_published": "2024-01-17T10:00:40+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "NPR Music", "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/l_P4UjbkSJk/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
