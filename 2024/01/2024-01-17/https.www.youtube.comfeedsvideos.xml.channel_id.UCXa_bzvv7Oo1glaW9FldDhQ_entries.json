What kind of end-game does it offer? How heavy is the narrative focus, given its co-op elements? Does every character play the same beyond a few abilities, or do they have more complex mechanics?\n\nThankfully, Rocksteady has offered several new details, from some of the mission types tackled in the end-game to the different kinds of loot that can be acquired (with \"hundreds\" of possible build combinations). It doesn't overwrite any misgivings about the live service elements or looter shooter direction, but there's something for fans of the latter and those seeking a decent narrative.\n\nHere are some of the newest details about Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League that you should know before its launch.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MMMWuyYpKg", "date_published": "2024-01-17T14:30:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/1MMMWuyYpKg/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Palworld Review - Is It REALLY POKEMON WITH GUNS?", "description": "Pokemon clones are nothing new, whether it's acclaimed indie efforts like Cassette Beasts or rivals like Digimon. However, a relatively unknown team unleashing a full 3D creature collector with a massive open world is rare.\n\nPocketpair's Palworld gained some notoriety for being \"Pokemon with guns\" and promising a world. The reality is that it's a solid survival crafting experience, with a great line-up of Pals to collect, sprawling landscapes to explore and a notable presentation bereft of any severe issues. And yes, you can equip some Pals with guns.\n\nThough it has a way to go in some departments, from the task automation of creatures to the combat, Palworld's early access release is a strong start and well worth diving into, warts and all.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdU8-8rKRnE", "date_published": "2024-01-17T11:00:28+00:00", "permanent": false, "bookmarked": false, "dead": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "", "user": null, "language": null, "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/bdU8-8rKRnE/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "comments": [], "vote": 0}]
