It is difficult to merely take in a performance by the Rwandan group known as The Good Ones. The pathos of the band and the country’s recent history permeates the duo’s existence and its music.

Adrian Kazigira and Janvier Havugimana were taught music by the latter’s older brother, who then perished during the country’s brutal genocide. They formed a band as a way to process their nation’s trauma and also bring together Rwanda’s three tribes: Tutsi, Hutu, and Abatwa.
