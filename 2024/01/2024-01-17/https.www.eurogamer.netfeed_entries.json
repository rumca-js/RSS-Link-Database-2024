Embark calls Solo Bank It both \"experimental\" and a \"fast-paced all-in-action\" experience, so you are sure to be kept on your toes. It pits 12 single players against each other in PvP matches. Those taking on Solo Bank It need to scoop up a total of 40,000 Cash to claim victory. \n</p><p>\nThe developer notes strategy is a key factor in this mode, as you won't have a squad backing you up for you to rely on.
