<p>Inflation and other factors tend to force prices on all goods higher, and that seems to be holding true for high-end electronics. But just occasionally consumers reap the benefits of market forces and see prices drop before a product reaches the end of its shelf life. Such is the case for AMD&rsquo;s most powerful current Radeon cards, as the company readjusts its already competitive prices following the launch of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2194178/nvidias-rtx-40-series-super-gpus-make-geforce-great-again.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Nvidia&rsquo;s updated RTX 4000-series Super GPUs</a>. </p>

This includes detecting and blocking viruses, a very specific type of program, but also a wide variety of other digital threats. </p>



<p>PCWorld is constantly covering the latest news in viruses and other threats, and how to defend against them.
