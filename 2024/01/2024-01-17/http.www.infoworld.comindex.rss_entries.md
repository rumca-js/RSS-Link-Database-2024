<p>The Internet may be the greatest creation of modern technology, and it is a work in progress. At the heart of its ongoing development are three different visions of what the Internet might become. In this article, we'll explore the three ideas guiding the technological and architectural future of the Internet: Web 3.0, Web3, and the semantic web.</p><h2 class="toc">Web 3.0: The future of the Internet</h2>
<p>Web 3.0 is the most expansive of the three visions for the Internet. It encompasses and cross–pollinates the ideas of the other two. In essence, Web 3.0 takes the ideas of Web 2.0 and says, “What's next?”</p><p>Web 2.0 generally refers to the web that was developed during the early part of this century.

<p>No question about it, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3204016/what-is-python-powerful-intuitive-programming.html">Python</a> is a crucial part of modern data science. Convenient and powerful, Python connects data scientists and developers with a galaxy of tools and functionality, in convenient and programmatic ways.</p><p>Still, those tools sometimes come with assembly required, sometimes a lot of it. Because Python is a general-purpose programming language, how it’s packaged and delivered doesn’t speak specifically to data scientists. But various projects deliver Python to that audience in a way that’s prepackaged, with little to no assembly required—something regular Python users can benefit from, too.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3245814/get-started-with-anaconda-python.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
