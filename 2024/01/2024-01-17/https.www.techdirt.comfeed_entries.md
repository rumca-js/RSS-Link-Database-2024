As we noted, the research out there does not support the underlying [&#8230;]

And the lower you go on the judicial organization chart, the more likely you are to run into a judge who doesn&#8217;t seem to realize the Constitution exists. The problem for people being sued in state and county courts is that [&#8230;]

Broadband growth has&#160;dramatically slowed, cable TV customers are&#160;leaving in droves, and while they are getting a ton of new subsidies via the infrastructure bill, a lot of that money is [&#8230;]
