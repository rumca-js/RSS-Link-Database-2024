London-based Builder.ai uses AI and other tech to help companies build and maintain apps across various verticals. The company raised a $250 million Series D funding round in May. &#8220;Today I join Builder.ai with the same thrill and excitement to be part of something bigger than myself as I experienced when I joined Microsoft in 1992,&#8221; Torossian wrote on LinkedIn. Torossian&#8217;s stint with Microsoft took him to Paris, Singapore, Munich, and finally at Microsoft’s HQ in Redmond more than&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/tech-moves-ex-microsoft-cvp-joins-builder-ai-as-president-moonbeam-hires-seattle-marketing-vet/">Read

The workforce in the U.S., which currently amounts to about 240 people, is being immediately reduced by about 20%, First Mode CEO Julian Soles said in an email sent to employees today. Most of those employees are in Washington state &#8212; for example, at First Mode&#8217;s Seattle HQ and at its proving grounds in Centralia, Wash. About 125 additional employees work in non-U.S. offices.

The pricing is the same as OpenAI&#8217;s existing ChatGPT Plus subscription, with similar capabilities. This could cause some users to choose between the two services, illustrating the potential for the partners to compete over the long run. But for now, there&#8217;s enough greenfield opportunity in AI that the two companies seem content to claim their own turf.

Opponents to the tax had argued that it was functionally an income tax and therefore a violation of the state constitution&#8217;s strict rules on these taxes, while supporters said it operated as a sales tax and was therefore legal. The state&#8217;s justices had ruled 7-2 in favor of supporters. The tax sparked controversy within the tech industry because it targets stocks, a key part of compensation for many&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/washington-states-capital-gains-tax-stands-as-u-s-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-appeal-of-law/">Read More</a>

And so, it will be missed.&#8221; Zulily&#8217;s downfall is a story of a brand that lost its identity and struggled to maintain a competitive moat, years after the company attracted millions of customers with an innovative e-commerce model aimed at moms.

DARPA selected 14 industry teams, including Blue Origin&#8217;s team, to receive up to $1 million each for studies that are due this spring.
