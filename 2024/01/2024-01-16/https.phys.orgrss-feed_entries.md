In animals, and often in humans too, performance is significantly impaired when the value of the reward for work is reduced. Argentinian and Hungarian researchers have studied what happens when family dogs are forced to switch from a cooked liver reward snack to dry food. The results show that dogs are not as sensitive to such replacement as other mammalian species.

Intercropping, the simultaneous cultivation of multiple crops, is beneficial for maximizing resource use but poses challenges due to the shading of lower crops by higher ones. This shading, quantified as Cumulative Shading Capacity (CSC), significantly affects light interception and crop efficiency but remains poorly understood. Previous research mainly has focused on light distribution and crop responses without directly quantifying CSC and its variability across rows. Despite attempts using geometrical and statistical models, accurate, direct CSC quantification and understanding inter-row heterogeneity remain elusive.

How the intricate molecular machinery of life arose from simple beginnings has been a long-standing question. Several lines of evidence point towards a primordial "RNA world," where an "RNA copy machine" (a so-called replicase) started making copies of itself and other RNA molecules to kick-start evolution and life itself. However, the ancient replicase appears to have been lost in time and its role in modern biology has been taken over by more efficient protein machines.

Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, commonly known as LiTFSI, and its analogs, are critical electrolytes for lithium batteries and solar cells. However, the commercialization of LiTFSI through thermal chemical synthesis relies on the use of NH3 intermediates, which involves multiple catalytic and purification processes, leading to substantial carbon emissions. Therefore, developing a method for the direct synthesis of LiTFSI from N2 under mild conditions becomes particularly important.
