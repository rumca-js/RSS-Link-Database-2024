		At least in its earliest days, 2024 looks like it will be the success that last year was in terms of taming AI globally. That is to say, it will fail the world.

AI in general and biometric privacy in particular continues to primarily be a talking point. Talking heads talking about how there's no global government to impose regulations. Virtually all national governments are too inept, political and/or duplicitous to handle their own mess. And businesses are taking advantage of the vacuum or slow-walking when they could be running with code innovation.

Here are four recent, notable talking points.

		The British Columbia Court of Appeal says Yeremia Situmorang, who filed a civil claim alleging pictures of his children taken on his Android phone were automatically uploaded to Google Photos without his consent, can go back to the B.C. Supreme Court to try and certify his class action suit against the tech giant for the non-consensual collection of face biometrics.

A court <a href="https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/ca/24/00/2024BCCA0009.htm">document</a> states Situmorang’s argument that “facial biometric data is intrinsically sensitive personal information, akin to an individual’s DNA or fingerprints,” and that collecting said data without consent constitutes a violation of privacy.

Situmorang’s action is on behalf of anyone who had facial biometric identifiers extract
