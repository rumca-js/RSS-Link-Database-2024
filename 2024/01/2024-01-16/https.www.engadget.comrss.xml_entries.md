<p>The cult hit <em>Prison Architect</em> <a href="https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=f2b6f430f6574f4d360bd22a5&amp;id=84aabc34bf"><ins>is getting a sequel</ins></a> and it's actually releasing pretty soon. The franchise follow-up launches on March 26 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257610/Prison_Architect_2/"><ins>PC via Steam,</ins></a> Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. There’s even a trailer, posted below. Of note, <em>Prison Architect 2</em> brings the series to 3D, as the original was a strictly top-down affair. The sequel has a cartoonish look that’s slightly reminiscent of newer Dragon Quest games, but the gameplay is anything but a JRPG.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, it’s a robust prison-building simulator. We loved the original and wrote that it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-20-prison-architect-makes-you-part-of-the-problem.html"><ins>nearly impossible to play the game in a humane way,</ins><

First <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://respawnfirst.com/remedy-entertainment-and-take-two-clash-over-logo/">reported</a> by <em>RemedyFirst</em>, the trademark dispute was filed against two versions of the Remedy logo (one <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003910498">with the company’s name</a>, one <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/History/1/UK00003910520">without</a>) in September with the UK’s Intellectual Property Office.</p>

<p>Yamaha is a pillar of the electronic music making world, but it's perhaps best known for its stage synthesizers and studio monitors. Today, that might change as the company unveils the SEQTRAK ("seek-track") groovebox. Let's address the obvious first, yes, this looks very much like Yamaha had a meeting and decided to take Teenage Engineering head-on. The SEQTRAK (R.I.P. my shift key) takes more than a little inspiration from the Swedish firm's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-19-teenage-engineering-op-z-review-synth.html">OP-Z portable studio</a> and it even borrows the firm's favored <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineerings-ko-ii-sampler-review-150038528.html">gray and orange aesthetic</a> (though the SEQTRAK also comes in dark gray/black).</p>
