The Last of Us Part 2 was not just a great game in terms of its mechanics, but also a technical achievement with its clever usage of baked lighting techniques and highly detailed character models. 

It's a game that's ripe for being brought over to the new generation of consoles, and Naughty Dog has done just that with The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered for the PS5. 

It's more of an iterative upgrade over the original as opposed to a radical overhaul, but those incremental upgrades coalesce to create what just might be the best looking and best playing version of the game. With this video, we will be taking a look at the game's technical aspects and break them down individually.

The Last of Us Part 2 is the sort of game that you either love or you hate. I fall in the former category, so any excuse to jump back into Naughty Dog’s masterpiece would have been one I would have snapped up all too eagerly- and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is an excellent way to do just that. 

The campaign is, of course, still some of the best content Naughty Dog has ever made, but on top of that, the remaster also delivers a meaty additions like Guitar Free Play and the Lost Levels, and what you get is a surprisingly comprehensive expanded re-release of a masterpiece.
