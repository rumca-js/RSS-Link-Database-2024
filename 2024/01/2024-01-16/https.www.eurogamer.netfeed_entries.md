With Diablo 4's third season of post-launch content - now officially titled Season of the Construct - rapidly approaching, Blizzard has finally deemed it time to share some details about what it'll bring when it arrives on 23rd January next week.
</p><p>
"Ancient forces threaten Sanctuary," the studio <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/diablo4/24053482/unearth-a-looming-threat-in-season-of-the-construct">writes in a bout of scene-setting</a> over on its blog. "Aided by your Seneschal Companion, hazard the many traps and devastating Constructs beneath the deserts of Kehjistan." Here, it continues, "elemental forces are amassing for malicious whims of the demon Malphas. Only by descending far below the surface will you be able to cull this cursed threat from its root."

We've not heard much about Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remastered-original-tomb-raider-trilogy-headed-to-switch-next-year">unveiling back in September last year</a>, but now developer Aspyr has emerged to share further details about what players can expect - including control toggles and a photo mode - when Lara Croft's spruced-up early adventures come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC, on 14th February.
</p><p>
Writing in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/01/16/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-ps4-ps5-features-detailed-new-key-art-revealed/">new post on the PlayStation Blog</a>, Aspyr explains it wanted to focus on "additions instead of revisions" when developing Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered, saying it believes the "gameplay of [the originals] is timeless."

## Final Fantasy 14 Online's Xbox open beta launch announced then unannounced by Microsoft

It looks like the wait for Final Fantasy 14 Online on Xbox Series X/S could be ending very soon; Microsoft today announced that an open beta for the acclaimed MMORPG was now "officially available" before yanking the post and tweeting to say it had "incorrectly" shared the news.
</p><p>
Final Fantasy 14 has been a long time coming to Xbox; it launched for PC and PlayStation back in 2013, but it wasn't until last summer that Microsoft and developer Square Enix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-heading-to-xbox">confirmed</a> it'd finally be making the leap to Xbox - specifically Xbox Series X/S consoles - in "spring 2024".
</p><p>
At the time, Microsoft said Final Fantasy 14 Online's full Xbox arrival would be preceded by an open beta, planned to coincide with the game's patch 6.5X. And with Patch 6.55 out tod

## Sea of Thieves' Season 11 adds fast-travel in radical voyage overhaul next week

Sea of Thieves' 11th season is right around the corner, and it looks like its arrival next Tuesday, 23rd January, could very well bring the most radical overhaul for the multiplayer pirate adventure since its launch back in 2018. Behold the advent of fast-travel.
</p><p>
As per Rare's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfFgOw4cva4">latest video update</a>, Sea of Thieves' Season 11 makes sweeping changes to the way voyages are accessed and activated. Previously, voyages - essentially self-contained quests directing players to specific themed activities, if you're familiar - could only be purchased from trading company representatives at outposts, meaning a whole lot of time spent engaged in often wholly uneventful sailing as you traversed back and forth across the map to pick up new voyages, drop off loot, and on.

Popular jail simulator Prison Architect will get a 3D successor, and it'll release on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th March.
</p><p>
British developer Double Eleven and publisher Paradox Interactive made the announcement today, and confirmed a &pound;35 pricetag ($40/&euro;40). 
</p><p>
As you can see from the reveal trailer below, Prison Architect 2 (as it's unsurprisingly titled) has been rebuilt from the ground up as a 3D experience, unlocking the ability to build across multiple floors in a sandboxy environment with ease.

Square Enix's upcoming team shooter Foamstars will have a small amount of AI art, the developer has said.
</p><p>
Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-confirms-foamstars-contains-some-ai-generated-art/">VGC</a>, Foamstars producer Kosuke Okatani said the team had "dabbled" with AI program Midjourney - a known AI tool that converts text into art - but the majority of the game has been crafted by hand.
</p><p>
"All of the core elements in Foamstars - the core gameplay, and the things that make the game enjoyable - those are all made by hand," Okatani said.

A patch in 2021 added 60fps support for PS5, with a transformative impact on gameplay, but now we've got something further: The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, a new bespoke PS5 version that promises visual enhancements alongside additional content. </p><p>Going into this analysis, I wanted to find out if there's enough performance headroom on PS5 for visual improvements while keeping up that 60fps update - and whether the new content additions are meaty enough to justify an upgrade for existing players, even at a fairly painless $10. </p><p>After all, the original TLoUP2 enhancements for PS5 already have the game running at 1440p and 60fps

Microsoft has revealed its next batch of Game Pass titles for January and into the start of February.
</p><p>
Notable additions this month include Persona 3 Reload and Palworld (aka Pok&eacute;mon with guns, see picture above). Persona 3 Reload (Cloud, Console, and PC) will arrive early next month, on 2nd February.

"I can say that Persona 3 Reload's promise is undeniable," wrote Henry Stockdale in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-3-reload-builds-on-fine-foundations-but-may-fall-just-short-of-definitive">Eurogamer's preview of the game</a>. "Remaking an RPG with such a vast legacy would prove daunting for many, yet even with the omissions, Atlus is building on the original game's foundations well. After many years of waiting, I'm excited to dive in properly next month."

I don't replay games as much as I'd <em>like</em> to. Like most things in my life &ndash; and yours, I suspect &ndash; I always intend to carve out extra time for them, but other things always seem to get in the way. Work. Kids. Partners. Kids again. By the time I get to the end of the working week, I barely have half-hour left to tackle one of the brand new games sitting expectantly in my To-Be-Played pile, let alone indulge in a little nostalgia.</p><p>The games that do get an encore, then, are particularly special. The Last of Us &ndash; both instalments &ndash; fall firmly under that category because every playthrough feels a little different depending upon how you approach it. My natural inclination, for instance, is to stealth my way through as much of the game as possible, only resorting

Back in 2018, Nvidia released its first wave of RTX graphics cards, boasting RT and machine learning features - but also arriving with some eye-watering price rises. &pound;530 for the RTX 2070, anyone? However, balance was restored to the Force with the 2019 'Super' refresh, where 60, 70 and 80 class GPUs were beefed up in terms of specs with a price-cut to boot. So it is with the controversial RTX 40-series cards based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. Saddled with unflattering price vs performance comparisons up against the RTX 3080 10GB, this time it's the RTX 4070, 4070 Ti and 4080 that get the Super treatment.</p><p>It looks like Nvidia is going to release one new GPU per week and that kicks off with the RTX 4070 Super. It's priced at $599 US/&pound;579 UK - the same price as the RTX

The upcoming feature is being made in collaboration with the game's developer LKA, Wired Productions and Studios Extraordinaires from Sweden. It is currently in "active development".

Martha is Dead writer and designer Luca Dalc&ograve; called the forthcoming adaptation a "dream come true".

While its sequels have a clear best option, I remember taking ages deliberating over FES or Portable, eventually beating the former on PS3. I fondly remember that journey, even preferring it to Persona 4, yet I always felt like I was missing a lot. Persona 3 Reload doesn't quite deliver the all-encompassing remake many fans hoped for, yet my recent preview convinces me that Atlus is otherwise on the right path.</p><p>Going hands-on for nearly two hours, this preview build differed considerably from the Gamescom/EGX demo. I felt pleasantly nostalgic as I explored Gekkoukan High School and Tatsumi Port Island. Reload recreates the original setting with precise attention to detail.

Take Two Interactive has entered a trademark dispute with Remedy Entertainment, and says the latter's logo resembles the R* of Rockstar Games.
</p><p>
Remedy revealed this logo in a <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/a-fresh-and-refined-look-for-remedy-entertainment">blog post</a> back in April last year. "The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old," it wrote at the time. "It was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today's Remedy."

The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology was previously set to arrive on 30th January for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

Ubisoft has updated its subscription model, and said consumers need to be "comfortable with not owning [their] game".
</p><p>
Ubisoft+ will now feature two revised tiers. Ubisoft+ Premium (&pound;14.99/$17.99 per month) will include all new releases and - in some cases - early access to games alongside premium editions, monthly rewards and more. Ubisoft+ Classics on PC, meanwhile, is a brand new curated selection of popular back-catalogue and live games (&pound;6.99/$7.99 per month).
</p><p>
Director of subscription Philippe Tremblay told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-ubisoft-and-getting-gamers-comfortable-with-not-owning-their-games">GamesIndustry.biz</a> there is "tremendous opportunity for growth" for subscription models, but the mindset of consumers needs to change.

The director of Warner Bros' upcoming Minecraft film adaptation wants to avoid any kind of fan reaction akin to <em>that</em> 'Ugly Sonic' reveal. 
</p><p>
As a reminder, 'Ugly Sonic' was the original design for Sonic from the 2020 film, starring Jim Carrey and James Marsden. On Sonic's initial full reveal in the first trailer, many were left unimpressed (to put it mildly) by the direction the designers had gone. But even before that there was concern, when posters teasing Sonic's cinematic release showed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonics-looking-slightly-terrifying-in-first-image-for-next-years-movie">hedgehog's oddly lithe silhouette</a> and his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/that-nightmarish-sonic-movie-poster-is-real">nightmarish legs</a>.

In fact, the criticism surrounding Sonic's seemingly final look was s

## "Ambitious" Call of Duty: Zombies live-service game was once briefly in the works at Raven Software

Raven Software was at one time working on a standalone live-service version of Call of Duty's popular Zombies mode, ex-Raven Software lead designer Michael Gummelt has revealed, but it was cancelled after its IP originator - presumably Treyarch - "wanted it back".
</p><p>
That small revelation comes via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelgummelt/details/experience/">Gummelt's LinkedIn page</a> (as spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-raven-software-had-two-projects-cancelled-including-cod-zombies-live-service-and-sequel-to-classic-title">MP1ST</a>), which explains he was lead designer on an "ambitious new Call of Duty: Zombies live service project" between 2011 and 2012, but that the whole thing was canceled "when the [Activision] studio that 'owned' that part of the Call of Duty IP wanted it back."
