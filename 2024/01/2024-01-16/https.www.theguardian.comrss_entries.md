Despite losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden, despite 91 indictments against him for federal and state crimes including racketeering, hoarding classified documents and conspiracy to defraud the United States, despite multiple attempts to keep him from the ballot, Trump is still with us. And he looks set to succeed in his nomination as Republican party candidate for 2024.

Until now</p><p>In theory, over the many meetings that lead to television concepts coming to screen, a series about how the rest of the world consumes and relates to food should have had plenty of meat on its bones, so to speak. But you can probably tell from the punning title that Around the World in 80 Weighs is not that kind of documentary. It’s a shame, as the age of weight-loss television seemed to be behind us.

<p>For David Moyes, a bitter evening on his old stomping ground ended with a sour taste. Not that he could have any complaints, with his West Ham side turning in a barely lukewarm performance that deservedly ended with Bristol City advancing to the FA Cup fourth round. They never truly recovered from Tommy Conway’s early strike after an error by Konstantinos Mavropanos and Saïd Benrahma’s straight red card, for a petulant kick, a few minutes into the second half ensured a forgettable trip and a tempestuous affair went from bad to worse.</p><p>For Moyes, this was an uncomfortable night that also exposed the apparent chasm between the quality of his missing star performers – Lucas Paquetá, Jarrod Bowen, Mohammed Kudus and Michail Antonio were among those absent – and those on the periphery. Simple passes went awry and Moyes went ballistic when Tomas Soucek was penalised for a foul throw as full time approached. No wonder Moyes wants to strengthen before the transfer deadline.</p> <a hr

<p>There has been little action in the window as clubs have been made wary by the charges meted out to Everton and Forest</p><p>It’s quiet. The transfer window has been open for more than a fortnight but most Premier League clubs appear not to have noticed. Instead of the nervous energy that usually makes January so stressful for dealmakers, stillness has descended upon the richest league in the world. Even the usual suspects have remained calm. Chelsea have been a model of restraint so far and there has been no frantic spending from teams at the bottom of the table, whereas in previous years they would have regarded signings as their best chance of avoiding relegation.</p><p>Industry insiders have felt the shift away from the old excess. The widespread view is that the caution is because clubs are wary of falling foul of financial fair play regulations and the league’s profit and sustainability rules, which do not allow for losses of more than £105m over a three-year period.</p> <a

<p>A cult of personality has ensured that believers are blinded to the means employed by the former president to take power</p><p>Before voters in Iowa kicked off the US presidential election cycle on Monday, Donald Trump shared a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/us/politics/trump-god-video-pastors-iowa.html">bizarre campaign video</a> on his Truth Social platform that declared him to be God’s chosen emissary on Earth, sent to deliver prosperity to America. It seemed unlikely that evangelicals in a rural state would buy into such narcissism. Sadly, Mr Trump has blinded believers to the means and fixed their gaze on the ends.

The musicians are recording the piece, so the passage is repeated over and over, then critiqued, with the finest of adjustments made.</p><p>You almost wouldn’t believe that the young Ukrainian orchestra, who are bringing such a disciplined passion to their work, had spent nine hours queuing to cross the Polish border the previous day, nor that they have had to

<p>Sewing is an anti-consumerist act, self-sufficient, creative and thrifty. It means I don’t contribute to sweated labour, and I don’t have to know my dress size</p><p>Being able to sew is radical, liberating and canny, which is why I’ve taught my six-year-old to fix his own socks.</p><p>This may sound like the overzealous justification of someone who as a schoolgirl took more interest in making her own trousers than in how to create a spreadsheet, but I truly believe that the skill of sewing opens the door to a lifetime of self-sufficiency, creativity and thrift.

A domestic double and Big Vase in his first full season as Porto head coach, he led them to a shock Big Cup the following season. At Chelsea, the “Special One” did what Claudio Ranieri couldn’t, moulding a disjointed team into a winning machine; in the age of Alex Ferguson, Arsène Wenger and a Europe-toppling Liverpool side, no less. Two Premier League titles, three Fizzy Cups and one FA Cup in three years at Stamford Bridge. Ridiculous. His Inter spell was another triumph, culminating in a famous treble; in which he sunk <em>that</em> Barcelona side en route to another Big Cup.

<p>The UK's deer population is at its highest level for 1,000 years, and is growing exponentially. Now at roughly 2 million animals, the UK’s deer stalkers need to cull at least 750,000 animals a year just for the population to stand still. There are also more food banks in the UK than ever. As the need for food grows, donations, especially those containing protein, become harder to find.&nbsp;<br />To combat these two problems, the Wild Venison Project has created a supply chain from deer stalkers all over the country to food banks that need protein-rich donations. The Guardian environment correspondent Damien Gayle follows the process from forest to food bank, to see if venison could provide an answer to Britain’s food shortage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2024/jan/16/could-a-surging-deer-population-ease-the-uks-hunger-crisis-video">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fringe movies such as horror and documentary are increasingly turning to digital releases. It allows for creative freedom but doesn’t easily pay the rent</p><p>In the pre-internet dark ages, the most ignominious fate that could befall a film was going straight to video. This infernal tier – available to buy from a newsagent bargain bin or service-station rack near you – was reserved for cinema’s bottom-feeders: second-rate Disney spin-offs, dodgy softcore thrillers, Troma offcuts, over-caffeinated ninja rampages starring Michael Dudikoff.</p><p>But this cinematic silt had a certain trashy sustenance value and the random delight of the tombola. Now straight-to-video is no more, and instead we have straight-to-streaming: hundreds of feature-length films are dumped online every year (to be precise, 107 to streaming in the US alone in 2022, and then there is the TVoD pay-per-view market on top). A few of us at the Guardian sift these releases every week, and I am often stunned by the

Writer-director-producer Oliver Pearn, making his feature debut here after working as an assistant director and the like, is laying down a crisp white calling card by showing off how economically he can tell a story. While this sometimes feels less like cinema and more like a stage piece or even a radio play, the end result is reasonably engaging and propulsive.</p><p>Pearn gets a crucial assist from lead Victoria Lucie who plays Agnes, an operator who spends her days inside a hut working the complex machinery of the exchange; these were the days when you couldn’t just dial a number to call

As the majority of Iowans put their faith in Trump, should we just assume he will be the Republican nominee?

<p>Lawrence Kwan’s film makes some insightful points about journalism while letting in a few cliches too</p><p>Here’s a solid newsroom drama inspired by a string of real-life scandals involving abuse at care homes for elderly and vulnerable people in Hong Kong. It’s a film with a fair few clunking journalism cliches, and it never quite builds momentum. But the performances are uniformly intelligent and committed, and it has some real insights too; there’s the moral outrage a reporter feels as the penny drops, and she realises that people in positions of power already know about cruelty and neglect in homes. They just haven’t had an incentive to care.</p><p>Jennifer Yu is Kay, the star investigative reporter of a Hong Kong newspaper, semi-disillusioned by the job. After a tip off, Kay goes undercover at an understaffed, overcrowded care home, pretending to be the granddaughter of an elderly resident with dementia (she fakes concern when he doesn’t recognise her).

On the way to the tunnel, those express trains speed by Lake Maggiore, affording fine views of the Borromean Islands. For Switzerland-bound trains, the last station stop in Italy is at the small Piedmont town of Domodossola. The station here is remarkably grand, as befits what was once an important gateway into Italy, with all the paraphernalia of customs and immigration. From Domodossola, it is just another half-hour through the Simplon Tunnel to Brig, an appealing Swiss town that guards the northern end of the Alpine tunnel, before trains head on to Berne, Basel and the north.</p><p>If you don’t mind missing the gorgeous scenery around the Swiss-Italian border, then travelling via the Simplon Tunnel route into Switzerland is fine.

How could any writer produce such a multilayered, time-jumping, character-hopping, consistently funny 200,000-word tale at his first attempt? Wisely, the wunderkind has taken his time to produce the next: at 600 or so close-typed pages,<em> Wellness </em>is barely shorter and no less shy of leaps across time and space. An equally remarkable panorama of American life, this new novel invites the reader to sink into a deep, demanding, constantly wrong-footing story of millennial lives misdirected and decisions catastrophically made. It is American storytelling at its best. While <em>The Nix </em>tackled America’s lost legacy of 1960s radicalism, <em>
