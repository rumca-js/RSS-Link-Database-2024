<p>Senator forces long-shot test vote on making US military aid conditional to whether Israeli government violates human rights</p><p>Bernie Sanders was set on Tuesday evening to force the US Senate into a long-shot test vote on requiring further US military aid to Israel to be conditioned on whether the Israeli government is violating human rights and international accords in its devastating war in Gaza.</p><p>A measure he has introduced, to be debated and voted on by senators, is one of several that progressives have proposed to raise concerns over Israel’s attacks on Gaza, where the Palestinian death toll has surpassed 24,000 and Israel’s bombardment since Hamas launched attacks on it on 7 October has displaced most of Gaza’s 2.4 million residents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/16/bernie-sanders-senate-test-vote-military-aid-israel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Serie A club have turned to a beloved figure in Daniele De Rossi to pick up the pieces left by the Special One’s era of wild highs and lows</p><p>Perhaps the story should have ended in Budapest. There had been speculation leading up to the Europa League final last May that it could be José Mourinho’s final week in charge of Roma. There were echoes of his previous time working for an Italian club, in 2010, when he led Internazionale to the treble in his second season then left to join Real Madrid immediately after winning the Champions League.</p><p>He had not touched quite those same heights at Roma, but this was a different context. By claiming the inaugural Europa Conference League in his first season at the club Mourinho had already ended a 14‑year wait for silverware. To follow up in season two by lifting the Europa League would have been an extraordinary achievement with a side whose previous biggest continental success was winning the 1961 Inter-City Fairs Cup.</p> <a href="

<p>Lara Ricote is among the standups whose gags have landed with deaf and hearing people thanks to the work of stenographer Claire Hill</p><p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/17/jokes-climate-crisis-standup-lara-ricote-edinburgh-newcomer">Lara Ricote</a> watches fellow comedians’ gigs, she likes to be near the stage. “I tend to sit in the front row – reading lips is a big one for me,” says Ricote, who has degenerative hearing loss and wears hearing aids. “I went to see a show this week,” she continues, “and the comic chose not to use a mic. So there was 30–40% of it that I didn’t hear.”</p><p>A year ago, Ricote did a live-captioned performance at Soho theatre in London. A stenographer in the room translated her jokes on to an onstage screen, in real time. “You’re like: woah, this is possible, to this extent?” Ricote remembers. “It makes you feel like you have the same access as everybody else.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/16/live-ca

<p>Largest study of ocean DNA reveals abundance of fungi thriving in extreme environment of the deep sea</p><p>Large numbers of fungi have been found living in the twilight zone of the ocean, and could unlock the door to new drugs that may match the power of penicillin.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/science/articles/10.3389/fsci.2023.1038696/full">largest ever study of ocean DNA</a>, published by the journal Frontiers in Science, has revealed intriguing secrets about the abundance of fungi in the part of the ocean that is just beyond the reach of sunlight.

<p>A farmer on the Gold Coast has captured video of fire ants forming floating rafts to survive flood waters in south-east Queensland. The footage was sent to Reece Pianta of the Invasive Species Council, who says the red imported fire ants (Rifa) only make rafts when they reach a certain density. The footage indicates there's been a surge in the population of the ants, which have infested about 700,000 hectares in Brisbane. "The concern we have is that if Rifa are floating on flood waters to lower-lying areas. They don't just inundate farmlands but wetlands and coastal habitats." Pianta says the rafting behaviour underlines the importance of properly funding the ant's eradication</p><p></p><p>► <a href="http://bit.ly/gdnaustraliasubs">Subscribe to Guardian Australia on YouTube</a></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/16/fire-ants-form-raft-survive-floods-ant-rafts-float-water-qld-queensland-australia"><strong>Fire ants form rafts to survive Queensl
