Queen Rock Montreal captures a pivotal moment in the band’s history.  When Queen returned for the fourth time to Montreal’s 18,000-seat Forum in November 1981, where this concert was recorded, it was after a 15-month absence during which they became the biggest band in the world.  Fueled by the release of The Game album, their smash single “Under Pressure,” and extensive touring, Queen now dominated the charts in every major territory across the globe. 

The two shows that took place in Montreal – November 24 and 25, 1981 – were arranged specifically to set Queen up for another first: shooting a full-length concert film to properly document their live show, highlighting the state-of-the art sound recording.  Having spent almost two years on the road, the group was ready for such a challenge and hit Montreal in top form for what would end up being two consecutive sold out, legendary nights.
