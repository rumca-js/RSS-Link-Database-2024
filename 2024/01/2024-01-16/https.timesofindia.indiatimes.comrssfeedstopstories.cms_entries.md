Bombay HC criticizes sessions court judge's order for making "uncalled for" observations against trans persons. HC judge states that transgenders are citizens of this country and are protected under the right to life and liberty. The sessions court's order, which made generalizing and stereotypical remarks about transgenders, should not have been recorded. "Transgenders are getting bolder by the day, and rowdier and nastier. Safety of the public is at high risk at every public place because of transgenders. Therefore, fear or hatred for transgenders is not without a reason, for men it is worst (sic)," session court said.

Mailapur, a village in North Karnataka's Yadgir district, is a unique place with its traditional way of life and deep-rooted religious beliefs. The village, with its narrow roads and closely packed hut-like structures, is primarily engaged in agricultural activities, cultivating crops like cotton, tur, chilli, and sugarcane. However, what sets Mailapur apart is the absence of chickens and poultry farming and the practice of not sleeping on cots. The villagers refrain from keeping chickens and poultry due to their belief in Mailarilingayya Mallayya, who is considered an avatar of Lord Shiva.
