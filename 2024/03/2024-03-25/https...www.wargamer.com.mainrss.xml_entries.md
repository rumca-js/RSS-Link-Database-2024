Not so, Millennia, which swallows time the way only a good Civ-like can. That&rsquo;s hopefully the highest praise I can bestow upon a turn-based game like C &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/millennia/review">Continued</a></p>

								<p>Nobody is more thirsty for Astarion than the actor who plays him, Neil Newbon. Well, not horny thirsty like many of the vampire&rsquo;s fans. But he is still passionate about the character &ndash; and he sat down with Wargamer to tell us more about his experiences with acting, the internet, and Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3.

								<p>Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3 has received plenty of praise for its LGBTQ+ representation, and Neil Newbon happily champions the title&rsquo;s inclusivity. Newbon has one clear message for potential critics: &ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;m woke, it doesn&rsquo;t make a difference to me.&rdquo; His comment is inspired by&nbsp;our&nbsp;discussion of sexuality in the world of Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3.

								<p>The Age of Sigmar double turn mechanic is one of the most unusual, and controversial, aspects of the game. It&rsquo;s also a fundamentally flawed mechanic that, if it can be salvaged at all, needs to be reconceived from the ground up. To make my perspective clear, I enjoy Age of Sigmar plenty.
