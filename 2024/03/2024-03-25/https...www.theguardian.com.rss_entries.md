<p>Arsenal midfielder will captain his country for the first time against Belgium at Wembley on the occasion of his 50th cap</p><p>It is a story that bears retelling mainly because it will make people smile. It was early last week, the England squad have joined up at St George’s Park for the Wembley friendlies against Brazil and Belgium, and Declan Rice bumps into John Stones. So, Arsenal versus Manchester City and, as everybody knows, it is Arsenal versus Manchester City after the international break – at the Etihad Stadium this Sunday. Well, not everybody, as it turns out.</p><p>“I said: ‘Big game next,’” Rice says. “And John said: ‘Who are you playing?’ And I said: ‘We’ve got you lot!’ He said: ‘Oh yeah.’ He didn’t even know they were playing us next! When he’s away from football he likes to be with his family and switch off and I get that.

The stakes of the Berlingo’s mission are extremely high.

But if we are to allow them to race in the UK once a year, maybe let that be at the Cheltenham Festival with perhaps one runner allowed per trainer in each race – not coming over every Saturday and winning everything.”</p>

<p>Officiating howlers, Jess Park and Katie Robinson nudge Sarina Wiegman  and Liverpool’s top-three hopes fade</p><p>Rehanne Skinner’s frustration at the state of officiating spilled over after West Ham’s 2-0 loss to Chelsea and she called for all WSL referees and their assistants to be professional. Skinner’s team were denied an equaliser against the champions after Honoka Hayashi was incorrectly flagged offside, but it is what she sees as repeated wrong calls that pushed her to demand change. “Last week there were two goals that were scored against us, neither of which should have stood, which is another point for us,” she said. “Tottenham game, we get an apology after the game for a goal that should never have stood for offside. I’m getting a bit sick of it to be honest … We just cannot keep having those types of mistakes because it completely ruins the game.” VAR is one solution but Skinner also added, more significantly perhaps, that WSL officials need to be full time.

But <em>The Russian Detective</em>, a remarkable new graphic novel by Carol Adlam, takes its inspiration from more obscure sources. For some years, Adlam, an associate professor in the Nottingham School of Art and Design at Nottingham Trent University, and Claire Whitehead, a reader in modern languages at the University of St Andrew’s, have been working together on the Lost Detective Project: a collaboration that draws on the work of long-forgotten writers of crime fiction who were contemporaries of Dostoevsky. As part of this project, Adlam has created several cross-media adaptations of their stories, of which <em>The Russian Detective</em> is one – and it could not be more rich or more beautiful if it tried.

<p>Midfielder on those early days under Louis van Gaal, spells in Hungary and Slovakia, and how injuries led to retirement at 28</p><p>“I have had so many operations on the left side that my body now tilts, and some days I could barely pass the ball,” the former Manchester United midfielder James Weir says.

<p>The iconoclastic US author’s intellectually poised critique of minimalism boasts scintillating writing of breadth and power</p><p>Becca Rothfeld is a dynamo. I had not come across her before picking up <em>All Things Are Too Small</em> and was unprepared for the book’s extraordinary clout and reach. She is an American journalist (a contributor to the <em>New Yorker</em> and the <em>New York Times</em> and a critic on the <em>Washington Post</em>), a philosopher, polemicist and a wit. She challenges, in this bracing, original and intellectually poised collection of essays, many of our unquestioning modern assumptions and, most persuasively, takes aim at the promotion of minimalism as an ideal for our living spaces, novels and ourselves.</p><p>Nothing, in Rothfeld’s view, succeeds like excess and she packs so much into her opening essay about why it is OK to want more (the most extravagant of Oliver Twists) that you feel richly fed before even turning the first page.

<p>From Monet to Degas, the luminosity of Paris has inspired countless artists. As the city celebrates 150 years of impressionism it’s still shining bright</p><p>Paris is called the City of Light, possibly because of its early adoption of gas street lighting. But that would not explain why, as I approach Gare du Nord on Eurostar during daytime, I&nbsp;experience a soft dazzle, similar to when I see a pebbly beach. This is not a&nbsp;meteorological phenomenon; the weather in Paris is only slightly better than London’s. Instead, the luminosity owes something to the buff or light-grey limestone of the older buildings (including the Sacré Coeur, rearing like a great ghost to my right), its pallor perpetuated by the whitewashed exteriors of newer buildings.</p><p>The light in Paris was a concern of&nbsp;the impressionists, the movement whose 150th anniversary is marked by&nbsp;the Musée d’Orsay’s forthcoming <a href="https://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/whats-on/exhibitions/paris-1874-in

It’s a film that maintains its near-affectless deadpan style from first to last, and declines to offer a conventional emotional payoff, or indeed the usual narrative shape that might lead to such a climax – although there is an emotional outpouring of sorts. It isn’t exactly that sadness finds its outlet in oblique or unusual ways (the heavy drinking we see is, after all, a commonplace symptom) but the way it is represented on screen is indirect.</p><p>Helena (Raquel Castro) is a production manager on a film shoot, dealing with a difficult director.
