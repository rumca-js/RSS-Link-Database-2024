Critical Role, the biggest poster child of the biggest RPG on the market, is taking a shocking turn away from Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the game on which it built its success, and looking to create its own system that looks to redefine the standards for epic <a href=\"https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/roleplaying-game/best-games/best-fantasy-rpgs\">fantasy RPGs</a>.
