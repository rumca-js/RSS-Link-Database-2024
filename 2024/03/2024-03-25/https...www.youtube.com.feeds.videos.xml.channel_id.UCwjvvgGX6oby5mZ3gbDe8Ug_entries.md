Every year on March 15, Chinaâ€™s central media, CCTV, presents a gala against fraud. It exposes counterfeit and shoddy products and claims to safeguard consumers' rights and interests. It started in 1991. In 1992, relevant government agencies got involved. Since then, what was originally a popular TV show has been turned into a government campaign. After 33 years, this show has left its audience with mixed feelings. On the one hand, what was aired in 2024 still stunned the audience; on the other hand, Chinese people, who are already familiar with all sorts of inside stories of counterfeiting in different industries, have started to speculate about the intention behind this program launched by the top-level media of the Party.
