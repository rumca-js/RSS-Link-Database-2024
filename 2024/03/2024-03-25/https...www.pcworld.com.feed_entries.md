<p>One of the biggest knocks on Windows on Arm PCs powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon chips has been how well applications run. Natively coded apps run just fine, but apps written for traditional X86 processors (read: the vast majority of PCs) have suffered.</p>



<p>In part, that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve had to run via emulation, a way of translating the X86 code into instructions that can be understood by the Arm processor. Qualcomm claims that performance won&rsquo;t be a problem for its upcoming Snapdragon X Elite processors and the PCs they run on. But the company also unveiled a pretty major caveat to that, too.</p>

<p>USB-C is the one connection to rule them all&mdash;literally, in many cases, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341415/europe-sets-deadline-for-usb-c-charging-for-almost-all-laptops.html">thanks to a recent law passed by the European Parliament</a>. Its popularity has made USB-C a common sight on new monitors. A USB-C monitor can act as USB hub, giving you additional ports for connecting various USB devices, but the monitor&rsquo;s USB-C port can also serve as a video-input alternative to HDMI or DisplayPort; and some USB-C monitors can even charge a connected device while in use.</p>



<p>The details of USB-C can be confusing, however, and pricing for USB-C monitors is often higher than that for monitors that lack the interface. See our buyers&rsquo; guide below our recommendations to better understand the nuances.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all made that joke, &ldquo;Searching for this in Google is gonna get me on an FBI watch list.&rdquo; But according to a recent report, that might actually be true if you watched some very specific YouTube videos last year. A United States federal court ordered Google to turn over the identities of tens of thousands of users who watched certain videos in a specific timeframe. </p>



<p>Federal investigators obtained court-approved subpoenas for any YouTube viewers who watched tutorials on mapping via drones and augmented reality software, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2024/03/22/feds-ordered-google-to-unmask-certain-youtube-users-critics-say-its-terrifying/?sh=7f3452291ca7&amp;xcust=2-1-2278729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_bl

<p>Is your computer&rsquo;s CPU too hot?

<p>OLED monitors are the cream of the crop when it comes to gaming, and Samsung makes one of the biggest, widest ones out there. The Odyssey OLED G9 is 49 inches of super-saturated, perfect-black glory, but it doesn&rsquo;t come cheap, with a regular retail price of $1799. But today Amazon is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDQMQQS2?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-2278597-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">offering it at the best price we&rsquo;ve seen yet</a>, just $999.99. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s $200 less than we saw it <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2235006/samsungs-49-inch-oled-ultrawide-monitor-is-600-off-right-now.html">back in February</a>, and in terms of dollars to pixels, it&rsquo;s probably the best deal on <em>any </em>OLED gaming monitor at the moment.

<p>Economists and politicians love to talk about &ldquo;the free market&rdquo; as some kind of capitalist ideal. But when countries start duking it out with policy instead of bombs, trade restrictions are often their first weapon of choice. Responding to heavy chip import restrictions from the US, China has now banned purchases of Intel, AMD, and Microsoft products for use in government computers. </p>



<p>Under the guise of transitioning to &ldquo;safe and reliable&rdquo; hardware and software, the CCP&rsquo;s Information Technology Security Evaluation Center has created a list of companies that government agencies are allowed to purchase from. This list notably excludes the biggest PC chipmakers in the world, Intel and AMD, and the creator of the leading operating system, Microsoft. All three companies are based in the US. </p>

<p>Choosing the best USB-C hub or dongle feels a bit like visiting a salad bar: The sheer variety of products means that you can literally shop for a device that has exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for, and for the best price.</p>



<p>That doesn&rsquo;t always mean a USB-C hub or dongle works as advertised, or that it will satisfy you. To know that requires actual hands-on testing. I consider a USB-C dongle to be a cheaper alternative to either a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/801587/why-new-usb-c-displaylink-docks-are-better-and-worse-than-thunderbolt.html">DisplayLink dock</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">Thunderbolt docking station</a>, which share some testing criteria.
