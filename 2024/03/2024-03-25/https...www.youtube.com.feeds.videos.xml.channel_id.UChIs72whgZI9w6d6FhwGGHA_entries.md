Dragon's Dogma 2 came out to critical reception, with overwhelmingly negative Steam reviews relating to performance, crashes, microtransactions and DLC, and optimization. We're testing the CPU and GPU performance behavior and scaling in Dragon's Dogma 2, looking at how bottlenecks occur and which devices they impact the most. Testing includes CPUs like the 14900K vs. 7800X3D, 14600K, 2600X, 5600X, 12600K, 5800X3D, and more. We also tested on the RTX 4090 with a few spots of the 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4060 (before committing to a CPU comparison instead of GPUs). Testing looks at some of the best CPUs in 2024 for Dragon's Dogma 2 performance in heavy CPU load areas.
