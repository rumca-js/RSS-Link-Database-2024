<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/mandolin-harp-sensor-placement">few
days ago</a> I finished the "user interface" portion of my electronic
harp mandolin.  I'm 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/prototyping-pluck-sensors">happy with
the signals</a> the piezos put out, but now I need to sort out how to
convert them into MIDI.

I take a lot of pictures, maybe 10k annually.  Most of them aren't
that great, but if you take enough you'll get some good ones, and even
the discards can be a useful reference.  How do I handle these?

I have an Android phone, set to automatically upload any pictures to
Google Photos.  My wife does as well, and we have it configured to use
a <a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/7378858">shared
camera roll</a>, which is super useful.  As soon as a photo or video
either of us has taken uploads, the other one can see it as well.

The Photos interface struggles a little with this many photos, but
mostly does a good job.  I like that I can search by text descriptions
or people, and not just scroll back to a certain date, though I wish I
could combine these with some sort of "see in context" option after
finding a picture in a search.

As I take pictures, if I get an especially cute or funny one I'll
share it in our <a hr
