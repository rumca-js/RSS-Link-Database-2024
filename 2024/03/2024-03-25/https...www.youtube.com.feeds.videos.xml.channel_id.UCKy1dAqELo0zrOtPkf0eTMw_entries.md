The Legend of Zelda live-action movie director Wes Ball has big plans for Link's awakening on the big screen. While speaking to Total Film, he spoke about the importance of getting the tone of the Zelda property just right for fans to fully immerse themselves in the world as it unfolds in live-action. The quote reads, "I want to fulfill people's greatest desires. I know it's important, this franchise, to people, and I want it to be a serious movie. A real movie that can give people an escape." He goes on to describe the world he wishes to create as something that’ll feel real to audiences, as well as maintaining that fun and whimsy that’s been established in countless #Zelda games. The Legend of Zelda movie is coming to us from Nintendo, of course, as well as Sony Pictures. Miyamoto-san will be there to produce the film with Jurassic World writer Derek Connolly reportedly handling the script. No word on if the movie will adapt one of Zelda’s numerous storylines or create some

In today's Daily Fix:
To celebrate The Elder Scrolls' 30th Anniversary, Bethesda has given an update on the sixth main game: they're still working on it. Actually there's a little more to it: namely the game is in early stages of playtesting and the devs are actually having a good time playing it. Don't expect any official gameplay footage any time soon, though, as the game still doesn't have a release date. In other news, Capcom is planning a big future patch for Dragon's Dogma 2, which will including performance fixes, an option to start a new game when save data already exists, and more. And finally, rumors abound of Microsoft looking into some kind of Xbox handheld, possibly due to the success of the Steam Deck and other similar PC gaming handhelds. Xbox's Phil Spencer even talked about the features he'd want in a device in an interview with Polygon.

## The Jedi Kinda Suck... From A Certain Point of View

Ever since the first time that we met Obi-Wan Kenobi in George Lucas' stunning 1977 masterpiece Star Wars, the Jedi have been a vibrant and frequent presence in the realm of pop culture heroes. The cosmic religious order has long been seen as one of cinema's greatest “good guys,” but over the decades that shine has dimmed. That shift isn’t necessarily in their representation on screen, but because of the constant rewatches and ensuing conversations about the people within them.

With our first proper look at Leslye Headland's highly-anticipated Star Wars series The Acolyte it looks like the Galaxy Far, Far Away might finally be about to turn a judgmental eye onto the dangers and impact of the Jedi Order in a way that we haven't seen before.

## Millennia Review

Millennia reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC.

"I felt the same way finishing up a game of Millennia as I did finishing a game of Humankind: It made me want to play Civilization 5 again. Several have tried to claim the turn-based history crown at this point, but none have done it better than Firaxis. And while things like city needs, National Spirits, and production chains allow Millennia to stand out, they don't really let it stand up under its own weight. I think Percy Shelly said it best: Round the decay of that colossal wreck, limited game set-up options, horrid late-game performance, and a cumbersome tile economy, the lone and level sands stretch far away."

South Park: Snow Day! reviewed by Travis Northup on PC, also available on Xbox and PlayStation.

We know exactly what a great South Park game can look like, and South Park: Snow Day! couldn’t be farther from it. I’m a huge fan of throwing out the rulebook to try something completely fresh, especially in this age of samey sequels and forever live-service games that increasingly play it safe. But this bold attempt at a new direction misses the mark so drastically I’m aghast at just how sideways things went. Whether it’s due to the thoroughly unenjoyable combat or the uncharacteristically toothless and unfunny story, I can’t recommend anyone waste their time on this cooperative lost cause – even my fellow die-hard South Park fans.

BitCraft has come a long way since that initial announcement. What we played was memorable and – more importantly – fun. But it also has a long way to go. With the amount of ambition the developers are feeding into this game, it still remains to be seen whether BitCraft will fulfil its lofty vision. Previewed by Katie Williams.
