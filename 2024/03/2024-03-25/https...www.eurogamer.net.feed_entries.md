Chief of interest at the moment is the curious Dragonsplague affliction that can be acquired by Pawns - and cause the loss of an entire town in one evening.</p><p>Players believe Dragonsplague can be contracted by Pawns after they fight against a dragon - but the condition can also be passed between Pawns, too.</p><p>If ignored, the consequences can be "devastating", Capcom warns. The official Dragon's Dogma 2 website describes Dragonsplague as a "contagious disease-like condition that infects pawns as they travel between worlds".</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2s-dragonsplague-pawn-affliction-can-wipe-out-an-entire

This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we digest the last seven days of headlines from GDC 2024 - a conference that was unsurprisingly coloured by the past 18 months of industry turmoil. Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell was there, and joins us today to report back on what was being said on the ground. </p><p>From this side of the pond, we saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-boss-blasts-publisher-greed-behind-layoffs">the widespread anger at mass layoffs</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-unveils-generative-ai-neo-npcs-and-the-spirit-of-peter-molyneuxs-milo-lives-on">scepticism surrounding AI</a>.

CD Projekt's patched-up Cyberpunk 2077 will be free to play on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S this weekend - perfect for the Easter bank holiday. 
</p><p>
Cyberpunk 2077 will be available free from this Thursday 28th March at 3pm UK time, until Monday 1st April at 7.59am. </p><p>
No subscription is required to access the free trial, meaning you won't need PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass. But, unfortunately, you will be limited to five hours' worth of game time within the free play window. There's also no word of a similar offer on PC.

## DF Weekly: Is GTA 6 at 60fps really out of the question for PS5 Pro?

So it was last week, when the big takeaway - for many - from our PS5 Pro specs reaction was our contention that Grand Theft Auto 6 on the new machine would likely <em>not</em> run at 60 frames per second. Of course, there are caveats to that particular statement, and we spend some time in DF Direct Weekly #155 discussing it.</p><p>The whole PS5 Pro/GTA 6 discussion began when the mooted release date for the new Sony machine seemed to position it as the most performant hardware on the market for running Rockstar's next generation blockbuster. Assuming PS5 Pro arrives later on this year, it's an entirely logical supposition, beari

## Bethesda discusses "early" The Elder Scrolls 6 work-in-progress build

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-location-everything-we-know-5600">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> exists as a work-in-progress early build, Bethesda has confirmed, in a brief statement which notes the game is now very much "in development".
</p><p>
"Even now, returning to Tamriel and playing early builds has us filled with the same joy, excitement and promise of adventure," the company wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1772261818003497362">message</a> released today to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary.
</p><p>
Word that The Elder Scrolls 6 is on the way is no surprise, of course. Bethesda first confirmed it would make the game six years ago, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-announces-the-elder-scrolls-6">released a CGI teaser trailer back at E3 2018</a>. But it was clear at

## Timemelters review - weird, cold-blooded tactical brilliance

It bends and twists. What you've done with one part of the lace can effect the other parts in unusual ways. You get loops, but also knots and snarls and tangles. Sometimes, you get bows.</p><p>Listen. Just yesterday - yesterday in the real world - I was running up a snowy hill - this part was not in the real world - and I saw a bunch of enemies ahead of me, closing in on a friend of mine who had no defences. If my friend died, it would be bad: game over. I was out of range and out of mana, but I was also close enough to attract my enemies' attention, and they started to run at me. Stumped, my hands left the keyboard: I had pretty much given up. And then I watched, stunned, as someone entirely new raced into frame and briskly zapped all the enemies dead. I blinked. My friend who had no defe

A senior staff member behind the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delays-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-again">continually-delayed</a> Ubisoft shooter XDefiant has denied a report which claimed the game's late launch was due to developers "chasing Call of Duty".

Writing on social media platform X, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin - who previously held the same position at Call of Duty: Modern Warfare studio Infinity Ward - addressed a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-whats-going-on/">Insider Gaming</a> report that claims the game's developers are becoming creatively frustrated by demands they must "copy" features found in Call of Duty.

Apple and other tech giants face another legal fight - this time from the European Commission, which is now investigating the iPhone maker's alleged non-compliance with EU rules.
</p><p>
Apple, Google owner Alphabet and Facebook owner Meta are all being investigated by the EU under the Digital Market Act (DMA), key legislation designed to keep competition fair.
</p><p>
Both Apple and Google will be investigated over their mobile app stores, which the EU previously ordered must allow greater competition on their respective platforms.

PlayStation has released a digital Jim Ryan bobblehead to commemorate the exec's time at the company.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">Back in September</a>, Ryan announced he would be retiring from Sony in March, after nearly 30 years with the company. 
</p><p>
Now, to honour the occasion, Sony has released a bobblehead collectible in the exec's likeness, which can be obtained through PlayStation Stars (the console's loyalty programme where players can earn rewards by completing a variety of campaigns and activities).
