But the game that it probably has more in common with than most others is Ghost of Tsushima. \n\nPromising a historical Japanese setting where melee combat and stealth are front and center across a massive open world, Team Ninja\u2019s newest game attempts to emulate Ghost of Tsushima in a number of ways- but it comes out on top in very few (if any) of those comparisons. From its world design to its storytelling style to its side activities, Rise of the Ronin fails to match the heights of Sucker Punch\u2019s samurai epic in a number of areas.

I would say it is if you have players you want getting into games, especially if they are coming off of the Mario movie, and want to play as Peach on her many adventures.

Burning Shores on the PS5 continued this trend, while making further use of more modern hardware with gorgeous vistas and engaging gameplay. The PC release, however, has set a new benchmark for just how well a port can be developed.\n\nThe PC version of Horizon Forbidden West includes just about every feature you can imagine, including more niche ones like support for ultrawide monitors. For the larger majority of PC gamers, however, the game also features incredible optimization across a wide range of hardware. This means that, as long as your PC has parts made in the last few years, it\u2019ll probably run Horizon Forbidden West incredibly well.", "vote": 0, "artist": null}]
