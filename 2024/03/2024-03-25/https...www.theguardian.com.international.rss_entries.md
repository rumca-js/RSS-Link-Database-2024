Cathy tells Max she feels like it’s been too long since they had sex, and Max responds that it seems to him like they <em>just </em>had sex. They look at a calendar to see who is right, and remember they had sex seven days earlier. Both feel justified: Cathy says, “See, it has been a long time!” Max replies: “I knew it was recently!”</p><p>The author John Updike once wrote: “Sex is like money; only too much is enough.” But in longterm relationships, couples <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550615616462">often disagree</a> about if they’re doing it too much or too little.

We picked one, decided on shoes and that he’d wear his shirt tucked in. As he went to leave I had to catch myself from asking if he was going to put trousers

Last week’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/24/new-islamic-state-videos-back-claim-it-carried-out-moscow-concert-hall-attack">terrorist attack on the Crocus City concert hall</a> near Moscow, which killed 137 people, is one of the bigger crises Putin has faced in his 25-year rule.

<p>A cheesy, mushroomy five-layer lasagne that is both sumptuous and just plain satisfying</p><p><strong><br /></strong>A month ago I bought myself a stainless-steel oven tray. Not only was it the last one in the shop, but it was also the last of a size that was soon to be discontinued. Not that I needed further convincing of my need for this splendid, functional tray. It was only as I carried it home, with the bottom of the carrier bag bumping against my ankles, that it crossed my mind it might not fit in our oven.</p><p>It didn’t. And not by a fraction, either: it was as much as 30cm too long and deep enough for 10 layers of pasta. Even so, it was splendid – and I am dysmetric.

In lockdown our working situations changed, however, so we visited Oxford Animal Sanctuary and met Buddy, a labrador/border collie cross. He was nine and very reactive to other dogs. Knowing he had spent three years in and out of kennels, we couldn’t bear the thought of leaving him in what must have been an incredibly stressful environment.

<p>Strong pro-Israel consensus among political leaders has led to conflict with Berlin’s diverse cultural sector and a fraught debate over antisemitism</p><p>Two weeks after Hamas’s brutal attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, Berlin’s senate for culture commissioned a legal report to establish whether a cultural centre in the German capital’s Neukölln district had violated the city’s antisemitism prevention guidelines and should lose its funding as a result.</p><p>In question were several statements that the cultural centre had posted or shared on its social media channels in response to Israel’s retaliation against Gaza – including phrases such as “apartheid state” and “settler colonialism”. The investigation was also, however, looking at the centre’s plans to host an event one wouldn’t ordinarily suspect of meeting anyone’s definition of antisemitism: a wake hosted by a Jewish organisation to commemorate the victims of 7 October.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/worl

<p>Of all the threats to those suffering, one of the most frightening is that we tire – and their plight becomes background noise</p><p>Cast your mind back to early 2022, more than two years ago now. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was such a shock, such a break with decades of political consensus, that it was treated as an act of aggression that could not for one moment be accepted or made peace with, only urgently rebuffed. Condemnations, lamentations and pledges of support, both for Ukraine’s military effort and its displaced people, all signified the same thing – this was an aberration that would not be allowed to pass.</p><p>But pass it did. Russia has since suffered heavy losses and the war is referred to now as a “quagmire” for Putin, but pass it did.

But by asking Ukrainians to wear cameras on their helmets as they face down relentless Russian attacks, Jamie Roberts’s BBC Two documentary has captured the bloody reality of a conflict increasingly forgotten in the west.</p><p>The director says the intimate and harrowing film, Ukraine, Enemy in the Woods, was conceived as a response to war fatigue. But, if anything, the grim and often unheroic struggle in the frozen forest north-west of Kupyansk emphasises the sheer level of human loss that Ukraine is suffering in defence of its homeland.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/25/film-maker-captures-ukraine-war-soldiers-view">Continue reading...</a>
