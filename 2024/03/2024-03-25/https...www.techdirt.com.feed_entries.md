It&#8217;s a measure to protect the public, [&#8230;]

Look, I&#8217;m nearing 50. I&#8217;ve been around. I have seen some absolute clown shit from politicians. I have witnessed years of things like &#8220;bridges to nowhere&#8221; and self-aggrandizement taking the form of renamed airports or whatever. I have seen any number of candidates step into the arena with a headful of moronic ideas. But things [&#8230;]

Self-described “free speech absolutist” Elon Musk has just had a judge slam him for trying to punish and suppress the speech of critics. Judge Charles Breyer did not hold back in his ruling dismissing Musk’s utterly vexatious SLAPP suit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). Sometimes it is unclear what is driving a [&#8230;]

The Republican Party (or at least its voting bloc) appears willing to give a man who&#8217;s enjoyed nothing but unearned opportunities throughout his professional and governmental career yet another shot in 2024. But he&#8217;s not going [&#8230;]

I know that some people, including Elon Musk recently, have claimed that “trust &#38; safety” is some sort of “euphemism for censorship.” That is not true, and has never been true. The role of trust &#38; safety has always been about building trust in the platform and making sure that users feel safe on the [&#8230;]

The problem is usually that the worst, least competent, shallowest people imaginable routinely fail upward into positions of management, then treat the brands they acquire&#160;like disposable napkins. That’s certainly been the case over at Sports [&#8230;]
