<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis just <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/3/BillText/er/PDF"><ins>signed into law a bill named HB 3</ins></a> that creates much stricter guidelines about how kids under 16 can use and access social media. To that end, the law completely bans children younger than 14 from participating in these platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bill requires parent or guardian consent for 14- and 15-year-olds to make an account or use a pre-existing account on a social media platform. Additionally, the companies behind these platforms must abide by requests to delete these accounts within five business days. Failing to do so could rack up major fines, as much as $10,000 for each violation. These penalties increase to $50,000 per instance if it is ruled that the company participated in a “knowing or reckless” violation of the law.</p>

<p>A judge has dismissed a lawsuit from X against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a nonprofit that researches hate speech on the Elon Musk-owned platform. In the decision, the judge said that the lawsuit was an attempt to “punish” the organization for criticizing the company.</p>

<p>Core to the probe are concerns Google parent Alphabet and Apple have not given sufficiently allowed "app developers to “steer” consumers to offers outside the gatekeepers' app stores, free of charge," according to the European Commission (the European Union's executive arm).

But stay patient, as it’ll take a few weeks for the devices to get to their destinations. The company estimates the first R1 orders will be in customers’ hands “around April 24.”</p>
<p>The Rabbit R1 generated equal amounts of hype and questions regarding next-gen AI hardware and whether it can deliver on the heady demos and press releases. I will say, though, the R1, co-designed by Teenage Engineering, is a pretty piece of tech.</p>

<p>Many <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-beyond-everywhere-greg-ennis-post-hill-press-143010153.html">home Wi-Fi setups</a> suck for countless reasons, which makes it frustrating when everyone in your household needs a reliable connection for the most important things. Be it a work video call, an online class or simply balancing the family budget online, we all need a good home Wi-Fi connection to get things done. If yours isn’t up to pair, maybe it’s because the hardware your ISP gave you isn’t great, or your walls aren’t friendly to wireless signals. Or perhaps the signals from your all-in-one wireless modem and router just can’t reach everywhere from its spot in a far corner of your house.<br /><br />This is where mesh Wi-Fi routers can come in handy. It’s these maladies that mesh systems deal with as a distributed set of smaller Wi-Fi nodes that are spread around your home, pushing internet into every corner. Mesh routers aren’t new, and we’ve reviewed

<p>Much like the ubiquitous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instant-pot-guide-131534709.html">Instant Pot</a> that trended before them, air fryers can be a useful addition to your kitchen. While they excel at making things super crispy without excess oil, many of them are true multicookers with different cooking modes like bake, broil and dehydrate. Regardless of if you get a traditional pod-style air fryer or a larger air fryer toaster oven machine, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to use your new appliance for more than just crisping up chicken or french fries. If you’re still on the fence about buying one, or don’t know where to start looking for the best air fryer for you, we at Engadget can help. We’ve detailed our top picks below, along with buying advice that will help you decide which air fryer model is right for you.</p>

<p>China has introduced guidelines that bar the the use of US processors from AMD and Intel in government computers and servers, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7bf0f79b-dea7-49fa-8253-f678d5acd64a"><em>The Financial Times</em></a> has reported. The new rules also block Microsoft Windows and foreign database products in favor of domestic solutions, marking the latest move in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-09-china-bans-all-government-departments-from-using-us-made-technol.html">long-running</a> tech trade war between the two countries.</p>
