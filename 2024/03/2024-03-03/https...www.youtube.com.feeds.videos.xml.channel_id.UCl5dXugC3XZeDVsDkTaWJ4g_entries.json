Around 1,500,000 Greek Christians living in Turkey were forced to migrate to Greece. The same thing happened with almost 500,000 Muslims living in Greece. Yaqoob is one of the descendants of those Greek people. I shared the story of the India-Pakistan partition with him. Watch how I met Yaqoob while exploring Cappadocia in a different way.  #TravelVlog #mountaintrekker #Turkey \n\nAll videos from this series - https://bit.ly/MTturkey2022\nPrevious Turkey series - http://bit.ly/MTktg2018 \nplaces in this video - Ortahisar, Mustafapa\u015fa, Cemil (Cappadocia, Turkey), @HezenHotel  \n\nIf you like my videos, PLEASE SHARE them and let others get inspired to explore this beautiful world.
