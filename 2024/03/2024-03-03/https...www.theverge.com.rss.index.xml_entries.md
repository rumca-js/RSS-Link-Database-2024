  <p id="wU3prH">The smart fridge is the dream. You’re telling me there’s a gadget in my kitchen that can know all about the food I have in my house, what goes well together, and what I need to cook before it starts to stink up the whole house? A truly smart fridge could help you meal plan, keep your grocery bills down, reduce your food waste, and just make life better. </p>
<p id="1OsntY">But there are dreams and there’s reality. And on this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em>, for the second in our two-part series on the smart kitchen, we’re putting the dream to the test. </p>

  <p id="LwFPqk">Apple has plenty of releases planned for the spring, by the rumor mill’s reckoning, but one thing it may not do is make a big production out of it, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-03/why-was-apple-car-canceled-the-hubris-in-apple-thinking-it-could-outdo-tesla-ltbke5ut?srnd=undefined">according to Mark Gurman</a> in today’s <em>Power On</em> newsletter for <em>Bloomberg</em>. It’s not all that unusual for Apple to skip a spring event — it didn’t have one last year, and it’s skipped it in years past, too.
