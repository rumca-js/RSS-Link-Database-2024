After the World War 1 (1914-1918) and Greece-Turkey war (1919-1922) a large population displacement happened in the 1920s. Around 1,500,000 Greek Christians living in Turkey were forced to migrate to Greece. The same thing happened with almost 500,000 Muslims living in Greece. Yaqoob is one of the descendants of those Greek people. I shared the story of the India-Pakistan partition with him. Watch how I met Yaqoob while exploring Cappadocia in a different way.  #TravelVlog #mountaintrekker #Turkey
