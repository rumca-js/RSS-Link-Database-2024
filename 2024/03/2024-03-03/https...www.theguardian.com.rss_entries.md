But while it wasn’t the colour Jemma Reekie had long wanted, it at least carried a silver lining.</p><p>Afterwards the 25-year-old Scot talked bravely about how physically and mentally broken she had felt last year, due to a debilitating bout of glandular fever and a split from her coach Andy Young. And while she had no answer in the 800m final to the blistering finish of Ethiopian Tsige Duguma, she at least could reflect on how far she had come.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/03/jemma-reekie-wins-silver-in-800m-as-tsige-duguma-shows-her-class">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>The Place, London</strong><br />Humans keep making the same mistakes as five survivors of an apocalyptic event try to build a new civilisation</p><p>How to Build a Universe is a high-concept show.

<ul><li>Hull FC 28-24 London Broncos</li><li>Visitors remain winless after last-minute heartache</li></ul><p>Being 200 miles away from the sport’s traditional heartlands, London Broncos have never been strangers to a unique rugby league situation. But even by their standards this season is completely unprecedented given the reality that, no matter what the Broncos do upon their return to Super League in 2024, they will be asked to quietly collect their belongings and leave later this year.</p><p>With only the top 12 clubs in IMG’s grading system given a seat at the top table in 2025, the fact London were ranked 24th in the provisional rankings at the end of last season – below clubs such as Batley and Doncaster – means they simply won’t improve enough on and, more importantly, off the field in one season to climb into the top 12. Even winning the grand final, unlikely as it would be, wouldn’t be enough to save them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/03/h

Often, they reveal problems that make ministers uncomfortable. But the truths unearthed by Mr Neal about the borders and asylum system are ones they do not want even to hear.</p><p>Mr Neal found out that 10 private jets a week arrived in London City airport last year without occupants undergoing passpor

<p>London Tide at the National Theatre is the latest in a flood of Dickensian adaptations.

The latest adaptation of his work is London Tide, based by Ben Power on Our Mutual Friend – with songs by himself and PJ Harvey – and opening at the National Theatre in April. Given that the novel depicts a London where money is the measure of all things and the Thames is pitifully polluted, it seems a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/12/an-utter-disgrace-90-of-englands-most-precious-river-habitats-blighted-by-raw-sewage-and-farming-pollution">timely venture</a>.</p><p>But, keenly as I await it, I suspect it will raise all the old questions about the problems and pleasures of dramatising Dickens.

<p>At least it was not another abject humiliation. That was the crumb of comfort from the Manchester United point of view. In four of the previous six derbies – and that did not include the FA Cup final at the end of last season, which Manchester City won 2-1 – United had been taken apart in grisly fashion. Their supporters even had the thrill of seeing Marcus Rashford blast them into an early lead with a furious long-range drive.</p><p>It was still another defeat, another occasion when the gap to the top was mapped out in painful detail – as it was always going to be.

<p>Three years of trials have led to permanent concussion substitutes being added next year but not everyone in the game agrees</p><p>From next season the use of permanent concussion substitutes is to be added to the laws of football. The culmination of three years of trials in the men’s game, the decision is a “very important step”, according to Fifa’s general secretary “ad interim” Mattias Grafström, one based “on data and also medical advice”. It’s fair to say not everyone in football agrees.</p><p>For the Premier League, players’ unions PFA and FifPro, and a number of national associations, the decision taken by football’s lawmaking body, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), during its AGM at the weekend was a rebuff.

In the event, a day of driving rain had left McGirr’s disused Chinatown food market bleaker than he perhaps intended, chilled to its raw bones and perilous with puddles. Which might have been a coincidence, or might – a certain witchiness being a strand of the McQueen DNA – have been the spirit of Lee McQueen dialling in from the afterlife with his distinctive dark sense of humour.</p><p>The models scowled, arms wrapped tight around their bodies, hurrying along the catwalk as if they were navig

His unexplained absences on his secret building site made his wife wonder if he was having an affair. When in 1973 the authorities at last discovered Chand’s unauthorised construction, the

<p>From makeup to jewellery, suits to loungewear, we’ve got great tips from fashion’s leading experts</p><p><strong>Can I wear wide-leg trousers even though I’m only 5’2?<br /></strong>Yes, you absolutely can. The look is so chic and I say that confidently because I’m 5ft on the dot and I love a wide-leg pant. The things to think about are the tailoring, the fit and the fabric. As a shorty, you need to get them from the petite section or find a tailor you trust to take them up. The issue with altering them yourself is there’s a certain definition you want with wide-leg trousers and if you’re not a seamstress you won’t get it right. Make sure you take two pairs of shoes with you: the highest shoe you’re going to wear with it and the flattest shoe, so you can strike a happy medium with where the trousers are going to sit. With wide-leg denim, always wear a sturdy platform or wedge. Go for pants that are sold as three-quarter length or cropped for the “average”-height human. Cos

<p>A slowdown in global birthrates is a problem for states such as South Korea, but not for humanity and especially women</p><p>‘It’s funny, but it’s dark, because we know we could be causing our own extinction.” That was the sardonic response of one single 30-year-old South Korean, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68402139">to a BBC reporter</a>, to the data released last week that showed her country has the lowest fertility rate ever recorded. On average, women in South Korea are now having <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/28/south-korea-fertility-rate-2023-fall-record-low-incentives">only 0.72 children</a>. For a country to have a stable population, that number needs to be a little over 2. A little over because not all children reach mid-adulthood, anywhere in the world.</p><p>In South Korea, the fall in babies has occurred despite successive governments spending £226bn over the past 20 years trying to incentivise women to have more childre

<p>Britons have been borrowing less since Covid, but people on lower incomes are falling behind on the rent</p><p>It’s important to worry about the right things. Interest rates are up, sparking worries about our debts – in my case, the mortgage. Consumer debt (credit cards, overdrafts and personal loans) is surging, we’re told. But the truth is, consumer debt levels are down. New <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/in-too-deep/">Resolution Foundation research</a> shows them at their lowest since at least 1999, down from 23% of household disposable incomes in the mid-2000s to 13% today.</p><p>Since the start of the pandemic, there have been two phases. During lockdowns people couldn’t spend, paying down debt to the tune of £26bn between December 2019 and March 2021. More recently, debt has been increasing again but not as fast as incomes. Lenders have been tightening up access to loans, and higher inflation can also help those of us with debts partially

<p>The Swedish photographer was a fixture of Parisian cafe society, capturing intimate moments at all-night hangouts</p><p>The shared secret of after-hours love is one of the hardest things to capture with a camera. The Swedish photographer Christer Strömholm was a master of this kind of unaffected moment. After dramatic war years fighting with the resistance in Norway, he had settled in Paris and become a fixture in its cafe society in the 1950s and 1960s. For several years he spent his nights photographing transgender people in Pigalle for a series of pictures, <em><a href="https://www.lensculture.com/articles/christer-stromholm-les-amies-de-place-blanche">Les Amies de Place Blanche</a></em>.

<p>The mother of the US journalist James Foley, who was held for two years and then executed by Islamic State, tells her story with exemplary compassion and understanding</p><p>In August, 2014, Diane Foley went to church in Rochester, New Hampshire. Her son, Jim, a photojournalist, had then been a hostage of Islamic State in Syria for almost two years. It was late at night, and she was exhausted and alone. The US government, insistent that it would not pay ransoms to terrorists, would do nothing for her family; it was hellish living in fear of the sound of the telephone; the waiting and the wondering could drive a person mad. And so, here she was, clicking her rosary beads, kneeling to repeat her prayers. In that moment, all she wanted was for God to take over. She had decided to surrender her son to His plan, and by doing so, hoped to find some modicum of peace.</p><p>Even for those who believe in Him, God moves in mysterious ways.

<p>Style your brows and you can transform your face</p><p>Eyebrows have the ability to transform a face – define, sculpt or shape, depending on how you style them. At the moment brows are big, bold and fluffy but it’s a tricky trend to pull off if you’ve over-plucked in the past. Permanent brow treatments are always an option. Microshading, microblading, or ombre brows are excellent alternatives for those of us who’d prefer not to do the work. It is an effort, whether you pluck, tweeze or thread, but given what a difference it can make, it’s worth it in the long run.</p><p>Crucially you need to decide what sort of brow suits your features – it’s all in the shape that you choose. Seeking an expert and getting some advice can really help. Lastly, pick products that feel right for you, whether a gel, pencil or powder. Experiment a little, make sure it’s the correct shade, apply it with precision and you’re good to go.<em><strong> </strong></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardi

The phrase isn’t always used in good faith (you find it on the labels of some of the most industrial, additive-ridden rubbish around). But it does represent a genuine shift in emphasis in winemaking over the past couple of decades, analogous to the prioritising of quality ingredients over flashy cheffy skill in the restaurant world. One intriguing side-effect of this change has been the rise to prominence of master-craftspeople in fields once seen as unglamorous drudge work.
