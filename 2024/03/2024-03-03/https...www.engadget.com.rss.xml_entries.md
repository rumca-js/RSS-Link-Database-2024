<p>Apple is expected to have some big releases coming up soon ‚Äî including new iPad Pro and iPad Air models, and the M3 MacBook Air ‚Äî but it‚Äôs reportedly not going to host a big spring launch event for the announcements. In the <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-03/why-was-apple-car-canceled-the-hubris-in-apple-thinking-it-could-outdo-tesla-ltbke5ut?cmpid=BBD030324_POWERON"><em><ins>Power On</ins></em></a> newsletter, Mark Gurman reports that Apple is ‚Äúplanning to announce the new products on its website with a series of online videos and marketing campaigns.‚Äù If so, that‚Äôd be two years in a row that Apple has passed on a spring event, with this year being particularly stacked with new products.</p>

<p>A class action complaint filed against Apple on Friday in the northern California court has accused the company of creating unfair conditions to ensure iCloud remains the dominant cloud storage choice for its devices, according to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/apple-faces-antitrust-class-action-alleging-icloud-monopoly"><em><ins>Bloomberg Law</ins></em></a>. By placing ‚Äúsurgical technological restraints‚Äù on the types of files other cloud providers can host, Apple has made it so only iCloud can offer Apple device users full-service storage, the complaint argues. According to the complaint, this has also allowed Apple to charge higher fees in the absence of ‚Äúany real threat to iCloud‚Äôs dominance.‚Äù</p>
<p>The proposed class, represented by Hagens Berman, would cover tens of millions of customers in the US, <em>Bloomberg Law </em>notes. While iPhone and iPad users do have the option to store certain types of files with non-Apple cl

<p>We're back, having had to say goodbye and part with some great <del>coworkers</del> friends here at Engadget last week. Since then, we've covered everything at note at MWC 2024, including some sci-fi-level concepts from Lenovo that may never make it to stores but can still, well, hold our desensitized tech journalist's attention. Meanwhile, Nintendo is, once again, taking emulators and pirates to task in the courts. But this time could prove crucial for the future of emulators. A reminder: Nintendo's new console is set to launch in 2025.
