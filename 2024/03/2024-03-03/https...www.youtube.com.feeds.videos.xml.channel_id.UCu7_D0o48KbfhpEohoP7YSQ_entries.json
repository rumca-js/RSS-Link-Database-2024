I will provide you with an overview and a comparison of the currently available LoRaWAN gateways, as well as how to select them. Because most gateways use the same chips and should have similar ranges, I will not test it. Still, you will see big differences in capabilities, software, and price.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nComparison chart: https://bit.ly/3P2zLsf\n\nMikrotik:\nKNOT LR9 (915): https://amzn.to/4bYpbw3\nKNOT LR8 (868): https://amzn.to/3wCnJiS\nwAP LR9 (915): https://amzn.to/3uSJfzj\nwAP LR8 (868): https://amzn.to/49wLDeb\n\nLorix L1: https://iot.wifx.net/en/\n\nHeltec:\nHT-7603: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DnS5U2v\nHT-M2802: https://heltec.org/project/ht-m2802/\nHT-M02: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDf904z\n\nSeeed Studio:\nSensecap M2: https://bit.ly/4bYkBhf or https://amzn.to/4c8ELWa\nWM1302 Pi Hat: https://www.seeedstudio.com/WM1302-Pi", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ", "date_published": "2024-03-03T08:00:15+00:00", "language": null, "album": "", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": false, "source_obj__id": 17, "comments": [], "title": "Which LoRaWAN Gateway Is Best For Me (Comparison)?", "age": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ5XDgleQdY", "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "artist": "Andreas Spiess"}]
