<p>Five take aways from the opening weekend including who could possibly challenge the once again dominant Max Verstappen</p><p>Christian Horner has endured a torrid month as team principal of Red Bull after the allegations of inappropriate behaviour made against him by a female employee. On Wednesday in Bahrain he was cleared by the investigation the team’s parent company had instigated. He must have felt as if the worst was over – only for an email to be leaked on Thursday to F1, teams, press, and the FIA that contained images purporting to show messages between Horner and the employee who made the complaint. Their veracity has not been proved but it was enough to reignite the furore and pile pressure on to Horner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/03/f1-bahrain-christian-horner-red-bull-max-verstappen">Continue reading...</a>

Not that you would know it from the life of Jón (Þröstur Leó Gunnarsson). Dour and middle-aged, he lives with his elderly, hectoring mother (Kristbjörg Kjeld) and a dog called Bresnef, days away from the nearest neighbours. But when his mother dies, Jón must fulfil her last wish and drive her corpse across the country. Away from the prison of his home, he starts to question his life. And Mama has plenty to say on the matter (death hasn’t made her any less argumentative). This droll road movie uses the wild landscape to powerful effect, and features the best Icelandic canine acting since <em>Godland</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/03/driving-mum-review-hilmar-oddsson">Continue
