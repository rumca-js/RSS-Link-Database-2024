stunning games of 2023 - but also one of the most demanding for older hardware. Owing to its use of DX12 Ultimate mesh shaders, the game <em>could</em> run on older hardware but often delivered an unplayable experience, especially on Nvidia's GTX 10-series GPUs built on the Pascal architecture. This is an issue because so many of them are still in use: around nine percent of the Steam Hardware Survey's GPUs are 10-series cards. Last week, Remedy approached us with the chance to preview a PC patch going live on March 6th, which radically improves matters for Pascal users. At the same time, it's a golden opportunity for us to revisit Remedy's other work on the game since launch. \n</p><p>\nNvidia's GTX 1060 remains one of the most oldest and popular GPUs still in use, so it's a good i", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "date_published": "2024-03-03T14:56:11+00:00", "language": "en-gb", "album": "", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": false, "source_obj__id": 107, "comments": [], "title": "Upcoming Alan Wake 2 patch drastically improves GTX 10-series performance", "age": null, "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-upcoming-alan-wake-2-patch-drastically-improves-gtx-10-series-performance?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "artist": null}, {"permanent": false, "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/b1_peFJvss.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/b1_peFJvss.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>Arcade Paradise was a charming management/simulation game set in an old laundrette.
