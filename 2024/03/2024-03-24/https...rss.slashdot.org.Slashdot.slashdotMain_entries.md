An anonymous reader shared this report from The Register:

Chinese spies exploited a couple of critical-severity bugs in F5 and ConnectWise equipment earlier this year to sell access to compromised U.S. defense organizations, UK government agencies, and hundreds of other entities, according to Mandiant. 

The Google-owned threat hunters said they assess, "with moderate confidence," that a crew they track as UNC5174 was behind the exploitation of CVE-2023-46747, a 9.8-out-of-10-CVSS-rated remote code execution bug in the F5 BIG-IP Traffic Management User Interface, and CVE-2024-1709, a path traversal flaw in ConnectWise ScreenConnect that scored a perfect 10 out of 10 CVSS severity rating. 

UNC5174 uses the online persona Uteus, and has bragged about its links to China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) &mdash; boasts that may well be true. The gang focuses on gaining initial access into victim organizations and then reselling access to valuable targets... Just last month, Ma

## Steve Wozniak Decries Tracking's Effect on Privacy, Calls Out 'Hypocrisy' of Only Banning TikTok

In an interview Saturday, CNN first asked Steve Wozniak about Apple's "walled garden" approach &mdash; and whether there's any disconnect between Apple's stated interest in user security and privacy, and its own self-interest? 

Wozniak responded, "I think there are things you can say on all sides of it.
"I'm kind of glad for the protection that I have for my privacy and for you know not getting hacked as much. Apple does a better job than the others. 
And tracking you &mdash; tracking you is questionable, but my gosh, look at what we're accusing TikTok of, and then go look at Facebook and Google... That's how they make their business! I mean, Facebook was a great idea. But then they make all their money just by tracking you and advertising. 
And Apple doesn't really do that as much. I consider Apple the good guy. 

So then CNN directly asked Wozniak's opinion about the proposed ban on TikTok in the U.S.
 "Well, one, I don't understand it. I don't see why. I mean, I get a lot

## Ask Slashdot:  DuckDB Queries JSON with SQL.  But Will AI Change Code Syntax?

Long-time Slashdot reader theodp writes: Among the amazing features of the in-process analytical database DuckDB, writes software engineer Paul Gross in DuckDB as the New jq, is that it has many data importers included without requiring extra dependencies. This means it can natively read and parse JSON as a database table, among many other formats. "Once I learned DuckDB could read JSON files directly into memory," Gross explains, "I realized that I could use it for many of the things where I'm currently using jq. In contrast to the complicated and custom jq syntax, I'm very familiar with SQL and use it almost daily." 

The stark difference of the two programming approaches to the same problem &mdash; terse-but-cryptic jq vs. more-straightforward-to-most SQL &mdash; also raises some interesting questions: Will the use of Generative AI coding assistants more firmly entrench the status quo of the existing programming paradigms on whose codebases it's been trained? Or could it h

"Hollywood is bracing for another actors strike, this time against the videogame industry," according to MarketWatch:

"We're currently in bargaining with all the major game studios, and the major sticking point is AI," SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said Thursday. "Actors at all levels are at risk of digital replication. We have strike authorization on that contract and it is, at this point &mdash; we could end up going on strike...." 

The union, which navigated its way to a new film and TV contract after a 118-day strike against the Hollywood studios last year, is again focusing on regulating artificial intelligence and its impact on wages and jobs. "It will be a recurring issue with each successive contract" every three years, Crabtree-Ireland said.
 
Some studios are already using AI-generated voices to save money, the article points out. "Actors and actresses should be very much afraid," Chris Mattmann, an adjunct research professor at the

## 93-Year-Old William Shatner Discusses 'Star Trek', Space, Mortality, and Captain Kirk's Death

"It was three years of my, life you?" a 93-year-old William Shatner tells the Guardian when asked about playing Captain Kirk on the original Star Trek series from 1967 to 1969:

It gladdens him to see how much joy the series has brought its many fans, but the richest rewards came in his introduction to science fiction, which activated and nurtured a lifelong curiosity about our species. He reminisces about meeting the great writers of the genre fondly yet frankly, honest enough to sort Ray Bradbury into "the category right below friend, I think". He devoured their novels and developed a fascination with the principle of defamiliarization, that concepts taken for granted can be understood anew when viewed through the vantage of a stranger in a strange land. "Good science fiction is humanity, moved into a different milieu," he says. 

Even on a grander scale, "The universe charms him with its mysteries," writes the Guardian, calling it "the key to maintaining wonder through nea

## New Book Remembers LAN Parties and the 1990s 'Multiplayer Revolution'

CNN looks back to when "dial-up internet (and its iconic dial tone) was 'still a thing..."

"File-sharing services like Napster and LimeWire were just beginning to take off... And in sweaty dorm rooms and sparse basements across the world, people brought their desktop monitors together to set up a local area network (LAN) and play multiplayer games &mdash; "Half-Life," "Counter-Strike," "Starsiege: Tribes," "StarCraft," "WarCraft" or "Unreal Tournament," to name just a few. These were informal but high-stakes gatherings, then known as LAN parties, whether winning a box of energy drinks or just the joy of emerging victorious. The parties could last several days and nights, with gamers crowded together among heavy computers and fast food boxes, crashing underneath their desks in sleeping bags and taking breaks to pull pranks on each other or watch movies... 


It's this nostalgia that prompted writer and podcaster Merritt K to document the era's gaming culture in her new photob

Indian Express calls it "the ultimate smartphone killer". (Coming soon, its laser-on-your-palm feature will display stock prices, sports scores, and flight statuses.) 

 Humane's Ai Pin can even translate what you say, repeating it out loud in another language (with 50 different languages supported). And it can read you summaries of what's on your favorite web sites, so "You can just surf the web with your voice," according to a new video released this week. 

The video also shows it answering specific questions like "What's that song by 21 Savage with the violin intro?" (And later, while the song is playing, answering more questions like "This was sampled from another song. What song was that?") But then co-founder Imran Chaudhri &mdash; an iPhone designer and one of several former Apple employees at Humane &mdash; demonstrated a "Vision" feature that's coming soon. Holding a Sony Walkman he asks the Pin to "Look at this and tell me when it first came out" &mdash; and the Pi

## It's 25 Years Later.  Are We All Now Trapped in 'The Matrix'?

It was March 24, 1999 that The Matrix premiered, premembers the Wall Street Journal. "To rewatch The Matrix is to be reminded of how primitive our technology was just 25 years ago. We see computers with bulky screens, cellphones with keypads and a once-ubiquitous feature of our society known as 'pay phones,' central to the plot of the film." 

But the article's headline warns that "25 Years Later, We're All Trapped in 'The Matrix'".

[I]n a strange way, the film has become more relevant today than it was in 1999. With the rise of the smartphone and social media, genuine human interaction has dropped precipitously. Today many people, like Cypher, would rather spend their time in the imaginary realms offered by technology than engage in a genuine relationship with other human beings. 

In the film, one of the representatives of the AI, the villainous Agent Smith, played by Hugo Weaving, tells Morpheus that the false reality of the Matrix is set in 1999 because that year was "th
