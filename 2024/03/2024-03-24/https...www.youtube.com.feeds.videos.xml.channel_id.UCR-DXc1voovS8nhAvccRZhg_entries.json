I just love these little books, and so far the original has held up to four kids' rambunctious usage. It's not perfect\u2014it relies on light hitting optical sensors to denote the current page\u2014but it's fun, and the kids mostly love pressing the buttons. As do I! :)\n\nMusic: Panama Hat No Voice by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "tags": [], "bookmarked": false, "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/bOJW5-GyAp0/hqdefault.jpg", "artist": null, "language": null, "vote": 0, "date_published": "2024-03-24T18:38:33+00:00", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg", "album": "", "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "title": "Another baby book for the collection! #shorts", "page_rating_votes": 0, "source_obj__id": 161}]
