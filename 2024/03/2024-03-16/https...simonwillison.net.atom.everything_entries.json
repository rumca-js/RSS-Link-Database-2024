I need to write more about the latter one: it enables populating tables from unstructured content (using a variant of <a href=\"https://til.simonwillison.net/gpt3/openai-python-functions-data-extraction\">this technique</a>) and it's really effective. I got it working just in time for the conference.</p>\n<p>I also solved the conference follow-up problem!
