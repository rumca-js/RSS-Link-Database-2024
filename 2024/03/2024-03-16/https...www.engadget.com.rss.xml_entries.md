<p>A budding startup called Interlune is trying to become the first private company to mine the moon‚Äôs natural resources and sell them back on Earth. Interlune will initially focus on helium-3 ‚Äî a helium isotope created by the sun through the process of fusion ‚Äî which is abundant on the moon. In an interview with <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/03/mining-helium-3-on-the-moon-has-been-talked-about-forever-now-a-company-will-try/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>, Rob Meyerson, one of Interlune‚Äôs founders and former Blue Origin president, said the company hopes to fly its harvester with one of the upcoming commercial moon missions backed by NASA. The plan is to have a pilot plant on the moon by 2028 and begin operations by 2030, Meyerson said.</p>

<p>The biggest story this week was TikTok and the US government going at it again, with the house voting in favor of a bill that could force TikTok's parent company to sell to a US owner or face getting banned outright. Don't worry, though; your elected officials didn't waste the chance to embarrass themselves, as usual. Meanwhile, Mike Tyson comes out of retirement to box for Netflix. He'll face-off against Jake Paul, which I feel is best represented by <a href="https://twitter.com/b1s/status/1765748381501080061">this Punch-Out! tweet</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

I never get consoles the moment they come out and usually wait a few years for their next version.
