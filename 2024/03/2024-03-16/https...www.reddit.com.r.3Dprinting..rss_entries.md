I bought a CR-10 Max and my dad was pissed at first bc I spent almost 1k on a printer, till I found him looking up 10 hour blender tutorials and then I come home and find him printing bells😭 anyways what do you think about his progress so far? My dad has been designing and upgrading the bell every iteration. Blue is original bell design green was 2nd round of designs, red was second last and the white bell is what he’s currently working on. For context the bells will have c9 lights in them like a Christmas string. The top is meant to hold the string and bulb in place.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submit

I'm talking EVERYTHING. Had it disassemble even more so that it came from the factory. And hour and a half later and halfway through putting it all back together the thought dawns on me &quot;oh yea I tighten my extruder spring a couple days ago and still haven't done any real test prints since then&quot; 😑. Literally loosening one screw may have saved me the trouble of all this

Right is the normal size/diameter of the Bowden tube. My clogging issues (clicking/skipping extruder) got progressively worse until I couldn’t seem to do anything to lessen the symptoms. Finally, I removed and disassembled the hotend. This was so melted and so stuck in there, I had to cut the tube and pull ridiculously hard with a pair of pliers to get it out. Right now, as I sit here watching, it has never printed better. If you have the stock ender 3 white Bowden tube, I highly recommend
