Yubico and Hypr are making biometric security keys works across the different protocols that enterprises use, while J.P. Morgan pilots with PopID biometrics for in-person payments may soon come to a successful end. EU Digital Identity Wallets are testing further use cases (with IDnow technology) and interoperability, foreshadowing potential areas for the next round of innovation. In Norway, a new version of BankID for smartphones has launched.\n<h2>Top biometrics news of the week</h2>\nYubico has added <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/yubico-releases-multi-protocol-editi"}]
