Civil War review by Raphael Motamayor at SXSW. In theaters April 12, 2024

Civil War delivers a challenging, thrilling, heart-pounding movie about the importance of journalism in times of conflict, about how easily we become desensitized to violence when we’re living through it. Writer-director Alex Garland gives the story the scope and visual style of a massive summer blockbuster, but keeps the focus on the journey the characters take and how war affects them.
