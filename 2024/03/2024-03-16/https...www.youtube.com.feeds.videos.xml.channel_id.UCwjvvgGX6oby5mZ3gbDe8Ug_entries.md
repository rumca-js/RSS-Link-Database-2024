First, let's look at Zhongnanhai. This complex of buildings belonged to the emperors of the æ˜Ž Ming and Qing dynasties. After 1949, when the CCP took over China, it became the residence and office of the CCP's top echelon. Xinhua Gate is its main gate, and security measures are most strict. There are not only armed police standing guards at the gate but also police and security personnel patrolling back and forth in front of the gate. Many plainclothes officers are stationed on the opposite side and in the surrounding area as well. 
 In addition, only pedestrians are allowed to pass in front of the gate, but they aren't allowed to linger. There is also a yellow cordon in front of the gate that prohibits pedestrians from crossing the line. - 4
