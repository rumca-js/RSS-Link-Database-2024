<p>Being in the late evening of life we learn to reflect, to meditate on things lost and gained, to contemplate a society alien to the one we once knew. But ageing does not mean retreating from the world</p><p>A young male writer turned 60 recently and complained about getting old. Please, I thought<strong>, </strong>I’ve unwound nine-tenths of my mortal coil, don’t tell me about getting old, young whippersnapper.</p><p>One glaring difference in the two decades that stand between us is underlined by the fact a 60-year-old male probably hasn’t experienced ageism yet. A fit man at that age is not far off his social and cultural peak; dress him in a suit and he could be a minister of the crown or a hot-shot CEO. A woman – and in most cases, a man nearing his 80s – is more than likely just the furniture of the street; only her peer group really sees her as an equal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/mar/17/as-i-slide-into-my-ninth-decade-there-are-many-things-

With just 20 days to capture 28 buildings in Slovenia, Austria, Switzerland and Germany, the project involved scaling glaciers in the dark and sleeping in empty chapels. “We would aim to be on top of the mountain for golden hour, when the light is very beautiful,” he says. “Then we’d wait until pitch black at night, when the stars are visible.” The process often involved combining images, but Voss, <a href="https://www.worldphoto.org/sony-world-photography-awards-exhibition">now shortlisted for a Sony world photography award for the series</a>, tried to stay as close to reality as possible. “The reaction I get from people is that it feels like you are really there.”<br /><br /><a href="https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/sony-world-photography-

This, however, was arguably his greatest feat yet, leading Coventry into the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time since the club won the competition in 1987. No wonder some supporters consider his work worthy of a statue. Now they are heading back to the national stadium, after defeating Wolves in a tantalising tie, decided in the 100th minute by a magnificent, unerring finish by Haji Wright.</p><p>Two goals in the final seven minutes of normal time turned this game on its head, Wolves heading into at least minutes of stoppage time in front courtesy of strikes from Rayan Aït-Nouri and Hugo Bueno.

<p>The teenage Mancunian is one of British rap’s finest prospects, with a defiant flow and sly humour that’s won him nods from Drake and more</p><p>You could make a case for British rap being more compelling than its American cousin of late; it’s in its rapid expansion phase, not caught in a holding pattern. Partly that’s because there are now so many talented UK artists with non-London accents that it could soon be a disadvantage to spit from England’s capital. Teenage Mancunian Nemzzz is one of our most exciting prospects.</p><p>Growing up in Gorton in a house with a kitted-out studio, he was destined for the stage. “My mum made beats – all genres, you can’t box her in! And Dad sang reggae and bashment. I thought, let me give this a try,” the 19-year-old, real name Nemiah Simms, recalls. Six years ago he was ripping beats off YouTube to practise over, obsessively improving his vocal technique and lyrical dexterity. By 2021 he was working with professional beatmakers and sco

<p>What are the chances of real romance via a ‘missed connection’? And has the internet turned these interactions from the stuff of romcoms to just a bit creepy?</p><p>In the beginning, Darcy had a boyfriend and an aisle seat. It was 29 March 2000, and she was the last person to board the plane from Atlanta, Georgia, to Sacramento in California. Hot, sweaty and tired from running to catch the flight, she was frustrated to see that someone else was in her seat. “I’m sorry,” the stranger said, “do you mind switching with me?” The thing was, he explained, his wife was afraid of flying – he wanted to sit by her. Darcy McGaffic is 6ft tall – there’s a reason she had booked to sit in the aisle of the exit row. The stranger gestured to his seat, right at the back of the plane. A middle seat. Darcy said: “Fine.” She laughed, made her way back, sat down, and then another stranger opened their mouth. “<em>I</em> wouldn’t have done that,” the man next to her smiled.</p><p>That man was S

<p>Sidharth Malhotra fights like a machine in an Indian action film cut from similar cloth as the jingoistic Rambo series</p><p>Depending on your age and perspective, you may or may not have fond memories of the three Rambo films. Where the first one was rather circumspect about America’s role in Vietnam, the sequels went all in on a might-is-right jingoism that combined adrenaline-infused action, rippling muscles and improbable set pieces with deeply queasy politics. New Hindi action-movie Yodha is cut from similar cloth.</p><p>We’re introduced to our hero, Arun (Sidharth Malhotra) as a young boy who worships his soldier father, who is then promptly killed leaving some big Freudian boots to fill. Arun vows he will either live to be worthy of wearing the uniform of his dad’s badass task force, the “Yodha” of the title, or else his “corpse will be wrapped in our flag”. Many bone-crunching displays of patriotism follow over the subsequent two hours. These are facilitated by Aru

<p>A mother’s unflinching account of finding meaning in her son’s unexpected death </p><p>One day, Liz Jensen’s son, Raphaël, meets death in the garden.

She made the 10-hour drive from Kennesaw, Georgia, to Washington on 5 January 2021. The next day, the 34-year-old died after losing consciousness in the crush of a mob of Donald Trump supporters as it surged against US Capitol police.

<p>Simon Bramhall was a high-flying transplant specialist who risked it all – and lost his career. Why did he do it?</p><p>On the morning of 21 August 2013, a patient with acute liver failure was on the urgent transplant list at Queen Elizabeth hospital, Birmingham (QEHB). If a donor couldn’t be found within 72 hours, she would die. But she got lucky. By 7pm the woman – later known in court as Patient A – was anaesthetised and unconscious on the operating table, with a healthy, deep-red donor liver glistening on ice for her nearby.</p><p>QEHB had one of the UK’s leading liver units, and Simon Bramhall, the hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) surgeon on call that evening, was one of only about two dozen in the country at the time who specialised in liver transplants. At 49 years old, Bramhall had already performed the operation nearly 400 times. On any given day, there would be at least 10 trainees from around the world working with him, learning from his experience. In a centre of
