The #1 New York Times bestselling and award-winning author initially caught the attention of the book community with her Arabia-inspired Sands of Arawiya duology. A Tempest of Tea, whilst set in the same universe as Faizal\u2019s well-loved duology, follows Arthie Casimir across the world from Arawiya in Ettenia, Faizal\u2019s fictional rendition of England. Arthie and her adoptive brother Jin run a notorious tearoom known as Spindrift, which transforms into an illegal blood-house for vampires at night. Whilst vampires roam free in society, they are very much ostracized and Spindrift allows the feared beings some reprieve and privacy. When their much-beloved establishment is threatened by a governmental force known as The Ram, Arthie and Jin must orchestrate a seemingly impossible heist in the heart of a vampire stronghold in order to gain leverage against the impending threat.
