		Partnerships making biometrics work across protocols and expanding pilot projects are common elements across many of the most-read articles on <em>Biometric Update</em> this week. Yubico and Hypr are making biometric security keys works across the different protocols that enterprises use, while J.P. Morgan pilots with PopID biometrics for in-person payments may soon come to a successful end. EU Digital Identity Wallets are testing further use cases (with IDnow technology) and interoperability, foreshadowing potential areas for the next round of innovation. In Norway, a new version of BankID for smartphones has launched.
