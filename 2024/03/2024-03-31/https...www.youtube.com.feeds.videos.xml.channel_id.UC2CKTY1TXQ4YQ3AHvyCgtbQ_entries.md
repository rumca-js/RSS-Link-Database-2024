A new edition of Age of Sigmar was announced at AdeptiCon this year - and most interesting to me: the new "Spearhead" format. We'll discuss that, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
