Since the release of the original game back in 1996 the Tomb Raider franchise has expanded into 3 different timelines across 12 games, 6 spin-offs, and near-on a library of books and comics. To date, the iconic adventure franchise has rebooted itself 3 times, and current developer Crystal Dynamics has even stated that future games will look to unify the timelines… somehow. And with a new animated series launching soon and the promise of another mainline game, there’s no better time to dive into the lore of Tomb Raider than now.

This is the complete Tomb Raider timeline fully explained.
