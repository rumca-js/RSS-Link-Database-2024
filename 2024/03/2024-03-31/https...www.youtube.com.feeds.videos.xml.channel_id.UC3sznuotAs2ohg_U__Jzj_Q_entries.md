Hey, loyal Theorists, did you see Dune or Dune: Part 2? We here at Theorist absolutely LOVED it. In fact, we’re all on board to support the Lisan al Gaib. But while watching the movie, we had one major question. No, it wasn’t how on Arrakis all of those Fremen got on and off the sand worms. It was about if the stillsuits would _actually_ work in real life. Could Paul, Chani, and Stilgar survive those brutal deserts? Could they actually get water? Or would they become so disgustingly STINKY from their own b-o? Grab your Crysknife and let’s find out!
