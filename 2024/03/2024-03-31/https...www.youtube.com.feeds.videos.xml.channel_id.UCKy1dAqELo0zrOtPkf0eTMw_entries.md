In 1983 Apple would release one of their most infamous failures, the Apple Lisa. Named after Steve Job's daughter, the Lisa was an all-in-one desktop PC that set out to change the computing landscape forever. Unfortunatley, due to its exorbitant price tag and slow performance, the Lisa was quickly replaced a year later with the Apple Macintosh. 

Join us on this episode of This Old Tech as Seth attempts to restore and repair an Apple Lisa he recovered from a landfill. From replacing the hard drive with an emulator, to restoring and repairing a 40-year-old keyboard full of rotted foam, and even attempting to access the internet. Seth has his hands full with this one!
