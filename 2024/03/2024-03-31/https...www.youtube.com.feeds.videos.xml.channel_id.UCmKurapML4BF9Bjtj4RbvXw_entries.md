As we welcome the dawn of Easter, listen to "O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown," a stirring cello chorale arranged by our very own Steven Sharp Nelson. This piece holds a special place in our hearts, as it encapsulates the profound journey of reflection and renewal that Easter embodies. This classic hymn captures the deep reverence and boundless love that the Saviorâ€™s sacrifice represents to us. The universal message of hope, resurrection, and the triumph of light over darkness resonates deeply with us. May this rendition touch your heart and uplift your spirit, as we come together to celebrate the eternal promise of Easter.

Wishing you and your loved ones a blessed Easter filled with peace and joy.
