<p>Candidates: HANG IN THERE. For those who are unemployed and have been for months, I suggest we create a separate post or move to a subreddit where we can do interviewing, resume and application reviews?<p>From my network of avid HN readers I get the sense that there are some bad actors in "Who is hiring". Candidates are desparate right now, there are some who are unemployed and have been for months, and some bad actors are taking advantange of and abusing their desperation.<p>Two companies that have been prolific on "Ask HN: Who is hiring?", posting every month for the last year have stood out where they are taking every candidate through the whole interview process as an exercise to train their current staff on interviewing with no actual intention of hiring candidates. Another company in particular are very thorough in their process requiring prerecorded video presentation of what the candidate has designed in the past, slides, two take homes and a "pair programming" exercise tha

<p>I was on the eternal quest of searching for a <i>properly gamified</i> productivity app that keeps me motivated throughout the day and in the long term.<p>After a few months of a fruitless search, I made up my mind and decided to build it myself! I've since launched FocuMon a little over a month ago. Quite a few early users told me it has helped them stay focused, so I'm excited to share it on HN for ya'll to try it out and let me know how I can make it better!<p>FocuMon is like an idle Pokémon game where you can collect, level up, and evolve cute monsters by being productive! It puts a reward layer on top of your work which helps to give you an initial boost to get into focus; it then gets out of your way once you are in the flow :)<p>I'm actively developing more features & game modes for FocuMon. It is also a multiplayer-first app where you can adventure together with people from all over the world!<p>Cheers and thanks for your time!

## Ask HN: Is anybody getting value from AI Agents? How so?

<p>I saw a lot of initial buzz about the promise of agent based workflows and it seemed to be the obvious way to get LLMs to the edge of decision making and leverage many specialized models. It seems the chatter has died down but there are growing projects out there in the space. Before I invest the time to explore and work with tools I’d love some feedback from the community and if and how they are being used.</p>

<p>I'm unable to access reddit via browser when using VPN. I see an error message both on regular 'reddit.com', as well as 'old.reddit.com' subdomain.<p>This is new develompent. They started blocking VPN access on their regular website three months ago[1], but back then 'old' subdomain still worked; today it no longer does.<p>I'm testing with desktop Safari and NordVPN from EU; curious if others are seeing similar results.<p>[1]: I posted about it here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38666028</p>

<p>I've been avidly reading all I can about it. I understand how it came about, and my sympathy is firmly with the maintainer. I know research is on going as I type this, but is anyone with the expertise I don't have able to explain in simple terms how bad it is, or could have been?</p>

## Show HN: Truncate, a word-based strategy game

<p>Truncate is a chess flavoured word game that blends spatial reasoning and wordplay. In puzzle mode, you beat back your NPC opponent's words and take over their territory.<p>Truncate started as a pen and paper game between a friend and I, evolved into a handmade board game, and finally arrived at an online puzzle game. Like any good word game, there is of course a daily mode, shareable with the tried and true grid of emojis<p>We've been playtesting it with friends and family for a few months, which has helped iron out the tutorials and gameplay, and we're finally happy with an MVP worth sharing!<p>Technical deets: The client and server are written in Rust, with the visuals built using egui (as an experiment in Rust's GUI ecosystem).<p>We'd love any feedback!</p>
