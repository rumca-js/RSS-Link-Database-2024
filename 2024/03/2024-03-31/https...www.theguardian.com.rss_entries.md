<p>Paul Nolan’s runner makes plenty of appeal at big odds in the undoubted highlight of Easter weekend’s racing card</p><p>Tracks from Plumpton to Redcar and at several points in between will be hoping to see Bank Holiday racegoers ­pouring through the turnstiles on Monday, but the undoubted highlight of the Easter weekend is the Irish Grand National at Fairy­house – the most valuable race of the jumps season in the country that is, for the moment at least, the dominant force in National Hunt racing.</p><p>It is unusual for a big race to be attached to a moveable feast, with a slot in the calendar that could be anywhere from the last week of March to late April.

<p>Steven Knight’s six-parter about the formation of an 80s new wave band is intelligent, ambitious and anarchic. But be warned: it can feel oppressive at first</p><p>I don’t know about you, but whenever I hear about a film or drama series about a band getting together, the spirit quails within. I prepare for “Let’s put the show on right here!” vibes and the equivalent of poor Billy Zane’s line in Titanic – “Something Picasso?

It’s about the formation of an 80s new wave band, influenced by the preceding popularity of ska, reggae, two tone and punk, with the tracks the characters write created by record producer and songwriter Dan Carey and poet Kae Tempest. I am exhausted before it even starts.</p><p>Which just goes to show how very stupid one sho

<p>New York Times columnist Carlos Lozada examines the speeches, writing and linguistic tics of presidents and members of Congress to expose ‘inveterate deceivers’</p><p>Politicians mince or mash words for a living, and the virtuosity with which they twist meanings makes them artists of a kind. Their skill at spinning facts counts as a fictional exercise: in political jargon, a “narrative” is a storyline that warps truth for partisan purposes. Carlos Lozada, formerly a reviewer for the<em> </em><em>Washington Post</em> and now a columnist at the<em> </em><em>New York Times</em>, specialises in picking apart these professional falsehoods. Analysing windy orations, ghostwritten memoirs and faceless committee reports, the essays in his book expose American presidents, members of Congress and supreme court justices as unreliable narrators, inveterate deceivers who betray themselves in careless verbal slips.</p><p>Lozada has a literary critic’s sharp eye, and an alertly cocked ear to go wi

Bored with TV test images, they turned to the centrefold, defending its choice by noting that it featured a face and a mixture of light and dark colours.

But its power has never been revealed publicly, in part because of the “cautious and informed” approach that OpenAI is taking to release it more widely.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/31/openai-deems-its-voice-cloning-tool-too-risky-for-general-release">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Social housing tenants are suffering just as much as those in the private rented sector, writes <strong>Suzanne Muna</strong>.

The Social Housing Action Campaign’s perspective is that we are no longer in a housing crisis. It is system collapse. Tenants and residents in social housing are suffering just as those in the private rented sector. Last year, the vast majority of housing associations utilised the maximum scope allowed by government and increased their rents by 7%. These inflated rents will rise again this year by 7.7%.</p><p>Shared owners fare e

<p>A man swaps his comfortable existence for an affair in Thomson’s lyrical study of a midlife crisis</p><p>In Jean-Paul Sartre’s first novel, <em>Nausea</em>, the protagonist, Roquentin, suffers a strange “sweet sickness” that is the physical manifestation of a deep existential malaise. Phillip Notman, the hero of Rupert Thomson’s <em>How to Make a Bomb</em><em>,</em> is, like Roquentin, an academic researching a biography of an obscure historical figure. Like Roquentin, he is struck by a sudden and paralysing nausea, one that threatens to capsize his apparently ordered existence. Like Roquentin, he seeks solace in a woman’s love. Thomson’s 14 novels are overwhelmingly disparate, sharing only a profound regard for style, an engagement with the European avant garde tradition, and an interest in the secret and occluded corners of life.</p><p>It is at a conference in Norway that Notman suffers his first bout of illness.

<p><strong>Menier Chocolate Factory, London<br /></strong>Paul Grellong’s gripping dialogue makes a brisk plot and unlikable characters immensely watchable as a Harvard professor invites a white supremacist for a debate</p><p>‘I’m one of the good guys,” insists a beleaguered Harvard professor facing student protests after inviting a white supremacist to be part of a university debate on extremism. The defence, for Charles Nichols (Julian Ovenden), is that illogical or offensive arguments need to be heard in order to be dismantled, though hand-wringing principal Amy Katz (Tanya Franks) suggests he is doing this as an attention-grabbing career move.</p><p>Paul Grellong’s intelligent if schematic play incorporates themes of cancel culture, Nazi legacies and the intersection between freedom of expression and hate speech.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/mar/31/power-of-sail-review-menier-chocolate-factory-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a young Liberian woman in survival mode, Cynthia Erivo carries Anthony Chen’s unassuming drama</p><p>Understated, but with a mesmerising, shell-shocked stillness, British actor Cynthia Erivo’s arresting central performance gives this earnest drama by Singaporean director Anthony Chen (<em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/04/ilo-ilo-review-award-winning-drama-singapore">Ilo Ilo</a></em>, <em>Wet Season</em>) its emotional heft. She plays Jacqueline, a traumatised refugee from war-torn Liberia who has recently arrived on a Greek island. The jagged, rocky terrain of her new home evokes her fractured mental state. But even in survival mode, subsisting on scavenged leftovers and small change, Jacqueline is too proud to beg. That same dignity prompts her to invent a story – a husband and a hotel room – when she strikes up a friendship with an empathic American tour guide, Callie (Alia Shawkat).

Stripping away the connotations of the standard England flag, both positive and negative, and comparing it with the Nike one with complete aesthetic objectivity – and I’m convinced I’m capable of that and you’ll get an earful if you tell me otherwise so don’t bother – the Nike one clearly looks more pleasant.</p><p>Nevertheless I was surprised to hear from Keir Starmer that it was being lin

<p>Public satisfaction with the health service is at an all-time low, so now might be time to reconsider what we expect from it</p><p>In the NHS’s long lifetime, people have consistently made the same two assumptions. The first&nbsp;is that the health service could at any minute cease&nbsp;to exist. The second is that the NHS is so important in Brits’ view of their country and wellbeing that it wins, or loses, elections.</p><p>Even when the health service was being set up, its founder Nye Bevan was asking the medical profession to see it as an experiment and give it a go. Within a decade, there were gloomy sounding BBC documentaries marking 10&nbsp;years of the NHS, asking how much longer it would last. There had already been standoffs within government over how much money it was sucking from other public services. And in so many of the ensuing elections, the Labour party has assumed it will win on the NHS, while the Tories have feared they will lose.</p> <a href="https://www.theguard

But we now have an opportunity to turn things around – by reimagining the UK as a ‘we’ society rather than an ‘I’ society</p><p>If there is any consensus in our otherwise fractured, toxic national debate it is that we cannot go on like this. Our economy is in crisis, exemplified by an annual £100bn shortfall in public and private investment, which must be lifted decisively for Britain to break out of today’s triple whammy of stagnant growth, productivity and living standards. Society reels from alarming gaps in the provision of crucial public services and the yawning unfairness in the distribution of income, wealth and opportunity. Our democracy and state seem incapable of acknowledging the full extent of these deformities, let alone adequately responding to them. Our international standing has plummeted at a time of geopolitical peril. A transformative respo

<p>James Rokop’s photography reveals the extreme athleticism of a sport that has struggled for recognition</p><p>In 2017, the Olympic event that had long been known as synchronised swimming had an imposed rebrand, when the international governing body of aquatic sport decided it should now be called “artistic swimming”. The name change generated uproar. Kris Harley-Jesson, who had coached national teams in Europe and North America, launched a petition that quickly collected more than 11,000 signatories from 88 countries. One swimmer, Jessica Lewis, expressed the outrage of many: “Artistic swimming sounds like something society ladies did with their bosom friends at garden parties or after tea in the early 20th century. Synchronised swimming is a REAL sport for REAL athletes.”</p><p>Despite the protests, the name persists. National federations that held out against the change have mostly fallen into line. Still, in advance of this summer’s Paris games, there is a feeling in the sport t

He believed his body was made entirely of glass. A relatively new material, both fragile and transparent, glass captures the hypochondriac’s acutest fear – brittle vulnerability – with their greatest desire: visceral omniscience. This human longing to peer inside our “meaty vessel” was answered in the 20th century by medical technologies, including blood testing, microscopy and imaging, which became widely available. Rather than soothe the hypochondriacal itch, however, this intimate access – along with Google’s democratisation of medical knowledge – has fuelled health anxiety to new heights.</p><p>Caroline Crampton describes herself as a hypochondriac, but one with impostor syndrome because she pr
