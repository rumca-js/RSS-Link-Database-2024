<p>Conversations about menopause have matured but the question of when and how to treat perimenopausal symptoms remains confusing – even to a science journalist</p><p>There’s a meme featuring a confident, suave, smiling Henry Cavill – the actor best known for playing Superman – posing for photographers on the red carpet. <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/jason-momoa-sneaks-up-on-henry-cavill">Sneaking up behind him</a> is wild-looking, maniacally gleeful co-star Jason Momoa.</p><p>To me, this is the perfect metaphor for perimenopause. Cavill is at the peak of his career, he looks great, clearly feels great, exudes confidence, strength and self-possession.

A roaring wall of red erupted behind the goal and players and staff on the bench spilled down the sideline as Arsenal scored late into extra time to retain their Continental League Cup title with a 1-0 win against Chelsea.

The stadium of a record 21,462 fans for the final held its breath for the almost 10 minutes during which she was being treated.

From the highly strung <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002136/">Bernard Herrmann</a>-alike score to the coiffed spiral of Alice’s platinum blond hair, to the fact that the film opens with a curtain-twitching character spying through a rear window, <em>Mothers’ Instinct</em> (a remake of the 2018 Belgian film <em>Duelle</em>) goes beyond Hitch-homage and veers into parody. But the film’s fawning admiration for the work of the Master of Suspense only serves to highlight how heavy-handed the plotting is by comparison.</p><p>It’s a pity that the scree

<p>These queens know what it is like to be abused for being who they are – their joyful self-acceptance is a tonic for our times</p><p>In the northern market town where I grew up, winter took a long time to pass into spring, and even then something about the sky made me feel hemmed in. I used to call it the armpit of Lancashire. It wasn’t quite George Orwell’s The Road to Wigan Pier, but when I looked in the mirror when I was young, what I saw “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/24/road-wigan-pier-george-orwell-100-best-nonfiction-books">wore … the most desolate, hopeless expression I have ever seen</a>”. I was a broken weirdo longing for a mask. I thought if I could become a different person, everything would be fixed and I’d finally fit in. How wrong could I have been? As RuPaul’s Drag Race makes clear, it’s the inner weirdo who fixes you.</p><p>This weekend, while I was painting an egg for Easter Sunday, the queens were painting their faces on TV.

<p>Do you shout your achievements from the rooftops, or ‘move in silence’ while waiting for the perfect moment to flex online? If only we could all sit this one out</p><p>I have belatedly discovered the phrase “move in silence”. Apparently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/lil-wayne">Lil Wayne</a> instructed people to do it in 2011 with the line: “Real Gs move in silence like lasagne,” a lyric that prompted various polemics (is the G in lasagne <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/lil-wayne-lasagna-line-in-67-causes-controversy-thoughts-949210/">actually silent</a>?). Even then, a music commentator told Billboard it was “such an old concept”. It hadn’t broken through in the south side of Brussels, where I was living then (despite lasagne, happily, being plentiful).</p><p>I was finally alerted to “moving in silence” by an Instagram post. The phrase grabbed me, since I am a cheerleader for silence. My take is: the more people move in silence, the better, especia

<p>An warehouse space in the Italian city has been cleverly transformed with original features and a mix of styles</p><p>Milan isn’t a city short of personality, but it is short on homes with personality that haven’t already been developed into brand-new boltholes or snapped up by the cool crowd. Luckily for Elisa Vassalli, the area of Isola, northwest of the centre, still has a few secret spaces up its sleeve, which is how she ended up finding her former textiles factory home.</p><p>“We saw a lot of apartments, but this one was really different to everything else,” says the interior designer, who shares the space with her carpenter and set designer husband, Davide. The factory was built in the 1930s and they are the first couple to make it their home. “We loved that it hadn’t been touched, because we wanted to have a space with a story. It was very important for us because we love the memories of a space and respecting it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/m

Beneath that, women who had previously not known each other were now commenting. “So sorry he did this to you, too,” one woman wrote.“Took $5,000 from me. Lived with me for a year while he impregnated me and stole from other women. He’s a piece of garbage and I bet you’re wonderful.

<p>For a new generation of fans and musicians, the 90s grunge band – and in particular their frontman Kurt Cobain, who died 30 years ago next month – have provided not only inspiration but a blueprint for a more inclusive style of rock stardom</p><p>Five years ago, when the alternative artist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/27/one-to-watch-ekkstacy">Ekkstacy</a> was 16, he stole two T-shirts from a record shop in a mall by his childhood house in Vancouver. They were both merch for Seattle bands: one was a Nirvana shirt, the other was an Alice in Chains shirt. “I was like, I’m not wearing this unless I know what this is,” he remembers. After listening to the artists, one of the shirts got a lot of use; the other was an Alice in Chains shirt.</p><p>Next month it will have been 30 years since frontman Kurt Cobain’s death in April 1994. Over these decades, there has been a natural and constant flow of artists name-checking Nirvana in interviews – Lorde and Lil Nas X co

<p>The new biopic of the London singer has puts the London borough’s rich musical past in the spotlight. But what of its future?</p><p>Of all the ­musicians who have lived, worked or performed there, none has a stronger connection with Camden Town than Amy Winehouse. But the release of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/11/back-to-black-first-trailer-for-amy-winehouse-biopic-from-sam-taylor-johnson-released">the Winehouse biopic, </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/11/back-to-black-first-trailer-for-amy-winehouse-biopic-from-sam-taylor-johnson-released">Back to Black</a></em>,<em> </em>is a useful reminder of both the ­fragility of cultural moments and how Camden has been robust enough to survive a series of them, remaining a desirable location for musicians and fans through several generations, going all the way back to the ­opening of the Roundhouse as a concert venue in 1966.</p><p>Usually, the moment a London borough announces itself as fashi

<p>The author’s new book posits an all-too-possible catastrophe, destruction assured by human frailty as much as by technology</p><p>Annie Jacobsen was a high school student in 1983, when ABC television broadcast the film The Day After, about the horrors of nuclear war. She never forgot the experience. More than 100 million Americans watched and were terrified too. One of them lived in the White House. According to his biographer and his own memoirs, it helped turn Ronald Reagan into a nuclear disarmer in his second term.</p><p>Not long after, the world’s stockpile of nuclear warheads peaked and began to decline rapidly, from 70,000 to just over 12,000 currently, according to the <a href="https://fas.org/initiative/status-world-nuclear-forces/">Federation of American Scientists</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/31/annie-jacobsen-nuclear-war-scenario">Continue reading...</a>

<p>But rather less so when the jokes are at your own expense</p><p>‘We can turn Mummy into a dog!’ says my son. I look at him quizzically and say that might not be possible. ‘An ant, then?’ he offers, by way of compromise. Those are both excellent pranks, I tell him, but quite far outside the remit of April Fools’ Day. It’s the first he’s ever heard of the holiday and enthusiasm is getting the better of him. While I attempt to manage his expectations, he leaps around the room, drunk on the prospect of adult-sanctioned silliness.</p><p>He is, after all, a budding comedian. I recently made the mistake of introducing him to the ‘what do you get if you cross x and y’ format, specifically the classic sheep/kangaroo ‘woolly jumper’ crossbreed. He has spent every day since attempting his own, with decidedly mixed results. Sample: what do you get if you cross a lion, a goat and a snake? A Liongoatsnake! The thousand or so variants he’s come up with since have not been particularly hilarious,

Suffering his first defeat in 25 fights, Tszyu surrendered his WBO super welterweight belt and the vacant WBC strap at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, missing his chance to take his place among the sport’s elite.</p><p>Tszyu lost the fight in a split decision, with the judges scoring the fight 116 -112, 115-113, 112-116 in favour of Fundora. The unlucky Australian’s fight derailed at the end of the second round when he walked into the elbow of 197cm Fundora, opening up a huge gash on his head. But he was gracious in defeat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/31/boxing-tim-tszyu-sebastian-fundora-las-vegas-b
