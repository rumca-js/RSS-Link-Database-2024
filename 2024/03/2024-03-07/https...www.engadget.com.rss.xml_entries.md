<p>The little console that could, Playdate, <a href="https://play.date/games/?utm_campaign=CatalogAnniversarySale&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=catalog-elist&amp;?utm_campaign=CatalogSale&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=catalog-elist">is having its first sitewide games sale,</a> just like its more-established rivals. Manufacturer Panic is holding the sale to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the online store, which is officially called the Playdate Catalog.</p>
<p>The discounts are noteworthy. If you happen to own a Playdate, you’ll find plenty to like here. The cute little synthesizer app <em>Playmaker</em> is on sale for $8, instead of $15, and the action RPG <em>Under the Castle</em> is on sale for $7, which is a discount of 30 percent. Many titles go much lower than this. The bizarre unicycle/coffee-acquisition sim <em>A Balanced Brew</em> is on sale for just $2 and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2004-12-28-young-kids-old-games-hilarity-ensues.html"><

The app has been alerting its millions of US users about the measure, which would force ByteDance to sell TikTok in order for the app to remain available in US app stores.</p>
<p>“TikTok is at risk of being shut down in the US,” the push <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@sineadbovell/post/C4N80ypMh9x">notification</a> says. “Call your representative now.” An in-app message then instructs users to “speak up now — before your government strips 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression.” It also provides users a shortcut to dial their representative’s office if they enter their zip code.</p>

Despite his 9-1 record, Paul can hardly be described as an elite fighter. While Tyson is regarded as one of the best heavyweights of all time, he retired 19 years ago and ha

That continues with the launch of the SL3, a 60-megapixel (MP) model that looks nothing like its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/leica-m11-rangefinder-digital-camera-price-specs-release-date-140032032.html">famous rangefinder cameras</a>, offering a new phase-detect autofocus system, 8K video capability and more.</p>
<p>The new model has the same sensor as the M11 rangefinder and Q3 compact models, but very much resembles the SL2 and tips the scale at a hefty 767 grams. It's also IP54-rated so you can shoot in weather conditions ranging from 14 to 104°F without worrying about dust, moisture etc.&nbsp;</p>

CEO Daniel Ek wrote an <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-03-07/spotify-to-adjust-its-prices-over-new-tax-in-france/">open letter</a> denouncing the tax, which France’s government passed in late 2023.

<p>Sony is so closely associated with full-frame mirrorless cameras that it’s easy to forget it also sells the A6000 APS-C lineup — particularly since the last one,<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-sony-a6600-review-misstep.html"> the A6600</a>, came out five long years ago in 2019.

<p>It’s the same price the A6600 was at launch four years ago, but addresses its predecessor’s main flaws by boosting resolution a bit and reducing rolling shutter. At the same time, it’s been likened to a mini-FX30 cinema camera as it has the same sensor and video capabilities.</p>

<p>It's hard to expect much from Apple's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-announces-new-macbook-airs-with-m3-chips-132810766.html">new M3-equipped MacBook Airs</a>. The 13-inch M2 model, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098-130040785.html">released in 2022</a>, was the first major redesign for Apple's most popular notebook in over a decade. Last year, Apple finally gave its fanatics a big-screen ultraportable notebook with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-review-a-bigger-screen-makes-a-surprising-difference-130033172.html">15-inch MacBook Air</a>. This week, we've got the same two computers with slightly faster chips. They didn't even get a real launch event from Apple, just a sleepy Monday morning press release. They look the same and are a bit faster than before — what else is there to say?</p>
<p>Now, I'm not saying these aren't great computers. It's just that we've been a bit spoiled by Apple's laptop

## Why Jack Dorsey thought Elon Musk could fix Twitter

<p>Of the many bizarre moments that preceded Twitter's change in ownership, one that’s always stuck out to me was Jack Dorsey’s <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-elon-musk-twitter-takeover-034408777.html"><ins>tweetstorm</ins></a> that “Elon is the singular solution I trust.” His insistence that Musk was uniquely positioned to “extend the light of consciousness” was a strange endorsement, even by Dorsey’s usual weird-guy standards. But Dorsey had long idolized Musk and the two men had a relationship that was far deeper than what many onlookers realized.</p>
<p>That’s according to a new book that explores Jack Dorsey’s role in Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter. Written by <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Kurt Wagner, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2

<p>Space and fashion lovers have a crossover accessory right now, and it's not just because there are some moons and stars dotted across it. Coperni, a French luxury brand, has unveiled the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4Ftm7Htob_/">Air Swipe Bag</a>, made entirely of NASA's nanomaterial silica aerogel, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91047739/nasa-used-this-material-to-catch-comet-dust-now-its-being-used-for-a-luxury-handbag"><em>Fast Company</em> reports</a>. Scientist Steve Jones first created the substance for NASA's 1999 Stardust mission, which brought samples back from the Wild 2 comet.</p>
<p>The Air Swipe Bag weighs only 1.1 ounces, with just 0.2 percent of its matter actually tangible. The rest is air that moves through the Aerogel's trillions of channels. Aerogel is renowned for its lightweight build, taking the title of lightest matter in the 1990s, with a second version breaking that record. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-is-looking-for-volunt

But fear not, Engadget can help you make sense of the computer monitor space and help you decide which monitors (or, at the very least, type of monitor) is right for you. Whether you’re a business user, a content creator, a multitasker or into competitive gaming, you have plenty of options to choose from and we’ve outline our top picks below.</p>
<h2>Factors to consider</h2>

The Fortnite creator claims this action prevents it from launching the Epic Games Store in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This escalation began when <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1750589570880516402">Epic CEO Tim Sweeney shared a post on X</a> in January claiming that Apple was trying to thwart complying with the Digital Market Act (DMA) and calling much of its latest policy announcement "hot garbage."

<p><a href="https://www.nikon.com/company/news/2024/0307_01.html">Nikon has announced it is buying RED</a>, the high-end cinema camera company, for an undisclosed sum. In a statement, the camera giant, which has suffered along with most of the imaging industry in recent years, said RED will become a wholly-owned subsidiary, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/7/24093109/nikon-acquiring-red-cameras-film-motion-picture-tv">as found by <em>The Verge</em></a>.

<p>A former Google engineer was arrested in California on Wednesday for stealing more than 500 files containing artificial intelligence trade secrets from the company and using the information to benefit rival tech companies in China. <br /><br />In an <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1341356/dl?inline">indictment</a> that was unsealed in a federal California court, prosecutors accused Linwei Ding, a 38-year-old Chinese national who started working at Google in 2019, of uploading trade secrets from his Google-issued laptop to personal cloud storage accounts. The documents that Ding stole involved “building blocks” of Google’s AI infrastructure, according to the indictment. He uploaded them to his personal accounts over a period of one year from May 2022 to May 2023.<br /><br /> Ding was arrested in Newark, California, and charged with four counts of theft of trade secrets. If convicted, he can be sentenced up to 10 years in prison and a fin
