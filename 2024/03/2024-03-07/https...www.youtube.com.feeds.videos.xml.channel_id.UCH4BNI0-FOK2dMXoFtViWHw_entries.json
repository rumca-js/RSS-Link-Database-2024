If you have the chance to see it, you don\u2019t want to miss it. It\u2019s an amazing coincidence that total eclipses happen at all \u2014 and that we\u2019re alive at a time when we can see and predict them. We made this video so you can learn how to watch an eclipse safely, what to look for during an eclipse, why eclipses happen, and how eclipses have helped advance scientific research.\n\nExplore this April 8, 2024 eclipse map from NASA! https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/\n\nFind your next solar eclipse here: https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEatlas/SEatlas.html\n\nLearn more about the solar eclipse timer app: https://www.solareclipsetimer.com/\n \n-----------\n\nHigh fives to all our Brain", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=791qJZivHpk", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCH4BNI0-FOK2dMXoFtViWHw", "bookmarked": false, "permanent": false, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "user": null, "album": "", "dead": false, "age": null, "source_obj__id": 33, "date_published": "2024-03-07T15:16:20+00:00"}]
