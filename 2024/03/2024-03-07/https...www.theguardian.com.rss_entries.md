<p>Jeremy Hunt’s NIC cuts risk weakening the moral foundation on which Britain’s taxation system still relies</p><p>Before he unveiled his main tax cut in the 2024 budget&nbsp;this week, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/mar/05/national-insurance-cut-budget-jeremy-hunt">Jeremy&nbsp;Hunt</a> criticised the fact that Britain collects two different types of taxes on earnings: income tax and national insurance contributions (NICs). The system has become too complicated, the chancellor said. It penalises work, he added, thus deterring a high-wage, high-skill economy. He then announced a cut in employees’ NICs by a further 2p, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/spring-budget-2024-speech">ended</a>: “Our long-term ambition is to end this unfairness … we will continue to cut national&nbsp;insurance.”</p><p>Britain’s tax system is indisputably complicated.

Jimmy Chérizier, widely known as Barbecue, is behind the week-long uprising by gangs that has freed 4,000 prisoners and besieged airports and police stations. The gangs are demanding the resignation of the unelected and unpopular prime minister, Ariel&nbsp;Henry, who arrived in Puerto Rico on Tuesday having been unable to return home from a foreign trip. But while ordinary citizens reel from the violence, he has yet to comment.

Indeed, football finance is such big news that recent years have witnessed the growth of a new subset, the “football finance expert”. It can be a broad church, from Gianni Infantino rolling in Saudi money, to Big Sir Jim’s Manchester United revolution, via more parochial stuff like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/oct/25/private-eye-frank-keating">the running costs of Neasden FC</a> since Buffy Cohen flounced out.

At that point, the textile artist’s name was still Pauline Jacobs but, one week after graduating, she married the artist Patrick Caulfield, seven years her senior. The two had met a few years earlier when he was her tutor at the Chelsea School of Art in London. “My fellow graduates were working out what they wanted to do and how they were going to afford to live,” she says. “And I was buying champagne and choosing a dress for the wedding.”</p><p>The marriage lasted a little over 20 years, during which time the couple had three sons and w

She explains why she wanted to show the world its flawed lead character</p><p>Nearly a decade ago, when Ramata-Toulaye Sy sat down to write her graduation script at the end of a screenwriting degree, her goal was simple. “I wanted to tell the most beautiful and greatest African love story,” says the 37-year-old French Senegalese film-maker with a smile. “When I was growing up a lot of African stories were about misery, poverty, war. I wanted to say: we can have African stories about people falling in love.”</p><p>She pauses, her grin widening. “Most importantly, I wanted to write the story of how Juliet became Lady Macbeth.” It’s a description that nails the film she’s now directed, based on that script, Banel and Adama.

Functionally, there were two incumbents. And functionally, neither party’s primary offered a meaningful opportunity for the expression of internal dissent.</p><p>This did not change on Super Tuesday.

<p>From mega-conspiracies to evolutionary biology, these books will help you dissect why political systems go awry</p><p>It has been called the permacrisis – a state of perpetual turbulence that folds geopolitical tension into cultural polarisation and spins it all around in a furious vortex. It can feel like being knocked over in the sea, unsure which way is up, afraid that another wave will strike the moment you breach the surface. The usual political narratives aren’t adequate to explain what is happening.

They dated from the Anglo-Saxon period and, once reassembled, revealed themselves as the remains of&nbsp;35 young adult males. The fact that these men had been thrown into a mass grave, with none of the usual pieties, suggested that they were outlaws of one kind or other. At the time England was engaged in a war of attrition with “the Danes” (a generic description that encompassed people from across Scandinavia), so the most likely explanation was that these unfortunate skeletons belonged to prisoners of war.</p><p>But on closer examination, explains Alice Roberts in this gripping set of tales from the crypt, the bones told a different story.

And it’s not about going into denial about that – it’s about looking at it from a different perspective.”</p><p>From someone else, those words might sound like psychobabble.

<p>Britten’s atmospheric, strange and beautiful opera, the last he wrote, comes to life in this new production from Welsh National Opera in a collaboration with No Fit State Circus</p><p></p><p>Death in Venice is Benjamin Britten’s final opera, written when he was ill with the heart condition that would kill him three years after its premiere at Snape Maltings in 1973. “It’s a deeply personal and intimate piece. Britten wasn’t a well man at the time of its composition, and he didn’t know how much music he had left in him. The epilogue, the last 20 bars, is the most serene and profound music he ever wrote. It’s Britten’s requiem for not only himself, but for his life partner, Peter Pears,” says Leo Hussain, conducting this production for Welsh National Opera – the first time the company have staged the work.</p><p>Mark Le Brocq sings Aschenbach, the role Britten wrote for Pears. The libretto adapts Thomas Mann’s 1912 novella and tells of an ageing writer suffering from creativ

<p>A dysfunctional Jewish family in north London is the focus for a study of faith and mysticism</p><p>Toby Lloyd’s slow burn of a debut novel is in the tradition of the pentagonal family saga, a subgenre that might include Thomas Mann’s Buddenbrooks and Jonathan Franzen’s The Corrections. Add to this formula the elements of religious mysticism, ethnicity (in this case Jewishness), and an exploration of the ethics around using family as material for literature, and you should have a truly combustible mix.</p><p>The five members of the Rosenthal clan are as different and conflicted as Franzen’s Lamberts. Mother Hannah is a high-powered journalist who writes about “religious obligations” and “gender roles” for the rightwing press, while father Eric is a gentle, religiously observant barrister. Eldest son Gideon is gay and leaves to do military service in Israel, while the youngest boy, Tovyah, begins his first term at Oxford having always been “coddled ... shy, knowledgeable, d

<p><strong>PlayStation 5 (version played), Xbox, PC; Visual Concepts/2K<br /></strong>Visual Concepts pulls off an incredible reversal on this formerly beleaguered series, just in time for Wrestlemania’s big 4-0</p><p>It’s a storyline worthy of a WWE superstar: washed up, widely ridiculed, apparently on its way to obscurity, WWE 2K20 was video game wrestling’s lowest ebb. Not five years later, presumably having performed all manner of off-screen training montages in meat lockers, the game returns revitalised, with a twinkle in its eye and, much more pertinently, controls that not only function but actually put a smile on your face.</p><p>Conceptually, wrestling has always been hard to translate to a game. Why not just keep leathering your opponent in the face until they’re too stunned to resist a pin? Because that makes bad television, and if you hadn’t already guessed by the smell of body oil and hairspray, you’re in the world of sports entertainment here. No, being “good” a

<p>Departure of longtime leader would pave way for new elections and much needed reform of Palestinian Authority</p><p>Last month the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, flew to the Qatari capital, Doha, for talks on securing a ceasefire in the war in Gaza. That in itself was unusual; the West Bank-based Abbas, who is also chair of the Fatah party and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), has been all but sidelined by local and international actors since the conflict between Israel and Hamas broke out.</p><p>According to three sources with knowledge of the meetings, which involved Palestinian and Qatari officials as well as diplomats from around the region, it was suggested that Abbas, 88, should consider shifting to a ceremonial presidential role. Such a move would pave a path for new Palestinian elections and help heal the long-running rift between Fatah and Hamas. It would also allow US-led hopes for a “revitalised”, “single structure” Palestinian

Clare’s group channelled the spirit of the early Victorian investors who had raised the funds to build the railway: “They wanted the railway so they decided to get on and do it themselves,” she tells me.

<p>Four years on from the start of the pandemic, the drama may have subsided but the lingering effects go on. Are we suffering from political long Covid?</p><p>Like many people, I have had Covid and I have had long Covid. They are very different experiences. I first caught the disease at the start of the pandemic in March 2020, when its effects were relatively unknown. It was unnerving and highly unpredictable. I did not get particularly sick, but I probably gave the virus to my father, who did. Back then, Covid appeared to be the great divider – the old were far more at risk than the young, and those with pre-existing vulnerabilities most at risk of all – and the great equaliser. Almost everyone experienced the shock and the fear of discovering a novel killer among us. We soon acquired a shared language and a sense of common purpose: to get through this together – whatever <em>this</em> turned out to be.</p><p>I developed long Covid last year, six months after I had caught g

<p><strong>Olivier theatre, London<br /></strong>Sheen stars as Aneurin Bevan in Tim Price’s drama, unfolding in flashbacks from a hospital bed</p><p>This life story begins at the end, with Aneurin “Nye” Bevan in a hospital bed, befittingly for the visionary political colossus who created Britain’s National Health Service in 1948.</p><p>As Bevan (Michael Sheen) is creeping towards death, flashbacks of memory bring a hallucinatory quality reminiscent of The Singing Detective: beds and ward curtains are woven into scenes of his childhood as a Welsh miner’s son and a stammering schoolboy bullied by his headteacher. We follow his rise from local council politics to the House of Commons and high office under Clement Attlee (Stephanie Jacob, slightly sinister in a bald wig). Doctors and nurses morph into a bevy of characters from his past, the cast juggling this multiplicity adeptly, and there is a surreal song and dance breakout number as, one presumes, Bevan’s morphine kicks in.<
