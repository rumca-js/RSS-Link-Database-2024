An entirely new card type, locations serve as both a passive source of lore and, sometimes, provide benefits to certain characters when they're place there. By playing locations, players will gain an amount of lore at the start of their turn, simply by having them out on the table - which already makes them very appealing. Add to this the bonuses they grant characters and the benefits characters can get from them - depending on their abilities - and locations are set to shake things up.</p><p>Every ink colour in Disney Lorcana is getting a set of location cards, with players who favour all sorts of strategies getting some great options in this set.
