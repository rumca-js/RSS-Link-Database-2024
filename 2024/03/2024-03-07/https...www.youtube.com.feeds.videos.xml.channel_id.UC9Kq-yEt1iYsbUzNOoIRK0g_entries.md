Now that the original Ghostbusters are back on the big screen (after forty years and a failed reboot attempt) it’s time to revisit the classic movie that started it all. 

The original Ghostbusters definitely raises some questions. Like why didn’t the guys take their ghostly evidence somewhere else instead of starting a ghostbusting business? Why did they get a secretary before having any clients? Whatever happened to that library ghost?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Ghostbusters!
