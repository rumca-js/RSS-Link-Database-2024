In the early 16th century, European explorers noticed something strange. Sailing down the east coast of Florida was almost impossible. Even with good winds they ended up sailing backwards. Today we know that the reason for this one-way-sailing route is the same thing that keeps the water levels around the east coast low and the weather in Europe mild. Itâ€™s the Gulf Stream! But can climate change stop it? And what happens then? Sit back and enjoy the show, because we're going to look into it now!
