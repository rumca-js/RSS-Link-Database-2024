		Computer vision scientists from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/smart-engines">Smart Engines</a> have successfully trained AI to detect forged passports from around the world, showing promise in reducing fraud cases and fighting terrorism, according to a company statement.

The AI can detect fraud through the photo page and all pages of documents. It has the capacity to check over 500 passport templates from countries on every inhabitable continent.

The team at Smart Engines used a one-shot approach to training the AI, meaning that it's trained on a single image of a document in order to add a new template. The AI would then be able to find anomalies on other samples individually.

The system includes Smart Engines <a href="https://smarte

## UK’s £230 million plan to implement police facial recognition and drones

		As much as £230 million (approximately US$295 million) will be designated by the UK government to be spent on drones and facial recognition for police, "among other time and money saving technology." The allocation was revealed by Jeremy Hunt, chancellor of the Exchequer, during his annual address on Wednesday, according to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13164103/Police-drones-responders-victims-report-crimes-video.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Daily Mail</a>.

Drones could be used as first responders as soon as the public reports a crime, and police could contact individuals through video calls. The idea behind the use of drones is that the police will have a better understanding of any incident than they would get by relying 

## Voters likely pass facial recognition freedoms for police in San Francisco

		In a move that is not particularly surprising, California lawmakers are pushing along legislation that would tighten rules on police use of facial recognition.

Other states generally have been become fans of biometric surveillance by law enforcement while the California legislature has tended to tilt the other direction. Again, not unthinkable.

More surprising, though, is how San Francisco continues to turn the opposite direction as the state legislature on the issue.

A city ballot measure voted on this week, Proposition E, likely passed, and if so, it will significantly deregulate the use of face biometrics by police in the city. Prop E also frees cops from other rules they dislike.

The measure was put on the ballot by Mayor London Breed, who has made many monied fr

		Maybe recognizing that many U.S. communities will gamble the privacy of school-aged children for promises of safety on campus, AI skeptics are beseeching parents to at least challenge vendor pitches.

Always a good message, caveat emptor may not be enough to slow the welcoming biometric recognition <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/one-us-school-backs-out-of-biometrics-contract-another-is-going-big">trend</a> in schools.

Biometrics skeptics at an education conference this month said vendors are marketing fear and sometimes overpromising results. No matter how small the chances are (and they are small), tragedy is 100 percent certain when it happens to a family.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/bioid">BioID</a> has released a new version of its deepfake detection software to secure biometric authentication and digital identity verification against manipulated images and videos.

The software prevents identity spoofing by detecting deepfakes and content generated or manipulated by AI, with real-time analysis and feedback on both photos and videos.

BioID notes that in addition to scenarios like identity verification for user onboarding, deepfakes threaten trust in journalism, entertainment, and personal relationships.

The company has been working on deepfake detection since 2020, according to the announcement. As part of that effort, BioID is contributing its proprietary anti-spoofing and biom

Pennsylvania state lawmakers have introduced a bill in the lower house that would make digital IDs a publicly and privately recognized document in combination with a conventional physical document.

Holders of an mDL could filter the information displayed in a transaction.

Police would not have the authority to demand a phone as they do now with physical IDs.

Officers could not search a suspect’s phone without a warrant unless the person gave the phone up.

The legislation doesn’t address the legality of buying alcohol with
