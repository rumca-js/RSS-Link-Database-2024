Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains 1 of the top 3 global public health challenges facing humanity. Every year, 70,000 people die globally from AMR, and the threat is exacerbated by the fact that we have moved from the era of excess antibiotics to one where only a few antibiotics are considered innovative by World Health Organization (WHO) standards.

The demand for paper and paperboard production continuously grows worldwide, particularly in the packaging industry. Due to the paper's nature, it usually requires a surface coating to keep out water, oil, and other unwanted substances. These coatings can come with high financial and environmental costs. Using renewable coating materials that are also cost-effective can support sustainability strategies.

Almond [Prunus dulcis Miller (D.A. Webb)] has significant economic and genetic research value, but current studies face limitations, including a narrow focus on additive models and limited germplasm diversity.

It is well known that animal-pollinated plants usually offer nectar or pollen to reward vectors for pollen transfer. While nectar is a kind of sugar water, pollen is protein-rich, a must-need nutrient for bee babies. The honey humans consume is made by female bee workers. Fifty years ago, German scientist Stefan Vogel first identified that droplets are non-water miscible 'nectar' but lipids in some flowering plants, discovering the so-called oil-flower, which offers oil as a reward for female bees.

Activated carbon is employed for the adsorption of organic micropollutants (OMPs) from water, typically present in concentrations ranging from ng L−1 to μg L−1. However, the efficacy of OMP removal deteriorates considerably due to competitive adsorption from background dissolved organic matter (DOM), present at substantially higher concentrations in mg L−1. Interpreting the characteristics of competitive DOM is crucial in predicting OMP adsorption efficiencies across diverse natural waters.

New research by Caltech's Kirby Nielsen, assistant professor of economics and William H. Hurt Scholar, shows that the gender gap in confidence that is often held responsible for women's underachievement in the workplace is "contagious"; that is, when evaluating a worker's performance based on self-assessments, reviewers will reward apparent self-confidence—and conversely, penalize a lack of confidence—rather than focusing solely on performance.

Packing to go to space is a lot like getting ready for a plane ride with only a carry-on bag. You have to maximize the use of the space in your bag at the same time you want to make sure you have what you need. That's the challenge astronauts face in the upcoming Artemis moon missions. So, NASA held a competition to figure out the best and most innovative ways to store cargo for the missions.

Spintronics is a field that deals with electronics that exploit the intrinsic spin of electrons and their associated magnetic moment for applications such as quantum computing and memory storage devices. Owing to its spin and magnetism exhibited in its insulator-metal phase transition, the strongly correlated electron systems of nickel oxide (NiO) have been thoroughly explored for more than eight decades. Interest in its unique antiferromagnetic (AF) and spin properties has seen a revival lately since NiO is a potential material for ultrafast spintronics devices.

Sparks fly when a female nematode meets her mate in a Petri dish. Tracking him by smell, she beelines over and is pregnant within moments of physical contact. But for the hermaphroditic version of these tiny roundworms, it's a very different story. Anatomically female but capable of self-fertilizing with their own supply of sperm, hermaphrodites remain emphatically uninterested in mating—until their sperm supply runs dry. Only then will they seek out males.

Land subsidence is a geohazard caused by the sudden or gradual settling (years to decades) of the land surface due to the removal of subsurface material. This can be due to a variety of factors, both natural (such as earthquakes, volcanic activity and compaction of fine-grained unconsolidated sediments) and anthropogenic (for example, mining and groundwater abstraction). It poses a major issue in urban zones where it can cause building collapse and damage to infrastructure that may be a hazard to life and a resource management problem.
