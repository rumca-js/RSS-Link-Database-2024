But Marcus Lemonis is still trying to turn around businesses. Lemonis, who starred on the reality show for eight years, recently became executive chairman of Beyond \u2014 the company that just paid $4.5 million to acquire the assets of embattled online retailer Zulily. In an interview with GeekWire on Thursday, Lemonis said he hopes to spark some of the secret sauce that helped Zulily blossom in its early days as a flash sales leader that focused on women and moms. &#8220;The flash sale, get-it-before-it-runs-out model \u2014&#160;that&#8217;s how it will be rebirthed,&#8221; he said.
