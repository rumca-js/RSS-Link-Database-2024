<p>Who would have guessed that giving illegal immigrants free flights with no identification requirement would increase human trafficking? Well, not the federal government. </p>
<p>This week we <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/secret-migrant-flights" target="_self">reported </a>that the White House admitted they have been transporting migrants on secret flights. Today we shall report that Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd announced a total of 228 arrests in an undercover human trafficking investigation. But the worst part about that is at least 21 of those suspects are fore

But what happens when these sorts of people start running things - is that it becomes home to people who are either dirt-poor or tech-boy-rich. You must either be a drug addict on welfare, or someone making millions working for a tech startup. And the middle class ends up having the most trouble getting by. </p><p>But most people are just your average American. Most people are not drug-addicted on welfare and most people don‚

Transgender ideology is nothing more than a contradiction, at best.

	India Willoughby, who boasts being the world‚Äôs 1st trans newsreader ("newsreader" is what they call journalismers in the UK) has JK Rowling right where h/she wants her... under arrest! Or, maybe under arrest. Willoughby has reported Rowling to the police for misgendering and has told a media outlet that the author is totes going to jail now. Finally, after all these years, someone has put an end to all Rowling's anti-transing.
</p><p>
	Not really, but we can let India pretend. Rowling has something to say about it too.

	Here's India, who needs to calm down.

	JK Rowling definitely committed a crime. I'm legally a woman....

	"Legally."

	She knows I'm a woman, and she calls me a man. It's a protected characteristic. And that is a breach of both the Equalities
