WWE 2K24 reviewed by Jarrett Green on PlayStation 5, also available on Xbox and PC.

WWE 2K24 is clear proof that 2K and Visual Concepts have hit their stride when it comes to making today’s package better on the whole than yesterday’s. While not drastically different, there are enough new little features added to every inch of this iteration to make it well worth climbing back into the ring. Old enemies still have their number, though, such as making its docuseries Showcase mode feel good to actually play, creating a more consistent tone and pacing in MyRise, and getting more of the current day roster up to the high visual bar that’s currently only hit by its most popular superstars. But even with those lingering annoyances, WWE 2K24 puts an impressive cap on a three year run of great wrestling games.

Already certain it’s got a hit on its hands, Netflix is doubling down on more ‘Avatar The Last Airbender’ with the announcement of a season two and three of the live-action series. The live-action adaptation has proven to be a hit for the streaming service, as it’s held its place on top of Netflix’s English shows with a whopping 41.1 million views so far. It’s unsurprising, as the series has proven to be quite the 1:1 adaptation of the Nickelodeon animated series, lauded by longtime fans of the Nick Toon. The first batch of episodes in what’s seemingly now a three-season long adaptation is built to tell the story of Aang’s journey to becoming the Avatar, and according to Netflix his story will conclude in season 3.
