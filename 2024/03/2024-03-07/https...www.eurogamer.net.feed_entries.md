This adventure puzzler was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 just months before the next console generation, and packed a real emotional punch for those that caught it. Jump forward eleven years and we have a new remake for a new generation on PS5, Series X and Series S - so how does it hold up on new platforms, including the less powerful Series S, across both performance and quality modes? </p><p>In terms of its tech, this is a significant remake: the original game's Unreal Engine 3 is jettisoned for Unreal Engine 5, with Milan-based studio Avantgarden putting in serious work to re-imagine every environment with vastly improved detail via the engine's Nanite and Lumen technologies. Beyond improved visuals, the

Epic has announced the next batch of titles it'll be giving away on the Epic Games Store, with Deux Ex: Mankind Divided and The Bridge both getting the freebie treatment starting Thursday, 14th March.
</p><p>
Starting with Deux Ex: Mankind Divided, it's the fifth instalment in Square Enix's stealthy, shooty sci-fi series and a direct sequel to 2012's Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Once again cyber-augmented series protagonist Adam Jensen returns, and the ensuing adventure was deemed to be a "smart, handsome and weighty addition to the stealth-action genre" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deus-ex-mankind-divided-review">Eurogamer's Recommended review</a>.
</p><p>
As for The Bridge, it's a puzzle game created by Ty Taylor that's described as "Isaac Newton meets M. C. Escher". It's a direction-flipping, gravity

## Dune: Awakening developer seeks to reassure fans following religion concerns

Funcom, developer of the upcoming Dune: Awakening, has issued a statement regarding the role of religion in the game after fan concerns erupted on the internet this week.
</p><p>
In Eurogamer's preview of Dune: Awakening, Funcom chief creative officer Joel Bylos mentioned how "for the large part, we sort of sidestep religion" as part of the game's "alternate history approach" - something which, as we wrote at the time, was likely to initially set Dune nerds' alarm bells ringing. 
</p><p>
But the decision to "sidestep" Dune's overtly religious aspects in Awakening has been taken out of consideration for the series' lore, our Chris Tapsell wrote, and refers to one "religious aspect" in particular. That said, religion is still a theme in the game - something seemingly evident by its focus on the Butlerian jihad: the war betwe

Final Fantasy fans are arguing over the redesigned moogles in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.
</p><p>
Moogles are, of course, the adorable little white flying creatures that are regulars in the series, with each game having a slightly tweaked design.
</p><p>
In Rebirth, though, they're quite different: elongated bodies, round eyes, and... teeth.

## Helldivers 2 mechs are nearly here, but first they need to be liberated

Mechs are set to make their arrival in Helldivers 2 in the very near future, but there is still one small thing standing in their way. The mechs' production factories are under attack, it turns out, and it's going to be up to players to liberate them.
</p><p>
"THIS IS NOT A DRILL," the Helldivers 2 social media team proclaimed earlier today, stating a recent (fictional) attack has halted all mech output. "Helldivers have been deployed to liberate Tien Kwan!"
</p><p>
Based on this post, it seems like we will soon be sent to Tien Kwan to deal with whatever pest is currently tormenting those poor, sweet, mech factories, and to liberate their metal machines.

I've seen glimpses of the game I feel we've been promised - the Victorian fantasy where friends glide through the air on umbrellas, fighting mythical beasts together in strange fae lands - but only ever glimpses. Mostly, I've been in dogged pursuit of an excitement that eludes me, hoping it'll be around the next corner I turn, in the next gear tier I unlock. But every corner seems to just bring another corner, and so around and around I go, getting somewhere<em> </em>but never <em>there</em>.</p><p>It's a shame because as a concept, and even in practice, there are things I love about Nightingale. The setting! A Victorian world of old-fashioned explorer garb and backpacks, of canvas and ironwork. And the fantasy world lurking jus

## Unknown 9: Awakening is an ambitious new transmedia bid

What came first, the video game or the tie-in novel? Typically it's the former - and only after it's proven to be successful. But this isn't the case with Unknown 9: Awakening, a  historical action adventure published by Bandai Namco originally announced back in 2020. Back then, it was due for launch the following year. Now, it will rather belatedly arrive this summer, long after a number of other Unknown 9 things have already debuted: a comic, the beginnings of a novel trilogy, a Spotify podcast. There's no Michael Fassbender movie in sight just yet, but the hope is that Unknown 9: Awakening will supercharge interest in all that, and act as an entry point into this fresh storytelling universe.

Last night's Xbox Partner Preview showcase gave us our first look at Sleight of Hand, an occult noir deckbuilding stealth sim from RiffRaff Games. And, it looks Ace (see what I did there?).
</p><p>
On Sleight of Hand's release next year across Xbox Series X/S and PC (including day one on Game Pass), players will take on the role of Lady Luck, a former occult detective "fated to return for one final job". And that job? Taking down her former Coven after a "less than amicable departure" which saw her lose her left hand. 
</p><p>
"Too tired to fight fate any longer, and with more overdue bills than bucks to her name, Lady Luck strikes out to Steeple City with a cursed deck in hand, ready to track down everyone from her past life," reads Sleight of Hands description.

If you have been playing Minecraft for the last decade or so and been thinking, 'I really enjoy this game, but I wish they would change up the wolves up a bit', then I have good news: Eight new wolf variations are coming to Minecraft, first via the Bedrock Edition beta and preview builds and Minecraft: Java Edition's latest snapshot.
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/new-minecraft-wolves">blog post</a> shared yesterday, Mojang detailed each new wolfy variant. The wolves all live in their own, specific areas, with the Rusty wolf "hiding between the jungle vines". The Spotted wolf, meanwhile, can be found in the Savanna Plateau. 
</p><p>
Other wolves currently being put through the test are: The Black wolf, the Striped wolf, the Snowy wolf, the Ashen wolf, the Woods wolf and the Chestnut wolf. Me

However, those on Xbox will have to wait a little longer for this and the game's previous hotfix to arrive, as they are still going through testing.</p><p>Sharing details of its most recent fix, Larian stated it had found a crash bug that was only affecting Xbox. "We're taking the time to investigate and solve that issue, so your future adventures go a little smoother," Larian said.</p><p>A knock on effect of this delay means cross-saves are currently not loadable on Xbox consoles, if they come from other platforms which have been updated with to include hotfixes 20 or 21.
