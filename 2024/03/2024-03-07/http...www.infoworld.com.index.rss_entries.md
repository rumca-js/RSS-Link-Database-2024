<p>Apple has released Swift 5.10, an update to the company’s open-source programming language that reaches a major milestone: providing safety against data races via full data isolation in the concurrency model. The improvement prepares the way for the planned Swift 6 release.</p><p>Binaries for Swift 5.10, <a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-5.10-released/" rel="nofollow">introduced March 5</a>, can be found at <a href="https://www.swift.org/download/" rel="nofollow">swift.org</a> for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p><p>In explaining the milestone, Apple Swift engineer Holly Borla said an increasingly important source of undefined behavior is concurrent code that inadvertently accesses memory from one thread at the same time that another thread is writing to the same memory. This unsafety is called a data race, which makes concurrent programs exceptionally difficult to write, Borla noted. Swift 5.10 finally accomplishes full data isolatio

<p>Web development platform provider <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709192/netlify-composable-web-platform-aims-to-modernize-web-architecture.html">Netlify</a> has added AI-enabled deploy assist capabilities to its Composable Web Platform.</p><p>Unveiled March 7, AI-enabled deploy assist analyzes failed deployments and offers suggestions to correct errors. Netlify said the feature is intended to reduce the time developers spend manually reviewing logs and debugging failed builds, ensuring failed builds do not become bottlenecks and improving the developer experience.</p><p>Netlify CTO Dana Lawson explained how the company’s AI addresses issues across toolsets. “When building composable architectures, teams are pulling in tools, content, and integrations that suit them best. When issues happen, it’s not always clear what part of your composable architecture is having issues. It could be code, configuration, etc,” Lawson said.</p><

<p>Passwords are a <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/568943/most-common-passwords.html">problem</a>. While they remain the main way we secure applications, services, and systems, they’re increasingly vulnerable. Cloud compute makes it economical to brute-force valuable passwords, while poorly-thought-out password policies drive users to inherently risky behaviors. And while password managers make it easier to have separate complex passwords for everywhere we need them, other “security” policies block us from using those passwords.</p><p>What was intended to be a secure internet is increasingly insecure, with our files, data, and finances at risk. It’s still a Wild West out there, and the question is, who will win that frontier?

<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3268073/what-is-kubernetes-your-next-application-platform.html">Kubernetes</a> has become the de facto way to schedule and manage services in medium and large enterprises. Coupled with the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3445043/what-are-microservices-your-next-software-architecture.html">microservice</a> design pattern, it has proved to be a useful tool for managing everything from websites to data processing pipelines. But the ecosystem at large agrees that Kubernetes has a cost problem. Unfortunately, the predominant way to cut costs is itself a liability.</p><p>The problem is not Kubernetes.
