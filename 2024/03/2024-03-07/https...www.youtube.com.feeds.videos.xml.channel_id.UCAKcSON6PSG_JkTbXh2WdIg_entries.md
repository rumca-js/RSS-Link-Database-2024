Sarah Jarosz didn’t go into recording what became the album "Polaroid Lovers" with a specific theme in mind, but after the songs coalesced, the theme emerged. “I realized that each story is a snapshot,” Jarosz explains. “And a lot of the songs are almost sort of dealing with time and the fleeting nature of time … the moment is gone, but the photo lives, and songs are kind of like that.”

Hailed for a fresh new sound that Radio Heartland’s Mike Pengra describes as very “sing-along-able,” "Polaroid Lovers" also saw Jarosz break new ground in terms of co-writing “in a Nashville sort of way,” as she puts it, working with such artists as Natalie Hemby, Ruston Kelly, Jon Randall and producer Daniel Tashian.

While in town for a concert at the Fine Line in Minneapolis, Jarosz and her band visited The Current studio to play songs from the record. Watch and listen to "Runaway Train" above.
