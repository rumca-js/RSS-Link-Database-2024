<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 07 March 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01815-1">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01815-1</a></p>Cu2Se is of interest for thermoelectrics as it is environmentally sustainable and has a high figure of merit ZT; however, copper ion migration impacts device stability. Here a co-doping strategy that combines steric and electrostatic effects is shown to improve device stability as well as improving ZT to 3.
