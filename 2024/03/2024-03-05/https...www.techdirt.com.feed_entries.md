Amazon&#8217;s home surveillance tech acquisition, Ring, wanted to be all things to everyone. But mostly, it wanted to be BFFs with law enforcement. Providing homeowners with an easy way to surveil their own doorsteps and driveways was enough for Ring for a little while. Then, following its acquisition by Amazon, it began to portray itself [&#8230;]

Anyone who follows Techdirt knows we&#8217;re very interested in the progress of Bluesky, the decentralized social network that embraces our concept of protocols over platforms. Bluesky recently ended its invite-only beta and opened its doors to the public, so it seems like a great time for a check-in, and who better to check in with [&#8230;]

A few weeks ago, Prof. James Grimmelmann and (former Techdirt) journalist Tim Lee wrote a piece for Ars Technica, stating why the NY Times might win its copyright lawsuit against OpenAI. It’s no secret that I’m skeptical of the underpinnings of the lawsuit and think the NY Times is being silly in filing it, but [&#8230;]

Like highway patrol officers bitching about the fact they couldn&#8217;t talk a driver into a voluntary search, a British censorship board is complaining about the fact they can&#8217;t get US companies to comply with takedown requests they&#8217;re under no legal obligation to comply with. That&#8217;s the gist of this article, as reported by Laurie Clarke [&#8230;]

It appears that Meta is serious about no longer bribing news orgs to keep corrupt politicians from forcing them to engage in sketchy wealth transfer schemes to news orgs. While it caved in the past in Australia and paid off news orgs there, the company is informing news orgs that they won’t be renewing the [&#8230;]

We’ve noted repeatedly how early attempts to integrate “AI” into journalism have proven to be a&#160;comical mess, resulting in no shortage of&#160;shoddy product, dangerous falsehoods, and plagiarism. It’s thanks in large part to the incompetent executives at many large media companies, who see AI primarily as a way to cut corners, assault unionized labor, and [&#8230;]

While I&#8217;m mildly surprised by this, at least it&#8217;s a pleasant surprise. Almost exactly a year ago rapper Eminem opposed the trademark for the &#8220;Reasonably Shady&#8221; podcast, which is itself a product of Gizelle Bryant and Robyn Dixon, both of whom were on Real Houswives of Potomac. The opposition itself is quite silly, with Em&#8217;s [&#8230;]
