The documents show that the company helped the Chinese government by pretending to be an information security company and conducting hacking and cyber espionage activities worldwide. \nSo, why would confidential documents be leaked on such a large scale? \nOne of the possibilities is that China's strained economy might have played a role. These cyber security companies might have to tighten their finances, causing a backlash from employees and resulting in some of them becoming whistle-blowers. From the leaked information, it seems that people who leaked the info are eager to capitalize on it. \n\nHave questions? Do you have something to share with us about China?
