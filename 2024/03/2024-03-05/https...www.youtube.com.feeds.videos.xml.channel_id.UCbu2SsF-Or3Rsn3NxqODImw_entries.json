Combined with the remake trilogy, the timeline now spans 9 games, 1 movie, and a handful of tie-in books, all of which amounts to a rather confusing chronology of events. With the new remake trilogy toying with the continuity of the original game\u2019s timeline, it certainly gets a little bit confusing. And with the release of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, there is no better time to dive back into the lore of Final Fantasy 7 than now.\n\nThis is the Final Fantasy 7 timeline fully explained.\n\n00", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/J0OE91PSdCw/hqdefault.jpg", "comments": [], "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "language": null, "source_obj__id": 127, "age": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0}]
