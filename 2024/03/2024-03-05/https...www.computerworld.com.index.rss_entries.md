<p>The best value notebook for most of us is the MacBook Air, and Apple has now updated both the 13- and 15-in. models with powerful M3 chips and the capacity to run two external displays when the lid is closed.</p><p>All in all, these Macs should be more than suitable for most mobile workers.</p><h2><strong>Apple in the fast lane</strong></h2>
<p>Think back less than a year to when the company <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3701891/apples-new-15-in-m2-macbook-air-is-a-consumer-workhorse.html">introduced its superb M2-powered 15-in. MacBook Air</a>. That model delivered more performance than the late 2019 2.7GHz Intel Mac Pro.</p><p>That surge in computational ability goes even further with the M3 update. Citing tests it conducted in January, Apple claims the new chip runs up to 60% faster than the model with the M1 chip and up to 13 times faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article
