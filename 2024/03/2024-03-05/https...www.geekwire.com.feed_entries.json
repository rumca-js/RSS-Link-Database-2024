The new grant will support a year-long project to create an antimicrobial discovery platform to tackle these challenges. The focus is on Campylobacter infections, which are among the most common human infections and can cause severe diarrhea. Methane released in cow burps are the No. 1 source of greenhouse gases for the agricultural sector.

Less than a year after the release of the $1,200 Aura \u2014 designed to attract a wider audience of consumers \u2014&#160;Glowforge is releasing the new Spark, which will sell for $699. Glowforge&#8217;s two higher-end machines include the Glowforge Plus ($4,995) and Glowforge Pro ($6,995). The Spark is a little smaller than the Aura, but is built around the same laser technology, capable of cutting materials ranging from paper to leather to wood. The bed size of the Spark is&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/glowforge-releases-spark-another-low-priced-3d-laser-engraver-to-attract-more-home-crafters/\">Read More</a>", "thumbnail": null, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "language": "en-US", "source_obj__id": 131, "age": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0}, {"tags": [], "page_rating": 0, "bookmarked": false, "permanent": false, "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/jeff-bezos-bumps-elon-musk-from-billionaires-top-spot-with-net-worth-of-200-3b", "date_published": "2024-03-05T16:25:49+00:00", "user": null, "title": "Jeff Bezos bumps Elon Musk from billionaires top spot with net worth of $200.3B", "vote": 0, "artist": null, "album": "", "description": "<img alt=\"Musk and Bezos\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"542\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/190410-musk-bezos.jpg\" width=\"933\" /><br />Jeff Bezos is back on top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for the first time since 2021, overtaking Elon Musk as the richest person in the world with a net worth of $200.3 billion. Bloomberg reported that Musk lost his top ranking on Monday after Tesla shares tumbled 7.2%, leaving the automaker&#8217;s CEO with a net worth of $197.7 billion. The stock fell after February vehicle shipments fell in China, the company&#8217;s largest market. Bezos&#8217; wealth has been on an upward trajectory thanks to the same trend for Amazon shares, which have more than doubled since late 2022.

It can be especially challenging in the early part of product creation, when designers need to set parameters and requirements, also known as the &#8220;definition phase.&#8221; Can AI help speed up that process? That&#8217;s what a group of longtime investors are betting on with a $3 million seed investment in Enzzo, a new Seattle startup that spun out of Pioneer Square Labs and aims to accelerate hardware development. The 4-person startup is led by veteran entrepreneur and tech leader Ford Davidson, who most recently spent time at Meta and Amazon in product leadership roles.

So I pulled up from the bottom of my screen in the Amazon app, and called on Rufus for help. &#8220;Can you recommend a trainer for my bike, which is a Raleigh Cadent 2?&#8221; I asked. Rufus responded, &#8220;The Raleigh Cadent 2 is a versatile hybrid bike that can handle both road and light off-road riding.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/will-ai-change-how-we-shop-what-its-like-to-use-amazons-new-rufus-assistant/\">Read More</a>", "thumbnail": null, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "language": "en-US", "source_obj__id": 131, "age": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0}]
