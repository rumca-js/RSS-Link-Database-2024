More than 30 years ago, in room 517 at the distinctly prosaic Sheraton hotel in Martinsburg, West Virginia, Casolaro was found dead in a bathtub. The 44-year-old\u2019s wrists had a dozen slash wounds, deep enough to sever the tendons.

While nobody in their right mind, even a Premier League manager such as Wilder, would have given the Blades a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of getting a result against Mikel Arteta\u2019s rampant Arsenal team, the speed and meekness of their surrender must surely have raised eyebrows around Bramall Lane. It certainly raised backsides, with the clack-clack-clackety-clack-clack of hastily-vacated seats punctuating the stunned silence of the stadium as hundreds of fans decided to give up on a bad job and make for the exits after less than quarter of an hour.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3185b94f5a815c488ccb17f65afe4c10502d2b1d/0_364_5461_3277/master/5461.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f90f83b18004f963c2c9ebfd9aed0b7b", "comments": [], "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "language": "en-gb", "source_obj__id": 340, "age": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0}, {"tags": [], "page_rating": 0, "bookmarked": false, "permanent": false, "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/mar/05/bridgertons-charitha-chandran-west-end-shocker-netflix-hit", "date_published": "2024-03-05T16:26:45+00:00", "user": null, "title": "\u2018I have big ambitions\u2019: Bridgerton\u2019s Charitha Chandran on her West End shocker \u2013 and building solar-powered factories", "vote": 0, "artist": null, "album": "", "description": "<p>One minute, she decided to try acting.
