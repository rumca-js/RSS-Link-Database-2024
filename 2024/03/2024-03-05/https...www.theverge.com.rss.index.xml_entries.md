  <p id="2D6dTV">The music labels suing Twitter — now X — for copyright infringement can move forward with parts of their lawsuit. In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24459497-twitter-music-label-lawsuit?responsive=1&amp;title=1">a filing on Tuesday</a>, US District Judge Aleta A. Trauger partially denied X’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, saying it’s still not clear “to what extent X Corp. may be liable for the infringing acts of users on its platform.”</p>

  <p id="gsLPRK">A year ago, TikTok introduced a new way for creators on the platform to make money: make longer videos. The invite-only Creativity Program, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/20/23604204/tiktok-creativity-program-creator-fund-longer-videos-eligibility">then in beta</a>, required TikTokers to post clips longer than a minute to qualify for monetization, demonstrating a shift in how the company wanted people to use its platform. It was a move away from the so-called short-form video style that made TikTok a household name in the first place. </p>

<p id="3ft9qh">For many of us, the path to the smart home starts with a simple problem. You lock yourself out of the house one too many times, so you buy a smart lock. You want to change the temperature without getting out of bed, so you get a smart thermostat. You always forget to turn the porch lights off, so you buy a smart switch that automates them. For most people, that’s as far as it goes and as far as it needs to go. </p>

  <p id="qOZtR9">Budget phones tend to be pretty forgettable, but the Nothing Phone 2A isn’t your average budget phone — that much is obvious just looking at it. </p>
<p id="aSwRC9">The 2A is Nothing’s third phone, and its first attempt at a truly inexpensive device. And it’s <em>very</em> budget-friendly: the Phone 2A goes on sale today starting at £319 (€329) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. A 12GB/256GB version will cost £349 (€379). Preorders open today, and the phone will ship on March 12th. The 256GB variant will be sold in the US for $349, but there’s a catch — it’s only available throug

  <p id="iXbEx3">The Federal Communications Commission is considering a proposal to bar landlords from charging tenants in bulk for cable, internet, and satellite services, offering them more choice in the kinds of services they need.</p>
<p id="AqvKkf">The agency is circulating a proposed rule to ban the practice of “bulk billing,” the White House announced in a press release ahead of President Joe Biden’s meeting with his Competition Council on Tuesday. It’s part of a broader effort to promote policies that will lower costs for Americans, as Biden is trying to appeal to voters focused on the economy as he seeks reelection later this year. That theme of lowering costs will resurface in Biden’s State of the Union address on Thursday, National Economic Advisor L
