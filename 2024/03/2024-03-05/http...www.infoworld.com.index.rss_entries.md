<p>I’ve never been a big fan of annual performance reviews. Frankly, I think they ought to be utterly unnecessary. No one enjoys the process. I’m at a loss why a company would spend all those person-hours on a process that no one really wants.</p><p>Any competent manager should be meeting regularly with all of her direct reports, and should make sure that each employee knows clearly where they stand and how they are performing. Continuous and timely feedback is vastly superior to annual reviews. If a manager provides continuous and timely feedback, then the performance review process should be a complete waste of time.</p><p>Companies should foster a culture in which the standing and progress of every employee are transparent, making performance reviews an unnecessary exercise in redundancy. Managers who have direct reports who are not totally clear about where they stand should themselves be told that they are not performing up to snuff.</p>

<p>Are you a cloud architect, engineer, or neither? The question will get you more blank stares than good explanations due to the confusion around two roles that perform separate but equally important duties.</p><p>I’ve held both roles. I was a software engineer early in my career, then morphed into an architect, then an executive architect. The trouble is that we tend to conflate both roles these days. The lines between engineering and architecture have blurred. We’re obtaining engineering certifications that say “architect” and architecture certifications that say “engineer.” The former is the most common, leading to considerable confusion.</p><p>First, I don’t care if you mislabel something, but I will correct you if you do. The confusion I’m seeing is leading to hiring mistakes and misunderstanding of what skills to apply where.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3713501/why-we-need-both-cloud-engineers-and-cloud-architects.html#jump
