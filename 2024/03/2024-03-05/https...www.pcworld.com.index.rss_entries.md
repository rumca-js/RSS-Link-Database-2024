<p>Microsoft is unexpectedly killing off its support for Android apps within Windows 11, although you&rsquo;ll have a year to play games on your Windows tablet until support officially expires. </p>



<p>But if you haven&rsquo;t already installed support for Android apps, you&rsquo;re out of luck.</p>



<p>Microsoft isn&rsquo;t saying exactly why it&rsquo;s ending support for the Windows Subsystem for Android, though notice was given as part of an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/android/wsa/?ranMID=24542&amp;ranEAID=kXQk6*ivFEQ&amp;ranSiteID=kXQk6.ivFEQ-WQX1M.uQ0d_eDtKNE4pPGw&amp;epi=kXQk6.ivFEQ-WQX1M.uQ0d_eDtKNE4pPGw&amp;irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AIDcmm549zy227_aff_7593_1243925&amp;tduid=(ir__quu2hwvqqskf6zh3aw2isckjem2x9bjzotwe11n900)(7593)(1243925)(kXQk6.ivFEQ-WQX1M.uQ0d_eDtKNE4pPGw)()&a

<p>A quality monitor arm is one of the best upgrades you can make to your home office setup. Not only do monitor arms provide you with more options to move and position your displays around your desk, but they also free up space on your desk surface, leaving it open for other uses. Plus, they help your setup look cool, too.</p>



<p>The only catch is the price. Most monitor arms worth buying will set you back close to $200, and heavy-duty arms are even pricier. However, if you buy a good monitor arm, you&rsquo;ll likely never need to replace it. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to buy the right monitor arm the first time so you&rsquo;re left feeling like you got your money&rsquo;s worth. To that end we&rsquo;ve put several popular monitor arms through their paces to figure out which are truly worth your money. Below you&rsquo;ll find a our curated lis

<p>Bless me, Gaben, for I have sinned. In a moment of weakness I turned off the adult content filters in my Steam search, and now my game library has been tainted by the shame of tender, undulating flesh rendered in Unreal Engine. But fear not, fellow naughty gamers: Steam will soon let you hide those titles you&rsquo;d rather not let your friends and family see if they happen to stray near your battlestation&hellip; assuming you&rsquo;re not actively playing them at the time, of course. </p>



<p><strong><em>Update, March 5th, 2024: </em></strong>The hide-your-shame feature is now <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4149575031731807336&amp;xcust=2-1-2178154-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">officially out of beta</a>, and you

<p>You&rsquo;re working at home, rocking out to an embarrassing pop playlist. Suddenly, your boss requests a video chat. Do you scramble to turn off Spotify? Two years ago, sure. But not now.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;re probably used to thinking of AI in terms of AI art, or chatbots, or how AI blurs or filters out your background on video calls on Teams or Zoom. But AI audio filtering has now become so sophisticated that you can literally play music in the background, and your laptop will filter it out entirely. We tested it to make sure.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;re probably unaware of this, because it&rsquo;s the people you talk to that hear your voice, and not you. And you shouldn&rsquo;t expect the same experience over every single laptop. But at the very least, it&rsquo;s a feature worth exploring. You may be surprised at how good it is!</p>
