<p>This audacious drama has poisonings by prune, lesbian affairs, murders, orgies – and a family so monstrous they make the Borgias look like the Waltons. It is magnificent</p><p>For those of us who have gazed at our children and thought, “Miraculous fruit of my loins, blood of my blood, bone of my bone – how can I best monetise you?” Ladies, we have our answer. Mary Villiers, played with gorgeous relish by Julianne Moore, is here to show us the way.</p><p>Mary &amp; George is the tale of the former – born into 17th-century social nothingness – who uses the latter, her preternaturally handsome second son (played beautifully in all senses by Nicholas Galitzine), to secure the family fortunes in the most gloriously audacious manner. Based on The King’s Assassin, Benjamin Woolley’s nonfiction account of a family that makes the Borgias look like the Waltons, and written by DC Moore (Temple, Killing Eve), it is more fun than I can possibly tell you.

<p>Made with the blessing of Everard’s parents, this stomach-churning documentary about her murder doesn’t shy away from all the disturbing facts. It is both unbearable and heart-rattlingly urgent to watch</p><p>We begin with Sarah Everard’s last moments in London. A CCTV video of the shop she went into on the way to a friend’s house for dinner. Doorbell camera footage of her walking home down a residential street. Finally, grainy film from a bus showing her in conversation with Wayne Couzens, the man who subsequently kidnapped, raped and killed her.</p><p>Some of the circumstances surrounding Everard’s murder were highly unusual: it is believed that Couzens, then a serving officer in the Metropolitan police, tricked the 33-year-old into getting into his car by convincing her she was being arrested due to a breach of lockdown-related restrictions. Yet, as this footage emphasises, many of them were also dreadfully ordinary. And which woman doesn’t walk the streets after dark,

<p>The drummers in the <em>Südkurve</em> beat out a tribal rhythm. Out on the pitch the players of Bayern Munich were unleashing wave after wave of feral attack, the crowd at the Allianz Arena swaying and baying along with them. And if you closed your eyes and tried not to think too hard, it was possible to imagine that these were other times, older times, better times. That everything was going to be all right in the end.</p><p>They’re not, of course. Bayer Leverkusen are running away with the league, coach Thomas Tuchel is off in the summer, and there’s a sound case for swilling out around a third of his underperforming squad with him. But still, the stolen glance at a truncated dream that dares to return their gaze. Bayern are still in the Champions League. They still have unfinished business and a front four you would wade through thick snow to watch. And they still have Harry Kane.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/05/bayern-munich-lazio-champion

<p><strong>New Wolsey theatre, Ipswich<br /></strong>With its irresistible harmonies, this comedy about a blood-guzzling plant has plenty to savour but it lacks satirical punch and menace</p><p>‘Feed me, Seymour!” Alan Menken and Howard Ashman’s 1982 comedy has so many catchy songs that you arrive hungry to hear them. Luckily this is a musical front-loaded with delights and its beaming rock’n’soul chorus, each member named after a 60s girl group (the Ronettes, Chiffons and Crystals), clearly knows how irresistible their harmonies are.</p><p>The trash cans on stage may suggest Oscar the Grouch’s Sesame Street but we are, of course, in New York’s Skid Row, where green-fingered klutz Seymour cultivates a blood-guzzling flytrap whose growing celebrity saves his boss Mr Mushnik’s wilting flower shop. A series of successively bigger puppets are used to portray the rapacious plant, named Audrey II after Seymour’s keenly admired co-worker. The first resembles a foam-and-felt Muppet a

<p>The artist was mostly known for his work in New York yet in the early 80s, he found a new kind of artistic output out west</p><p>After years creating street art, Jean-Michel Basquiat began his meteoric rise to fame in 1980 with a breakthrough exhibition as part of the Times Square Show. From there, the artist would go on to become the toast of the Big Apple, with a name-making profile in Artforum, his first sale going to the NYC punk icon Debbie Harry, and a budding creative and personal relationship with Andy Warhol. With so many ties to the New York art world, one could be forgiven for not knowing that Basquiat made as much as a quarter of his artistic output thousands of miles away in a sleepy California beach town.</p><p>In December 1982, Basquiat began living in Venice, California, at the invitation of the art dealer Larry Gagosian – today, one of the most influential figures in the art world, but at the time still a relatively young aspirant who had opened his first

<p>One of the most important British dramatists of the 20th century who was unafraid of taking on the establishment over censorship</p><p>The battle to remove censorship from the British stage was fought primarily at the Royal Court theatre in London during the mid-1960s. The plays of Edward Bond, one of the most important British dramatists of the 20th century, who has died aged 89, were an essential part of that story and that struggle.</p><p>Bond had submitted plays to George Devine’s recently established English Stage Company at the Royal Court in 1958 and, as a result, was invited to join the theatre’s Writers’ Group. His first performed play, The Pope’s Wedding, was given in a production without decor on 9 December 1962, and Devine then commissioned a new play, which Bond submitted in September 1964.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/mar/05/edward-bond-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Attention is turning to individuals and families as country confronts legacy of slavery and question of reparations</p><p>Eliana Alves Cruz and Branca Vianna grew up at a similar time in different neighbourhoods of Rio de Janeiro. But the two Brazilian women had very different experiences of their family history.</p><p>Cruz, 57, was always surrounded by elderly relatives, yet struggled to get them to recount stories about the men and women who had preceded them. In contrast, Vianna remembers the omnipresent figure of her grandmother’s great-grandfather, who died in 1868. There was even a painting of him hanging in the family home where Vianna, now 61, spent her holidays as a child.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/05/black-brazilians-white-family-history">Continue reading...</a>

Cruz smouldered in a chic black polo neck and discreet diamonds, Pitt twinkly eyed in an open-necked white shirt. They gazed into each other’s eyes, flirted a little, and then – how could either of them resist? – embarked on a clandestine affair.</p><p>Well, almost. Cruz was, in fact, sitting demurely in the front row in a leather skirt suit, and Pitt was not in attendance. The rendezvous was on a short film, made for the show and screened above the catwalk, a remake of a seminal scene in Claude Lelouch’s Un Homme et Une Femme, a classic Gallic romance about a widow and widower falling in love which won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes festival in 1966.

But doing nothing was not an option</p><p>When I was nine, my oldest friend nearly choked to death on a gobstopper. We had snuck out of my back garden to get sweets, a girl gang of four, hopping over a low wall and armed with enough pennies for at least one treat each. In the end, probably copying each other, we had bought gobstoppers – white terrazzo boiled sweets with a chewing-gum centre that took plenty of licking to get to. We were having an excellent time until, halfway home, my friend started to cough – and then choke.</p><p>Her face went red, her eyes looked panicked and she started to wheeze. We called for help, but no one was around, apart from some boys we had made fun of on the way to the corner shop. They ignored our cries.

Now she wants change</p><p>On a bleak Monday in February, Sabitra Bhandari set off to warm up as soon as the coach made the sign. The clock was nearing the hour mark at the Stade Jean-Pierre Delhomme in the outskirts of Bordeaux and, just two days after signing for Guingamp, Bhandari was set to make history.</p><p>And so it happened. Samba, as she’s called by everyone back home, became the first Nepalese player – male or female – to play a European top-flight fixture, coming on in the 76th minute. It was a giant leap for the South Asian nation, whose direct footballing connection with Europe is limited to a few managerial tenures, youth trials, and reported interest in young footballers who ultimately do not make the move. “I always had that dream to play in Europe,” the 27-year-old tells Moving the Goalposts. “Now is the time to prove myself, put those dreams to reality by doing we

Voters in many states filed lawsuits arguing that Trump was constitutionally disqualified from the presidency, under section 3 of the 14th amendment, having committed treason against the United States when resisting by force the peaceful transfer of presidential power. The Colorado supreme court agreed. Trump and his lawyers responded by waving numerous constitutional technicalities that they claimed exempted traitors from constitutional disqualification, while barely making any effort to refute charges that the former president committed treason on 6 January 2021.</p><p>On Monday, all nine justices on the US supreme court agreed that Donald Trump should remain on the presidential ballot even if

Besson himself might contend that box office success is in any case the sole criterion for assessing groove. At all events, this bizarre and macabre drama-thriller is watchable and Caleb Landry Jones gives an oddly engaging performance as Douglas Munrow, a wheelchair-using “Dogman”, questioned by police psychologist Evelyn (Jojo T Gibbs) after being arrested in full drag gear, smeared with blood, while at the wheel of a van filled with his “babies” – his dogs.</p><p>Murrow’s conversation with Evelyn reveals in flashback a childhood kept in a dog kennel by an abusive father, at whose hands a terrible injury was sustained; then there are poignant teen years in a children’s home where his eyes are opened to poetry by a Shakespeare-loving drama s

Except at a crucial point, two-thirds into the film’s 168-minute running time, the fly turns the camera on herself when she finds out she too has cancer, just like several of the people she’s been filming.

<p>Iron Maiden, Fatboy Slim and Grimes have all made music inspired by Frank Herbert’s 1960s sci-fi epic. So what makes ‘Dunecore’ different to other interpretive genres? </p><p>Harry Potter might have “wrock” (AKA “wizard rock”), Doctor Who fans “trock” (“Time Lord rock”) and Star Wars “jizz” (don’t ask) but you could argue that few works of sci-fi or fantasy have influenced the history of popular music as much as Dune. Since the novel’s release in 1965, countless huge artists, from Iron Maiden to Grimes, have released songs or entire records inspired by Frank Herbert’s epic tale of war, colonialism and human morality. Although the book is particularly beloved fodder for 70s and 80s prog musicians, its influence has leached into everything from underground pop to Fatboy Slim’s No 2-charting 2001 hit Weapon of Choice, with successive generations finding new ways to reinterpret Herbert’s images of monstrous sandworms, blue-eyed freedom fighters and superhuman nuns through musi

But Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, an effervescent comedy about the world’s most famous doll that wraps up a zingy dissection of the patriarchy, women’s lack of power and mortality in a bright bow, is not your standard blockbuster. And that’s exactly why it deserves that best picture Oscar.</p><p>Meryl Streep wasn’t being hyperbolic when she credited Barbie for saving the film industry and “all of our jobs” at this year’s Palm Springs film awards.

<p>Proposals to build a cable car to access the retreating glacier have sparked a debate about the future of this low-key resort loved by ski tourers</p><p>There’s nothing like scrambling along a jagged granite ridge resplendent in russet and lime-green lichen, when it should be covered in snow, to remind you that the climate crisis is in full swing. My guide, Maxant Danilo, and I are at an altitude of more than 2,500 metres in the Hautes-Alpes, but even though it’s late January, conditions on south-facing slopes such as these feel more like late spring. Our snowboards are strapped to our backpacks instead of our feet.</p><p>Danilo, who works for a guide collective based in nearby La Grave, tells me the resort actually had one of the strongest starts to a winter season in recent years, with plenty of snow and low temperatures from November until the middle of January.

But just when Gabriele’s treatment had progressed to the stage where her eggs were about to be retrieved they hit an unexpected hurdle.</p><p>In February, Alabama’s Supreme Court made a ruling in a case in which embryos in an IVF clinic were accidentally destroyed.
