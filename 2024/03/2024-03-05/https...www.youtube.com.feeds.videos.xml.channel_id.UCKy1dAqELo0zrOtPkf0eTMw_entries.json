Hideo Kojima saw Sony\u2019s latest box office disaster, Madame Web, and had this to say on Twitter: \u2018Saw Madame Web at the theater.\u2019And with that, you can likely assume the famed video game maker didn\u2019t necessarily have a good time at the theater. This is kinda in typical Kojima fashion when it comes to commenting on movies that didn\u2019t necessarily resonate with him. He\u2019s done the same with The Marvels film, only sharing with his audience that he saw it in IMAX. And don\u2019t think that Kojima just doesn\u2019t have a way with words; he had all this to say about The Killer movie and said this about Avengers Endgame. He\u2019s also done so for various other movies he appreciated, like Pacific Rim, calling that movie the ultimate otaku film and an inspirational love letter. But when it comes to Madame Web, Kojima\u2019s one sentence merely confirms that the current movie he\u2019s seeing is in theaters", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/5wvCuOogPTM/hqdefault.jpg", "comments": [], "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "language": null, "source_obj__id": 149, "age": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0}, {"tags": [], "page_rating": 0, "bookmarked": false, "permanent": false, "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW019lHAtbA", "date_published": "2024-03-05T00:00:43+00:00", "user": null, "title": "OG Star Wars movies had commercials IN THEM in Chile in 2003 #starwars #movie #memes #commercial", "vote": 0, "artist": "IGN", "album": "", "description": "", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/XW019lHAtbA/hqdefault.jpg", "comments": [], "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "language": null, "source_obj__id": 149, "age": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0}]
