<p>The first time I ventured out into the vast open land of Dragon's Dogma 2, I was accompanied by my three companions as we followed a lead on a missing young boy, suspected to have been dragged off by a pack of wolves. As I pursued the trail, my crew and I fought off a gang of thieves, sliced our way through banshees, discovered treasure, and battled a giant troll on the edge of a cliff that eventually fell to its death. None of these occurrences were at all related to one another, nor did they pertain to the lost boy that set this journey in motion. Instead, this thread of distinct events emerged naturally and set the tone for the world of Dragon's Dogma 2. The long-awaited sequel is a giant open land where danger looms around every corner in <em>all</em> shapes and sizes, and regardless of your quest, there's always the chance a cyclops could unravel your best-laid plans by picking you up and hurling you into the ocean.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on the three hours I played at

<p>Madame Web star Dakota Johnson has responded to the negative reaction to her recent big superhero movie. Speaking to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/entertainment/dakota-johnson-teatime-book-club">Bustle</a>, she said she was not surprised critics didn't like the movie. She said she saw the writing on the wall based on how the movie was produced.</p><p>"It's so hard to get movies made, and in these big movies that get made--and it's even starting to happen with the little ones, which is what's really freaking me out--decisions are being made by committees, and art does not do well when it’s made by committee," she said. "Films are made by a filmmaker and a team of artists around them. You cannot make art based on numbers and algorithms."</p><p>Johnson went on to say that she believes audiences are "extremely smart," despite what some movie executives might say. "Audiences will always be able to sniff out bullshit. Even if films start to be made with AI, humans aren't going

<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown earned overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics when it launched earlier this year, but it's not exactly standard AAA fare from a big studio like Ubisoft. The game took a big risk by forgoing 3D action in favor of becoming a side-scrolling metroidvania. The Lost Crown is one of the best metroidvanias in recent years, but it's also one of the few pricey ones at $50.
