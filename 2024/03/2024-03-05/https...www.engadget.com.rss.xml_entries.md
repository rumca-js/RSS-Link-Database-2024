<p>A group of lawmakers have <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/press-releases/gallagher-bipartisan-coalition-introduce-legislation-protect-americans-0">introduced </a>a new bill that would force ByteDance to sell TikTok in order for the app to remain available in the United States. The “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act” would prohibit US app stores and web hosting services from distributing TikTok unless it divested from parent company ByteDance.</p>
<p>The bill is the latest in a long line of attempts by lawmakers and other officials to ban or force a sale of the app. Former President Donald Trump attempted to force <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-executive-order-bytedance-divest-tiktok-010440540.html"><ins>a sale</ins></a> of TikTok in 2020, but  was ultimately unsuccessful.

<p>Microsoft is pulling the plug on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-154014628.html">Android apps for Windows</a>. The company said it’s ending support for Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA), the underlying component behind the Amazon Appstore (and other Android apps) in Windows 11. Microsoft told Engadget it was responding to “evolving customer needs.”</p>
<p>Microsoft first said in 2021 that Windows 11 would be able to run Android apps. When it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-android-apps-update-available-release-date-191055347.html">arrived the following year</a>, users could install the Amazon Appstore, and some individual Android apps were found in the Microsoft Store. The rollout was viewed as an answer to the dual threats of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-26-google-pixelbook-review.html">Android apps on Chromebooks</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323-140050246.html">

<p>Microsoft will reveal the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 on March 21, according to a report. This isn't likely to just be a matter of a hardware refresh, however. Microsoft is expected to call these systems its first AI PCs, as <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/surface/exclusive-microsoft-will-unveil-oled-surface-pro-10-and-arm-surface-laptop-6-this-month-ahead-of-major-windows-11-ai-update"><em>Windows Central</em></a> notes.</p>
<p>The devices are set to be equipped with new Intel Core Ultra or Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite-based processors that feature the latest neural processing units (NPUs) to boost AI capabilities. They're said to approximately match the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-preview-m2-chip-130006105-130006112.html">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-14-inch-and-16-inch-review-an-m3-chip-for-every-situation-140048075.html">MacBook Pro</a> in terms of efficiency and performance.</p>

<p>Amid complaints that its search results have declined in quality, Google is <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-update-march-2024/">tweaking</a> its algorithms to do a better job of weeding out spammy or automated content. The company says the ranking updates, arriving in May, will “keep the lowest-quality content out of search.” Of particular note, Google says its engine will be better at eradicating today’s automated (read: AI-generated) content that’s harder to spot.</p>
<p>Google says it’s taking what it learned from a 2022 algorithmic <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/more-content-by-people-for-people-in-search/">tuneup</a> to “reduce unhelpful, unoriginal content” and applying it to the new update.

<p>Yes, you can get a good laptop without spending thousands of dollars. Not everyone wants (or needs) to spend a boatload on their next notebook, and depending on how you plan on using it, you might be better off with a cheap laptop anyway. As with most affordable tech, the key in getting the right machine for you is understanding what you need your laptop to do and the sacrifices you can make to save a bit of cash. Best of all, you may find that you don’t need to sacrifice as much as you thought to get a good laptop at a great price.

<p>Apple has rolled out updates for many of its operating systems and none are more impactful than the changes to iOS — at least in the European Union. With the arrival of iOS 17.4, Apple is adhering to strict new rules in the bloc when it comes to the App Store. Apple now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pple-details-how-third-party-app-stores-and-payments-will-work-in-europe-183931334.html">officially supports third-party app stores</a> on iPhones in the EU, while developers can offer third-party payment options. Web browser makers no longer need to base their apps on Apple's WebKit, while Apple is opening up the NFC chip to wireless payments that have nothing to do with Apple Pay.</p>
<p>While those game-changing updates are limited to the EU, iOS 17.4 does have some snazzy new features for folks elsewhere too. Apple Podcasts now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-podcasts-will-automatically-generate-transcripts-in-ios-174-091040750.html">offers automatic transcripti

<p>The deadline for compliance with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) is this Thursday and <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/complying-with-the-digital-markets-act/">Google just dropped a document</a> outlining exactly what changes it has made (or will make) to keep up with the law. These 20+ adjustments vary in scope, and impact search users, advertisers and third-party app developers.</p>
<p>One of the big search changes will be the inclusion of price comparison results from external aggregators when looking up things like flights or hotels. For example, searching Google for a one-way to Paris typically pulls up a module called the Google Flights unit — that's the company's own internal pricing aggregator. Competitor aggregators, like Kayak and Tripadvisor have been vocally displeased to have Google stomping around in their backyard <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/oukin-uk-itasoftware-google-idUKTRE69P3WY20101026/">for over a

According to <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/warner-bros-discovery-max-password-sharing-crackdown/"><em><ins>The Wrap</ins></em></a>, the company's CEO and president of global streaming and games JB Perrette said at a conference that the account sharing crackdown will start later this year ahead of a more widespread effort in 2025.</p>
<p>The aim, of course, is to improve Max's bottom line. WBD doesn't make any money when a user lets someone else use their Max account. As of the end of 2023, WBD had 97.7 million subscribers across Max, Discovery+ and HBO on cable. That was an increase of 1.8 million from the previous quarter.</p>

<p>Computer manufacturers are finally catching up to the remote-work trend and including better built-in webcams in their laptops and desktops. But it’s not practical to upgrade your PC just to look better on video calls; this is where external webcams come in handy. Not only can they help you put your best face forward during work Zoom meetings, but they can also improve your experience whilst chatting with friends and family across the world, or level-up your live-streaming game. And even if you do have a new machine with a 1080p webcam, there’s a good chance that you’ll only get the level of customization you need for Twitch or YouTube streams from a separate webcam. We’ve tested a number of the best webcams available today that support 1080p, 2K and 4K resolutions to find out which are worth your money and solidify our top picks.</p>

<p>Apple has upgraded the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-announces-new-macbook-airs-with-m3-chips-132810766.html"><ins>13 and 15-inch MacBook Airs with the M3</ins></a> and a few new bells and whistles. But while I expected the company to keep the M1 around as its budget option, it swapped it out for the base model M2. Someone at Cupertino’s going to regret that, because the M2 Air is, despite its limitations, a damn fine machine. I don’t know if anyone needs the added performance the M3 Air provides, but I do know you can’t afford to ignore the base model M2.</p>
<p>Historically, Apple has kept a MacBook below a thousand dollars to hook price-sensitive buyers. A grand is a lot to spend on a machine if you’re broke, especially if there are cheaper low-end Windows machines (even if they are crap). Even then, the $999 MacBook is the “cheap” option, and Apple will hobble it just enough to upsell you to the $1,200 model it really wants you to buy.</p>

<p>Oregon is set to become the latest state to pass a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-right-to-repair-movement-won-its-biggest-victories-in-2023-143010331.html">Right to Repair</a> law. The Oregon House of Representatives passed the <a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2024R1/Measures/Overview/SB1596">Right to Repair Act (SB 1596)</a> on March 4, two weeks after it advanced from the Senate. It now heads to Governor Tina Kotek's desk, who has five days to sign it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/californias-right-to-repair-bill-is-now-californias-right-to-repair-law-232526782.html">California</a>, Minnesota and New York have similar legislation, but Nathan Proctor, the <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/release-oregon-legislature-passes-right-to-repair-bill/">Public Interest Research Group's Right to Repair Campaign</a> senior director, calls Oregon's legislation &quot;the best bill yet.&quot; (It's worth noting that Colorado also has its own Righ

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/passkey-support-is-finally-available-in-1password-193723385.html">Passkey availability</a> has been on the rise and is only continuing to grow. The latest example comes from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-password-manager-134639599.html">1Password</a>, the aptly named password manager, which has announced support for passkeys on Android devices. Now, anyone using a phone or tablet with Android 14 or higher can access 1Passwords's passkeys right on their device's apps. Last September, the company made passkeys available on iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 devices, along with browsers such as Chrome and Safari.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/passkeys-passwords-authentication-security-133024414.html">what is a passkey</a> anyway? Unlike a password that someone can guess or potentially obtain in a hack, passkeys consist of public and private keys. The public key belongs to whatever site an account is made with, while the privat

<p>Over-ear, noise canceling headphones tend to offer the best balance of sound quality, noise blockage, reliable Bluetooth connections and extra features that you can get in the headphone space. But just because a particular pair of cans ticks all of the boxes doesn’t mean it will look, sound and feel just as good as another; some companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-wh-1000xm5-anc-headphones-are-just-280-right-now-104013435.html">Sony</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review-function-meets-fashion-140015467.html">Bose</a> and others lead the pack. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/topics/reviews/headphones/">Engadget reviews dozens of headphones</a> every year and we test out even more to keep our finger on the pulse.

<p>Skullcandy just announced new earbuds that go all-in on sustainability. The EcoBuds True Wireless earbuds are made with 65 percent certified recycled plastics and 57 percent less heavy metals than competing products. This gives the earbuds a 50 percent lower carbon footprint when compared to rival devices.</p>
<p>The bad news? The move toward sustainability forced Skullcandy to nix the usual battery case that accompanies modern earbuds, as lithium battery packs are a <a href="https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/renewable/environmental-impacts-of-lithium-ion-batteries/"><ins>major environmental offender.</ins></a><ins>&nbsp;</ins>To make up for the lack of a charging case, the new earbuds can be charged from a smartphone, in addition to any USB-C port or outlet. The earbuds still get eight hours of use before requiring some juice.</p>

<p>The creator of a popular Nintendo Switch emulator, Yuzu, appears to have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/makers-of-switch-emulator-yuzu-quickly-settle-with-nintendo-for-24-million-203204698.html">agreed</a> to settle Nintendo’s lawsuit against it, less than a week since the games company accused the emulator’s creator of “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-lawsuit-accuses-switch-emulator-creators-of-piracy-at-a-colossal-scale-093157736.html">piracy at a colossal scale</a>.”</p>
<p>A joint final judgment and permanent injunction filed Tuesday says developer Tropic Haze will pay the games company $2.4 million — along with a long list of concessions. The people behind Tropic Haze must halt all “activities related to offering, marketing, distributing or trafficking in Yuzu emulator or any similar software that circumvents Nintendo’s technical protection measures.” No more emulating, then. It must even surrender the emulator’s web domain (including any variants) to Ni

This year, the term you’ll probably hear the most is AI PCs, that is, computers with neural processors designed to speed up AI tasks. While it’s not necessary for you to buy a laptop just for the sake of AI this year, it’s a good thing to keep an eye on for future-proofing as more companies bring the likes of Microsoft’s Copilot or ChatGPT to their systems. Some notebooks even have dedicated Copilot buttons on the keyboard to make it easier to summon generative AI help.<br /><br />Even if you’re willing to wait out the AI hype while you s

<p>The battle between AI chatbots is more than a two-horse race. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anthropics-chatgpt-rival-claude-can-now-analyze-150000-words-in-one-prompt-201033756.html">Anthropic</a>, the company formed by several ex-OpenAI employees, claims its new Claude 3 language model outperforms ChatGPT and Google's Gemini in several key industry benchmarks. It even hit "near-human" levels on some tasks, the company <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family">wrote in a blog</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three new chatbots under the Claude 3 umbrella, including Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. Sonnet powers the <a href="https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=%2F">Claude.ai chatbot</a> and is offered for free with an email sign-in. Meanwhile, Opus is the largest and most powerful LLM and will be available with a $20 per month subscription via the "Claude Pro" service. It's also multi-modal, so it can work with both text and image inputs, unlike past versions.</p>
