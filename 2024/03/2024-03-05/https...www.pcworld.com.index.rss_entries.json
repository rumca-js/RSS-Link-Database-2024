Not only do monitor arms provide you with more options to move and position your displays around your desk, but they also free up space on your desk surface, leaving it open for other uses. Plus, they help your setup look cool, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only catch is the price. Most monitor arms worth buying will set you back close to $200, and heavy-duty arms are even pricier. However, if you buy a good monitor arm, you&rsquo;ll likely never need to replace it. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to buy the right monitor arm the first time so you&rsquo;re left feeling like you got your money&rsquo;s worth. To that end we&rsquo;ve put several popular monitor arms through their paces to figure out which are truly worth your money.

Suddenly, your boss requests a video chat. Do you scramble to turn off Spotify? Two years ago, sure. But not now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;re probably used to thinking of AI in terms of AI art, or chatbots, or how AI blurs or filters out your background on video calls on Teams or Zoom. But AI audio filtering has now become so sophisticated that you can literally play music in the background, and your laptop will filter it out entirely. We tested it to make sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;re probably unaware of this, because it&rsquo;s the people you talk to that hear your voice, and not you. And you shouldn&rsquo;t expect the same experience over every single laptop. But at the very least, it&rsquo;s a feature worth exploring.
