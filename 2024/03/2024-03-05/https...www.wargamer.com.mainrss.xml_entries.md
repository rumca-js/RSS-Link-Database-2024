								<p>Crusader Kings 3: Legends of the Dead essentially adds two main features to the medieval rulership simulator: Plagues and Legends. Plagues are pretty much perfect, as they are in Crusader Kings 2: no notes. Legends are a really great idea, but their implementation feels a little under-baked.
