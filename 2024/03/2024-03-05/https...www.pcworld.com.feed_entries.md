<p>Most computers and storage drives still use the common SATA or PCIe 3.0 interfaces to sling your bits of data around, but if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to own a relatively modern PC, you might be able to upgrade to a solid-state drive (SSD) built on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3400176/pcie-40-everything-you-need-to-know-specs-compatibility.html">insanely fast PCIe 4.0 protocol</a>.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve tested several PCIe 4.0 SSDs and the best one to cross our labs thus far is the&nbsp;Solidgm P44 Pro&nbsp;in a field of tough contenders thanks to ferociously fast speeds only rivaled by next-gen PCIe 5.0 SSDs. </p>

<p>Some recent reports indicate that Nvidia is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-discontinues-geforce-gtx-16-gpus-the-end-of-gtx-series?__cf_chl_tk=NiSKsDAEzsLeOrPX34jjuHsRxzoUpCDtvSKflcXInMg-1709654072-0.0.1.1-1791&amp;xcust=2-1-2256110-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">finally, truly done making GTX graphics cards</a>, with the last GTX 16-series cards leaving the fab. Seven years after the company followed up its incredibly successful GTX 10-series with the rebooted RTX branding, how has the PC gaming landscape changed? Did ray tracing make the splash that Nvidia hoped for? PCWorld&rsquo;s Keith May is here to answer those questions in his latest video essay on our YouTube channel. </p>

<p>Say what you will about the latest iteration of the Xbox, but for my money Microsoft has some of the best and goofiest merch of the generation, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1421222/bundle-up-your-cold-controller-in-a-tiny-adorable-xbox-hoodie.html">a tiny hoodie for your controller</a> or an <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MDZ5QQZ?ascsubtag=2-2-2256031-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X-shaped mini-fridge</a>. The latest special edition of the console itself is a great example. To celebrate the launch of <em>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2</em>, Microsoft is releasing a Series X bundle with the visage of Spongebob Squarepants printed on four sides of the notably square-ish game console. </p>



<p>I think it&rsquo;s a pretty ingenious use of the IP. One, Spongebob&rsquo;s famously s

<p>Google has revealed some new improvements in the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/02/release-notes-03-01-2024.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2255976-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">latest update</a> to its cloud service Google Drive. The playback of video files in your Drive will be faster, and it will be easier to sort and find all your files in the cloud.</p>



<p>Thanks to new transcoding in Google Drive, the transfer capacity can be adjusted to give you higher or lower resolution depending on your connection speed. With the update, video playback should also start faster from the moment you hit the Play button, and it shouldn&rsquo;t buffer as often. So far, these improvements only apply to new video files uploaded to Google Drive since the launch of the upd

## Why I never use frame rate counters for any serious gaming

<p>After recently installing a GeForce RTX 3070 graphics card in my desktop PC I decided to start running a frame rate counter whenever I played games like <em>WoW</em>, <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>. It&rsquo;s not something that I&rsquo;ve done much of in the past, but who could blame me&hellip; I mean, here I was staring down the barrel of more GPU power and quicker frames than I&rsquo;d ever had before, so it seemed a no brainer to see that new performance in action and compare the difference to my ageing GeForce GTX 1070 &ndash; a card that had more than earned its retirement.</p>



<p>Running the counter was really satisfying in the beginning &ndash; not only did seeing my frame rates hit 110 fps at 1080p (with ray tracing!) in <em>WoW</em> justify my decision to drop a cool $300 on an extravagant piece of hardware when I could have sun
