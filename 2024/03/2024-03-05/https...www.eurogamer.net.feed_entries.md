## Dragon's Dogma 2 feels like a perfect second try at the original - but could the "Isekai" theories be true?

What's surprising is in the brief time I got to speak with him I learned Hideaki Itsuno, Dragon's Dogma 2's director, felt exactly the same way. To him the original game is a flawed example of the dream game he's always wanted to create, which is why I assume he only spoke of Dragon's Dogma 2 with an infectious glee.</p><p>So much of what I experienced in the time I played Dragon's Dogma 2 gave me a very strange, but comfortable feeling of deja-vu. Have you ever gone back to play a game from your childhood, only to feel disappointed that it didn't look or play as well as you remembered? Dragon's Dogma 2 feels like the inverse of that sensation: as if I'm replaying the original ten years later, but i

Eight months after Warner Bros.' platform-brawler MultiVersus went dark, following an announcement its open beta would be shutting down until a return sometime in 2024, its social media account has sprung back to live, teasing an update announcement soon.
</p><p>
MultiVersus launched into Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC open beta back in July 2022, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mulitversus-has-already-welcomed-10m-players-to-the-brawl">got off to a flying start</a> - ratcheting up over 10m players in the space of a month. However, its player numbers rapidly dwindled and by the time developer Play First Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">pulled the game offline last June</a>, its Steam concurrent player count had fal

## Hades' acclaimed rogue-like action hits iOS via Netflix later this month

Hades, the acclaimed rogue-like dungeon-crawler from developer Supergiant - and by 'acclaimed', we're talking Game-of-the-Year levels of good here - launches for iOS as part of a Netflix subscription later this month, on 19th March.
</p><p>
Hades, the fourth game from Supergiant - following the studio's impressive Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre - charts protagonist Zagreus' attempts to escape the Underworld and reach Mount Olympus, all with a little bit of help from an entire pantheon of Greek gods.
</p><p>
It's an isometric action-adventure built around a wonderfully punchy combat system that follows the classic rogue-like template by offering handy permanent upgrades after an escape attempt fails, all in aid of helping Zagreus inch just a little bit closer to freedom each time.

## Warner Bros. focusing on mobile and free-to-play instead of "volatile" AAA console games

Warner Bros. Discovery gaming boss J.B. Perrette wants the company to move away from the "volatile" market of AAA games for consoles.
</p><p>
Speaking during a recent <a href="https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1658834&amp;tp_key=c33085d8d5&amp;language=en-us">Morgan Stanley event</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-wants-to-shift-away-from-volatile-aaa-console-games-lean-into-free-to-play-and-mobile/1100-6521597/">Gamespot</a>), Perrette said the company would combat volatility by focusing on its biggest franchises and bringing some to the mobile and free-to-play space in addition to live-service games. The aim is more consistent revenue.

## Cataclismo is a game of castle walls and terrible mistakes

Moonlighter's a straight-up dungeon crawler, until you crawl out of the dungeon with all your loot and have to face a far more terrifying foe than any monster you encountered in the depths: supply and demand. Moonlighter was a dungeon crawler, then, and also a game about stocking a shop and making a profit. Risk your life to find stock, and then return to the surface and try to find the right price for it. The horror!</p><p>So what's the twist with Cataclismo? My recent demo began in a dark autumnal woods. I'm controlling an archer, clicking to move them through forest paths between spectral, bronzing trees and dark abysses that make the whole thing feel very claustrophobic. Is this an action

## Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley review - it's just lovely

There are boutiques and galleries devoted to them. They're on our teacups and our beach towels. They're on plant pots by our windows and on the rough-papered covers of fancy Tove Jansson reprints stocking our libraries. It's not surprising that they've made it to video games, but it is surprising - to a moomin outsider, at least - to discover that the sort of thing that middle-class Southern idiots like me lap up so readily has a little bite to it. Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, a musical stealthy exploration game, is the best kind of surprise.</p><p>What kind of bite does the world of the moomins bring? Yesterday, I was wandering along in Moonminvalley taking Snufkin, the series' pipe-smoking philosopher, for a bit of a stroll. Beyond the rocks and trees we

Two brand new games will be available from day one. Lightyear Frontier is a farming sim using mechs to grow alien crops; while MLB The Show 24 is the latest in the baseball series.

Footage showing Free Radical Design's sadly-cancelled TimeSplitters project has surfaced online, revealing five minutes of gameplay.

A small team within Respawn are making a fresh game set in the Titanfall universe, it's been reported - but this project won't be Titanfall 3. 
</p><p>
We knew of this team already - and the fact it is being led by Titanfall and Titanfall 2 director Steve Fukuda - via an <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/01/vince-zampella-ea-star-wars-battlefield">Axios</a> interview with Respawn boss Zince Zampella earlier this year. 
</p><p>
Now, Giant Bomb's ever chatty reporter Jeff Grubb has stated this team is working on a "Titanfall game" set in the same universe as the series' first two entries - but stressed that this was not currently planned to be Titanfall 3.
