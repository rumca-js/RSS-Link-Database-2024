<p>Much is open-ended about this realist yet dreamlike exploration of midlife crisis and regret set in Vietnam</p><p>The question of what the title means, or what the movie means, remain open; even so, this is a quietly amazing feature debut from 34-year-old Thien An Pham, born in Vietnam and based in Houston, Texas. It’s a jewel of slow cinema set initially in Saigon and then the mountainous, lush central highlands far from the city; it is a zero-gravity epic quest, floating towards its strange narrative destiny and then maybe floating up over that to something else. It’s compassionate, intimate, spiritual and mysterious in ways that reminded me of Tsai Ming-liang or Edward Yang.</p><p>Inside the Yellow Cocoon Shell is presented in a calm, unforced realist style with many long, unbroken middle-distance shots, with closeups a rarity. There is a flashback and a dream-sequence presented in exactly the same way, leading to the woozy feeling that past and present, reality and rev

<p>The ‘enforcer’ role had looked like it was slowly being eliminated from professional hockey. Then a hulking New York Rangers rookie emerged</p><p>Near the start of the third period on Saturday night in Toronto, it finally – and inevitably – happened. Leafs’ tough guy Ryan Reaves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&amp;v=haExypciFWU">squared-off at centre ice with Matt Rempe</a>, the hulking New York Rangers rookie. Rempe, a 6ft 7in, 240lbs centre, has one goal and one assist in his first seven games in the NHL. He also has 37 penalty minutes, five more than he’s spent actually playing on the ice. He’s what most people would call an “enforcer” – a role that in recent years has been more or less phased-out of the NHL. That’s not to say there aren’t guys around still who are willing to drop the gloves or play a more physical than finesse game – every team has at least one. But what Rempe is doing is different.</p><p>Rempe has, so far, spent most of his time

<p>Amid a nationwide housing crisis, residents say 262 Fifth Avenue – a batch of condos for the wealthiest – is ruining the view downtown</p><p>Tom Clark’s Lower East Side apartment comes with a prime view of the Empire State Building. “I can see it from my couch,” he said. Well, he <em>used </em>to be able to catch a glance – before an ultra-thin luxury tower dubbed 262 Fifth Avenue came along.</p><p>Now the 860ft residential tower, which is still under construction, blocks the Empire State Building from most vantage points south of 28th street. Many New Yorkers (and tourists) can no longer catch a glimpse of the celebrated landmark, all because of some poorly placed – and incredibly expensive – condos.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/05/new-york-262-fifth-avenue-condos-empire-state-building-housing-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bowie’s 1999 album Hours… was the first to go on sale online before hitting regular stores – and his experimentation caused horror in the music industry</p><p>It is far from his best album, and not even his best album of the 1990s, but Hours... is David Bowie’s most significant album that decade. Not because of the music, however, but how it was released: the first album by a major artist on a major label to emerge as a download before it arrived physically.</p><p>Writing about the album in August 1999 ahead of its September release, Rolling Stone called Hours… a “cyber-coup”: a continuation of Bowie’s fascination with releasing music online, which he started with the Telling Lies single in 1996. He had also enthusiastically embraced webcasting and created his own internet service provider with BowieNet in 1998 “I couldn’t be more pleased to have the opportunity of moving the music industry closer to the process of making digital downloads available as the norm and not the
