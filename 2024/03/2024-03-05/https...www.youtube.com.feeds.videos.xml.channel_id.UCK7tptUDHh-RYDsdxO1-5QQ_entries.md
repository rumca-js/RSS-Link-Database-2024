China’s economy is teetering on the brink of widespread deflation—a scenario that could cause even more problems than high inflation. Economists are afraid that deflation is happening in China like it did in Japan’s recession in the 1990s.

WSJ looks at Japan’s “lost decade” to explain why China’s economy is struggling and what it means for the global economy.
