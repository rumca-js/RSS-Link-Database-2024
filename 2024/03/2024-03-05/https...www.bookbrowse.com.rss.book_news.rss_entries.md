Madeline McIntosh and Don Weisberg, who have served as CEO of Penguin Random House US and Macmillan, respectively, have joined forces with Nina von Moltke, most recently president and director of strategic development at PRH US, to form a new publishing company, Authors Equity. As its name implies, the publisher will operate outside of traditional publishing business models, offering no advances but paying authors a high percentage of a book's profits&#8212;a model used by some other types of hybrid publishers. 
Five of the company's investors are authors, including James Clear, Louise Penny, and Tim Ferriss.

A federal judge has formally adopted a magistrate judge's recommendation that a consumer class action lawsuit accusing Amazon of anticompetitive conduct in the e-book market be allowed to proceed. But in adopting the magistrate's recommendation, the court also officially dismissed all claims against the Big Five publishers that were initially accused of being co-conspirators with Amazon in a bid to fix e-book prices.
