According to the article, the National Election Commission (NEC) of South Korea detected 129 illegal AI deepfake posts over a 19-day surveillance period. Content included highly convincing deepfake video of candidates with altered speech or visuals, spread primarily through social media.

To make matters worse, says the piece, the relatively low sophistication and capacity of NEC’s deepfake monitoring system means there are probably many more <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/ele

		Cryptography plays a fundamental role in securing data within computer systems, particularly those involving biometric technologies. It ensures that confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of sensitive data, whether it’s processed locally at the edge or sent to cloud servers for further analysis and storage.

However, with the introduction of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/quantum-computing">quantum computing</a>, which has rapidly advanced in computational capabilities, present a significant threat to these cryptographic methods. Large-scale quantum computers have the potential to break several established cryptographic algorithms, including RSA and ECC, by solving the complex mathematical problems upon which their security relies.
