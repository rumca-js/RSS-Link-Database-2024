Microsoft has revealed the first wave of games coming to the Game Pass service in March. Today, you can play Warhammer 40K: Boltgun,a retro-styled shooter set in the Warhammer 40K universe. Later this month is PAW Patrol World and SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom—Rehydrated, you know, for the kids. IGN's 2019 Game of the Year, Control, is returning to the service, this time with all the DLC. If you finished Alan Wake II and want to explore more of the Remedy Connected Universe, Control should be your next game. Also coming are Lightyear Frontier in Game Preview, No More Heroes 3, and MLB The Show 24 (still kinda weird that a Sony-developed game is launching Day One on Game Pass). In other news, Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead has confirmed that mechs are coming shortly, and they can't come soon enough—terminids and automotons are pushing on both fronts and we need the reinforcements. And finally, Dead Cells and Diablo fans should be very

Expeditions: A MudRunner Game reviewed on PC by Luke Reilly. Also available on Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch.

"Expeditions: A MudRunner Game certainly isn’t a replacement for the supremely addictive SnowRunner, but its more untamed wilderness maps and huge truckload of exploration-focused missions do see it function as a very worthwhile complementary experience – despite some aggravating mission gating and a bit of an unfriendly map screen. Its unique brand of slow-paced bushwhacking won’t ever be for everybody, but successfully taking a truck on a trek through terrain that the toughest trailblazers would fear to tread is still an oddly satisfying challenge that proves the journey is always more important than the destination."

One of the goats in the video games industry recently updated his followers on his moviegoing experience. Hideo Kojima saw Sony’s latest box office disaster, Madame Web, and had this to say on Twitter: ‘Saw Madame Web at the theater.’And with that, you can likely assume the famed video game maker didn’t necessarily have a good time at the theater. This is kinda in typical Kojima fashion when it comes to commenting on movies that didn’t necessarily resonate with him. He’s done the same with The Marvels film, only sharing with his audience that he saw it in IMAX. And don’t think that Kojima just doesn’t have a way with words; he had all this to say about The Killer movie and said this about Avengers Endgame. He’s also done so for various other movies he appreciated, like Pacific Rim, calling that movie the ultimate otaku film and an inspirational love letter. But when it comes to Madame Web, Kojima’s one sentence merely confirms that the current movie he’s seeing is in theaters
