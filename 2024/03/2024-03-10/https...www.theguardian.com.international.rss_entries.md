<p>The Broad City alum leads the Better Things creator’s directorial debut that enjoyably refashions the rom-com for best friendship after kids</p><p>It’s a fact of life: eventually, we all grow up. Our priorities shifts; habits molt or harden; the tastes that seemed to define us change. Such maturity, or even just the novelty for new experiences after a period of time, came even for the fiercely shameless and stubbornly chaotic twenty-somethings of Broad City, the decade-defining Comedy Central series created by and starring Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson as two free-wheeling besties scrounging through New York. Since the show ended two seasons early in 2019, owing to the stars’ desire for new creative paths, Jacobson went on to create the acclaimed remake of A League of Their Own. Glazer reinvested in her standup career, and gave birth to a daughter, in 2021.</p><p>That experience clearly informed Babes, a new pregnancy comedy co-written by Glazer and Josh Rabinowitz, which

For most MPs, accustomed to the Palace of Westminster’s inward-looking spaces and rituals, the answer is obvious.

Except for very occasional referendums, periodic elections, voxpops and opinion polls, or perhaps the odd exchange with their MP, voters are not meant to be directly involved.

Now it’s dramatised in a new film</p><p>In 1958, 17-year-old Rose Dugdale was one of 1,400 young women who curtseyed before Queen Elizabeth II in the most prestigious event of the summer’s debutante season. It was the last time that the well-bred daughters of the most aristocratic and affluent families in the country would be presented to the monarch in a ritual that dated back 200 years. Princess Margaret, with characteristic hauteur, would later say: “We had to put a stop to it. Every tart in London was getting in.”</p><p>For the fiercely independent Dugdale, being presented to the queen was a means to an end.

<p>A collection of work by a giant of New York journalism is both a joy and a lesson, particularly on objectivity and its limits</p><p>For decades, Calvin Trillin has been one the most celebrated journalists in New York. This splendid collection of his pieces is filled with reminders of what makes him special: he is equally good at the serious stuff and “pieces meant to amuse”.</p><p>The press is the subject that knits these stories together. It occurred to Trillin that these articles “amounted to a picture from multiple angles of what the press has been like” since he entered the game. Many are from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. They provide the flavor of the glory days of print journalism, when newsstands were stuffed with magazines and papers written by giants like Murray Kempton, Molly Ivins and Edna Buchanan – and giants in their own minds, like RW Apple Jr – each of whom gets their due here, in Trillin’s 32nd book.</p><p>A veterinarian prescribed antibiotics Monday for a came

<p>Slowly, the days are getting longer and the garden is stirring to life. Now is the time to start sowing</p><p>Though March remains chilly, the return of the bright and gently warming sun wakes dormant plants and seeds from their slumber, coaxes birds out to build their nests and beckons to the insects that sheltered through winter in undergrowth, nooks and crannies to emerge and flit about in the cool sun. This is a period of preparation and renewal. The garden is stirring.</p><p>Most plants need at least 10-12 hours of light a day to grow well. As we emerge from the dark half of the year, in the days that follow Valentine’s the sun finally gives us 10 hours of light. This gradually grows to 12 as we arrive at the spring equinox on 20 March, when day and night are equal.

<p>The latest flop to make the papers was based, loosely, on Roald Dahl’s story about Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory</p><p>There is no joy quite so pure, quite so grand, as the joy that comes from picking over pictures of a failed “immersive experience”. Even typing the words makes me slightly delighted. In the past I have enjoyed reports from various British “winter wonderlands” where open-hearted families bought tickets for what promised to be a magical tour of Santa’s grotto but, upon entry, was revealed in fact to be a nightmare made of forks and cotton wool. A cardboard cutout of a reindeer would appear to be bleeding from the eyes, a child would be lightly maimed by a fallen star made of rust, that kind of thing – festive, fun and full of spirit. £35.</p><p>The success of these Christmas experiences was so great that the teams behind them needed to work out a way to spread the joy all year round.

<p>Moguls extol the fruits of artificial intelligence, but seek to hide its science from public view</p><p>In 1914, on the eve of the First World War, HG Wells published a novel about the possibilities of an even greater conflagration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/worldsetfreestor00well/mode/2up"><em>The World Set Free</em></a> imagines, 30 years before the Manhattan Project, the creation of atomic weapons that allow “a man [to] carry about in a handbag an amount of latent energy sufficient to wreck half a city”. Global war breaks out, leading to an atomic apocalypse. It takes the “establishment of a world government” to bring about peace.</p><p>What concerned Wells was not simply the perils of a new technology, it was also the dangers of democracy.

<p>A life-affirming spirit of joy and entertainment builds from noon at the beach bars and restaurants in this laid-back coastal town near Cádiz</p><p>Even the geology conspires to make Sanlúcar de Barrameda feel laid-back. Spain slows and drifts out peacefully in this coastal cul-de-sac of estuarine sandbanks, wide beaches and shallow rippling sea in the corner of the province of Cádiz. It certainly helps that there are no rocky cliffs and surfer waves, and that the thick sand keeps the beaches soundproofed and free from the rattling drawl of pebbles.</p><p>I live among uneven green mountains in the Sierra de Cádiz, so a visit to this flat expanse of navy blue and cream is tantamount to therapy.

<p>Preparation for a play is a notoriously private affair, as actors bond and experiment – and some even enjoy it more than performance. Here five actors and the director Richard Eyre share their experiences</p><p>Most of us have an indecent curiosity about what other people do in private. Sex and tax, for instance: “What do you do in bed?” and “How much do you earn?” are the questions that lurk under almost all profile journalism and biography. There’s a particular species of prurience that concerns the working habits of actors: what do you do in rehearsals?</p><p>I’m not immune to this prurience. Even when I was running the National Theatre I rarely witnessed more than fleeting fragments of other directors’ rehearsals. No one likes to be observed; rehearsals are a private province.

<p>The photographer celebrated for portraying his parents’ lives in a squalid council flat has fleshed out his seminal work, Ray’s a Laugh, with previously unseen images</p><p>Richard Billingham’s book <em>Ray’s a Laugh</em><em>,</em> documenting the life of his alcoholic father and his violent mother, Liz, in the Black Country council flat in which he grew up, became a landmark in British photography after it was first published in 1996. Billingham was then 26. He had intended the candid pictures of his chaotic home, with its menagerie of pets, its sense-overloading furnishing, its unhinged scenes of domestic squalor, to be studies for paintings he planned for his art degree course at Sunderland University. Instead, having been “discovered” by a tutor, the pictures took on a life of their own. Charles Saatchi included Billingham’s pictures of Ray, shirtless and swigging from beloved plastic bottles of home brew, and Liz, a confusion of outsize dresses and tattoos and unfinis

<p>A journalist’s impassioned and rigorous study of a 20th-century psychiatric hospital uncovers how Black Americans were institutionalised by a country still in thrall to the logic of slavery</p><p>At the beginning of this heartfelt, deeply researched inquiry into the history of mental illness in America’s Black population, journalist Antonia Hylton describes a regular meeting with a close relative in a park in Massachusetts. The relative – who does not want to be identified in the book – is suffering from a very specific paranoia: they believe that white supremacists are hunting them down.</p><p>The relative has, Hylton writes, “covered up all of their windows with black gaffer tape… unplugged all their electronics, convinced they were being watched through every screen”. The worst part of it, she suggests, was that her loved one believed that she, as a journalist – a reporter with NBC – was a passive part of the conspiracy; that she should call an editor and tell the story

<p>Mother’s Day can trigger painful memories for some, but a traumatic upbringing need not define us</p><p>At a recent dinner party I was asked about my mother, who – a gross simplification, this – was a bit of a character. I tried to paint a nuanced picture but our host, a qualified therapist, was having none of it. It ended badly, with her shouting at me: “Enough. Your mother was a monster!”</p><p>A not unreasonable diagnosis, given the facts. She sent me away to boarding school when I was three. When I was 13, she started telling me she had six months to live and kept telling me this, roughly every six months, for the next 15 years. Indeed, she once pretended to die in front of me. I’m still not sure why.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/10/my-mother-the-monster-and-how-i-came-to-understand-and-forgive-her">Continue reading...</a>

If we’re in south London, we’ll go to the North Downs. Then it’s home for berries, yoghurt and nuts.
