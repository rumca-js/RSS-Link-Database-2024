<p>This week James Maddison enjoyed going head to head against his Tottenham teammate Micky van de Ven in a darts challenge with elite players Michael Smith and Nathan Aspinall and the Spurs No 10 stepped up to the oche here to twist a cagey contest into their favour. By the end, however, Tottenham were able to revel in a comprehensive evisceration of 10-man Aston Villa.</p><p>When the fourth official, Darren Bond, indicated 10 minutes of second-half stoppage time, it spelled bad news for Villa, at that point 2-0 and a man down. Then Son Heung-min got in on the act, adding Spurs’ third in consummate style, and the substitute Timo Werner completed the rout, side-footing in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/10/aston-villa-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The opener has gone from living in a tent to breaking records and plays for an Indian Test side with frightening depth</p><p>You may, by now, have heard the origin story of Yashasvi Jaiswal, the 22-year-old Indian opener who has just crunched 712 runs in a series, the most inflicted on an England side by any Indian batter in Test history. No matter – it’s a tale that bears repeating. Jaiswal was just a slight and shy 10-year-old boy when he left his home district of Bhadohi, eastern Uttar Pradesh, with his father, and headed 1,000 miles south across India’s vast expanse to the bright lights of Mumbai in pursuit of a seemingly impossible dream – to make it as a professional cricketer in a country of 1.4 billion people where the game is revered as a quasi-religion.</p><p>His father left him with an uncle in Mumbai and headed back to the rest of the family. After just a few days the young Jaiswal left to live and work in a dairy shop before he seized the opportunity to live i

<p>Former sheep farmer Derek Gow is on a mission to rewild Britain. Having switched sides from team sheep, he wants to reintroduce its mortal enemy…</p><p>Across the River Wolf and along several miles of muddy Devon lanes lies Derek Gow’s lair. Inside a crepuscular barn filled with a pungent aroma, an imposing, bearded Scot sits surrounded by his collection of animal skulls, stuffed beavers, taxidermied badgers and birds of prey. A distinctive stench wafts from the head of an ibex mounted on the wall. The barn is badged as an education centre but it would terrify some visitors.</p><p>This gothic scene reaches its climax when – <em>bang!</em> – a shot is fired nearby. Gow looks relaxed. “She’s not shooting anything,” he says of his neighbouring farmer. “It’s a gas gun, trying to scare a bunch of complacent geese.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/10/derek-gow-the-rewilding-enthusiast-wants-to-bring-back-the-wolf">Continue reading...</a>

Leaving at the age of 15, he did national service and then trained at the Royal College of Art. His early works were critical to the definition of British pop art. In 1967, famously, he designed the cover for the Beatles’ <em>Sgt Pepper</em><em>’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>. In his varied career since, he has continued to develop an idiosyncratic and iconic style in paintings, collages, drawing and sculpture. He lives in Chiswick with his second wife, the artist Chrissy Wilson, to whom he has been married for 37 years.</p><p><strong>How does it feel to be showing what is effectively your first solo sculpture show at the age of </strong><strong>91</strong><strong>?<br /></strong>About 10 years ago, I was making a lot of very di

He returned to the White House a few hours later with all flags flying and the cheers of grateful (and relieved) Democrats ringing in his ears. Biden had survived what could easily have turned into a wake for his unpopular presidency. More than that, he had scored a personal mini-triumph which, for now at least, has boosted faith in his ability to win a second term.</p><p>The reasons so little was expected of Biden are not difficult to discern.

With its striking ‘x’ and the interpunct dot separating the two ls, it has something pictographic or runic about it, something ancient and mysterious, but also quintessentially Catalan and Mediterranean. That’s how the excellent dry white wines made from xarel·lo come across, too: the best are made from very old vines in the Penedès region not far from Barcelona and come with timeless, decidedly Mediterranean flavours, with a waft of fennel, thyme, chamomile, orange citrus and orange blossom, and a distinctive chalky and som
