AdeptiCon is less than TWO weeks away, and I have a LOT to get done. I'll talk about all that, the GAMA Expo I just returned from, and of course - I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made a 'zine! Check out SNARL at http://www.snarlingbadger.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
