And yes, I think I made a track I really loved. The vocals are, frankly, pretty amazing. I am really impressed with what came out! By the way, the service I used is Riffusion, which has changed quite a bit since I last used it. I think it's currently the best music generation AI out there, in terms of creative and sonic quality. And I'm sure it's getting better and better every day. \nSince I already remix stuff to make music here, I thought I'd try remixing an AI generated thing. Let me know if you enjoyed the track."}]
