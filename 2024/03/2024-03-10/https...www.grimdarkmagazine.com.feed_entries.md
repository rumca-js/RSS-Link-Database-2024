<p>Bob the Wizard, the debut dark fantasy by M.V. Prindle, is a raucous ride featuring Robert Caplan, or Bob, as his friends know him. Bob is a chain-smoking recovering alcoholic, a foul-mouthed ex-garbage man from Texas who will stop at nothing to avenge his family’s death. The novel opens with Bob in the aftermath of tragedy, his wife and son viciously murdered by a gray-skinned man known as Galvidon. Powered by nicotine and an unrelenting thirst for revenge, Bob chases the killer across the various worlds and slices of reality that make up the Astraverse, carrying nothing but a backpack, a pistol, and an enigmatic object called the Gatekey. This solar-powered Gatekey, which enables Bob’s world-hopping, had been gifted to him by a mysterious creature prior to his death. Somehow the Gatekey also seems to facilitate Bob’s communication with other intelligent beings wherever he goes. While Bob the Wizard features a fun cast of side characters, Bob himself steals the show. Grim
