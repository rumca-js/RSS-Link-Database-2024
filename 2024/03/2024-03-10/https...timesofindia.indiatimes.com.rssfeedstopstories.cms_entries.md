Trinamool Congress, led by Mamata Banerjee, unveiled its list of candidates for all 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal. Notably, retired star all-rounder Yusuf Pathan, formerly associated with IPL franchise KKR, is set to make his political debut as part of the lineup.

During discussions with the media, he also emphasized that the BJP-JJP alliance significantly contributed to his unease within the BJP.

This Friday marked a significant change, as the Tollywood pair was replaced by new faces for the Jadavpur and Basirhat constituencies, respectively, among the five sitting MPs undergoing a transition.

He asserted that such an alliance could materialize at any point until the withdrawal of candidatures.
