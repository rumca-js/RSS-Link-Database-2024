LoraWAN is a widely used low-power, long-range network that consists of sensors and gateways. I will provide you with an overview and a comparison of the currently available LoRaWAN gateways, as well as how to select them. Because most gateways use the same chips and should have similar ranges, I will not test it. Still, you will see big differences in capabilities, software, and price.
