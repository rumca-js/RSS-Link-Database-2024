A Chicago police detective receives a call that a serial killer has emerged in Scotland. The crime scenes match those of unsolved murders dating back nine years of five women who were brutally murdered in Chicago, one of which was his girlfriend. Summoned to consult, by Scottish chief superintendent Kessler, he travels to Scotland. 

Kessler assigns Lawson to work alongside local detective Glen Boyd to establish and confirm the possible link between all crime cases. Lawson embarks on a personal mission to solve the case that has torn him apart, and to rid his own demons by catching who was responsible for his loss. Progress takes a twist after Lawson’s retired Chicago PD partner, Walker who now resides in the UK, emerges with new evidence. 

Samuel L. Jackson, Vincent Cassel, John Hannah, and Kate Dickie star in Damaged, which will be released in theaters and on digital on April 12, 2024, by Lionsgate.

Alone in the Dark reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.

"Like a Louisiana voodoo priestess, Alone in the Dark is not without its charms, but its basic combat lacks the flexibility and function of Resident Evil 4, its inventive narrative is never as mind-bending as Alan Wake 2, its uninspired creature design can’t compete with Dead Space, and it’s not nearly as scary as any of them. Its central mystery intrigued me enough to lure me through its strand of imaginative settings all the way to its story’s end as Edward, and its puzzle design did feel consistently rewarding, but I was disappointed to discover that there wasn’t a substantial enough difference to make a repeat playthrough as Emily feel particularly worthwhile. While this remake is undoubtedly a step up from the three-decades-old original, Alone in the Dark fails to escape the shadows of the other contemporary survival horror titans that it helped spawn."
