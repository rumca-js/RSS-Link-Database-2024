Pirates make everything better, so if Blizzard's announcement that World of Warcraft now has a standalone battle royale mode isn't enough to get your tootsies twitching with excitement, then how about this: it's called Plunderstorm and is positively stuffed with piratical flair.
</p><p>
Plunderstorm arrives alongside World of Warcraft's 10.2.6 content update as a limited-time event accessible for the "next several weeks", and sees up to 60 players -either playing solo or as a Duo with a friend - scouring the Arathi Highlands to locate abilities, upgrades, and loot in a bid to be the last pirate standing each 10-15 minute match.
</p><p>
"Discover lootable spells, abilities, and upgrades as you plunder treasure chests and defeat enemies," Blizzard explains in its <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/e

Stardew Valley's long-awaited 1.6 update - which creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone at one time warned wouldn't "be huge", a comical assertion in hindsight - is finally here on PC, and it's accompanied by some an absolutely gargantuan patch notes.
</p><p>
Barone confirmed he was working on a 1.6 update for Stardew Valley <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-patch-16-is-on-the-way">back in June 2022</a>, but warned fans it would be relatively modest in scope and 'mostly modding-focused'. As time has gone on, however, and more features have been teased by Barone, it's become increasingly obvious 1.6 has grown considerably more ambitious than was initially planned.
</p><p>
It's only now, though, with 1.6's arrival - and the release of its <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-update-full-change

PlayStation's former head of internal game production Connie Booth, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-confirms-departure-of-veteran-exec-connie-booth-after-more-than-30-years">departed Sony last October</a> after nearly three decades, has joined EA to to oversee its action-RPG portfolio.
</p><p>
During her tenure at Sony, Booth worked on a roll-call of famous PlayStation franchises, including Jak and Daxter, Sly Cooper, Ratchet &amp; Clank, inFamous, Resistance, Uncharted, The Last of Us, and Marvel's Spider-Man. At the time of her departure, former God of War and Twisted Metal game director David Jaffe claimed Booth had been fired amid internal tensions relating to PlayStation's increased focus on live service games under <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">ou

## Overwatch 2 heroes won't be locked behind a battle pass starting in Season 10

Blizzard is overhauling the way it introduces new  heroes into Overwatch 2 starting in Season 10, by making them free and immediately available to all players instead of locking them behind the game's premium battle pass or a progression grind, as was previously the case.
</p><p>
That's according to Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller, speaking in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H998wgSQm3M">new developer update</a> video. Starting with the introduction of Overwatch 2's next hero, Venture, in Season 10, all heroes be free at launch, and that change is retroactive, meaning all previously released heroes will also be immediately available to players, no battle pass required.
</p><p>
The only requirement is players must first complete Overwatch 2's tutorial, if they haven't already done so, in order to unloc

## Spec Analysis: PlayStation 5 Pro - the most powerful console yet

The machine is real, it is coming relatively soon - and by and large, the leaks are accurate. The question is, what are the design objectives of the new console? What is less than ideal about the current PS5 and how will the Pro model address that? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-do-we-actually-need-ps5-pro-or-xbox-enhanced-consoles-this-generation">We're on the record</a> as saying that this generation doesn't really need a mid-gen upgrade, but does the state of recent games and the extra power and capabilities of the mooted Pro change our opinion?</p><p>First of all, let's address the authenticity of the leaks we've seen thus far, which essentially operate on two levels.

In fact, he seems to be amused by her attempts to drug him with a laced projectile.

Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has discussed the company's strategy of experimenting with generative AI, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-unveils-generative-ai-neo-npcs-and-the-spirit-of-peter-molyneuxs-milo-lives-on">detailed in today's announcement of NEO NPCs</a> - a new prototype project from Ubisoft designed to let video game characters respond with custom responses to players' speech input.
</p><p>
Speaking at a press briefing for the NEO NPC project held at GDC this week in San Francisco, attended by Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell, Guillemot likened Ubisoft's experimentation with generative AI to some of its other early bets on emerging technology, like Xbox's camera Kinect and Nintendo's motion-controlled Wii. 
</p><p>
Asked whether Ubisoft was sometimes <em>too</em> early with taking up new tech, Guillemot responded:

Roblox Studio has announced a new generative AI-based character creator. Graphics card manufacturer Nvidia unveiled a new AI-powered chip, sending its stock price skyrocketing. And behind closed doors, Ubisoft demonstrated something of its own to a small collection of the press: a partnership with Inworld AI to create a prototype for "Newly Evolving NPCs", or NEO NPCs as Ubisoft calls them.</p><p>It's important to stress the "prototype" factor here. At the event, Ubisoft gave a brief presentation explaining the origins of its research team - led by Ubisoft Paris and a supporting Ubisoft Production Technology crew - and its goals, often referring to the project as an

Flat2VR Studios is a new developer dedicated to turning flatscreen games into VR experiences.
</p><p>
The studio was born from the Flat2VR community, comprising modders who have created unofficial VR versions of games like Half-Life 2 and Doom, which have received millions of downloads.
</p><p>
The team is working on its first licensed VR game port, though the title remains a mystery for now. It's tentatively planned for late 2024 or early 2025 on "major VR platforms".

For example, there will be optional widescreen HUD support and 60+ fps interpolation,

## Alone in the Dark review – a perfunctory romp that doesn't quite live up to the hype

That's the word that springs to mind when I think back to the games I used to play &ndash; Alone in the Dark among them &ndash; as a kid. Along with the fixed camera angles and tank controls were the bugs and the glitches and all that lovely jank, as much a part of survival horror's storied beginnings as Resident Evil's "itchy tasty" memo.</p><p>Pisces Interactive's reimagining of 1992's Alone in the Dark adopts its inspiration's dark story and even fixed cameras at times, but it also preserves &ndash; unintentionally, I suspect &ndash; the jank. In fact, there's no part of this modern Alone in the Dark remake that's jank-free &ndash; combat, puzzles, sound, script; you name it. For some, it'll feel like an integral part of Alone in the Dark's experience that'll only add to its appeal. For others, it'll be an insta

"The beautiful thing about what Black Panther did was it essentially showed there can be heroes that look like me," says Abubakar Salim. "The feeling I had when watching was I wish I had this when I was a kid, because it shows to me, as an actor, I don't have to be the best friend of the cop, or the buddy character. I can actually be a hero.
</p><p>
"If this game has that same effect to audiences and to players and developers, then great. We're doing a good thing. I want to go for that."
</p><p>
Salim is perhaps best known as the voice actor of beloved Assassin's Creed: Origins protagonist Bayek. Now he's jumping into the world of game development with Tales of Kenzera: Zau. On the surface it's a Metroidvania inspired by the Bantu Tales of African myth with a dash of the sort of Afrofuturism seen in Black Panther. Beneath that, it
