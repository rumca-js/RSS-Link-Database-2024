Love sacrificed. Love unrequited. Love forbidden by social mores or bad timing or the tectonic forces of history. Think Casablanca. Brief Encounter. In the Mood for Love. The Age of Innocence. Moonlight. Considered another way, though, they’re powerful because they end so pristinely, before the banal hassles and petty fissures of everyday life make a mess of things. Give a relationship enough time and Before Sunrise turns into Before Midnight.</p><p>One of the reasons why Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, now 20 years old, ranks among the best love stories of the 21st century is that it makes the unique argument that failure is an essential, precious part of romantic experience. It’s only human to want that pain to go away,

Even before being packed off to boarding school, he was largely raised by nannies, in the remote aristocratic manner of the time. Lonely and vulnerable at his prep school, Maidwell Hall, which he describes as rife with schoolboy bullying and savage ritual beatings from masters, he was easy prey for the false comfort offered by a matron who he says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/mar/17/earl-charles-spencer-a-very-private-school-interview">sexually abused him</a> from the age of 11. Later, he lost his virginity at 12 to a sex worker.</p><p>It’s the kind of story that if he’d been born to a struggling single mother on a council estate would arguably have prompted a speedy referral to social services, and when the now Earl Spencer started writing out these memories

<p>East Yorkshire artist Mandy Barker has found a way to make us look again at pollution – cataloguing fibres from fast fashion in the style of a Victorian book about British algae</p><p>When Mandy Barker stumbled upon a fragment of colour in a&nbsp;rock pool while&nbsp;walking near Spurn Point, East Yorkshire, in 2012, she was bewitched. “I thought it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;piece of seaweed with lovely colours on it – greeny-browny – but when I&nbsp;went to pick it out, I saw that it&nbsp;was&nbsp;actually a strip of clothing material,” she says.</p><p>Growing up on the Yorkshire coast, Barker had become used to the coastline she once walked to collect driftwood shells changing around her.&nbsp;“Over the years I saw TVs, fridge freezers and computers washing up on the beach,” she said. “Fishers there told me they could see trawlers out at sea visibly dumping waste into the ocean. People would pay these trawlermen to take their rubbish out and dump it. And the fish were getting&nbsp

<p>The battle between ‘true fans’ and ‘plastics’ weakens the ties between supporters and their inclination to unite and organise</p><p>Leaving early is a bit of a red flag. Booing your own players, obviously. Wearing a half-and-half scarf, purchasing a half-and-half scarf, expressing any opinion of a half-and-half scarf short of pathological hatred: forget it. Fake merch. Supporting a club from a place where you do not live. Supporting more than one club. Getting fewer than 10 out of 15 on a multiple-choice clickbait quiz.</p><p>Yes, these days there are multiple ways of outing yourself as that most abhorred of footballing species: “not a true fan”. Who gets to call themselves a football fan? Ostensibly this is a church open to all who want to believe, and yet somehow the very idea of fandom is constantly being challenged and contested, revoked and downgraded. English football has more words to describe ersatz fans than real ones: “plastics” and “casuals”, “fakes” and “frauds

<p>Crisp hake fillets with clams basted in a power-packed sauce of chorizo and dry sherry – let everyone dig in straight from the pan</p><p>Today’s recipe epitomises the vibrant spirit and rustic charm of so much Spanish cooking. I’ve always cherished the incredible power that food has to unite people, and to infuse gatherings with warmth and joy. This dish, a big favourite of my mother’s, uses succulent hake fillets and hearty clams, all bathed in a flavourful chorizo and sherry sauce. It’s essentially a tribute to Spain’s rich coastal traditions, but it also blends the earthiness of the land with the freshness of the sea, creating a glorious chorus of flavours. Perfect for sharing, it captures Spanish conviviality and the simple pleasures of a meal cooked with love.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/mar/19/hake-clams-chorizo-manzanilla-recipe-jose-pizarro">Continue reading...</a>
