In this video I discuss how Apple added post quantum encryption to their message app.  iMessage is still proprietary, and still only works on Apples proprietary hardware, so while iMessage with PQ3 is technically more secure than Signal messenger, it requires you to put a great deal of trust in Apple which still makes it a less private and secure messaging app in comparison to open source alternatives.
