Back to Basics: Forwarding References - How to Forward Parameters in Modern C++ - Mateusz Pusz - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

This talk is a part of the Back To Basics track and provides the introduction to Forwarding References. During the talk, we will learn why those references are so important that they got a special name and how to use `std::forward` with them. We will put a lot of effort into understanding when we are dealing with them in the source code, and when it is not the case. We will also try to answer the question if they really deserve a "universal reference", as some people call them, and see how they may improve the overload set we write. Finally, we will learn about potential pitfalls they may introduce and how to handle them.
