With such a high influx of releases, it often happens that the lesser known titles crumble under the weight of the heavily anticipated IPs. \n\nBut every now and then, there comes a game that challenges this notion by turning out to be a surprise hit that no one really expected. We are talking about games like Helldivers 2, Hi-Fi Rush, and Palworld and many more. With this video, we will be counting down 15 such games that came out of nowhere but instantly caught the love and attention of hundreds of thousands of fans."}, {"title": "Outcast: A New Beginning Review - A Disappointment", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjw3iskf8kg", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/Qjw3iskf8kg/hqdefault.jpg", "date_published": "2024-03-19T06:15:01+00:00", "dead": false, "artist": null, "page_rating": 94, "comments": [], "language": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "source_obj__id": 129, "page_rating_contents": 94, "vote": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "age": null, "tags": [], "bookmarked": false, "user": null, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "album": "", "description": "Outcast \u2013 A New Beginning is a follow-up to what is widely considered to be one of the first fully-3D open world games to have ever been released, the original Outcast back in 1999. As a modern video game release, Outcast \u2013 A New Beginning boasts an impressive new jetpack that hopes to give new life to the act of exploration in a massive open world.\n\nWhile the combat and traversal in Outcast \u2013 A New Beginning can be a lot of fun, especially thanks to the unique approach to weapon customization and the jetpack, the game is filled with archaic design decisions that can be frustrating. Even the story feels incredibly badly done, despite having some characters that ooze charm and sincerity."}]
