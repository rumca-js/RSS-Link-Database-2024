Singapore, a city state around the same size as New York City, has built one of Southeast Asia’s most advanced militaries. Despite being at peace with its neighbors, Singapore’s defense budget was over $11 billion in 2022, ranking it per capita among the highest in the world. 

Singapore has ordered 20 F-35 jets and its navy is increasing its number of submarines to eight, more submarines than both its larger neighbors Malaysia and Indonesia combined. 

WSJ takes a closer look at why this small nation is pouring billions into its armed forces.
