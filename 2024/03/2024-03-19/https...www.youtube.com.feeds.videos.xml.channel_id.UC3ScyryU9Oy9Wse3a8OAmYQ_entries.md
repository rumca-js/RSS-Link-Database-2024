In late 2011, nearly nine years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq under President George W. Bush, U.S. troops left the country while President Barack Obama was in office. In “The Rise of ISIS,” FRONTLINE correspondent Martin Smith examined how Iraq began coming apart after the American withdrawal, probed the Obama administration’s Iraq and Syria policies, examined mistakes and miscalculations that enabled the terror group’s rise, and explored what it meant for the U.S. to return to Iraq starting in 2014 as ISIS seized wide swaths of territory there and in Syria.
