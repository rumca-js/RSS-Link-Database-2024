<p>This not only pertains to Venture, a new hero created for season 10, but all of the game’s previously released heroes, like Mauga, Illari, Sojourn and Lifeweaver, among many others. New players will still have

<p>Replacing a smartphone every two years is partially why <a href="https://weee-forum.org/ws_news/of-16-billion-mobile-phones-possessed-worldwide-5-3-billion-will-become-waste-in-2022/">billions</a> of phones go into landfills each year. If stacked flat atop one another, that many handsets would reach farther than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/looking-back-at-25-years-of-the-iss-173155049.html">ISS</a>. But we’ve become accustomed to that 24-month time frame because wireless carriers often push an upgrade on biennial contracts, and many smaller phone makers <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/phone-update-policies-1658633/">only offer</a> software support for two years. But now, with longer software commitments from major manufacturers, along with growing right-to-repair legislation, many newer phones can stay in our pockets for closer to seven trips around the sun. Here’s how you can extend the lifespan of your smartphone and avoid shelling out hundreds before

<p>NVIDIA’s H100 chips are used by nearly every AI company in the world to train large language models hooked into services like ChatGPT. It’s been great for business. Now, the company is ready to make those chips look <em>terrible</em>, announcing a next-generation platform called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-gpus-powered-the-ai-revolution-its-new-blackwell-chips-are-up-to-30-times-faster-001059577.html">Blackwell</a>.</p>
<p>Named for David Harold Blackwell, a mathematician who specialized in game theory and statistics, NVIDIA claims Blackwell is the world’s most powerful chip, reaching speeds of 20 petaflops compared to just 4 petaflops the H100 provided. Yeah, throw it in the trash. You need new chips.</p>
<p>And if you didn’t know how powerful NVIDIA is, its press release for this new platform includes quotes from the CEOs of OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla — yes, all CEOs you probably know the names of.</p>

<p>I'm a notebook lover and have been for most of my life. I've had dozens over the years, serving as safe places for me to dump story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. But at a certain point, I turned away from physical notebooks because it became easier to save all of those things digitally in various apps that were always available to me on my phone. Today, people like me might be served well by E Ink tablets. They can combine the feeling of writing in a regular notebook with many of the conveniences of digitized documents. Plus, many of them come with an included stylus, an accessory you have to pay extra for when buying a standard slab. Unfortunately, though, E Ink tablets are nowhere near as ubiquitous as general tablets — but there are just enough of them now to make deciding which is right for you more complicated than you might think. We tested out seven different E Ink tablets to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and w

<p>Logitech is expanding its Mevo lineup of live-streaming cameras for creators. The company’s new Mevo Core shoots in 4K, meaning, unlike the 1080p Mevo Start <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mevo-start-3-pack-tiny-powerful-multicam-streaming-studio-133046416.html">we reviewed two years ago</a>, cropping and digital zooms won’t lead to overly grainy video. However, the tradeoff is pricing, as the new model will set you back three times as much for a three-camera setup.</p>
<p>The Mevo Core continues the lineup’s trajectory of wireless multicam live-streaming directly to platforms like YouTube, Twitch and Facebook. (Of course, you can also record content to upload later.) The $999 package ships as a body only, although Logitech says it will sell lens bundle kits through Amazon and B&amp;H Photo Video. Either way, you’ll need at least one <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-15-micro-four-thirds-future-interview.html">Micro Four Thirds (MFT) lens</a> to get started,

<p>In less than two years, NVIDIA’s H100 chips, which are used by nearly every AI company in the world to train large language models that power services like ChatGPT, made it one of the world’s <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-becomes-the-third-most-valuable-us-company-at-alphabets-expense-123503967.html">most valuable companies</a>. On Monday, NVIDIA announced a next-generation platform called Blackwell, whose chips are between seven and 30 times faster than the H100 and use 25 times less power.<br /><br />“Blackwell GPUs are the engine to power this new Industrial Revolution,” said NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang at the company’s annual GTC event in San Jose attended by thousands of developers, and which <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/liveplexio/status/1769843150598930587?s=20">some compared</a> to a Taylor Swift concert. “Generative AI is the defining technology of our time.
