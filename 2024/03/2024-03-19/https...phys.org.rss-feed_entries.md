Cape lions used to roam the Cape Flats grassland plains of South Africa, in what is now known as Western Cape Providence. When Europeans arrived in South Africa in the mid-1600s, Cape lions, along with many other African carnivores and herbivores, were hunted as agricultural practice to protect livestock and humans. By the mid-1800s, less than 200 years since European arrival, Cape lions had been hunted to extinction.

When plastic ends up in the ocean, it gradually weathers and disintegrates into small particles. If marine animals ingest these particles, their health can be severely affected. Large accumulations of plastic can therefore disrupt the biological balance of marine ecosystems. But which areas are particularly affected?

Light can compute functions during its propagation and interaction with structured materials, with high speed and low energy consumption. Achieving universal computing using all-optical neural networks requires optical activation layers with nonlinear dependence on input. However, the existing optical nonlinear materials are either slow or have very weak nonlinearity under the natural light intensity levels captured by a camera. Therefore, the design and development of new optical activation functions is essential for realizing optical neural networks that compute with ambient light.

As a major driving force of evolution, polyploidy (genome duplication) is ubiquitous across different evolutionary stages of the flowering plant tree of life. However, the interactions between the ancestral genomes in a polyploid nucleus, often involving subgenome dominance, have been poorly understood.

Today, the word "quantum" is everywhere—in company names, movie titles, even theaters. But at its core, the concept of a quantum—the tiniest, discrete amount of something—was first developed to explain the behavior of the smallest bits of matter and energy.

## Climate change graphics are important—make them simple, say experts

When the "hockey stick" graph, which illustrated a steep increase in global temperatures, was published in 1998, it reshaped the world's understanding of climate change. A quarter-century later, with climate change now wreaking havoc around the world, graphics depicting global warming are more important than ever to inform policymaking.

## Is food waste the key to sustainable, plastic-free diapers and sanitary pads?

Once thrown away, disposable items such as diapers and sanitary pads can take hundreds of years to decompose, because their absorbent parts and waterproof layers contain plastics and other synthetic polymers. But now, researchers are replacing these materials with porous components made from protein biomass that is often discarded by the food and agricultural industries. These components are sustainable and biodegradable, and could potentially allow future diapers and sanitary pads to be flushed down a toilet or used as fertilizer.

## Molecular crystal motors move like microbes when exposed to light

At first glance, Rabih O. Al-Kaysi's molecular motors look like the microscopic worms you'd see in a drop of pond water. But these wriggling ribbons are not alive; they're devices made from crystallized molecules that perform coordinated movements when exposed to light. With continued development, Al-Kaysi and colleagues say, their tiny machines could be used by physicians as drug-delivery robots or engineered into arrays that direct the flow of water around submarines.
