Data is scattered, and we need to leverage it as training data where it exists.</p><p>This paradigm is nothing new. I was playing around with it in the 1990s. What\u2019s old is new again\u2026 again. Federated learning allows for the collaborative training of machine learning models across multiple devices or servers, harnessing their collective data without needing to exchange or centralize it.
