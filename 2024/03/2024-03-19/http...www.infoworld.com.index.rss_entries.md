<p>Federated learning marks a milestone in enhancing collaborative model AI training. It is shifting the main approach to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3214424/what-is-machine-learning-intelligence-derived-from-data.html">machine learning</a>, moving away from the traditional centralized training methods towards more decentralized ones. Data is scattered, and we need to leverage it as training data where it exists.</p><p>This paradigm is nothing new. I was playing around with it in the 1990s. What’s old is new again… again. Federated learning allows for the collaborative training of machine learning models across multiple devices or servers, harnessing their collective data without needing to exchange or centralize it. Why should you care? Security and privacy, that’s why.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3714680/a-change-in-the-machine-learning-landscape.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></

<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709489/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">Large language models</a> (LLMs) seem ideal for creating <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3398696/what-is-natural-language-processing-ai-for-speech-and-text.html">natural language interfaces</a>, but the rise of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689172/chatgpt-and-software-development.html">ChatGPT</a> and other similar tools has raised a question: Are LLMs right for optimizing business processes?</p><p>In short, the answer is a resounding “yes.” Of course, the longer answer is more nuanced than that. The stand-alone utility or prowess of an LLM is relatively limited unless paired with other technologies. The true impact of AI lies in its ability to facilitate the acceleration of business processes through automation.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3714621/how-llms-can-help-streamline-business-process

Many companies were able to continue only because their workforce could work productively remotely. Some companies, notably tech companies, even thrived. One could argue that Zoom itself kept us from a complete economic disaster.</p><p>Working remotely was good in all kinds of ways. Many people really liked it.
