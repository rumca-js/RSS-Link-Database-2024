It\u2019s a direct continuation of X-Men: The Animated Series, a show that holds a special place in a lot of fans\u2019 hearts. X-Men: The Animated Series introduced mutant heroes like Wolverine and Cyclops to a much bigger audience, winning legions of fans thanks to those colorful characters and a nonstop dose of mutant soap opera.\n\nTo celebrate the release of X-Men \u201897, let\u2019s take a step back to explore why the original cartoon was so influential, and how it continues to influence the X-Men franchise even today. Cue up the theme song\u2026\n\nX-Men '97 features the voices of \u00a0Cal Dodd, Lenore Zann, George Buza, Catherine Disher, Chris Potter, Alison Sealy-Smith, Adrian Hough, Christopher Britton, Alyson Court, Lawrence Bayne, and Ron Rubin.

Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.\n\n\"Like a Louisiana voodoo priestess, Alone in the Dark is not without its charms, but its basic combat lacks the flexibility and function of Resident Evil 4, its inventive narrative is never as mind-bending as Alan Wake 2, its uninspired creature design can\u2019t compete with Dead Space, and it\u2019s not nearly as scary as any of them. Its central mystery intrigued me enough to lure me through its strand of imaginative settings all the way to its story\u2019s end as Edward, and its puzzle design did feel consistently rewarding, but I was disappointed to discover that there wasn\u2019t a substantial enough difference to make a repeat playthrough as Emily feel particularly worthwhile. While this remake is undoubtedly a step up from the three-decades-old original, Alone in the Dark fails to escape the shadows of the other contemporary survival horror titans that it helped spawn.\""}, {"title": "Hi-Fi Rush - Official PS5 Launch Trailer", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlDlUmmaj6w", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/nlDlUmmaj6w/hqdefault.jpg", "date_published": "2024-03-19T13:35:10+00:00", "dead": false, "artist": null, "page_rating": 94, "comments": [], "language": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "source_obj__id": 149, "page_rating_contents": 94, "vote": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "age": null, "tags": [], "bookmarked": false, "user": null, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "album": "", "description": "Hi-Fi Rush is an action hack-and-slash rhythm game developed by Tango Gameworks.
