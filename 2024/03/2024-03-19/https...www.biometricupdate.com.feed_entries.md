		The Philadelphia Phillies are promoting facial recognition ticketing to all of the main entrance gates at Citizens Bank Park following a successful debut as a pilot project last year.

Major League Baseball is introducing its Go-Ahead Entry program, a top prospect in biometric ticketing and access control, to all stadiums league-wide during the 2024 season.

Fans submit a selfie through the MLB Ballpark app and enter at gates where Go-Ahead Entry is implemented without showing a ticket or their phone. The service was <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/philadelphia-phillies-lead-off-facial-recognition-access-pilot-for-big-league-baseball">first deployed</a> to the first base gate at Citizens’ last year, and expanded to the third base gate duri

		The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has thrown out decisions in favor of CPC Patent Technologies over <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/assa-abloy">Assa Abloy</a> and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/hid-global">HID Global</a> because the rulings introduced new terminology. Patent lawsuits against Apple's Secure Enclave will take place in Texas after the company's request for location transfer was rejected.
<h2>Rulings against Assa Abloy, HID vacated</h2>
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has thrown out decisions that found that Assa Abloy and HID Global failed to show that two biometric patents from CPC Patent Technologies were unpatentable.

		The U.S. government has posted an AI roadmap for the Department of Homeland Security, outlining algorithm initiatives and how they will protect Americans.

DHS officials say theirs is the most detailed such document of any federal agency. That may be, but what is certain is that the document hits most of the must-dos for any organization hoping to create ongoing innovation and responsible use.

There’s even a couple surprises in the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/24_0315_ocio_roadmap_artificialintelligence-ciov3-signed-508.pdf">24-page document</a>.

One of the examples provided of how the Department currently uses AI is the use of bio

The use of biometrics as an identification tool is not new; it dates back to ancient times when fingerprints were used as signatures and seals. Application in payment technology is what makes it revolutionary. However, there is a gap between expectations and reality.

Since 2010, there has been an acceleration in this trend, primarily in the use of smartphones, while the fintech sector is still in the testing phases today. Although skepticism is strong in France, some pla

The decision does not signal a promising courtroom strategy for defendants caught in Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/bipa">Act</a> so much as it will be seen as a cautionary tale for plaintiffs.
