<p>An independent regulator could act in the best interests of a sport in which too much power and wealth has accrued at the top</p><p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/05/sportandleisure.sport">The Football Man</a>, his acclaimed 1960s portrait of the national sport, the writer and journalist Arthur Hopcraft wrote that “the way we play the game, organise it and reward it reflects the kind of community we are”. Viewed from the present, that is quite a depressing thought.</p><p>England’s football family is an unequal, fractious and divided one right now. Booming broadcast revenues, the success of the Premier League and the legacy of an anything-goes approach to club ownership have channelled enormous power and wealth to the top of the domestic game, but created deep insecurity elsewhere. Despite having <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/68580692">signed</a> a record £6.7bn domestic television deal in December, Premier League clubs continue to re

<p>At first taste, they seem like duds. But give them a chance – as with difficult music or strong cheese – and they might they grow on you</p><p>Some wines are satisfying from the first sip. There are reds that are immediately smooth, silky, velvety: attracting adjectives associated with luxuriant comfort and ease. Whites that are dubbed refreshing, mouthwatering, bright: wines with an immediate, thirst-quenching drinkability that keeps you coming back, unthinkingly, for more. Then there are wines that make you wonder if something has gone badly wrong. Wines that feel awkward, uncomfortable, or even trigger your gag reflex.</p><p>But if some, perhaps even most wines that we hate at first taste are irredeemable, unlovable duds, there are others that might just go on to be those we love the most. They’re part of a category of wine we might call “challenging” or “extreme”. As with a difficult piece of music that can eventually bring a bigger and more lasting emotional payoff th

Nobody tells you just how explosive those bowel movements can be.</p><p>Eventually, after much complaining, I came to the sheepish realisation that people <em>do</em> tell you this stuff.

Temperatures across much of England have topped 40C for eight days running: they peaked at 46C, and remain above 30C in cities and large towns at night. The country’s poorly insulated homes feel like furnaces, and thousands of people have resorted to camping out at night in the streets and local parks in a desperate attempt to find sleep. Hospital A&amp;Es are overwhelmed and wards are flooded with patients, mostly old and vulnerable people who have succumbed to dehydration and heatstroke.

It’s a universe entirely populated by anthropomorphised animals; no humans and no dialogue.

Their story is laced with comedy, tenderness, loneliness and friendship; in truth, it’s probably a bit too slow for most under-10s.

<p>People have long drawn comparisons between ant societies and human ones – but in fact they are a reminder of how limited our influence on the world really is</p><p>It is a familiar story: a small group of animals living in a wooded grassland begin, against all odds, to populate Earth. At first, they occupy a specific ecological place in the landscape, kept in check by other species. Then something changes. The animals find a way to travel to new places. They learn to cope with unpredictability. They adapt to new kinds of food and shelter. They are&nbsp;clever. And they are <em>aggressive</em>.</p><p>In the new places, the old limits are missing. As their population grows and their reach expands, the animals lay claim to more territories, reshaping the relationships in each new landscape by eliminating some species and nurturing others. Over time, they create the largest animal societies, in terms of numbers of individuals, that the planet has ever known. And at the borders
