In our first Amazing Digital Circus theory, we concluded that the main characters are all digital copies of their brains. But brains hold A LOT of information, around 2.5 MILLION GB of information. And since this show is meant to take place in the 90’s, the best commercial hard drive at that time could only hold 1GB at a time. Sounds like Caine needs to start investing in quite a few hard drives!
