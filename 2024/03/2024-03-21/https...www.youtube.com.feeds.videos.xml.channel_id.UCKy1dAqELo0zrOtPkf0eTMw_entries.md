In today's Daily Fix:
Dragon's Dogma 2 isn't even officially out yet, and players are already planning to kill as many NPC's as they can in the name of a better frame rate. The game is apparently very demanding, even on the beefiest of PC's, with frame rates dipping to 30fps when playing on RTX 4090 cards and modern CPU's. But by killing off non-essential NPC's, players could get a better frame rate as the CPU wouldn't have to devote resources to help render them. Capcom is already working on a solution, but until then, maybe keep multiple saves if you accidentally off a character you need for a side quest. In other news, the U.S. Department of Justice is suing Apple over monopolistic practices, and this could impact how you game on your iPhone. Apple is notorious for not letting third-party marketplaces and streaming services that don't adhere to their strict rules, which keeps something like Xbox Game Pass officially off iOS devices (but workarounds are common).

Halo Season 2, reviewed by Hayden Mears. Narrated by Erik Adams.

Halo Season 2 is indeed a step-up from its predecessor, but the show's chronic inability to manage its many disparate threads, coupled with its pervasive hollowness, continues to work against it. The acting remains a highlight, even if most of the main cast don’t get nearly enough to do. But while stunning action and high stakes may keep these 8 episodes watchable, Halo’s character mismanagement, unfocused plotting, and lack of emotional resonance make it an underwhelming sophomore outing.

MLB The Show reviewed by Justin Koreis on PlayStation 5. Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

Hank Aaron’s motto was “Always keep swinging,” and MLB The Show 24 does just that. It continues to push the envelope for what a baseball sim can be by adding a deep respect for the history of the sport on top of its already excellent gameplay. Season 2 of the Negro leagues is off to a fantastic start, and I can’t wait for the next episode to drop. The addition of women to that and Road to The Show emphasize Sony San Diego’s commitment to the idea that baseball is for everyone. With great new features like Custom Game Entry in Franchise, and seamless integration of Major League Baseball’s latest changes, not even a lackluster Storyline and a Diamond Dynasty mode in flux can change the fact that this is a great way to play baseball.

Streetwise but struggling, Clarence (LaKeith Stanfield) is trying to find a better life for himself and his family, make himself worthy to the woman he loves, and prove that he’s not a nobody. Captivated by the power and glory of the rising Messiah and His apostles, he risks everything to carve his own path to a divine life, a journey through which he finds redemption and faith, power and knowledge.

The Book of Clarence is a bold new take on the timeless Hollywood era Biblical epic. The film is produced by Jeymes Samuel, Shawn Carter, James Lassiter, and Tendo Nagenda. It is executive produced by Garrett Grant. The Book of Clarence features new music by Jeymes Samuel, JAY-Z, Lil Wayne, Kid Cudi and more.

The Book of Clarence, written and directed by Jeymes Samuel, opens in theaters on April 19, 2024.

Princess Peach: Showtime! reviewed by Logan Plant on Nintendo Switch.

Princess Peach: Showtime! is more closely aligned with Kirby and Yoshi’s simple, cheery romps rather than Mario’s polished platformers and Luigi’s haunted mansions. There’s fun to be found in the Sparkle Theater, as these delightfully simplified takes on some of gaming’s most popular genres are entertaining to blast through, and the whimsical stage play aesthetic gives Peach’s game an identity all its own. I’m also thrilled that Nintendo is finally giving Peach another crack at her own solo outing after nearly two decades, and I hope this is the start of an ongoing spinoff series within the wider Mario universe. Some noticeable performance issues and the frustrating lack of a chapter select means I won’t be returning for an encore, and I wish there were a few extra levels to lengthen the somewhat brief campaign, but Nintendo and Princess Peach at least know how to put on a good show.

Rise of the Ronin reviewed by Will Borger on PlayStation 5.

Rise of the Ronin marries a cool historical setting, Team Ninja’s mastery of tough-but-fair combat, and some smart RPG design to make a game that is immediately compelling, and even more fun with friends. It’s full of cool little touches, whether it’s throwing something at an enemy with the grappling rope or dropping from your glider onto your horse. Unfortunately, it’s also a game full of map clutter, bloated systems, and a truly absurd amount of junk loot, and the time I spent clearing out everything that didn’t spark joy and dealing with all these non-essential systems made me pine for a leaner, meaner, more focused game. Rise of the Ronin is excellent when it has the courage to be itself and lean into its challenging, rewarding fighting; too often, however, it feels stuck in indecision, torn between what it wants to be and what it feels it’s expected to be, and not even the best samurai can overcome that.

In today's Fix of entertainment news:
Disney is experiencing some internal turmoil lately, with a group of investors trying to oust current CEO Bob Iger. But, just like Thor arriving in the nick of time in Avengers: Infinity War, George Lucas has appeared on the scene in defense of Iger. In news probably only boomers and Gen X-ers care about, Popeye and The NeverEnding Story are getting rebooted. Popeye was already attempted in live-action before, starring Robin Williams, so we're not sure it needs to be tried again. At least The NeverEnding Story is aptly named. And finally, we've got some very cool-looking character posters for the upcoming season of House of the Dragon.

Capcom returns with their most ambitious title yet in Dragon's Dogma 2 which releases on PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC this week. They reached for more than the moon with its RE Engine. From its inception it was focused on high quality visuals, high performance on consoles and PC but mainly within a linear and atmospheric world. Here the team have pushed all the dials to maximum but this has a big impact on those targets. With our IGN Performance Review we put consoles and PC under the microscope and see just what it takes to run this game at 60fps or higher and if the Xbox Series S can stay the journey.
