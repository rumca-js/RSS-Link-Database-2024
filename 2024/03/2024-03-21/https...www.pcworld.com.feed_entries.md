<p>AMD on Thursday introduced AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.1 (FSR 3.1), an improved version of its FSR3 frame-boosting gaming technology that AMD said will be available in 40 games, both available now and coming soon.</p>



<p>The new FSR 3.1 technology adds a &ldquo;Native AA&rdquo; mode, as well as a very subtle though interesting tweak: AMD has decoupled FSR 3.1&rsquo;s upscaling capability from frame generation, meaning that it&rsquo;s possible that AMD&rsquo;s FSR could be tasked to pair with Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS or Intel&rsquo;s XeSS graphics technology, too.</p>



<p>AMD has already added FSR 3 to titles like <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora,&nbsp;Farming Simulator 22, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, REMNANT II, Starfield</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part I</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Thaumaturge</em>.&nbsp;It will be added to 21 upcoming games, in

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to think that all USB-C cables are the same, and that manufacturers are only claiming to be superior in order to jack up the price. After all, it&rsquo;s <em>just a cable</em>, right?</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s completely understandable, but not always accurate. We at PCWorld have tested a ton of USB-C cables and can say with certainty not all of them are made the same. In fact, there can be huge performance differences among cables when it comes to both charging and transferring data.</p>



<p>Hands-on evaluation of numerous cables ranging from the biggest, most-recognizable brand-names to the cheapest of the cheap has revealed some clear winners, which I highlight below.</p>

<p>Microsoft announced the Surface Pro 10 for Business and the Surface Laptop 6 for Business on Thursday, as expected. But what differentiates these new Surfaces from earlier models is that these new laptops actually feel like they were designed with businesses in mind &mdash; and the Surface Pro 10 is perfect if you&rsquo;re coming down with spring fever.</p>



<p>Microsoft is accepting orders for both devices today, with shipments beginning April 9. Prices begin at $1,199 for both. Consumer versions of the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 are likely due in May. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2269179/microsoft-signals-a-second-surface-ai-event-for-may.html">Microsoft has scheduled a second event</a> just before its Build conference, with additional Surface hardware and AI improvements in Copilot and Windows on the table.</p>
