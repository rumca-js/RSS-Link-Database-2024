Ninety-three days after fracturing the fifth metatarsal in my left foot, I had the joyful feeling of finally stepping out on to the pitch again in front of our home crowd in Munich. I had expected to be more nervous, but thanks to the girls playing a fantastic game – en route to a 5-0 win over RB Leipzig – I was able to run out there with a good feeling in my body.</p><p>I’d like to take you through the process of my recovery from that injury – the most serious I’ve had since fracturing the same bone in my other foot when I was 17. That experience meant that when it happened this time, in our Champions League home game against Ajax, I recognised the feeling straight away. I felt the crack and was able to tell some of the girls what it was even before the physio

I had woken up early, buzzing from the adrenaline of a series of unaccustomed public appearances following the recent publication of my book.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/21/what-is-grooming-relationship-abuse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My ancestors had their own complex relationships with the party, but they could point to policies that transformed people’s lives. In 2024, I cannot say the same</p><p>It’s difficult to disentangle Labour from my sense of self. Grew up in Stockport, looks a bit like Macaulay Culkin, bad dress sense … the Labour party always seemed to fit in there somewhere. My great-grandfather, a railwayman who had his wages docked in the General Strike nearly a century ago, was a Labour councillor. So was my grandmother; her proudest achievement was stopping a family being evicted by a private landlord over Christmas. My parents met at an open-air Labour meeting outside Tooting Bec in the 1960s (romantic). My mother bought me a Labour membership as a 15th birthday present. Under every Labour leader in my 21 years of adult life, I’ve plumped for the party’s candidates at local, national and European level, and campaigned for them to boot.</p><p>And yet, after a uniquely calamitous 14-year

<p>The government’s vaping legislation is a courageous start but it leaves gaping integrity issues unresolved</p><p>From 1 July the only vapes available in this country should be those prescribed by medical practitioners and dispensed by pharmacies. As a paediatrician who has witnessed the extraordinary increase in childhood vaping addiction in Australia, I wish our government had the courage to do this years ago. As a politician, I’m watching with concern the pushback from the tobacco and vaping lobby – and the political parties they support.</p><p>The number of young Australians who vape has increased 12-fold in the last four years, to more than 12%. Vaping is highly addictive. With vaping rates soaring, we’ve also seen a tripling in teen smoking – the first time our teen smoking has risen in decades. It’s an entry point to the tobacco industry, which still kills at least 20,000 Australians a year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/21/big-tobac
