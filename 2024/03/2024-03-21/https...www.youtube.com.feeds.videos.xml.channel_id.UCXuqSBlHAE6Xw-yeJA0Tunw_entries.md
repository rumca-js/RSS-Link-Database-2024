We’ve gone through many evolutions of our main video editing server Whonnock, but they’ve all shared a similar problem - there is only one of them. Today, we change that by deploying a high availability storage cluster powered by Supermicro’s GrandTwin multi node servers and Weka, a distributed NVMe-first clustered file system. It’s fast… very, very fast.
