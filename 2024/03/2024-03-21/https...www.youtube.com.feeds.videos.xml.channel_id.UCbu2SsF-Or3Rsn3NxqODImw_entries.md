## Princess Peach: Showtime! GameSpot Review

Princess Peach Showtime is a breezy exploration of genres aimed at novice gamers.

Princess Peach, the prototypical video game damsel in distress, has had limited success with her own solo adventures. On the rare occasion that she's playable, she has typically been a sidekick in a larger adventure, like Super Mario RPG. Though she did land a starring role in Super Princess Peach, the game and its core mechanic—in which her powers were defined by wild mood swings—were a miss. Princess Peach Showtime is the latest attempt to make her own story, with nary a Mario or Luigi in sight, and this time she has come more into her own as an adventurer. More importantly, this solo outing seems primed at introducing new players to a wide variety of game genres. While veteran gamers will likely find the pacing too lethargic, it's nice that Nintendo is making such a clear overture to welcome new players.

Princess Peach Showtime is a friendly, inviting game that's made to be easy to digest.

We take down an enemy encampment on the hardest difficulty, Twilight, in the early game. We use a variety of sneaking tactics and the handy grappling hook to gain the upper hand.

Though it has a somewhat steep combat learning curve and some dated open-world ideas, Rise of the Ronin does a great job of rewarding your time in its world.
