<p>Defender wants to seize ‘big moments’ and accepts scrutiny is ‘part and parcel of football’ before Saturday’s match with Brazil</p><p>The problem for Harry Maguire – and it has coloured his situation for some time – is that many supporters want the England team to be picked on club form. It is not how Gareth Southgate works, at least not entirely. The England manager places an emphasis on how his players have performed for him, on what he sees directly. The critics call it excessive loyalty. Southgate views it as basic logic.</p><p>Maguire’s travails at Manchester United have been well documented. For him, 2022-23 was the lost season at club level when he started only eight Premier League games and slipped to the bottom of the central defensive pecking order, which was where he began the current campaign. In March 2022, he had heard his substitution in United’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/15/manchester-united-atletico-madrid-champions-league-last

<p>Many women are cutting themselves off from great relationships because they are convinced they will not get aroused if a man can’t reach something off the top shelf</p><p>A few nights ago, for some reason, I got served a TikTok where (dating) actors Zendaya and Tom Holland were asked a question about their much-commented-on height difference. OK, the reason might be because I’d been scrolling TikTok for 25 minutes and earlier that day googled Zendaya’s height after seeing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/21/dune-part-two-review-denis-villeneuve">Dune: Part Two</a> … but who knows.</p><p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tomsnapchats/video/7272801319268650258">In this TikTok</a>, Zendaya replied that her mum is taller than her dad, so tall woman/shorter man relationships were always normal to her, and she didn’t even realise it was an issue until dating Tom (who also doesn’t find it an issue).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/

## Wales set up Poland showdown after James seals emphatic win over Finland

<p>On a night when Wales knew they needed the fresh blood to fire, how they delivered. A comprehensive victory over Finland means Wales have now won each of their last three playoffs in Cardiff and if they beat Poland here in the final on Tuesday they will secure a place at the Euro 2024 finals in Germany this summer. None of the goalscorers featured at Euro 2016 but all played a significant part in ensuring their hopes of reaching a fourth major tournament in five remain very much alive.</p><p>The pick of the goals was an unstoppable free-kick from Neco Williams but it was Daniel James, on his 50th appearance, who capped the ­scoring, rounding the Finland goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky after a calamitous error by a dawdling Miro Tenho, the Finland centre-back. David Brooks gave Wales the ideal leg-up before Williams doubled Wales’s advantage but Teemu Pukki struck before half-time for Finland.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/21/wales-finland-euro-2024-q

## Faith Healer review – Brian Friel’s classic questions everything we believe

<p><strong>Lyric Hammersmith, London<br /></strong>Rachel O’Riordan’s powerful production explores political, medical and religious faith with a wholly convincing cast</p><p>When Brian Friel’s Faith Healer opened on Broadway in 1979, it closed, critically trashed, after 20 performances. The Irish playwright told an interviewer: “You feel as you do about a sickly child for a panned play.” But the script, 45 years on, is one of Friel’s most beloved offspring, regularly revived on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>In each successful production, though, you can see what daunted earlier audiences. Faith Healer has the austere form of four more-or-less half-hour monologues. The first and last are delivered by Frank Hardy, who tours Celtic villages in a van, laying hands on the sick. He travels with Grace, his (depending on who you believe) mistress or wife, and Teddy, his agent and driver.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/mar/21/faith-healer-review-brian-friel-ly

It’s five years since he made his debut, and in that time a global star at under-15 and under-17 level has matured into one of the sport’

The Beatles were about to play Boston Garden but the family couldn’t leave until they’d celebrated her brother Peter’s second birthday with candles and presents.</p><p>“I was furious, because I didn’t want to be late,” recalls DiGangi, now 72. She had saved up all her babysitting money to buy the band’s second US album, Meet the Beatles! “I was so excited.” Thankfully, DiGangi made it to the show on time. It was “electric”, and sent fans wild. “It was just an explosion of screaming and hysteria,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/21/us-beatles-fans-share-stories">Continue reading...

<p>Classic heist caper The Lavender Hill Mob is getting a cinema rerelease. But which of these 40s and 50s film fancies are slyly subversive, and which have dated less well?</p><p>Anyone wanting a look at Dublin in the late 1940s might like this, but there’s not much else especially compelling about this weird Walter Mitty-ish comedy about a park loafer hoping to finance a one-way trip to the South Seas by helping rich people who have fallen over. Inspired by the anywhere-but-here mood of postwar privations, this is pretty charmless, and almost completely tone-deaf to the class/ethnic sensitivities of a crew of posh Brits rolling around the Irish capital.

When they do, they may well have to remind themselves and sometimes juries of the position of women in society, and counter gender stereotypes that might otherwise influence the outcome of the case. These stereotypes might be those that associate women with certain forms of work, caring for children or doing “womanly” things (like not going out drinking in cosy clubs in the evening), or gender-related rape myths that blame women for men’s sexual assaults upon them. Judges are supposed to do this “without f

That man is Mohamed Amersi, whose public persona is that of a prolific donor to the Conservative party, a philanthropist who has spoken at the University of Oxford about tackling international corruption, and a man who has met with King Charles on multiple occasions, supporting causes close to the king’s heart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/21/cuckooland-by-tom-burgis-review-reputation-management">Continue reading...</a>

<p>By truly finding solutions for ailing rail links and bus services, Labour can remind us who the party of the ‘red wall’ really is</p><p>Creating a better public transport system will be vital for meeting Labour’s economic goals and its environmental ones; and it would make for a much nicer country, too. Getting there from here, though, will be a long and difficult journey. After 14 years of Tory mismanagement, with growth low and interest rates high, it may be harder to splash the cash than it would have been in the past. The next Labour government should focus on the following.</p><p>Jonn Elledge’s new book, A History of the World in 47 Borders: The Stories Behind the Lines on Our Maps,<em> </em>is published in April</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/21/manifesto-britain-needs-labour-uk-public-transport-rail-bus-red-wall">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sarah, 66, and Chris, 70, met 10 years ago when she worked for him as an architect. They now live together in Suffolk, in the home she designed for him</p><p>For Sarah, 2013 had been a difficult year. She was struggling after losing both her parents and threw herself into her job as an architect to distract herself. “My dad had a stroke and my mum had cancer in a short space of time,” she says. “I was a single mum to two children who were at university. I’d always been passionate about my work but it became my focus.” Living in the small town of Eye in Suffolk, she worked mainly on modest, local jobs. One day, a builder she knew asked if she would be interested in helping a client near Ipswich. “It was a big house far from where I was living,” she says. “But it looked like such an interesting project that I said yes.”</p><p>The client was Chris, a single father with grownup children, who worked as a banker in London and commuted from Suffolk. “We moved here in the 90s, but

<p>They are the familiar ingredients that can add punch, zing and umami to even a five-minute recipe. Here is a guide to getting the very best out of them</p><p>Over the past 20 years or so, the way we cook and eat at home has changed almost completely. We spend far less time in the kitchen, and at the same time, we expect much more from our meals: food that’s ready quickly with layers of flavour and texture, food that does us good from an array of world flavours. There has been nothing short of a revolution when it comes to putting plants at the centre of our plates, and that thrills me. As our eating habits evolve, we want more from a recipe. It must be fast but clear; easy, but brimming with taste.</p><p>With this in mind, most of my recipes rely on a few favourite flavour-packed components; a capsule pantry of ingredients that are always in fashion. After much note-taking, recipe-reading and talking to amateur and professional cooks, I landed on the 12 I rely on the most:

<p>Sport does not exist in a vacuum and football clubs will always be powerful emblems of our communal identity</p><p>Mustafa Suleyman’s timely book The Coming Wave discusses the combinational technologies that will define our future. One quote particularly stood out: “I’ve often heard it said that technology is ‘value neutral’ and that its politics arise from its use. This is so reductive and simplistic that it’s almost meaningless.”</p><p>I agree and was thinking similarly that football extends beyond the pitch, weaving itself into the very fabric of our societal, cultural and, most unmistakably, political realities. The notion that sports can exist in a vacuum, devoid of the world’s complexities and challenges, is not only implausible but naive. Football, as exemplified by the controversies surrounding the World Cup in Qatar, encompassing debates over workers’ rights, environmental practices and discrimination based on sexual orientation, has proven a catalyst for a larger

<p>What our politics and government need is a restoration of continuity and stability – not a premature resignation</p><p>The Conservative party needs another leadership election right now like it needs a hole in the head. Most observers agree about this. Even Jacob Rees-Mogg accepts that four Tory leaders in one parliament would be more than the country could tolerate. This side of the general election, the die is cast. After the election is another matter.</p><p>So far, so fairly obvious. But here’s a thought. If Rishi Sunak leads the Tories to defeat this autumn, as most of his MPs now suspect will happen, he should not then resign immediately. Instead, Sunak should stay on as opposition leader. British politics doesn’t need a premature pre-election leadership contest of the sort that was again floated this week. But it doesn’t need a premature post-election contest either. And nor, in particular, does the Conservative party.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commen

<p>An urgent and persuasive warning about the toll of ‘phone-based childhoods’</p><p>At the start of the 2010s, rates of teenage mental illness took a sharp upward turn, and they have been rising ever since. Among US college students, diagnoses of depression and anxiety more than doubled between 2010 and 2018. More worrying still, in the decade to 2020 the number of emergency room visits for self-harm rose by 188% among teenage girls in the US and 48% among boys. The suicide rate for younger adolescents also increased, by 167% among girls and 91% among boys. A similar trend has been observed in the UK and many&nbsp;other western countries. The American social psychologist Jonathan Haidt believes this mental health&nbsp;crisis has been driven by the mass adoption of smartphones, along with the advent of social media and addictive online gaming. He calls it “the Great Rewiring of Childhood”.</p><p>Children are spending ever less time socialising in person and ever more time glu

<p>The life and achievements of Shirley Chisholm, the groundbreaking Black politician, are told in a formulaic drama that boasts a winning central performance</p><p>For all its broad strokes, Shirley, the new Netflix biopic on trailblazing politician and erstwhile presidential candidate Shirley Chisholm, has a point. Some things are not subtle. The film opens with a visualizer of the House of Representatives in 1968: of the 435 members, only 11 were women, only five Black, and no Black women. Or to put it more starkly: in the official congressional class portrait on the steps of the Capitol, Chisholm (Regina King) is the only Black female face in a sea of grizzled white male visages. The Capitol dome in the background may look obviously CGI-ed, but the image is effective: Chisholm’s mere appearance in the halls of power was radical, her fight steeply uphill.</p><p>Said image is also fitting for Shirley, written and directed by John Ridley, which is insightful on Chisholm’s un

This symbol of girlhood has been on a journey, from the industrial revolution to TikTok</p><p>When an individual French fry is being wrapped in a bow, filmed, and shared on the internet, it is a sign that something strange is going on with an age-old symbol of girl- and womanhood. By the end of last year it wasn’t just chips – everything from ice cubes to gherkins, toilet rolls, golden retrievers and a bottle of antidepressants were being prettified, neatly packaged with a single bow and posted on TikTok, where, in some cases, they would rack up millions of views.</p><p>It was a satirical conclusion to a year in which we arguably reached peak bow. But the wave never crested.

But it’s still going.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardia

Hamad, a former journalist with a degree in veterinary medicine, was also involved in the Shalit negotiations and served as deputy foreign minister in the 2012 Hamas government. Prior to the 7 October attacks, for more than a decade and a half, Hamad and Baskin had exchanged frequent phone calls and text messages. These mainly concerned
