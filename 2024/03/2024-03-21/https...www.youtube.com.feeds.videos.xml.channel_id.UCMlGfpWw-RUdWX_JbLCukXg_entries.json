On the other hand, it can be surprisingly\ndifficult to precisely define these words in a way that matches both\nintuition and common usage. This difficulty has even led to divergence within the C++ standard library!\n\nThis talk is a journey of discovery where we not only find satisfactory\ndefinitions, but identify practical, good coding practices along the way.\nAt the end of this talk you'll be able to name implicit contracts,\nunderstand the deep connection between move semantics and exception safety, and, in general, have a greater appreciation for the meaning of the programs we write every day.\n---\n\nDavid Sankel\n\nDavid Sankel is a Principal Scientist at Adobe and an active member of the C++ Standardization Committee.
