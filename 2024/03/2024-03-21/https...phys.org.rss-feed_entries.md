Roots play a vital role in plant health, adapting to environmental changes and indicating crop growth. However, studying root senescence is challenging due to difficulties in obtaining clear in situ root images. Traditional methods are limited, and while in situ cultivation and advanced imaging techniques offer some solutions, they face issues such as high costs and low image quality. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly semantic segmentation models like SegNet and UNet, have improved root identification but still require further optimization.

While much ink has been poured over China's economic growth in recent decades, the contributions of Chinese women often receive less attention. With the pressure of the "three-child policy", being a mother isn't a mere personal choice, it's a part of national demographic strategy. To navigate their lives, many Chinese mothers are now turning to what has been referred to as "mumpreneurship". A January 2024 search for "妈妈创业" (the term in Chinese) showed 69.9 million results on Baidu, China's primary search engine, compared to just 2.6 million English results on Google.

In order for plants to grow, they absorb water and nutrients through their roots. In doing so, they rely on tiny helpers: bacteria and fungi in particular are found in a thin layer around the roots. These microbes also ward off organisms that are harmful to the plant, just as the "microbiome" in the human gut helps determine whether we fall ill or stay healthy.

Legionnaires' disease (LD), a rare and severe type of pneumonia, is a respiratory infection caused by species of Legionella bacteria. One of the most accurate ways to diagnose LD is to perform culture on samples from a patient's lower respiratory tract, but those samples are difficult to obtain. In addition, growing cultures requires specialized culture media and incubation times and conditions that many laboratories lack; as a result, LD is likely underdiagnosed.

## Scientists elucidate the role of GlyT1 in anti-schizophrenia drugs

Schizophrenia is a highly disabling mental disorder, and numerous studies have shown that the hypofunction of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is one of its pathogenic mechanisms. Glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1), a glycine transporter protein, is highly co-localized with the NMDA receptor. Inhibition of GlyT1 can increase the concentration of glycine in the synaptic cleft, thereby indirectly promoting NMDA receptor activation. Therefore, GlyT1 is considered a key target for the treatment of schizophrenia.
