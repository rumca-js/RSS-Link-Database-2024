It's trailer-tastic this week as we've just had trailers for The Acolyte, House of the Dragon Season 2 and Alien: Romulus. Plus, bad news for the 20 or so Star Wars fans that are left, as George Lucas puts his weight behind Bob Iger in the proxy battle for the Disney board. Join me, MauLer, Ryan Kinel, Robot Head and The Angry Badger as we talk about all of it.
