Better Code: Exploring Validity in C++ - David Sankel - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

Most developers have at least some notion of the meaning of object, state, invariant, value, and invalid. On the other hand, it can be surprisingly
difficult to precisely define these words in a way that matches both
intuition and common usage. This difficulty has even led to divergence within the C++ standard library!

This talk is a journey of discovery where we not only find satisfactory
definitions, but identify practical, good coding practices along the way.
At the end of this talk you'll be able to name implicit contracts,
understand the deep connection between move semantics and exception safety, and, in general, have a greater appreciation for the meaning of the programs we write every day.
