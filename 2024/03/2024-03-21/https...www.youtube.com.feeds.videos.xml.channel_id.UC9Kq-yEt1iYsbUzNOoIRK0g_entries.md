With movies based on YA novels like The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, Twilight and Harry Potter doing great at the box office for years, you can’t really blame Lionsgate for trying to recapture that magic with Divergent. Did they success? Hey, no.

Divergent definitely raises some questions. Like what’s with the big weird age gap between Tris and Four? What happens is Four gets scared of something new? What’s with the whole testing ceremony?
