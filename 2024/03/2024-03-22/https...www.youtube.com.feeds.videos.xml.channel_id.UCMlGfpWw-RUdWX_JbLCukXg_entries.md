Getting Started with C++ - Michael Price - CppCon 2023

Getting started with C++ can be intimidating, especially if you are learning on your own. Where do you even start?!

This talk walks you through getting started with C++, from obtaining a compiler toolchain and useful libraries, to finding learning resources and deciding whether you should be using source control and continuous integration. If you are already on your C++ journey, there’s likely stuff you weren’t familiar with that could make your life a bit easier. If you are a C++ expert, it’s useful to remind yourself of the challenges that beginners face so that we can help them avoid all the mistakes we made along the way.
