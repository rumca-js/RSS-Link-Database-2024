I failed lately in a way I didn't expect - was Games Workshop to blame?

Vince Venturella and I made a 'zine! Check out SNARL at http://www.snarlingbadger.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
