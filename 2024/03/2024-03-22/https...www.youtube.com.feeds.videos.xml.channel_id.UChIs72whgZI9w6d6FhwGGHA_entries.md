NVIDIA had a lot of announcements this week between the Blackwell GPUs (which will presumably come to the RTX 5090, 5080, and others), its NIMs, the humanoid and other robotics Project GR00T, NVLink Switch advancements, and more. But in addition to covering those stories and some of the surface-level technicals that have been released so far, we're also talking about some of the absurdity of media coverage. This piece is a mix of news reporting on NVIDIA's GTC 2024 keynote and of commentary and opinions on the state of the industry, NVIDIA's scary position, and what AMD and Intel are left to do. Despite our focus in gaming, much of this technology eventually works its way into consumer parts (and it's just fun to learn about).
