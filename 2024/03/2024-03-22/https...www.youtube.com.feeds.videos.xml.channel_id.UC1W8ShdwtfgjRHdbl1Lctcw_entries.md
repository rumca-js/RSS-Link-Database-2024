I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of downtown Los Angeles showing automobiles, streetcars and pedestrians, 1946 May, we can see Loew's State Theatre (703 South Broadway), Warner Brothers Downtown Theatre (401 West 7th Street), RKO Hillstreet Theatre (801 South Hill Street), Pershing Square (532 South Olive Street), Silverwood's (556 South Broadway), Bullocks (639 South Broadway). 

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
