		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a> has taken a step towards transparency by open-sourcing the software component of its Orb biometric device. This move allows for external verification of the company's data privacy claims and provides experts with the ability to examine how the Orb captures images, processes biometric data, and transfers it to the World App.

Such an infrastructure will promote a community-driven audit process, wherein an independent verification and public reporting of findings will contribute to the assurance of Orb's adherence to the protocols governing data privacy and security.

An important component of the Orb's software, the do_signup function within the orb-core repository, is <a href="https:/

		Corsound AI writes software capable of generating what the executives say is an accurate rendering of the face issuing the voice. The company’s AI algorithms are also said to accurately match a voice with a face.

To the extent that the private Tel Aviv startup can pull this off reliably and with low error rates, it would be helping to create a new biometric surveillance tactic and to add a new option for remote authentication in onboarding.

<a href="https://www.corsound.ai/">Corsound</a> says it can also detect deepfakes, and among its promoted use cases is identifying the people who harass someone by summoning law enforcement to their home with dangerous claims (swatting).

Company policy is to refrain from naming customers, but it is focused on law enforce

		Researchers in Indonesia have published a study on the perceived effectiveness of facial recognition technology as a security measure in digital wallet transactions among Generation Z users.

A survey of 385 respondents born between 1997 and 2012 has shown that facial recognition significantly influences perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward usage, behavioral intention to use, and actual system usage.

“The use of face recognition as a method of leverage in digital transactions has a positive and mutually influential effect on the user experience.” the research <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article/3026/1/050006/3277619/Analysis-of-transaction-security-effectiveness">notes</a>. “The security of face recognition as a technology is a

		The Tobacco and Vapes Bill will introduce penalties for underaged tobacco and vape sales in England and Wales. Among other actions, the bill is enhancing online age verification requirements to prevent underaged online sales. Biometric age assurance providers like Innovative Technology (ITL) hear opportunity knocking.

Local Trading Standards Officers will now be able to immediately issue fines of £100 (roughly US$127) to retailers for underage sales as well as proxy buyers. Scotland and Northern Ireland already have fixed penalty notice schemes.

According to <a href="https://www.betterretailing.com/digital-id-for-alcohol-sales-coming-soon/">Better Retailing</a>, Bestway stores will continue their government-led digital ID trial for age verification for the purcha

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/precise-biometrics">Precise Biometrics</a> is expanding into a new modality with the launch of palm biometrics software to run on any device with a quality camera.

The new modality is being integrated into Precise’s portfolio of access control and visitor management products. In addition to being offered with YOUNiQ Access and YOUNiQ Visit, Precise will sell its palm biometric algorithm to developers and system integrators, and notes payments as another possible application.

Palm biometrics provide touchless convenience, fast and reliable authentication, the company says, and will allow it to address the needs of more customers and use cases, resulting in higher sales.

		The European Union’s top court has ruled that governments that mandate handing over fingerprint biometrics for identity cards are not breaking European privacy laws. They are, however, doing it illegally.

In its <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2024-03/cp240050en.pdf">ruling</a>, published on Thursday, the European Court of Justice explains that the mandatory insertion of fingerprint data in ID cards is compatible with fundamental privacy rights. The court also argues that obtaining biometrics is justified because of the need to combat identity theft and to ensure the interoperability of verification systems.

The court, however, has also declared that the EU regulation on mandatory fingerprinting of ID cards is invalid.

		As countries work to facilitate the way their citizens, both home and abroad, can access public services or complete online tasks, the provision of digital ID or its adoption constitute key concerns to be addressed. In this light, Vietnam has just issued draft rules on digital ID registration and verification for citizens including those living abroad to facilitate their access to online services. In Azerbaijan, the facial recognition function of a cloud-based digital signature application will be used to facilitate identification of individuals and legal entities. The United Arab Emirates’ digital ID (UAE Pass), authorities say, has proven vital for citizens’ access to public services, with more than 7.2 million of the IDs issued in the course of las

		The future of Buenos Aires' controversial public facial recognition system, which has been used to spy on civil society members and has led to erroneous arrests, is still uncertain.

In February, a court in the Argentinian capital ruled that the public surveillance system, known as the Fugitive Facial Recognition System (SNRP), will remain suspended as there is still no agreement on how to audit the technology. No date has been defined on when the system might be re-activated.

The court has instructed the city’s government and civil society groups ODIA, Vía Libre and CELS to come up with an institutional framework, a budget and a clear methodological plan for an audit of the system before its reintroduction. The two sides, however, have been cl
