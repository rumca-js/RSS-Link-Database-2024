Many consider it an early Game of the Year contender for its open-world design, combat and emergent gameplay.\n\nHowever, there's also been a strong focus on its performance. While announced as having an uncapped frame rate, reviewers have pointed out frame drops in both the console and PC versions. The latter is worse off because even those well above the recommended specifications will struggle to maintain a steady frame rate in packed cities.\n\nThe developer has promised a fix, blaming NPCs for the high CPU load, but how long it could take remains to be seen. Open-world development on this scale isn't easy, but with a $70 price tag, players are questioning why they should line up at launch with such severe issues.", "page_rating_contents": 94, "vote": 0, "title": "Dragon's Dogma 2 PC Performance - What Is Going On?", "album": "", "source_obj__id": 129, "page_rating_votes": 0, "language": null, "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "dead": false, "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/KvW-kPGb5nA/hqdefault.jpg", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "age": null, "page_rating": 94, "artist": null, "permanent": false, "tags": []}]
