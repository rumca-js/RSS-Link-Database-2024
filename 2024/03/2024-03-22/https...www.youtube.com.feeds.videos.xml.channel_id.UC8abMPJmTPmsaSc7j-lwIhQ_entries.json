Believed to be the very first film adaptation of a Shakespearean play, it is not a film in the way we understand it today, but rather a brief, tantalizing glimpse into the birth of cinematic storytelling.\n\nProduced by the British Mutoscope and Biograph Company and directed by Walter Pfeffer Dando and William K.L. Dickson, this landmark film consisted of a single scene: King John's death throes from Shakespeare's historical play. Starring the renowned stage actor Herbert Beerbohm Tree, it captured no more than a minute of action. Yet, this fragment represented a bold step \u2013 an attempt to translate the grandiosity and poetry of the stage onto the fledgling medium of film.\n\nContext is crucial.  In 1899, cinema was in its infancy. Films were short, silent spectacles, designed as novelty acts rather than full-fledged narratives.
