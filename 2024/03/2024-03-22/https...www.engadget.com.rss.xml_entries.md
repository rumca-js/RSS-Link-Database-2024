While not as heavy on tech deals as regular Prime Day is, there are some good Amazon deals available on tech we recommend, including a number of Apple devices. In truth, the pickings are pretty slim — and most of these discounts are not explicitly tied to the spring sale — but they're still worth noting as some of the best tech deals we found amongst all of the clothing, home goods and outdoor gear on sale at Amazon right now. Here are the best Apple deals we could find in the Amazon Spring Sale. As a reminder, this sale will run through March 25 and isn't exclusive to Prime subscribers.</p>

<p>The social network Threads is going to start showing live sports scores, starting with NBA basketball. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C40wRjXRGte">announced the initiative</a> and wrote that it’ll be adding more leagues in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. During a game, just search for the teams and you’ll see an up-to-date score. If the game is over, a search will bring up the final score. You can also find out when a game will start by searching for it ahead of time. This obviously resembles how X does things, as the platform began <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-happening-now-feature">showing live sports scores back in 2017</a>, when it <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/943901463998169088?lang=en">was called Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Porn bots are more or less ingrained in the social media experience, despite platforms’ best efforts to stamp them out. We’ve grown accustomed to seeing them flooding the comments sections of memes and celebrities’ posts, and, if you have a public account, you’ve probably noticed them watching and liking your stories. But their behavior keeps changing ever so slightly to stay ahead of automated filters, and now things are starting to get weird.</p>
<p>While porn bots at one time mostly tried to lure people in with suggestive or even overtly raunchy hook lines (like the ever-popular, “<a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-19-instagram-bots-spam-comments-huge-booty-masturbate-verified-badges.html">DON'T LOOK at my STORY, if you don't want to MASTURBATE!</a>”), the approach these days is a little more abstract. It’s become common to see bot accounts posting a single, inoffensive, completely-irrelevant-to-the-subject word, sometimes accompanied by

<p>A team of university security researchers has found a chip-level exploit in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m3-review-2024-13-15-inch-140053162.html">Apple Silicon Macs</a>. The group <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://gofetch.fail/files/gofetch.pdf">says</a> the flaw can bypass the computer’s encryption and access its security keys, exposing the Mac’s private data to hackers. The silver lining is the exploit would require you to circumvent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-gatekeeper-privacy-macos-security-104715012.html">Apple’s Gatekeeper protections</a>, install a malicious app and then let the software run for as long as 10 hours (along with a host of other complex conditions), which reduces the odds you’ll have to worry about the threat in the real world.</p>

<p>Meditation is often touted as a mental cure-all, purported to help with stress, sleep, mood, focus and even certain medical conditions. I’ve been meditating most of my adult life. I’ve done silent retreats. I’ve been formally trained in various techniques. I’ve had someone in my contacts list who I referred to as a “guru.” So I feel I’m relatively qualified to give some bad news: Meditation won’t fix your life, <a href="https://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/">despite what David Lynch says.</a> However, there’s also some good news: Despite not actually being a cure-all for everything bad in the universe, meditation can certainly take the edge off.<br /><br />This is where meditation apps can come into play. Of course, practicing mindfulness doesn’t require an app; people have been doing it for thousands of years, with nary a smartphone in sight. But mindfulness apps can be useful in a number of ways. They provide access to all kinds of guided meditations to suit different st

You can only buy them on Microsoft’s website and through enterprise resellers. This week, Cherlynn and Devindra discuss why Microsoft is positioning these computers for businesses, and what it could mean for the future of the Surface lineup. The company is hinting that it’ll have consumer devices soon – likely the Pro 10 and Laptop 6 without as much corporate baggage. But there may also be room for an entirely new form of Surface. Perhaps it’s time for a true Surface foldable? (Or maybe not, after seeing how the Duo performed.)</p>

It says Apple’s hardware and software products are largely inaccessible to competitors, making it difficult for rivals to compete and for customers to switch to other companies’ products.</p>
<p>The lawsuit comes after the European Commission fined Apple €1.8 billion ($1.95 billion) for stopping music-streaming developers from “informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available” outside the App Store.

<p>As temperatures begin to rise, it’s time to prepare your outdoor space for some seasonal relaxation. That, of course, includes showing off your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-grilling-gear-143011296.html">culinary skills</a> on the porch, patio or in the backyard for guests. During the winter, your grill has probably been hibernating, so you’ll need to give it a tune-up before it’s ready for heavy use from spring to fall.

<p>WhatsApp has just made it easier to take note of more important messages from within a conversation. Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg and WhatsApp head Will Cathcart have both announced on their respective WhatsApp channels that you'll now be able to pin up to three messages to the top of a chat, allowing you quick access to any information you want.

While Google did make things simpler last fall by introducing the Chromebook Plus initiative (more on that below), there are still multiple things to keep in mind when shopping for a new Chromebook. I’ve been testing and reviewing Chromebooks for years and know what you should be looking for, and what you can expect out of these laptops in 2024.<br /><br /><strong>Editor’s note (3/22/24): </strong>We’re constantly testing and evaluating new Chromebooks for this guide, and there are two models on our
