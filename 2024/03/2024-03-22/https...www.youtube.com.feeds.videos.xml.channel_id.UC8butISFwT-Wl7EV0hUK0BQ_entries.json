She's worked as a software engineer for more than a decade at companies like GitHub and Glitch. \n\nAmong her many accomplishments, Jessica created the Electon team at GitHub. Electron is a library for building desktop apps using browser technologies. If you've used the desktop version of Slack, Figma, or VS Code, you've used Electron.\n\nI recorded this podcast live and I haven't edited it at all. I want to capture the feel of a real live conversation, with all the human quirks that entails. As with all my podcast episodes, I start by performing a classic bass line. Can you guess what song this bass line is from? It's a \"cult\" hit from 1990.\n\nBe sure to follow The freeCodeCamp podcast in your favorite podcast app. And share this podcast with a friend. Let's inspire more folks to learn to code and build careers for themselves in tech.\n\nAlso, I want to thank the 8,427 kind", "page_rating_contents": 94, "vote": 0, "title": "She wrote code you use every day [freeCodeCamp Podcast #116]", "album": "", "source_obj__id": 422, "page_rating_votes": 0, "language": null, "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ", "dead": false, "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/lSxiMMs5y-4/hqdefault.jpg", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "age": null, "page_rating": 94, "artist": null, "permanent": false, "tags": []}]
