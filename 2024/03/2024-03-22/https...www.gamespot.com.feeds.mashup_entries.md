<p>Grief is messy. It's complicated. It's noisy. Or, at least, that's how Abubakar Salim described grief to me when we sat down to play Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, the debut game from his studio, Surgent Studios. On the surface, Tales of Kenzera: ZAU is a confident and vibrant 2.5D metroidvania, with an African mystical world as its backdrop. But below its genre foundation, are roots nourished and forged from tragedy. When Abubakar's father passed away, he said it was like "the rose-tinted glasses were snatched from his face."</p><p dir="ltr">Abubakar was shoved into the depths of grief, navigating a labyrinth of questions he couldn't answer and emotions he had trouble unpacking. It was noisy and unclear--a feeling that he felt only Tales of Kenzera: ZAU could emulate. "It doesn't matter if you've lost a parent, a brother, a friend, a pet, or a job. Grief is something we'll all experience, and it's a journey that we all go through. It's what makes us all human," he told me. Hearin

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has earned enormous praise for its plethora of well-rounded, romanceable companion characters. Among those companions is the well-meaning, well-spoken, Weave-wielding Wizard Of Waterdeep, Gale Dekarios.</p><p dir="ltr">As a generally good-aligned character, Gale generally isn't too much of a challenge to romance for players who are committed to a "good" playthrough, though he can be a challenge for anyone playing as The Dark Urge or otherwise planning to take the "evil" route when it comes to player choices, and there are several moments in the story that can result in him disappearing altogether.

<p>Disney Speedstorm has great kart-racing mechanics, but has been bogged down by an aggressive, confusing progression system. The game has found an audience and continued to release regular seasonal content introducing new iconic Disney characters, but developer Gameloft appears ready to finally fix its overcomplicated upgrade system soon.</p><p>Currently, there is a shared pool of upgrade resources like Energy Cans and Racing Helmets that can be used by all racers at the lower levels. As they reach higher levels, each Collection (aka franchise) gets its own <em>specialized</em> upgrade materials alongside higher-level shared materials. Hercules characters might need to collect Hercules Action Figures, for example, while Monsters Inc. characters need to collect Scream Canisters. Some materials are further specialized to be only usable by a single racer, like Ariel's Dinglehopper in the latest season. When you account for all the different franchises and characters, you get <
