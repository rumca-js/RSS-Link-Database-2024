<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi <a href="/r/politics">r/politics</a>, Post reporters Hannah Natanson and Laura Meckler here. We recently published a story showing that school hate crimes targeting LGBTQ+ people have sharply risen in recent years, climbing fastest in states that have passed laws restricting LGBTQ student rights and education, according to an analysis of FBI data.</p> <p>We also interviewed students and families nationwide who experienced anti-LGBTQ bullying at school. (If you have a story of anti-LGBTQ school bullying to share, please let us know here.)<br /> Among our findings:</p> <ul> <li>The number of anti-LGBTQ+ school hate crimes serious enough to be reported to local police more than doubled nationwide between 2015-2019 and 2021-2022.<br /></li> <li>The rise is steeper in the 28 states that have passed laws curbing the rights of transgender students at school and restricting how teachers can talk about issues of gender and sexuality.<br /></li> <li
