To what extent do funds received through electoral bonds by parties reflect their electoral performance? In some cases, quite well in others not at all, an analysis shows. Among the two biggest national parties, BJP's share of bonds (50.1%) was a little more than its share of elected representatives (46.2%), while Congress got less (11.8%) through EBs than what would correspond to its performance in the last round of Lok Sabha and assembly polls (12.7%). TMC's 10.4% share in bonds was out of proportion to its share of 4.9% in lawmakers.

Together BJP and BRS encashed bonds worth Rs 162.2 crore from these firms, which translates to over 65% of the donations they made.
