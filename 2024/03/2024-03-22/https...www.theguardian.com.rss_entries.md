<p><strong>Coliseum, London<br /></strong>A last-minute cast substitution added a remarkable gender twist to Bartók’s  opera about marital disintegration</p><p>The first night of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/english-national-opera-eno">English National Opera</a>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/aug/28/classicalmusicandopera.stage">Bluebeard’s Castle</a> (billed as a “concert semi-staging”, though there is considerably more to it than that) turned out to be unique, startling and completely unforgettable, thanks in no small measure to the unusual circumstances that surrounded it. Allison Cook, cast as Judith, withdrew from the performance late in the day because of illness. With only two hours’ rehearsal, Jennifer Johnston sang, not from the side of the stage, as one might expect, but as a costumed, albeit largely immobile presence within Joe Hill-Gibbins’s production. The role was acted, meanwhile, wonderfully well, by Crispin Lord, one of ENO’s

<p>A real blow-out, luxury Easter cake of joy – and no chocolate for a change!</p><p>Easter is a time for celebration, and this definitely counts as a proper celebration cake. Taking inspiration from bakewell tart, it has three layers of moist almond sponge broken up with cherry jam and a silky swiss meringue buttercream. I only ever use almond extract in bakewell – it’s one of those ingredients you either love or loathe, but I find that just a few drops bring the right amount of fragrant marzipan flavour to this Easter cake.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/mar/22/easter-cherry-bakewell-cake-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What I want now are clothes that have a quiet confidence. Luckily, catwalks and front rows are full of them</p><p>When you are young and – well, I was going to say nubile, please don’t cancel me – you get a lot of attention for the way you look. This is&nbsp;not just about beauty, but about swagger, and the kind of clothes you wear. And this attention feels very much like power. By which I mean that attention brings with it many of the same privileges of power, by making life run more smoothly. Doors open for&nbsp;you. It is a bit like having great presence at the bar, but you get to leverage it for&nbsp;life in general rather than just when getting the pints in. You are the centre of attention and that is easy to confuse with thinking you are terrifically important.</p><p>Attention is not power, though, because it is turned off and on not by&nbsp;you, but by the people doing the looking. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and so, therefore, is the power of it. At some

It boasts no equivalent of the Brontës or Thomas Hardy. Wordsworth never took time off from striding the northern Lakelands to stroll across the South Downs. True, Shelley was born on his family’s estate in Horsham, but he got out as soon as he was able, and never looked back. Painters similarly voted with their feet. William Gilpin, pioneer of the picturesque, toured the southern coastal counties in 1774 and, inevitably, given his hatred for the way that chalk soil always gave everything “a blank glaring surface”, decided that Sussex offered little to delight.</p><p>But there was one man who, while not Sussex-born, got the proper measure of the place.

<p><strong>Stone Nest, London<br /></strong>Historical ensemble Figure and an excellent cast explore grief, compassion and hope through five women representing multiple generations</p><p>Performed by <a href="https://www.figureensemble.co.uk/">Figure</a>, and the brainchild of the ensemble’s founder and musical director Frederick Waxman, Our Mother in some ways resists classification, though in essence it is a music theatre piece that takes Pergolesi’s Stabat Mater as its starting point for an exploration of the nature of grief. It’s not for purists. Pergolesi’s 1736 masterpiece is frequently considered contemplative and serene, and indeed some of it is. But in depicting Christ’s crucifixion, it is also, as Waxman puts it, “an evolving reflection on a mother watching her child die”, and a fierce anguish consequently offsets its moments of calm. Along with director Sophie Daneman, Waxman’s aim has been to reimagine it in terms of a communal exploration of bereavement and compa

<p>Familiar rituals and moments spent reconnecting with your body could be soothing</p><p>Whenever people ask, as they often do, for product recommendations for use during chemotherapy, I’m invariably honoured but hesitant. I&nbsp;would hate anyone to think I placed undue importance on beauty at such a&nbsp;time. Beauty products should be pleasurable, and can be soothing and comforting, but they’re not medicine and, as with any illness, cancer treatment is about doing as the experts direct and hoping for a positive outcome.</p><p>But I also know, having loved too&nbsp;many people who have had chemotherapy, that it’s a time when everything seems at sea. Familiar rituals and moments spent reconnecting with one’s body can be of value. And so if products can be adapted to newly sensitised skin, a&nbsp;recommendation is helpful.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/mar/22/if-feeling-rough-with-chemo-these-gentle-bath-and-body-treats-can-help">Continue reading...</

<p>Young women come together in Nevada for a tournament where ambition and self-expression clash with brutal reality</p><p>For those of us who consider ourselves fans there is no sport&nbsp;quite so pure, so outright poetic&nbsp;as boxing, because this simple&nbsp;art of&nbsp;consensual combat offers&nbsp;no place to&nbsp;hide. Unlike other working-class sports such as football, with its amateur dramatics and petty squabbles, or American football and its&nbsp;endless ad breaks, boxing boils it down to the basics: hit and be hit, and in the best fighters we get to see the perfect symbiosis of artistry, strategy and brutality. Humans like to watch violence as much as we like to tell stories, and each fighter brings with them a narrative.</p><p>Little wonder, then, that down the years boxing has inspired some of the best sports writing, and we can now add American author Rita Bullwinkel’s debut novel to an expansive canon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/

The polymath showman also shares his musings on birds, dogs, space, Satan, classic westerns, the symbolic pregnancy of dreams, other people’s impressions of his distinctive voice, and occasionally, acting.

<p>The Garrick Club is one of London’s original gentlemen’s clubs. Among its members are the most powerful people in the country. Yet in 2024 women are not welcome to apply for membership. Amelia Gentleman reports</p><p>You could quite easily miss the Garrick Club if you were walking past it in central London. It’s an unremarkable grey stone building not marked by a number or by a sign. Inside however, is a different story. A sumptuous staircase is lined with priceless artworks. And around its long dining table can be found some of the most powerful men in the country.</p><p>As the Guardian’s <strong>Amelia Gentleman </strong>tells <strong>Hannah Moore</strong>, it is only men who can be members of the Garrick. And while membership of the club is not secret, it is not public either. This week she got sight of the full list and the names on it include some of the country’s top judges, politicians, civil servants and businessmen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/au
