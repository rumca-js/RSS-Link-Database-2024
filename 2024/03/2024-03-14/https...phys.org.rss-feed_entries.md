Without Katherine Johnson, NASA would not have landed a man on the moon. The 2016 film "Hidden Figures" told Johnson's story as a brilliant mathematician, a trailblazer who overcame racism and sexism to succeed at NASA in the 1950s and '60s. That monumental career was again examined in the media following her death in 2020.

In some towns, for example, it was the members of local environmental initiatives or heritage associations that founded energy cooperatives. Larger projects, on the other hand, are more commonly initiated by companies, banks, public institutions or businesses.

Our solar system does not exist in isolation. It formed within a stellar nursery along with hundreds of sibling stars, and even today has the occasional interaction with interstellar objects such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov. So it's reasonable to presume that some interstellar material has reached Earth. Recently Avi Loeb and his team earned quite a bit of attention with a study published in Research Notes of the AAS, arguing that they had found some of this interstellar stuff on the ocean seabed. But a new study finds that the material has a much more local origin.

Dirac electrons were predicted by P. Dirac and discovered by A. Geim, both of whom were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 and in 2010, respectively. Dirac electrons behave like photons rather than electrons, for they are considered to have no mass, and in materials they move with light velocity.

Forests and streams are separate but linked ecosystems, existing side by side, with energy and nutrients crossing their porous borders and flowing back and forth between them. For example, leaves fall from trees, enter streams, decay and feed aquatic insects. Those insects emerge from the waters and are eaten by birds and bats.

Most of Europe's natural ecosystems have been lost over the centuries. However, a sizeable amount of natural old forest still exists, especially in the north. These "old-growth" forests are exceptionally valuable as they tend to host more species, store more carbon, and are more resilient to environmental change.

In response to the efficient attacks of the host CRISPR-Cas system, bacteriophages have evolved various resistance strategies, including encoding anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins. Since their initial discovery in 2013, over a hundred Acr proteins have been identified. These proteins use different mechanisms to inhibit the recognition and cleavage of target nucleic acids by the Cas protein-RNA complex, and have great potential for development as gene editing regulatory elements.

Severe burns can cause critical issues, including deep tissue damage and an increased risk of fatal conditions such as sepsis and organ failure. A major concern is the disruption of the intestinal barrier, leading to inflammation and systemic health problems. This breakdown allows pathogens to invade, worsening the patient's condition. Given the limitations and side effects of current treatments, there is a pressing need for new, more effective therapies.

Anthropogenic plastic pollution is often experienced through evocative images of marine animals caught in floating debris, yet its reach is far more expansive. The polar regions of the Arctic and Antarctica are increasingly experiencing the impacts of plastic reaching floating ice and land, not solely as larger macroplastics (>5 cm), but as microplastics (0.1 µm—5 mm) and nanoplastics (
