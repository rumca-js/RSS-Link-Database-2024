While countless lawmakers looking to get on cable TV spent much of the last few years freaking out about TikTok privacy issues, none of those same folks seem bothered by the parade of nasty vulnerabilities in the nation’s telecom networks. Hackers are still happily exploiting the SS7 flaw that lets governments and bad actors&#160;spy on [&#8230;]

Last year, we wrote about a very silly lawsuit that some big music publishers had filed against ExTwitter, making some silly claims about how copyright law works. It basically ignored the existence of the DMCA, which was designed to prevent lawsuits like this one, where there is some infringement happening on the platform, but no [&#8230;]

As the debate over Section 702 continues, more weird stuff keeps happening. For once, there&#8217;s serious opposition to a clean renewal, and it&#8217;s coming from both sides of the legislature. Then there are things like this, which is one of the stranger incidents to accompany a surveillance fight, as reported by Dell Cameron for Wired. [&#8230;]

Over the last few days, we’ve had a few posts about the latest attempt to ban TikTok in the US (and to people who say it’s only a divestiture bill: there is a ban in the language of the bill if ByteDance won’t divest). Yesterday, unsurprisingly, the House voted overwhelmingly, 352 to 65, to pass [&#8230;]
