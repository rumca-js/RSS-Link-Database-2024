<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 14 March 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01846-8">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01846-8</a></p>Limited datasets hinder the accurate prediction of DNA origami structures. A data-driven and physics-informed approach for model training is presented using a graph neural network to facilitate the rapid virtual prototyping of DNA-based nanostructures.
