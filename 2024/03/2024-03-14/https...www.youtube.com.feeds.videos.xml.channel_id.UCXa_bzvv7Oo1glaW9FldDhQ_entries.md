We live in a post P.T. world where you’re never more than a stone’s throw away from a first-person psychological horror game that owes its existence to the brilliant playable teaser, and Reveil has now joined that ever-growing list. 

Owing to the crowded nature of the genre it’s in, as well as how it chooses to execute on some of its own ideas, Reveil is inherently a game that feels overly familiar to its detriment at times, while it’s also let down by a lack of genuine scares and poor writing and voice acting. But with solid art design, surreal environments, strong atmosphere, and some genuinely fun puzzles and small gameplay interactions, it does still manage to deliver an experience with its fair share of strengths.

It's been hard for several games over the past several months, but Starbreeze Studios' Payday 3 can't catch a break. After a disastrous launch where those who purchased couldn't even play it, the co-op heist shooter has faced extensive scrutiny for its design choices, lack of content and quality of life features, progression and no offline mode.

Starbreeze has outlined plans to improve the title over the long term with Operation Medic Bag. However, with a mixed reaction to its first paid DLC, record-low player numbers (especially compared to Payday 2) and the removal of the studio's CEO, it looks like Payday 3 is dead, if not very much close to it.

Here's how this could happen in such a short period and whether the shooter has any chance of making a comeback.
