<p>After posting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKrt1E5fxLg">my deep-dive into the Pi 5's new BCM2712 and RP1 silicon</a> this morning, someone linked me to this GitHub issue: <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1876">Raspberry Pi 5 cannot overclock beyond 3.0GHz due to firmware limit(?)</a>.</p>

<p>For the past few weeks, a few blog readers (most notably, tkaiserâ€”thanks!) commented on PLLs, OPP tables, and DVFS and how something seemed a little off

Why? Mostly out of curiosity, since I'm not a silicon expert by any means.</p>

<p>I also ran into some weird overclocking issues after writing about my experience <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/overclocking-and-underclocking-raspberry-pi-5">overclocking and <em>underclocking</em> the Raspberry Pi 5</a>, and probably spent an unhealthy amount of time (and money) to learn about the clocks, PLLs, and chips on the latest ver
