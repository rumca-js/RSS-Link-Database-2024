For some reason I had an issue with my post that it didnt include the disclaimer regarding selling someone else's 3D designs. I don't know what happened but I specifically mentioned that I am paying for a subscription that allows me to print and sell the designer's models. All that was posted was the title of my post and a photo with no details. It obviously created some confusion and concern. </p> <p>With that said, I still want to share my experience with making a little money with 3D printing. I had seen several posts regarding whether one could make any money off of 3D printing and I just thought I would share my experience. </p> <p>I subscribed to a <a href="https://Printables.com">Printables.com</a> seller that allowed me to printer and sell his designs in the hope that I could maybe sell enough of his designs to at least pay for my filament costs.
