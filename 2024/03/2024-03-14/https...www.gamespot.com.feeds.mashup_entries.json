Meet the Wendigo armor kit for the Chimera armor core, as seen below.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Available in the Halo Infinite shop, this cyclops-themed suit features a metallic skull sinking into the chest piece, and most obviously, a huge eye on the helmet with a green sclera and pink iris. The rest of the armor is mainly gray with pops of bright pink. Needless to say, the cosmetic will definitely stand out in contrast to more traditional Spartan suits in multiplayer matches.</p><div><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\">As you can see, we've had our \uf8ff\u00fc\u00eb\u00c5\u00d4\u220f\u00e8 on you for some time now...<br />Head to the Shop to acquire the Wendigo armor kit for your CHIMERA armor core.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaloCyberShowdownIII?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">#HaloCyberShowdownIII</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/", "source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "tags": [], "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-gets-maybe-its-most-horrifying-cosmetic-yet/1100-6521843/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2024-03-14T13:08:00+00:00", "vote": 0, "user": null, "dead": false, "title": "Halo Infinite Gets Maybe Its Most Horrifying Cosmetic Yet", "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": "https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1813/18138562/4273030-halocyber3.jpg"}, {"permanent": false, "source_obj__id": 126, "age": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "artist": null, "language": "en-us", "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 100, "description": "<div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"6521793 - Monster Hunter Stories Double Pack preorder guide\">    <div class=\"buylink__container\">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class=\"buylink__item\">                  <div class=\"buylink__image-container clickable\">                                            <img alt=\"\" class=\"buylink__image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4272818-monsterhunterstories.png\" />                                 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20\"></a>                              </div>                   <div class=\"buylink__text\">                      <p class=\"buylink__title text-bold\">                        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20\">Preorder Monster Hunter Stories Double Pack<", "source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "tags": [], "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-stories-collection-preorders-are-live-at-amazon/1100-6521793/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2024-03-14T13:00:00+00:00", "vote": 0, "user": null, "dead": false, "title": "Monster Hunter Stories Collection Preorders Are Live At Amazon", "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": "https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1601/16018044/4271950-monster-hunter-stories.jpg"}, {"permanent": false, "source_obj__id": 126, "age": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "artist": null, "language": "en-us", "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 100, "description": "<p>Sony's Madame Web flopped at the box office.
