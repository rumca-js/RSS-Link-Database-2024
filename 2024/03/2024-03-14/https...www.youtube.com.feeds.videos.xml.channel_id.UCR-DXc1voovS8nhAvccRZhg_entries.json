Happy Pi Day, here are some resources if you want to try overclocking *your* Pi 5 beyond 3.0 GHz\u2014but be warned, you will be running experimental firmware if you do this:\n\n  - https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1876\n  - Argon THRML 60mm tower cooler: https://amzn.to/43gYmPM\n  - My video on Pi silicon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKrt1E5fxLg\n\nAnd yes, Argon sent this particular unit to me, though I have another one I purchased separately at home. This video isn't sponsored, and there are a variety of great cooling options that should work with most overclocks.\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\nMerch: https://redshirtjeff.com\n2nd Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/GeerlingEngineering\n\n#PiDay\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - I was wrong.\n01:13 - Cooling for an overclock\n03:18 - Flashing the O", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg", "tags": [], "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTIkZBsVJyA", "date_published": "2024-03-14T20:49:38+00:00", "vote": 0, "user": null, "dead": false, "title": "Overclocking Raspberry Pi 5 to 3.14 GHz on Pi Day", "page_rating": 94, "page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/TTIkZBsVJyA/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"permanent": false, "source_obj__id": 161, "age": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "artist": null, "language": null, "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 94, "description": "Visit https://brilliant.org/JeffGeerling to start your 30-day free trial, and get 20% off your annual subscription!\n\nThe Raspberry Pi 5 can't be overclocked past 3 GHz.
