		In Georgia, a bill may require users for some websites to submit identification in order to gain access. The legislation proposed refers explicitly to the use of “digitized identification cards.”

The state launched <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/georgia-mdl-now-available-on-google-wallet-for-android-users-other-states-follow">mobile driver’s licenses</a> (mDLs) supplied by Idemia last year.

<a href="https://legiscan.com/GA/bill/HB910/2023">House Bill 910</a> cleared a House vote on February 29th by a 165-to-1 margin, and a Senate reading took place on March 4, according to <a href="https://www.govtech.com/policy/georgia-bill-would-require-id-for-certain-website-access">Government Technology</a>.

		Lawmakers in the U.S. state of Illinois finally are debating a viable way to save businesses using biometric scanners mountainous fines when they violate local data privacy law.

But pols think they have a way to also protect people’s identifiers from being misused in ways that would disadvantage them for life.

Ever since the first huge fines were handed down as a result of Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act class actions, the question has been asked: When will politicians act on growing business frustration and even anger? The Illinois statehouse is as adept at currying favor from moneyed interests as any other government, if not moreso.

BIPA was enacted (and ignored) in 2008 to give people more control over their identifiers in business

And it looks like deregulation, to at least some extent, will be part of the change envisioned by the government.

Decades after international terrorism made the fight against money laundering a priority in developed economies – and years after Brexit shook the UK’s trade practices – the government is considering tinkering with AML regulations.

<strong>October 24, 2024</strong>

The world of digital identity is moving into a state of maturity after many years of experimentation. Driving forces such as citizen expectations, remote working, complicated identity verification processes, and increasing fraud levels, have shifted the ‘dial of identity’ to red hot. Governments the world over are crystallising their ideas and turning to thought leaders in the identity space to find elegant ways to identify their citizens.

		Ukraine is preparing a law that will help it unify its public video surveillance system – and sparking concerns among non-governmental organizations about the extent of biometric data collection.

The draft Law on a Unified System of Video Monitoring of Public Security, known as Bill <a href="https://itd.rada.gov.ua/billInfo/Bills/Card/43733">No. 11031</a>, was submitted to the Ukraine parliament in February. The bill is an attempt to bring order into the Eastern European country’s already existing surveillance systems, including Safe City projects, Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Leonid Tymchenko <a href="https://lb.ua/society/2024/02/22/599766_mvs_prokomentuvali_zakonoproiekt.html">explained</a> to local media while presenting the law.

		Software development company <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/smart-engines">Smart Engines</a> has developed AI for multi-document  recognition to fight fraud.

The AI can recognize dozens of documents in a single frame, allowing for banks to provide a more streamlined identity verification process while protecting themselves against fraud.

Users save time by surpassing having to submit individual shots of different documents. The multi-document recognition also minimizes the risk of fraudsters generating or editing document images to get past identity verification.

The system can detect different documents, recognizes necessary fields, and detects traces of editing and alterations. The system can detect if a document is inserted into the
