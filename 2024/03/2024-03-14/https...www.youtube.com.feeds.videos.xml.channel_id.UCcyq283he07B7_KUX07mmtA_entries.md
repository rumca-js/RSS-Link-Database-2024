Papa Johns is the third-largest pizza delivery chain in the world. It makes all its own dough out of massive quality-control centers. While those centers have largely been automated, Papa Johns didn't touch the in-store pizza-making process. That is, until 2020. During high-pressure pizza days like Super Bowl Sunday, the company found a pain point: Stretching the dough by hand took too long. So the Atlanta test kitchen stepped in to develop a dough spinner that takes 13 seconds of make-time. Now, it's in 75% of North American stores. We went behind the scenes with Papa Johns six days before the Super Bowl to see how all this new tech is faring during crunch time.
