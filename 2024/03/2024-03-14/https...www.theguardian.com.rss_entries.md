<p>A marvellous history of science vs creationism in Victorian Britain</p><p>During the English civil war, in hiding and in boredom, the Archbishop of Armagh, James Ussher, set about pinning down the&nbsp;date of creation. A decade down the&nbsp;line, he publicised his research findings with breathtaking self-assurance: the world was a sprightly 6,000 years old. More specifically, God had created it on a Saturday night in October 4004BC. As it was, his hunch was a few zeros off the mark. The Earth was, in fact, formed 4.6bn years ago.</p><p>Growing up in Ulster’s Bible belt, the historian Michael Taylor writes, Ussher’s chronology was “a matter of regional pride”. Impossible Monsters may not go down especially well back home, then, because its subject is the twin assault on Ussher’s view that came during the 19th century: Charles Lyell’s uniformitarian geology and Charles Darwin’s evolutionary biology.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/14/impossible-mons

## The biggest myth about Maria Callas? She was no tragic icon

<p>Her legend is traduced by the narrative she was abandoned by a man and went on a downward spiral: she was not self-destructive but highly self-aware, as I found when writing a novel about her</p><p>Although she was born a hundred years ago, Maria Callas remains the best-selling classical singer of all time. But when I tell people I have written a novel about her, the reaction comes with a sigh: “Oh Maria, such a talent, but what a tragedy.” All because Callas was left by a man. In 1968, the singer’s lover of nine years, the “Golden Greek” shipowner Aristotle Onassis, ended his relationship with her in order to marry the former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy. The story of Callas, much like the storylines of the romantic operas in which she starred, goes that she was betrayed by the man she loved before going into a decline that ended in her death eight years later.</p><p>Callas is not alone in being mythologised as the great female singer who dies unhappy and alone: Judy Gar

Having dominated headlines in the 2010s, the WikiLeaks founder has dropped out of sight having been confined at London’s Belmarsh prison since 2019. And that was kind of the plan, this impassioned documentary asserts, with the aid of staunch defenders including the late John Pilger, Tariq Ali, Jill Stein, Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsworth and Assange family members. “The persecution of Julian has been a long, slow form of killing somebody,” says Pilger; witnessing Assange’s trajectory from a buccaneering truth-teller to a frail, mentally damaged prisoner, perpetually denied justice, it’s hard to disagree.</p><p>According to this documentary by Australian film-maker Kym Staton, Assange has been subject to a coordinated smear campaign.

In truth, Russian voters have no genuine choice this weekend, since Putin has killed his most formidable opponent, Alexei Navalny, and ordered the disqualification of any other candidate who presented even a small chance of genuine competition. This plebiscitary legitimating procedure – quite familiar from the history of other dictatorships – will also be implemented in some parts of eastern Ukraine, which Russian official sources describe as the New Territories.
