Researchers uncovered the mechanistic details behind how several proteins interact to help cells recognize and remove damaged mitochondria. Optineurin (OPTN) and its interactions are needed to provide a contact site for another protein, Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), during this process. The OPTN-TBK1 relationship is necessary for these mitochondria to be recognized and eliminated from the cell. This mechanism may have relevance for developing drugs to treat Parkinson's disease.
