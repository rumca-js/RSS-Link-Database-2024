We will use the example of how we are introducing broader naming conventions across the company\u2019s massive C++ codebase, impacting our package management infrastructure and build tools. We will describe the lessons we\u2019ve learned and the pitfalls we fell into as we were trying to achieve that goal, so that attendees can apply these lessons within their own organizations when introducing their own set of C++ rules.\n\nThis will also highlight the value of journalism skills in approaching engineering questions. Most important are the willingness to seek out all sides of a question; being humble enough to truly listen to even your loudest critics; and the endurance to keep asking questions until the issu", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "tags": [], "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bth3PFsrsw", "date_published": "2024-03-14T16:04:12+00:00", "vote": 0, "user": null, "dead": false, "title": "Building Consensus on a Set of Rules for Our Massive C++ Codebase - Sherry Sontag - CppCon 2023", "page_rating": 94, "page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/-Bth3PFsrsw/hqdefault.jpg"}]
