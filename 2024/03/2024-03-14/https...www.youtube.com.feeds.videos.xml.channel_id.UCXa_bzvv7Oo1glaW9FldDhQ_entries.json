But with solid art design, surreal environments, strong atmosphere, and some genuinely fun puzzles and small gameplay interactions, it does still manage to deliver an experience with its fair share of strengths.", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "tags": [], "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxxhiSTa-2g", "date_published": "2024-03-14T20:00:23+00:00", "vote": 0, "user": null, "dead": false, "title": "Reveil PS5 Review - A P.T.

After a disastrous launch where those who purchased couldn't even play it, the co-op heist shooter has faced extensive scrutiny for its design choices, lack of content and quality of life features, progression and no offline mode.\n\nStarbreeze has outlined plans to improve the title over the long term with Operation Medic Bag. However, with a mixed reaction to its first paid DLC, record-low player numbers (especially compared to Payday 2) and the removal of the studio's CEO, it looks like Payday 3 is dead, if not very much close to it.\n\nHere's how this could happen in such a short period and whether the shooter has any chance of making a comeback.", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "tags": [], "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-a99RGQIpU", "date_published": "2024-03-14T13:30:17+00:00", "vote": 0, "user": null, "dead": false, "title": "HOW PAYDAY 3 DIED", "page_rating": 94, "page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/e-a99RGQIpU/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"permanent": false, "source_obj__id": 129, "age": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "artist": "GamingBolt", "language": null, "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 94, "description": "After a rather muddled presentation the dust has settled on Microsoft\u2019s newly announced multi-platform strategy and arguably the best game revealed to be heading to its rival console is Hi-Fi Rush. \n\nThis rhythm-action experience carved a reputation for itself as one of 2023\u2019s most hyped, most unique, and endlessly memorable games.
