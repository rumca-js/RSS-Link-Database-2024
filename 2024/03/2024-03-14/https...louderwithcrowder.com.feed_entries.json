That is no longer the status quo as this act is not only condoned, it is glorified and uplifted as if the man is braver than a War World II vet. And on top of that, anyone who has a problem with this will be punished. </p><p>Libs of TikTok posted a video of a woman from Alaska who claims to have exposed a man shaving in the female locker room when a 12-year-old girl was present. However, you cannot do that in America where trans rights override women\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rights. Subsequently, Planet Fitness not only could care less but they were enraged that this woman had the nerve to think about a minor being exposed by a man instead of being inclusive.
