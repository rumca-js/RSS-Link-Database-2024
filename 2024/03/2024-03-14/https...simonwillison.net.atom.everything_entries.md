<p>Gunpei Yokoi&#x27;s product design philosophy at Nintendo (&quot;Withered&quot; is also sometimes translated as &quot;Weathered&quot;). Use &quot;mature technology that can be mass-produced cheaply&quot;, then apply lateral thinking to find radical new ways to use it.</p>

<p>This has echos for me of Dan McKinley&#x27;s &quot;Choose Boring Technology&quot;, which argues that in software projects you should default to a proven, stable stack so you can focus your innovation tokens on the problems that are unique to your project.</p>

<p>I&#x27;ve been hoping to find something like this for years. Guidepup is &quot;a screen reader driver for test automation&quot; - you can use it to automate both VoiceOver on macOS and NVDA on Windows, and it can both drive the screen reader for automated tests and even produce a video at the end of the test.</p>

<p>Also available: @guidepup/playwright, providing integration with the Playwright browser automation testing framework.</p>

<p>I&#x27;d love to see open source JavaScript libraries both use something like this for their testing and publish videos of the tests to demonstrate how they work in these common screen readers.</p>
