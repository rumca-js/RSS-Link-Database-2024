In this video, we'll be sharing some useful tips and tricks for mastering Helldivers 2. We'll go over things that we have discovered and that the community has found to make you a better player.

We'll also cover how to rapidly fire the Arc Thrower and why you should use powerful and lesser-known Stratagems and weapons such as the Jump Pack, Smoke Strike, and Impact grenades. If you are a solo player, we'll give you some stealth tips such as taking the starting Peacemaker pistol along. Additionall
