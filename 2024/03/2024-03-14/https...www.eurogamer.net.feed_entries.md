Fen Research, the studio founded by original RuneScape designer Andrew Gower, has unveiled Brighter Shores - a "cosy" new free-to-play fantasy MMORPG coming to PC and Mac later this year that promises a "relaxing respite from daily life".
</p><p>
Brighter Shores, which is said to have been ten years in the making, whisks players away to the peaceful coastal town of Hopeport, where they'll initially take on the role of town guard. Soon, however, they'll find themselves venturing beyond the town walls "as they learn of a greater threat across the fantastical world of Adothria."
</p><p>
There's talk of "quirky characters, fascinating foes and captivating locations" for players to encounter as they explore the world, having adopted one of three classes: Cryoknight, Hammermage, or Guardian. These options are supposed to mark a

Hey everyone, today we're saying a very fond farewell to Aoife Wilson, Eurogamer's veteran Head of Video, as she heads on to an exciting new role outside the Gamer Network family after nearly a decade with us.
</p><p>
Aoife deserves an enormous thank you for all the years of hard work she's put into Eurogamer's video output, where she's grown a brilliant community of viewers alongside Ian and Zoe, and for her contributions right here on the site.
</p><p>
When she joined Eurogamer, back in 2014, I remember being immediately impressed by her talent, experience, and encyclopedic knowledge of Marvel comics and Japanese RPGs. Though one of my fondest memories is the year we spent recording the occaisonal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcadia-baes-a-life-is-strange-spoilercast">Arcadia Baes</a> podcast series - discussing an

What would that be like?</p><p>I don't mind that it probably wouldn't work, or that it works perfectly well as it is. I don't fully know what I'm responding to, even. Maybe it's the sense of being low to the ground in a world that unfurls towards the horizon, a world which is pushing me forwards to adventure. I don't get this from actual 3D Mario games, which tend towards the toybox-like. But I get it from Penny's Big Breakaway. In a strange, hard-to-pin-down manner, it's the action game I want when I play Mario Ka

A high-profile Pok&eacute;mon Go player and streamer has had his game account hacked and some of his rarest Pok&eacute;mon deleted, ruining countless hours of play. 
</p><p>
FleeceKing holds the Guinness World Record for being the first player to hit Pok&eacute;mon Go's current Level 50 cap. After playing the game since 2017, he's caught more than 2 million Pok&eacute;mon to date. 
</p><p>
Last night, FleeceKing reported his account as being hacked after footage was posted to social media platform X showing someone else using his account - and deleting FleeceKing's favourite Pok&eacute;mon.

Troubled video game publisher Embracer has announced the sale of more of its assets - this time, large portions of Saber Interactive, for the price of $247m.
</p><p>
In a financial call this morning, Embracer said the sale means it will cease all operations in Russia, something that will help it "reduce [its] geopolitical risk" - though the buyer, a company named Beacon Interactive, is founded by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch. 
</p><p>
In terms of actual studios, the deal will see Embracer sell off  all Saber Interactive-branded studios, plus New World Interactive, Nimble Giant Entertainment, 3D Realms, Slipgate Ironworks, Mad Head Games, Fractured Byte and Sandbox Strategies.
