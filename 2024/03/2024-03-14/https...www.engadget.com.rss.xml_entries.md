<p>If you're ready to commit to <a href="https://auth.max.com/product">a year of Max</a>, you can do so for a 40 percent discount. Right now, every tier of the streaming service is on sale — that includes the ad-free, 4K version for $140 annually, which works out to $12 per month instead of the regular $20 monthly. The least expensive sub is ad-supported and goes for $70 yearly, or $5.83 per month as opposed to $10. Between the two is an ad-free level <a href="https://www.engadget.com/legacy-hbo-max-ad-free-subscribers-will-lose-access-to-4k-streams-soon-092315829.html">without 4K</a> support that's going for $105 for the year, when you'd usually pay $192 for 12 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The deal is open to all new subscribers. Existing subscribers who buy their service direct from Max.com can also take advantage. If you're a returning subscriber and previously went through Max.com, the Apple App Store or Google Play, you can also get the discount. Unfortunately, onl

<p>One day after a bill that could lead to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/house-passes-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok-144805114.html"><ins>a ban</ins></a> of TikTok in the United States passed the House of Representatives, the company is doubling down on its strategy of urging users to call lawmakers. The app began pushing new in-app messages to users asking them to "tell your Senator how important TikTok is to you” and to “ask them to vote not on the TikTok ban.”</p>
<p>The new alerts are the second such message TikTok has pushed to users about the bill. Prior to the House vote, the company <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-is-encouraging-its-users-to-call-their-representatives-about-attempts-to-ban-the-app-202056111.html"><ins>prompted users</ins></a> to call their representatives in the House.

## The FCC just quadrupled the download speed required to market internet as ‘broadband’

<p>The FCC has <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401205A1.pdf">raised the speeds</a> required to describe internet service as “broadband” for the first time since 2015. The agency’s annual high-speed internet assessment concluded that 100 Mbps downloads and 20 Mbps uploads will be the new standard. The news will likely irk ISPs who would love to keep pointing to 25 Mbps / 3 Mbps speeds (the previous standards) and convincing people they’re getting high-speed broadband.</p>
<p>The FCC’s report broke down several areas where the country’s online infrastructure falls short. The agency concluded that broadband isn’t being deployed quickly enough to serve Americans, especially those in rural areas and those living on Tribal lands. “These gaps in deployment are not closing rapidly enough,” the agency wrote in its report.</p>

<p>Google for Developers disclosed the date in annoying fashion. It asked folks to complete a tedious logic puzzle (think of the path puzzles from <em>BioShock</em>). Once enough people kindly finished all 15 levels and got a marble to its destination over and over again, Google announced when I/O will be happening. It will again be a one-day event this year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/spacex/">SpaceX</a> hoped the third time would be the charm as it attempted another test of its Starship rocket. This third launch did indeed go well, with the Starship successfully launching at 9:25AM ET. Shortly after launch, it succesfully completed the hot-staging separation from the Super Heavy Booster, and the Starship successfully ignited the second-stage Raptor engines. It's currently coasting and the Raptor engines are planned to be re-lit about 40 minutes after initial take off. The Super Heavy Booster, meanwhile, went into a semi-controlled descent; its engines didn't fully re-ignite as planned prior to splashdown. We should hear more about what worked and didn't work in that phase of testing once everything is finished.</p>
<p>The previous two efforts ended in failure, though Starship did <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-loses-another-starship-after-rocket-explodes-during-test-flight-143503845.html">reach space on t

<p>It can be quite annoying to click through an Amazon ad in your results only to find out that the product you want can't be shipped to your place. Now, imagine you're the small business owner being charged for those ads. (Forget corporations and drop shippers, I know you all hate them.) There you are, thinking you're going to make a killing based on how much ad action you're getting. Except those ads don't translate to sales, because Amazon has been serving them to people who can't even buy your products. That's apparently what happened to at least one seller who told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-14/amazon-says-it-sold-ads-for-products-shoppers-couldn-t-buy?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=tech&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> that he was charged between $200,000 and $300,000 for ads served to California residents, where he can't sell his adv

Energy-efficient homes are designed to be more sealed, too, so they trap more pollutants inside. From cooking emissions and cleaning chemicals to fragrances and pets, a lot of everyday things can make the air inside your home less than ideal. The best thing you can do to improve your indoor air quality is open up windows and doors, as long as the air outside isn’t unhealthy. But if letting in fresh air isn’t an option, air purifiers can help reduce the level of pollutants, while also removing odors and trapping some bacteria and mold. There are hundreds of models from dozens of brands on the market, so we tested a handful and put together

<p>A bill that could force a sale or outright ban on TikTok passed the House of Representatives just days after it was first introduced. It now goes to the senate.</p>
<p>The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (no, we’re not calling it PAFACAA) is the latest attempt by the government to constrain TikTok. If it passes, it could have one of two outcomes: The parent company sells TikTok to a US-based owner, or it faces a ban from US app stores and web hosting services.</p>
<p>Of course, TikTok opposes the bill, saying it’s unconstitutional. But they’re not the only ones: Free speech and digital rights groups also object to the bill, with many noting that comprehensive privacy laws would be more effective at protecting Americans’ user data rather than trying to single out one app.</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Fight for the Future and the Center for Democracy and Technology argued the b

At the same time, Proton is also releasing its app for Linux users in beta.</p>
<p>If you've used Proton Mail before (or any recent / modern mail client), the app won't be a surprise —it's the standard three-pane view, with different folders on the left, a list of message in the middle and a preview of the message contents on the right.

<p>Depending on how much stuff you need to plug in, your laptop may not have enough ports to support it all — particularly if you have more wired accessories than Bluetooth ones. Docking stations add different combinations of Ethernet, HDMI, DisplayPort, 3.5mm, memory card and USB connections and, unlike simple hubs, are often DC-powered. For those who switch up their working location regularly, a docking station can make it easier to swap between a fully-connected desk setup and a simple laptop, since just one port links your computer to the dock. Which docking station you should get depends in part on what you want to plug in, but sifting through the hundreds of models out there can be tough. We tried out a dozen different options to help you narrow down the best docking station for your needs.</p>
<h2>What to look for in a docking station</h2>
<p>First and foremost, consider what you need to plug in. This will likely be the deciding factor when you go to actually buy a doc

<p>The SEC officials investigating Elon Musk over his handling of the Twitter takeover seem to be growing more and more impatient with his legal antics. The two sides have been locked in a dispute over Musk’s refusal to testify in the investigation.Now, in a new filing, the SEC accuses Musk of trying to “misrepresent” the regulator’s investigation. “Musk continues to distort the true scope of this investigation – his only hope for establishing that the SEC is not seeking relevant evidence,” the SEC writes in a court document.</p>
