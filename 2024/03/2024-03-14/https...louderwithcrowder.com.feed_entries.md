And Governor Greg Abbott responded by saying what anyone with half a brain would say: "Bye. Don‚Äôt come back.‚Äù </p><p>SXSW then responded to Abbott with a bunch of gobbledygook. </p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more crucial than ever that we come together to solve these greater humanitarian issues,‚Äù the festival said in response. </p><p>Unfortunately, I have no idea what that means or how that is even a response but I digress. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

That is no longer the status quo as this act is not only condoned, it is glorified and uplifted as if the man is braver than a War World II vet. And on top of that, anyone who has a problem with this will be punished. </p><p>Libs of TikTok posted a video of a woman from Alaska who claims to have exposed a man shaving in the female locker room when a 12-year-old girl was present. However, you cannot do that in America where trans rights override women‚Äôs rights. Subsequently, Planet Fitness not only could care less but they were enraged that this woman had the nerve to think about a minor being exposed by a man instead of being inclusive. As punishment, her membership was revoked. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet

That is the best they can do. </p><p>I know what you are thinking and I agree. Yes, the Toronto Police Department is very, very pathetic. </p><p>But we know what happens when officials condone a culture of lawlessness.

## NAACP to Black athletes: Don't play for a Florida school until they bring back DEI Programs

But it appears that the NAACP does as they have just suggested that black students should not apply for schools in the State of Florida due to the elimination of DEI. But that form of logic only makes sense if the organization believes that black students are not smart enough to make it on their own. Which is asinine but don't expect much more than a lack of common sense from these people.  </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
