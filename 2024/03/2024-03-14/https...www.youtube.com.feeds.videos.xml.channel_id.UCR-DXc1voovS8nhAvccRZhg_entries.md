Some said it couldn't be done. In fact, *I* said it couldn't be done, this morning!

Then I did it! Happy Pi Day, here are some resources if you want to try overclocking *your* Pi 5 beyond 3.0 GHzâ€”but be warned, you will be running experimental firmware if you do this:

  - https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1876
  - Argon THRML 60mm tower cooler: https://amzn.to/43gYmPM
  - My video on Pi silicon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKrt1E5fxLg

And yes, Argon sent this particular unit to me, though I have another one I purchased separately at home. This video isn't sponsored, and there are a variety of great cooling options that should work with most overclocks.

The Raspberry Pi 5 can't be overclocked past 3 GHz. Why? The secret is hidden in the silicon deep inside.

X-rays don't go deep enough. This video explores modern CPU architecture, clocks and PLLs (Phase-Locked Loops), silicon die shots, and even transistor-level debugging with an electron microscope!

Huge thanks to Kleindeik Nanotechnik and John McMaster for working with me on this project, to image the bare silicon die of the BCM2712 - the SoC that powers the Raspberry Pi 5.

More info in my blog post: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/die-shots-and-transistor-level-debugging-on-raspberry-pi-5

I will also link to my long form video with even more shots and information about the Pi 5's SoC and it's little 'southbridge' chip, the RP1, designed by Raspberry Pi themselves!
