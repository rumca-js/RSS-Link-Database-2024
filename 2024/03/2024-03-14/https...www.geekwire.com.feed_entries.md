Mayor Harrell submitted new legislation to the City Council on Thursday that includes exemptions and cost reductions meant to ease the process of office-to-residential conversions. “While we know there remains a need for office space, this effort will give us flexibility to help optimize our built environment and create the downtown we want to see — a thriving workplace and vibrant community for families&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-mayor-proposes-legislation-to-help-convert-commercial-real-estate-for-residential-uses/">Read More</a>

One area is dominated by a two-story, silver tower where engineers test the flow of liquid over mock reactor fuel rods. An enclosed space nearby features a network of insulated pipes that bear a vague resemblance to an oversized hamster Habitrail, but in fact are used to study heat transfer between melted salts and metal. Inside an oxygen-free sealed glove box, molten sodium spins in a glass beaker. &#8220;We are definitely in a mode&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/just-watch-us-gates-backed-terrapower-is-bullish-on-being-the-first-next-gen-nuclear-plant-in-u-s/">Read More</a>

The company, CreatorsAGI, was incorporated in January and is still in stealth mode. CreatorsAGI wants to give authors, YouTubers, media producers, and other creators a way to build AI assistants that reflect their own content or personality — and earn money through a new revenue stream.
