<p></p><p>Where next for Aston Villa on this European odyssey? The road to Athens, as is Uefa’s strapline for the Europa Conference League, continues. Their adventure to date has taken them to Alkmaar, Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Mostar and Warsaw. For those fortunate enough to savour an electric night under the lights here, the foldout map at the back of the programme handily displayed their potential opponents in Friday’s quarter-final draw. By the end, Villa supporters were the ones singing Bob Marley’s Three Little Birds, Ajax’s adopted anthem.</p><p>The only sore note was the sight of Ollie Watkins, who opened the scoring, heading down the tunnel after failing to shake off a knee problem. Unai Emery quickly poured cold water on the initial fears though, suggesting the England striker could be fit for Sunday’s Premier League trip to West Ham. Leon Bailey said Watkins’s knee “looked really bad” on first viewing. “It is a cut on his knee,” Emery said. “Maybe for Sunday he could b

<p>England can build on their impressive display against Ireland to outmanoeuvre France’s formidable forwards in Lyon </p><p>It is not every season that England can boast a more impressive Test record in France than their Gallic hosts. Six wins and a one‑point defeat in seven World Cup games on French soil within the past seven months is not the worst of springboards into the final weekend of Six Nations games, particularly as <em>Les Bleus</em> have failed to secure a victory in any of their last three outings at home.</p><p>Not since 1999, when the Five Nations was still in existence, have France gone through an entire championship without a single home victory, which may explain the lack of experimentation in their unchanged match-day 23 for this weekend’s fixture. The subtext is clear enough: France are taking this game seriously even if this particular version of Le Crunch is not as era-defining as some of its predecessors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/

<p>She’s looked after teenagers, rape survivors and trafficked sex workers<strong> </strong>– and assisted at terminations while she’s been pregnant herself. Still, she wouldn’t change her job for anything.</p><p>Juno Carey, a pseudonym, is a midwife practitioner who has worked in an abortion clinic for the last eight years. She lives with her wife and their three children – the baby’s at home when I meet her, along with Carey’s sister, who’s looking after him. Carey is tidy and serene, the woman you’d single out in a playground if you needed a tissue, or a hairbrush, or some nice word on a bad day.</p><p>She has written a book about abortion that is not at all serene, but deeply knowledgable, full of conviction and not even trying to keep the peace.

As a country, we need to be able to call out the appalling attacks by Hamas on 7 October, push for the release of hostages and also condemn the horrific loss of life in Gaza. And we must play our part in providing aid and assistance.</p><p>The crisis in Gaza is a diplomatic test for Australia. It is a test for our leaders’ ability to prioritise social cohesion and ultimately a test of our moral fibre. Are we willing to be our own country, condemn the appalling loss of life in Gaza and step up our efforts to provide support?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/14/the-crisis-in-gaza-is-a-diplomatic-test-for-australia-we-must-do-better-as-a-country">Continue reading...</a>
