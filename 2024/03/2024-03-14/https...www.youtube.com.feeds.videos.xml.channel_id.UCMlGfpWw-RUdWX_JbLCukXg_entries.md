Building Consensus on a Set of Rules for Our Massive C++ Codebase - Sherry Sontag - CppCon 2023

In this talk, we will trace our efforts to build consensus across our Engineering department on how we use C++ at Bloomberg.

We will describe the lessons we’ve learned and the pitfalls we fell into as we were trying to achieve that goal, so that attendees can apply these lessons within their own organizations when introducing their own set of C++ rules.

This will also highlight the value of journalism skills in approaching engineering questions. Most important are the willingness to seek out all sides of a question; being humble enough to truly listen to even your loudest critics; and the endurance to keep asking questions until the issu
