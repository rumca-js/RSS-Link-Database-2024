In today's Daily Fix:
Aspyr's remastered collection of the classic Star Wars: Battlefront games is having a very rough launch. Server issues kept most gamers from playing, and there are reports that only 3 servers, supporting just 200 people total, were live. And speaking of Aspyr, their Knights of the Old Republic remake is still stuck in development hell, but is being kept alive somewhat by fellow developer, Saber Interactive. Saber, meanwhile, was able to get out from under the Embracer Group's thumb, taking with them several projects. And finally, the newers premium warbond for Helldivers 2 is live, so unlock some extra weapon add-ons and get back in the fight.

## The Resident Evil Game That Can't Be Remade

Resident Evil 5 simply can’t be remade, at least not to the standards of Capcom’s best work. And so the answer is not to remake RE5, but to rewrite.

With the release of the Resident Evil 4 remake release last year, Capcom’s project to remake the glory years of its survival horror series is complete. So the big question is: where next? The obvious answer is a Resident Evil 5 remake. But on the game’s 15th anniversary, it’s clear that moving forward chronologically will take Capcom’s remakes into the series’ weakest era – an era of gameplay and narrative decisions best left in the past.

## Road House Review

Don't miss our Road House 2024 review! Reviewed by Rafael Motamayor, narrated by Mark Medina.

Road House trades '80s earnest silliness with a Saturday-morning-cartoon tone that manages – barely – to overcome its flaws. The original’s bouncer-versus-businessman plot is refashioned and almost given some thematic weight, pitting a charismatic Jake Gyllenhaal against a feral Conor McGregor. (Not that you can really see them going head to head amidst the murky cinematography and computer-generated fisticuffs.) This is the movie equivalent of a band performing at a seedy bar while drunks chuck bottles at the stage’s chicken-wire barrier. You can hear some cool music if you really try, but everything is working against it.

Outcast: A New Beginning reviewed by Dan Stapleton on PC. Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5.

Thanks to its wildly customizable weapons and versatile Iron Man-like jetpack, Outcast: A New Beginning actually does feel like the start of an open-world adventure that’s different from pretty much everything else out there. It’s clearly not a big-budget game, but the freedom it gives you and its ability to laugh at itself make up for a lot of its weaknesses, such as character animations and some overly long questlines filled with busywork. Once you get to know the Talans and appreciate their goofy sci-fi babble, this becomes a charming and colorful world to spend a few dozen hours blasting robots in.

Don't miss our Pokemon Horizons review! Pokemon Horizons: The Series Season 1 is reviewed by Kirsten Carey, narrated by Seth Macy.

Pokémon Horizons is no Pokémon Concierge, and it very much has the energy of a children’s action-adventure series – it’s the new mainline Pokémon show, so what can you expect? But with a delightful cast of new Pokémon (especially the grass cat and the screaming gator ball), a new mystery-driven plot, and a cast of characters with room to grow, at least the post-Ash era is off to a promising start.
