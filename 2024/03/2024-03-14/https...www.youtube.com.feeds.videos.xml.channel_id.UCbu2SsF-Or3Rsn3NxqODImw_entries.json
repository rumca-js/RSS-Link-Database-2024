In the meantime we\u2019re just here to have fun with more community finds, items you shouldn\u2019t sleep on, and more things you might have missed in Helldivers 2.\n\nIn this video, we'll be sharing some useful tips and tricks for mastering Helldivers 2. We'll go over things that we have discovered and that the community has found to make you a better player. We'll discuss the new Prototype 16 armor and what to watch out for, creative ways to use the Exo-45 Patriot Exosuit, how to avoid being killed by newbies with Tesla Tower, and why Scout armor is still the best option. We'll also cover how to rapidly fire the Arc Thrower and why you should use powerful and lesser-known Stratagems and weapons such as the Jump Pack, Smoke Strike, and Impact grenades. If you are a solo player, we'll give you some stealth tips such as taking the starting Peacemaker pistol along.
