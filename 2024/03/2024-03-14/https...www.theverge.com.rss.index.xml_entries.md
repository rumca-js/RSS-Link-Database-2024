  <p id="HEuPlJ">Intel is launching its flagship Core i9-14900KS processor today, with clock speeds that boost all the way up to 6.2GHz. That’s 200MHz more than the previous Core i9-13900KS that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/12/23551748/intel-6ghz-processor-core-i9-13900k-release-date-price">launched last year</a> and was the first desktop processor to break the 6GHz barrier at stock speeds.</p>
<p id="0s2g5r">This new Core i9-14900KS will be priced at $699, the same as the previous 13900KS, and will be available in stores today. The 6.2GHz max turbo frequency is an out-of-the-box boost, so there could be room for overclocking to push these speeds even further. The 14
