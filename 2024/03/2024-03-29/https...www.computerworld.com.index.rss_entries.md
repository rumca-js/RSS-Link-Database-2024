<p>The marketing hype surrounding AI broadly — and generative AI (genAI) more specifically — is becoming tiresome. You can't open an article or watch a news video without running into at least a reference to it. We may be approaching the point at which we stop breathlessly extolling its virtues (and dreading some of its outcomes).</p><p>The hype is so extreme that a fall-out, which Gartner describes in its <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">technology hype cycle reports</a> as the "trough of disillusionment," seems inevitable and might be coming this year. That's a testament to both genAI’s burgeoning potential and a sign of the technology's immaturity.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3714940/ai-is-on-a-fast-track-but-hype-and-immaturity-could-derail-it.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Though most companies have settled on return-to-office (RTO) policies now that COVID-19 is <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/05/1136367" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">no longer considered a global health emergency</a>, many continue to adjust their practices, often to the detriment of their workforce.</p><p>Several workforce surveys over the past three months have revealed that employees do not view mandated RTO policies favorably, even when hybrid, because the guidelines are often too rigid.</p><p>During the pandemic, employees became comfortable with flexible work arrangements. When people have the chance to work flexibly, 87% of them take it, according to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/real-estate/our-insights/americans-are-embracing-flexible-work-and-they-want-more-of-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a 2022 study</a> by global management consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href
