My previous full ost upload was emulated only and had flute problems in the title tune. Later the title theme was uploaded with correct flute (real A1200 gameplay rec). Since then i have recorded the full ost from real A500r6a gameplay (floppy version, no WHDLoad here). So here is the "machine appropriate" (game release 1989, no A1200 yet at that time) upload of the truly full ost, ending tune included. All other uploads have now been removed.
