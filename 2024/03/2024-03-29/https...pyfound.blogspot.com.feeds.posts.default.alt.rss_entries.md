<p>The PSF received an <a href="https://pythonafrica.blogspot.com/2023/12/an-open-letter-to-python-software_5.html" target="_blank">open letter</a> asking us, amongst other things, to look into some of our recent grant decisions and make recommendations to the PSF Board for improving the Grants Program.
