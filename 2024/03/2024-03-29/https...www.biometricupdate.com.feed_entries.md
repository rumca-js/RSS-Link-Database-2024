		Retail biometrics are growing rapidly, but stakeholder consultation, testing, and policy development must be prioritized to guard against the technology’s potential risks.

These were key insights shared during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/biometrics-institute">Biometrics Institute</a>’s On the Pulse Conversation video series, which features a discussion on “<a href="https://youtu.be/INN0vsqnxM0?si=UIjcVvP_yMOfm_2F">Considerations for using biometrics in retail</a>.”

Institute CEO Isabelle Moeller and Advisory Council Member and Digital Identity Group Head Brett Feldon discussed possible hurdles related to misidentification and handling sensitive data, and the benefits of biometrics that they say can make dealing with those

		British citizens support police use of biometric identification and verification systems – but they remain skeptical about private organizations’ use of biometric data, new research from the Alan Turing Institute has shown.

The survey sheds light on public attitudes toward the use of biometric technology by UK law enforcement agencies just as the country’s government is preparing a major <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/uks-230-million-plan-to-implement-police-facial-recognition-and-drones">US$295 million investment</a> into policing technology that will include facial recognition systems.

Conducted by the Institute’s Centre for Emerging Technology and Security (CETaS), the research also revealed that despite regular warnings from digital rights grou

		Fans entered several stadiums with biometrics during the opening day of the 2024 Major League Baseball (MLB) season, and the league has high hopes for the touchless access program.

The Washington Nationals added biometric ticketing to their opening day lineup through MLB’s Go-Ahead Entry. The introduction of Go-Ahead Entry allows fans attending Nationals games to use the MLB Ballpark app for touchless entry at gates equipped with dedicated hardware.

Fans using the optional service register their biometrics with a selfie and then use facial authentication to enter at full walking speed through dedicated gates. Four lanes have been deployed at Nationals Park in D.C. Two of those are on the west end of the Park’s center field gates, another in center field, and one more on

		The risks of generative artificial intelligence are looming over the financial services industry.

As access to more advanced AI tools becomes available, some financial institutions are worried that their risk management frameworks may not be enough to defend against the wave of deepfakes, the U.S. Department of Treasury says in a new report.

The <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Managing-Artificial-Intelligence-Specific-Cybersecurity-Risks-In-The-Financial-Services-Sector.pdf">report</a>, published on Wednesday, surveys the state of AI use or cybersecurity in the financial sector based on 42 interviews with industry stakeholders.

		Biometric identity verification provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/jumio">Jumio</a> is in legal hot water again for alleged violations of Illinois' BIPA. This time, plaintiff Jacob Czyszczon claims Jumio collected, stored, and used his biometric data without his consent, and therefore unlawfully, when he went through a KYC process in a finance app that used Jumio's identity verification. A class action lawsuit was filed in San Francisco federal court on March 18.

		Mobile telecommunications service users are calling on the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) to extend the deadline for linking SIM cards with users’ biometric digital ID (NIN).

According to some local media reports, the users say an extension is necessary given that agents of mobile telecoms providers have either been unable to collect complete registration information from SIM registrants, or they have put forth complaints of difficulties uploading data collected unto the servers of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC).

For the ongoing phase of the SIM-NIN linkage, the deadline is March 29 and there are fears that millions of SIM cards not properly registered could be suspended, Punch <a href="https://punchng.com/sim-nin-subscribers-kick-a

		Imperial College London researchers have <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11641.pdf">developed</a> Arc2Face, an advanced computer model that generates realistic images of human faces. What sets it apart is its reliance on identity embeddings, which enables the model to generate varied facial images while maintaining identity consistency. However, the current version of the model can only create images of one person at a time based on the provided ID embedding.

The proposed Arc2Face model builds upon the Stable Diffusion text-guided diffusion model. It is conditioned on ID embeddings extracted from a pre-trained <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=arcface">ArcFace</a> network, without relying on text embeddings.

The efficacy of this computer model is demon

Utilizing a successful extraterritoriality challenge, Google was recently able to procure the dismissal of an Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/bipa">BIPA</a>) class action lawsuit claiming it used a training dataset containing individuals’ biometric data for purposes of improving its facial recognition technologies in violation of the Illinois statute.

The training data, known as the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=%22Diversity+in+Faces+Dataset%22">Diversity in Faces Dataset</a> (DiF Dataset), entails a large collection of biometric data that was created through the use of publicly-available photos. Google
