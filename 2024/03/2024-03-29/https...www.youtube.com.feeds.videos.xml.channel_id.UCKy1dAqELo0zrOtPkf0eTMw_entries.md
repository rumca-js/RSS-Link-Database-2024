What’s The Marvels star Teyonah Parris’ advice to the next generation? She wants you to do what she couldn’t. Monica Rambeau, Ms. Marvel, and Captain Marvel take center stage in the latest MCU vehicle, now on Disney+.

In our interview, Teyonah Parris breaks down her experience on The Marvels, up to and including having to watch Flerkins overtake the red carpet while she, Brie Larson, and Iman Vellani had to sit at home due to the Hollywood strikes that were taking place at the time of the premiere. Robbed of a traditional press tour, the actress also reveals what it was like to not even get to wrap the project thanks to the ongoing health precautions, and why she’ll always show up to work on a Nia DaCosta project. 

We also discuss how far diversity in the industry has come, how far it still has to go, and the actress’ hope for future generations watching her and the other women of color leading the superhero charge now.

Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch. This week Daemon is joined my Max from the PlayStation Beyond podcast, and Ryan from IGN's Podcast Unlocked. This week the trio discuss rumors of an Xbox handheld, and why it actually makes sense for Microsoft. Obviously the Nintendo Switch's success has changed the industry, and Valve's Steam Deck has set off a wave of handheld PC imitators—can Xbox also strike gold with a dedicated handheld of their own? And should Sony follow suit following the launch of their PlayStation Portal streaming device? Plus we go over last week's poll, and have a new poll for you tol vote on at IGN.com.

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, reviewed by D. Hood.

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is a textbook visual thrill ride punctuated by brief moments of forced emotion and little else. Director Adam Wingard has a lot of fun with textures, colors, and camera work, and he’s adept at giving fans the over-the-top monster action that they demand via an imposing new villain. Unfortunately, there’s no time to spend on making things make sense or even matter all that much, and what few emotional punches are thrown lack the necessary wind up to connect, save for some very well done moments between Kong and his Hollow Earth kin.

## This game is in 5-D (3-D plus 2-D) and it’s called Screenbound! #3d #2d #gaming #screenbound
