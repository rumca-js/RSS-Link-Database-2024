You need a desk or a table and accessories like a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to use them. But if you have a laptop already, you have all the components of a desktop and then some. If you&rsquo;re not going anywhere for a while, why not kick back and get the full desktop experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s why: You probably don&rsquo;t have all the stuff you need for a full desktop setup. But getting that stuff is relatively easy, and so is assembling it in such a way that getting your laptop in and out is a cinch. That way you get the best of both worlds: a full, comfortable desktop setup when you want it, and an on-the-go laptop when you need it.
