That's the first part of the trick. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/timemelters-review\">Our game this week is, of course, Timemelters, by Autoexec.</a> It's the spiritual sequel to one of my all time favourites, Sang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves.</p><p>In both games you play a version of tower defence that's enlivened by unusual powers and unusual weaknesses. You have to protect something from hordes of enemies, and you usually know which path they're going to take. So far, so tower defence. But you can plant traps, and lure enemies off the path. And weirder stuff too. In Sang-Froid you can kite wolves using your scent.

This week: swimming pools, crates and tombs.</p><p>If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We've Been Playing, <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/what-weve-been-playing\">here's our archive</a>.</p><p>My wife is completely fascinated by the whole liminal spaces scene online. These are slightly Gibsonian faux-found-footage clips of office hallways and empty interiors, sickly lit by neon strips and radiating a vague sense of contemporary malice. Loads of people make these clips, share them, discuss them. They&rsquo;re reaching out for something deeply felt, I suspect, but which more or less defies the powers of language.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/w", "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-pools-crates-and-tombs?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Tomb-Raider-1-3-Remastered.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "What we've been playing - pools, crates, and tombs", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-29T08:00:00+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-03-28-155421.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>\nHow much does someone who built the foundations of <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go\">Pok&eacute;mon Go</a> still play the game, eight years on? It's the first question I ask Ed Wu, senior vice president of Pok&eacute;mon Go, as we set off on a walk together around a leafy London park - our phones in hand, Pok&eacute;mon Go open. \"I spend as much of my time beating up the game as possible,\" he laughs. This is often using work-in-progress beta builds, he admits, to ensure upcoming features are bug-tested. But he still plays his \"official\" main account when he can - and it's clearly a source of pride that his was the first ever user account - or one of the first, he can't quite recall - registered on Pok&eacute;mon Go's live server back at launch in the summer of 2016. \n</p><p>\n\"It's bananas to think this t", "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/niantic-pokemon-go-healthy-and-growing-as-it-approaches-its-next-decade?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-03-28-155421.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Niantic: Pok\u00e9mon Go healthy and growing as it approaches its next decade", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-29T00:49:40+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/deep-silver-has-founded-a-new-free-radical-design-to-work-on-timesplitters-1621503022210.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>\nTimeSplitters Rewind - the fan-made recreation of TimeSplitters 1, 2 and 3's multiplayer, which has been in development since 2013 - has reemerged with its first update video in over the year, offering a fresh look at the project and an urgent call for assistance as its developers find themselves in an \"incredibly challenging space\" due to the current state of the industry.\n</p><p>\nThe TimeSplitters Rewind team secured permission to create the multiplayer remake back in 2012, from then-rights holder Crytek UK.
