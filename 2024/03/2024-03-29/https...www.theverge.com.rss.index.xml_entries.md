  <p id="UqQbOf">OpenAI is offering limited access to a text-to-voice generation platform it developed called Voice Engine, which can create a synthetic voice based on a 15-second clip of someone’s voice. The AI-generated voice can read out text prompts on command in the same language as the speaker or in a number of other languages. “These small scale deployments are helping to inform our approach, safeguards, and thinking about how Voice Engine could be used for good across various industries,” OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/blog/navigating-the-challenges-and-opportunities-of-synthetic-voices">said in its blog post</a>. </p>

  <p id="kBR0fI">For years now, civil engineers have understood that bridges have a problem: many of them are not designed to withstand a blow from the kinds of cargo ships that routinely pass through their waters. Those concerns came to a head on Tuesday with the devastating collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland. It’s the kind of failure engineers have been trying to prevent for decades — and even now, they’re not sure if the available solutions are enough.</p>

  <p id="wFbB5N">The world of <em>Super Mario</em> is a dangerous place. In the games, the plumber falls off cliffs, gets jabbed with spikes, and has everything from wrenches to fireballs hurled at him. But he always gets back up and goes again, which raises an important question: does Nintendo’s hero actually feel pain? According to Takashi Tezuka, who has worked on the series since the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23876765">including serving as producer on last year’s <em>Wonder</em></a>), there isn’t really a clear answer. “It may be that Mario does feel pain,” he tells me.</p>
