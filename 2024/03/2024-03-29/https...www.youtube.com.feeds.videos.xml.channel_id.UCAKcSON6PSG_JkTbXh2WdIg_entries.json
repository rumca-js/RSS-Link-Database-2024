The release of her 2021 album, \"Wary + Strange\" (on  @rounderrecords ), advanced her solo career after Kiah first gained recognition as part of Our Native Daughters, a supergroup comprising Kiah, Rhiannon Giddens, Leyla McCalla and Allison Russell, whose live performance of Kiah\u2019s song, \u201cBlack Myself,\u201d at the 2019 Americana Honors and Awards ceremony in Nashville remains unforgettable to all who saw the performance in person or on video.\n\nKiah has been busily on tour in support of her solo work, which included a concert at the Parkway Theater in Minneapolis on Wednesday, July 5. Earlier that day, Kiah and her band visited The Current studio for a session with Radio Heartland\u2019s Mike Pengra. Kiah played a couple of songs from Wary + Strange, and also treated us to a radio debut of her new song, \u201cEmpire of Love.\u201d\n\nWatch and listen to the complete session", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN1tW2KXmMg", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "source_obj__id": 335, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zN1tW2KXmMg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Amythyst Kiah's introduction to bluegrass \ud83c\udfb5 #bluegrass #americana #interview #singersongwriter #mpr", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-29T15:00:55+00:00", "description": "On tour supporting her new album, \"Take It Like A Man,\" singer-songwriter Amanda Shires visited The Current studio to play songs from the album and to have a conversation with The Current Morning Show host Jill Riley.
