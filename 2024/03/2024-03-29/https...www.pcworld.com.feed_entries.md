<p>You can use any old keyboard to play most PC games. But for better performance, more customization, and maybe even a little more fun, a keyboard designed specifically for games is a great investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But actually buying one can be a daunting experience. There are hundreds of options out there with a staggering array of features and price points &mdash; and that&rsquo;s just the ones from the major brands. Which is where this guide comes in. We&rsquo;ve tested the latest, greatest, and not-so-great gaming keyboards on the market, so you can find the best one for you and your battlestation.</p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust us: </strong>PCWorld has been the go-to name for personal computer news and reviews for over 40 years. And as the writer of this roundup, and the reviewer of most of the keyboards on this list, I can assure you they&rsquo;ve

<p>Historically, you&rsquo;ve had two options to expand the port capabilities of your laptop: an inexpensive USB-C dongle or a more powerful, pricey Thunderbolt docking station. A third option is quietly emerging, trying to split the difference. A DisplayLink docking station (sometimes called a USB-C dock) uses data compression to offer the capabilities of a Thunderbolt dock over a standard USB-C or Thunderbolt cable.</p>



<p>Why buy one? DisplayLink docking stations works great for normal day-to-day productivity, and in my experience the docks are cheaper and more stable than older Thunderbolt 3 desktop docks. They&rsquo;re an upgrade over our picks for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html">the best USB-C hubs dongles</a>, and cheaper than <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thu

That said, I found myself stuck playing <em>DD2</em> on my desktop PC for the simple reason that it&rsquo;s not rated or optimized for Steam Deck by Valve.</p>



<p>Fans who have taken the plunge and installed it on Steam Deck to play natively are reporting frame rates around the 10 to15 frames-per-second (fps) mark, which isn&rsquo;t great. It means the game is virtually unplayable. That&rsquo;s with the game dropped to

<p>If you realize that your system is falling short of expectations, a new motherboard could be the solution. This is particularly necessary if you are due for a processor upgrade that requires a new socket type that your current motherboard does not support. </p>



<p>The latest Intel or AMD chipsets require specific sockets that are usually incompatible with older CPU generations. A switch to the new DDR5 RAM, which offers higher bandwidth and improved energy efficiency, also requires a motherboard with corresponding RAM slots and suitable CPU support. </p>

<p>The big difference between laptops and desktops is that the latter are, well, big. You need a desk or a table and accessories like a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to use them. But if you have a laptop already, you have all the components of a desktop and then some. If you&rsquo;re not going anywhere for a while, why not kick back and get the full desktop experience?</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s why: You probably don&rsquo;t have all the stuff you need for a full desktop setup. But getting that stuff is relatively easy, and so is assembling it in such a way that getting your laptop in and out is a cinch. That way you get the best of both worlds: a full, comfortable desktop setup when you want it, and an on-the-go laptop when you need it. This guide explains everything you need to know to turn your laptop into a desktop workstation.</p>
