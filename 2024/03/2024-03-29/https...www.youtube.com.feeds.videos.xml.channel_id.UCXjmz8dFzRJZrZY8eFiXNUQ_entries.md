Starting a story at the end and working towards that moment is nothing new, especially in Hollywood.  Films like Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Memento, Forrest Gump, and Saving Private Ryan all opt for starting the story with how it ends.  This can be a powerful tool in the right hands.  Immersing the audience in the story immediately and having them along for the ride with the main characters.  Though Tarantino, Fincher, and Nolan have all used this trick to great success, it doesn't always work out that way.  For every Pulp Fiction or Fight Club there are countless rip offs that attempt the same style but to a lesser degree. But why exactly does starting a movie at the end make for such a compelling story?
