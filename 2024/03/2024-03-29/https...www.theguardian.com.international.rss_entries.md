<p>Influencer sobriety is a world where alcohol addiction is history, but it’s all too neat</p><p>At a glance, sobriety looks pretty on social media – and relatively simple to achieve. A quick search for sober motivation will send you off on a stream of brightly coloured listicles that advise making plans that don’t involve alcohol, spending time with friends who support your choices, trying new things (like mocktails!) and going for a walk to combat alcohol cravings. The posts are often accompanied by a white-toothed influencer who is standing on a mountain in a bikini.</p><p>The internet paints a picture of sobriety that has been smoothed around the edges, with an occasional snag of vulnerability; a woman pushing her toddler on a swing with the caption “I was buzzed on vodka here”; a word tile that reads:”I realised that inebriated women are easier to control.” The darkness creeps in, but then it’s back to normal programming; memes and hashtags and journalling at sunrise.</p> <a hre

<p>The punk poet on finally getting JD Salinger, why he rereads the Bible, and growing up with Rupert Bear and Batman</p><p><strong>My earliest reading&nbsp;memory</strong><br />My earliest memories are of reading Rupert Bear, American comic books – Batman, Superman, Weird Planets, Creepy Worlds, Sinister Tales, Mad magazine, Kid Montana, Kid Colt: Outlaw and also Dick Tracy.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><br />The Buffalo Bill Annual, which contained the potted biographies of all&nbsp;the big hitters of the&nbsp;old west, including the titular figure himself&nbsp;plus Wild Bill Hickok, Jesse and Frank&nbsp;James, the Reno brothers, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Billy the&nbsp;Kid and more. I&nbsp;remember it had full-colour illustrations throughout.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/29/john-cooper-clarke-i-read-kerouac-at-12-and-figured-i-could-improve-on-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Forget the dodgy connotations: if it’s good enough for Chloë Sevigny, it’s good enough for the rest of us</p><p>The rugby shirt is the Breton top of 2024. I am entirely serious. Instead of Pablo Picasso or Brigitte Bardot in a navy and white stripe T-shirt, your style icon for this spring is Prince William in his St Andrews uni days, popping the contrast white collar on his Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.</p><p>This is not quite true. I’m exaggerating for effect, no need to panic. Forget freshers’ week. Put Twickenham out of your mind. Instead, think David Hockney, in a pink and blue rugby shirt with washed-out green trousers. Think Diana, Princess of Wales. Chloë Sevigny, Oscar-nominated actor who – more importantly for our purposes, is one of the best dressed women in the world, with an innate style compass that unfailingly finds true north – regularly wears a rugby shirt, these days. “It’s warm and it’s easy and it’s casual. It’s basically a nicer version of a sweatshirt. I mean, it ha

<p>Some schoolkids are clearly nervous. One asked if I’d ever killed a child</p><p>I’ve always been interested in the past. At school, I&nbsp;threw myself into history lessons. I&nbsp;turned one of my mum’s bedsheets into a&nbsp;toga so I&nbsp;could&nbsp;pretend to be a&nbsp;Roman, and spent holidays learning hieroglyphics long after lessons on ancient Egypt had&nbsp;finished.</p><p>When I was eight, we did the Tudors at school, and my aunt took me to the Tower of London, not far from where I&nbsp;grew up in Thurrock, Essex. I was spellbound. Back home, I’d pore over my mum’s Encyclopaedia Britannica, try to copy Hans Holbein portraits, and watch documentaries about Henry VIII over and over. There was just something magical about the Tudors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/29/experience-im-a-full-time-henry-viii-impersonator">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Sleeps Brothers)</strong><br />On their sixth album, the hardcore Sheffield quintet bring furious riffs, howling, swearing and … acoustic guitars? </p><p>Formed by school friends in former mining villages near Sheffield, While She Sleeps were briefly on a major label but have gone an independent route to build a passionate fanbase large enough for them to headline London’s 10,000 capacity Alexandra Palace. Meanwhile, over 17 years the quintet’s music has developed beyond metalcore to reflect wider influences from Radiohead to Kendrick Lamar.</p><p>This sixth album attempts the sort of genre-busting metamorphosis Linkin Park went for with A Thousand Suns. Riffola and guttural, screamed vocals still abound (singer Loz Taylor has had three throat operations).

<p>While religion doesn’t feature much in video games, I find the theory that we are all characters in a huge sim ever more believable – and appealing</p><p>It’s Easter weekend, when Catholics like me spend hours in church listening to the extended editor’s cut of a story whose ending we already know. Sitting there for the millionth performance of the Passion recently, I got to thinking about how few religious video game characters I’ve ever encountered. It’s interesting that in a world where so many people’s lives are dictated by religious beliefs, there is such a scarcity of religion in games. I mean, you could argue that <em>all </em>games are Jesus homages, with their respawns and extra lives, but even I admit that’s a stretch.</p><p>The Peggies in Far Cry 5 are a mind-controlling violent cult; those Founders in BioShock Infinite use religion to elevate and justify hatred of foreigners; and you have those wackadoodles in Fallout worshipping atomic bombs. Religion is almost exclusi

<p>The Iranian-American poet’s debut novel tells the tale of a bereaved writer – but struggles with too much angst</p><p>In Martyr!, the debut novel by Iranian-American poet Kaveh Akbar, a troubled young man is searching for a reason to live. Cyrus, the son of an Iranian migrant factory worker in Indiana, lost his mother in an infamous 1988 air disaster, when a&nbsp;US missile cruiser mistakenly shot down an Iranian civilian airliner in the final months of the Iran-Iraq war. This formative trauma has left a terrible legacy: when we meet him, in his late&nbsp;20s, he’s a recovering alcoholic, struggling with fragile mental health and an unhealthy dependency on pharmaceutical sedatives; he “often&nbsp;wept for no reason, bit his thumbs till they bled”.</p><p>An aspiring but unproductive writer, Cyrus has a fixation with martyrdom, and is researching a book&nbsp;on the subject. “It’s not an Islam&nbsp;thing,” he clarifies, “[it’s] about secular, pacifist martyrs.
