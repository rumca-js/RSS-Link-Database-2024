<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 29 March 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01820-4">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01820-4</a></p>Molecular materials for computing progress intensively but the performance and reliability still lag behind. Here the authors assess the current state of computing with molecular-based materials and describe two issues as the basis of a new computing technology: continued exploration of molecular electronic properties and process development for on-chip integration.
