<p>A late onslaught on a tiring home defence brought Leeds an equaliser and several near misses, but not the third goal that would have rewarded them with victory and first place in the Championship.

Five tries, an intensity that went missing last week and a masterclass at fly-half from Fin Smith tightened their hold on top spot of the Premiership and gave their sell-out crowd reason to believe this will be their year.</p><p>Saracens were off-colour with ball in hand but they stayed ferociously competitive to the end in what was a breathless encounter, and as a result Northampton will take such confidence from their victory.

If you are soft people walk on you. It has an impact on how I play. In 50-50 challenges I don’t want to lose it.

The speech Gossett had in mind? “It’s no use,” he told the capacity crowd at LA’s Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. “It’s all gone.” So he kept things short and sweet, thanking his family before pivoting to his fellow nominees – a tough crowd that included James Mason and John Lithgow. “All you other four guys,” Gossett said, raising his statuette, “<em>this</em><strong> </strong>is ours.”</p><p>That was Gossett in essence: magnanimous, dignified, always hit

The same could not be said of Hamas, which was the de facto government of Gaza when it entered Israel on 7 October. Hamas militants murdered more than 1,000 people and took over 200 hostage.

<p>Spaniard remaining at Leverkusen shows laudable loyalty but with several big clubs seeking new managers, Liverpool’s task is not easy</p><p>Perhaps it was always too perfect: not just the idea of Jürgen Klopp handing over to a revered former player, the man who scored the equaliser in Istanbul, but of the baton being passed on after a Europa League final meeting in Dublin.</p><p>When Bayer Leverkusen came from behind to keep that narrative alive with two injury-time goals against Qarabag, the Kloppian nature of the comeback felt profoundly appropriate. But Xabi Alonso announced on Friday he will remain with Leverkusen for at least one more season and attempt a Champions League campaign with the side he is surely about to lead to a first Bundesliga title, and that means Liverpool must think again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/29/xabi-alonsos-decision-to-stay-put-gives-liverpool-tricky-choices-at-a-time-of-flux">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New York’s subway system worked fine for me – that is when my fear of driving took root </p><p>Last Christmas, I did not wake up to the toasty aroma of mulling cider or the sound of youngsters rummaging beneath a tree. Instead I found myself in bed, slicked with sweat and flooding with relief. Moments earlier, I had been steering an SUV packed with my children and their friends. I was driving them along a bridge that suddenly jutted straight up into the sky. Just as we were all falling into a bottomless body of water, I startled awake.</p><p>“Driving is a very common theme in anxiety dreams,” Susan Kolod, a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst in New York, tells me. She lumps such nightmares together with dreams of flying or learning at the last minute that you have a test. But I love air travel and I don’t mind tests. It’s the crippling fear of driving that gets me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/mar/29/how-a-shrink-on-wheels-helped-fix-my-driving-anxiet

<p>As the 80s pop phenomenon prepares to release his 13th album, here’s your chance ask about his early work, collaborating with Calvin Harris or his best boxing tips</p><p>Sananda Maitreya had a simple plan for his 13th album: 13 songs, led by guitar, bass and drums. The ominous number didn’t faze him: “Anything that others are irrationally afraid of interests me,” he said recently. “I love black cats. Black cats are bad? No, black cats are fucking cool. The number 13 needs love, too.”</p><p>But the project prompted an unprecedented outpouring of love, which started just prior to his 60th birthday and blossomed into the 41-track epic The Pegasus Project: Pegasus and the Swan. Divided into two sides – the first guitar-led, the second more classical – it’s the third part of the “seasons” concept begun by 2017’s Prometheus &amp; Pandora and 2021’s Pandora’s PlayHouse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/mar/29/post-your-questions-for-sananda-maitreya">Continue reading.

<p><strong>Hampstead theatre, London<br /></strong>There are shades of Blackadder in April De Angelis’s play about the great tragedian of 18th-century British theatre</p><p>There is a certain chutzpah to writing a comedy about the life of Sarah Siddons, the great tragedian of 18th-century British theatre. That is what April De Angelis does in this backstage drama, which packs some punches among its jokes on what it was to be a sole, female megastar of the stage.</p><p>Siddons (Rachael Stirling) is a woman in crisis when we first meet her. A daughter has died and her husband is shacked up with a mistress. Her brother, Kemble (Dominic Rowan), a fellow (more wooden) actor and theatre manager, is a bully who hustles her into parts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/mar/29/the-divine-mrs-s-review-hampstead-theatre-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Aviva Studios, Manchester<br /></strong>Avant garde director Robert Wilson’s adaptation of the classic tale prioritises surreal setups and atmosphere over family friendly narrative</p><p>What does it look like when the familiar story of man-cub Mowgli meets avant garde director Robert Wilson? For audiences familiar with Wilson’s work, the answer is exactly what you might imagine. Though the combination is a somewhat surprising one, this new adaptation of The Jungle Book has many of the distinctive features of Wilson’s theatre: a sculptural approach to bodies and light, painterly composition of the stage picture, use of repetition and fragmentation.</p><p>The emphasis is on atmosphere over storytelling. While there is a narrator of sorts in the shape of Hathi the elephant, the outlines of Rudyard Kipling’s stories are only lightly sketched. Instead of scenes, Wilson gives us a series of surreal impressions. Tiger Shere Khan reclines on a chaise longue smoking a cigar beneath

Born a year before me in the post-industrial town of Crewe in England’s north-west, at school there was little to separate us.

At 18, I secured my ticket out and moved to the nearest big city for university; my sister stayed at home.</p><p>Nearly 20 years later, this choice we made as naive teenagers – whether to leave or remain – still seems to hang over us, making our differences appear an ever-widening chasm.

But the pandemic left its mark on all of us, whether we realise it or not</p><p>I recently came across a folder on my laptop labelled “Covid”. Inside I found screenshots I had taken of the government website, showing daily cases, ICU admissions and deaths from Covid-19. These reports were released every weekday during the first lockdown, and each afternoon I would collect them in this folder and study them,<strong> </strong>trying to understand what was happening in the wider world – before I began a busy evening of Zoom birthday quizzes, Netflix Party and WhatsApp.</p><p>I was shocked – both that I had ever been so macabre in the first place, and also that, four years later, I had forgotten doing it.

<p>When the research team at Vernadsky base are not defending their homeland, they are on the frontline of the climate crisis</p><p>When Ukraine’s Antarctic research and supply vessel Noosfera left Odesa on its maiden voyage on 28 January 2022, it passed Russian warships in the Black Sea. A month later, Vladimir Putin launched Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour. Noosfera has not been back since.</p><p>“A few weeks later, and Noosfera would have been an important symbolic target for Russia,” said Vadym Tkachenko, a biologist who recently completed his second Antarctic winter at Ukraine’s Vernadsky base.

<p>From Herod as the Messiah to a virginity test for Mary – the Christian story, but not as you know it</p><p>As far as variant versions of the nativity story go, the one from the second-century Gospel of&nbsp;James is hard to beat. It starts off rather beautifully by telling how, at&nbsp;the moment of Jesus’s birth, the world suddenly stops turning: birds hang in&nbsp;the air, a shepherd’s arm is frozen and the stars stand still. A few minutes later, a woman arrives and, sceptical about whether Mary can really be a&nbsp;virgin, insists on shoving her finger up the new mother’s vagina, whereupon her hand is immediately burned off. “Woe,” says the woman. Mary’s reaction is unrecorded, perhaps&nbsp;because she felt that she had&nbsp;made her&nbsp;point.</p><p>This is just one of the hundreds – thousands, probably – of alternative versions of Christianity that teemed in&nbsp;the centuries following Jesus’s life and death. Take the Ophites, who believed that Christ had appeared on&nbsp;Ea

<p>This charming period drama about a 1920s Russian aristocrat being kept in a hotel by the Bolsheviks sees McGregor on sparkling form. He’s an intoxicating, swaggering figure of delight</p><p>Some books are difficult to film, and TV is a fool to attempt them. Others, however, perch on the shelf poised and preened, all dressed up and ready for the small screen. Amor Towles’s 2016 novel <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/a-gentleman-in-moscow-9780099558781">A Gentleman in Moscow</a> could have been designed as a handsome, charming period drama, of the kind that once slid smoothly on to BBC One or ITV1 on a Sunday evening.
