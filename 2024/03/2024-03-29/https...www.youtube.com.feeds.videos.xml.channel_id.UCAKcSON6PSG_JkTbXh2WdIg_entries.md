Amythyst Kiah is a singer-songwriter from Chattanooga, Tenn., who is one of the biggest up-and-coming artists in Americana music today. The release of her 2021 album, "Wary + Strange" (on  @rounderrecords ), advanced her solo career after Kiah first gained recognition as part of Our Native Daughters, a supergroup comprising Kiah, Rhiannon Giddens, Leyla McCalla and Allison Russell, whose live performance of Kiah‚Äôs song, ‚ÄúBlack Myself,‚Äù at the 2019 Americana Honors and Awards ceremony in Nashville remains unforgettable to all who saw the performance in person or on video.

Kiah has been busily on tour in support of her solo work, which included a concert at the Parkway Theater in Minneapolis on Wednesday, July 5. Earlier that day, Kiah and her band visited The Current studio for a session with Radio Heartland‚Äôs Mike Pengra. Kiah played a couple of songs from Wary + Strange, and also treated us to a radio debut of her new song, ‚ÄúEmpire of Love.‚Äù
