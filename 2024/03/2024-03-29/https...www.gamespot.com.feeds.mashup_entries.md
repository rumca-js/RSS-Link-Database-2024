<p>Nintendo of America is currently in the process of laying off an undisclosed number of contractors who help with testing games and hardware. It's unclear how many workers will be affected by this but it's estimated to be over 100 contractors.</p><p>In a statement given to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-layoffs-testing-zelda-totk-1851369539">Kotaku</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson said, these changes "will involve changes will involve some contractor assignments ending, as well as the creation of a significant number of new full-time employee positions." The report explains that some contractors working alongside Nintendo of America feel as if they've been exploited and underpaid for some time, as they sought full-time employment with the company. Although some testers are being hired and moved out of software testing, the rest will be let go. Nintendo has stated that those impacted will receive severance packages.</p><p dir="ltr">The full statement given to Kotaku reads:

<p>A <em>lot </em>of people died on HBO's Game of Thrones, but which deaths were the favorite of creators and showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BpgpxbnpK0">Happy Sad Confused podcast</a> (<a href="https://ew.com/game-of-thrones-showrunners-share-favorite-death-8622357">via EW</a>), Weiss said it was the death of villainous characters that he was particularly fond of.</p><p>He said the show killed so many good guys early on, with Sean Bean's Ned Stark famously getting his head lopped off before the end of the first season. Later on, though, came Weiss' favorite deaths: Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and Ramsay (Iwan Rheon).</p><p>"We finally got to really kill both Joffrey in season 4 and Ramsay Bolton in season 6. It was fun to go back to the old-fashioned joys of just killing off a really bad guy," he said. His death felt like it was "balancing the scales a little," Weiss said as it relates to good guys vs. bad guys getting w

Right now, one of those perks is access to YouTube Premium for three months.</p><p>Game Pass Ultimate members can navigate to the "Perks" tab of their subscription profile to find a page that offers up three months of YouTube Premium for the low cost of $0. The only catch is that you can't have previously signed up for YouTube Premium or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium">YouTube Premium's own three-month trial</a>. And the offer does not stack if you're an existing subscriber to YouTube Premium. The offer must be claimed by May 22, 2024.</p><p>This is a pretty nice perk.

<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's first season, Season of the Jokes, is now live, adding Batman villain the Joker as a new playable character, another Elseworlds dimension to explore, and several new Legendary and Notorious-class weapons.</p><p>This version of the Joker hails from a different dimension in the DC Multiverse and is very different from the deceased version who menaced Batman in the Arkham games, although both villains do have a theatrical personality and love prop comedy, especially when said props are explosives.</p><p>The new Elseworld dresses Metropolis up as a version of the city viewed through the warped lens of the Joker, and you can also experiment with a Poison status effect. This deals damage over time and reduces the amount of damage that poisoned enemies can inflict on you, but they will drop fewer shields when harvested. Buildcrafters can experiment with the new Fear Bonus on Infamy Sets, adding extra power to this effect when they reach higher tier

<p>Actress Kirsten Dunst has commented on the iconic kiss that she and Tobey Maguire shared for 2002's Spider-Man, saying filming it was "kind of miserable."</p><p>Appearing on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/spider-man-kirsten-dunst-kiss-tobey-maguire-b2520215.html">The Jonathan Ross Show</a> (<a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/kirsten-dunst-spider-man-kiss-miserable-1235955587/">via Variety</a>), Dunst said the conditions were far from ideal when the kiss was filmed. "It was pouring with rain, freezing, Tobey couldn't breathe so it was almost like I was resuscitating him," she said.</p><p>In the scene, Maguire is suspended upside-down as Spider-Man, with Dunst's Mary Jane pulling his mask down to kiss him on the lips. It's an emotional, memorable scene, but clearly it wasn't very fun to film for Dunst.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirsten-dunst-says-filming-iconic-spider-man-kiss-was-miserable/1100-6522271/?ftag=CAD-01-1

<p>One of the most talked-about issues in gaming in recent times has been around the rise of artificial intelligence systems and how they may be further incorporated into gaming in the future. Larian Studios boss Swen Vincke has now weighed in with his thoughts. Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-larian-interview-swen-vincke-on-industry-woes-optimism-and-life-after-baldurs-gate-3">Eurogamer</a>, Vincke said Larian does not see AI as a "replacement for developers."</p><p>But deployed the right way, AI could allow Larian to "do more stuff." As an example, if an NPC in a game had just one line of dialogue, that might be a place for AI to step in to do the work.</p><p>"There's not a lot of creative accomplishment to be had by putting the camera on a singular NPC that only has a couple of notes--I'm very happy for AI to handle that," he said. "We're not going to do that for the very complicated scenes because there, the artistry is going to shine through. So there's use
