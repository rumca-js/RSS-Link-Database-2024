It mixes first-person shooting (with the occasional third-person perspective) and tower defense mechanics with a sci-fi setting and sleek visuals. However, it also throws in stages that mirror an extraction shooter, a rogue-like map to traverse, and much more.\n\nThe result is a mish-mash of ideas that never coalesce into an enjoyable game. The tower defense and action aspects feel compelling initially, but they suffer from painfully slow progression, a laughable story with forgettable characters and a worrying amount of crashes.\n\nWith time and a whole lot more polish, Outpost: Infinity Siege could become something worthwhile. After all, the shooting is tight, and there is some potential for slaying hordes of enemies in intense situations. For now, however, it's a miss.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hpoDUB9K5g", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/2hpoDUB9K5g/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Outpost: Infinity Siege Review - One of the Most Disappointing Games of 2024", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-29T15:30:08+00:00", "description": "It's incredible that even after almost two months of launching, Helldivers 2 feels like it's been around for a lot longer. Chalk it up to the extensive updates, whether it's the environmental hazards, new enemy types and equipment like Exosuits, but the fact that it still feels fresh and fun to play is exceptional.\n\nWith that said, there are still several areas where Helldivers 2 could improve. It may be in the weapon balance and ensuring that more options become viable (JAR-5 Dominator mains unite). Perhaps it's in the armor customization and allowing players to express themselves while staying true to the spirit of Super-Earth. Maybe some milestones to celebrate one's career.\n\nRegardless, a great experience could be even better.
