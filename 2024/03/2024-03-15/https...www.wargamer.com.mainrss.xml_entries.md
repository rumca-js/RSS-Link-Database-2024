The Rome-themed Paradox grand strategy game was slated by &hellip; <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/imperator-rome/fans-revive-development">Continued</a></p>

								<p><strong>Gloomhaven: Buttons and Bugs</strong> is always going to live in the shadow of its older siblings in the Gloomhaven series. I mean this quite literally, as the box is a fraction of the size. All jokes aside, the tiny single-player adaptation doesn’t quite live up to the excellence of its predecessors. It’s a great adaptation of Gloomhaven’s core gameplay, but a little too much of the design has been stripped to save space.</p>

								<p>A train is arguably one of the worst places to play a board game. The tables are tiny, the seating is cramped, and there&rsquo;s a chance a stranger could sit down next to you at any moment. Shuddering walls and regular stops add a new challenge to moving miniatures and rolling dice.
