Team Ninja's Rise of the Ronin is one of the more hyped titles of the year, with its launch coming up on March 22nd for PS5. Pre-release impressions have ranged from average to very positive, but some, if not all, draw comparisons to another Sony exclusive - Ghost of Tsushima.

Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection launched recently, and what should have been some moment for the community quickly went wrong. Players who hopped onto for multiplayer realized that only three servers were available to accommodate nearly 10,000 players on Steam.

Several other issues were quickly discovered, from the lack of aim assist in multiplayer to split-screen only supporting two players instead of four. While developer Aspyr reportedly added more servers, players complained of high ping, lag, stuttering and more. That's not including crashes, graphical glitches and other issues players have discovered in short order.

Suffice it to say that the Steam rating took a beating, plummeting to "Mostly Negative" reviews. What caused all this? How did a collection that offers some genuinely great modes and content for single-player fumble so hard with multiplayer and quality control? What's Aspyr's next move? Find out here.
