People ask me to talk about certain topics in my videos - and some of them are topics I won't talk about.

Vince Venturella and I make games! Check out Snarling Badger Studios at http://www.snarlingbadger.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
