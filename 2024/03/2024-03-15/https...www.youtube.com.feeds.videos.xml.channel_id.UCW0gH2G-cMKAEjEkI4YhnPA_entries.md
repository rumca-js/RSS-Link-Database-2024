Official Description:
Bred in secret by the fallen Wizard Saruman, the Uruk-hai issued forth from the pits of Isengard under the command of Lurtz. Driving his troops to run under a burning sun, Lurtz hunted ceaselessly along the banks of the Anduin for the Fellowship of the Ring.

On the slopes of Amon Hen, the Uruk-hai fell upon the Fellowship, chasing and scattering them among the woods. Relishing the hunt, a leer curled across the toothy mouth of Isengard's captain, raising his bow to fell his prey… LURTZ, HUNTER OF MEN

A creature born of foul magic, bred for one purpose and serving only one master, Lurtz quickly became a fan favourite. His raw ferocity and domineering presence provided a real, grounded, and immediate threat to the Fellowship, and his savagery, etched forever in our minds, is captured now as an integral part of the Classic Series.
