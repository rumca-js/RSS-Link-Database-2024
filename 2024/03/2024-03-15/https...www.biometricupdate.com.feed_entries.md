		A security assessment by Trail of Bits says <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a>’s software for biometrics collection with its orb devices is sound from a data protection and privacy perspective.

Trail of Bits also provided the third-party security analysis of biometric <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202003/third-party-voatz-security-assessment-says-third-of-findings-were-high-severity">digital voting platform Voatz</a> back in 2020.

The Worldcoin security audit report found the orb collects little personally identifiable information, and safely handles the iris biometric code, which is the only piece of PII that leaves the orb.

Tools for Humanity asked Trail of Bits to assess a series of claims about its software. The

		Age estimation and face matching are hot products for digital identity and biometrics providers. Governments are cracking down on unrestricted porn sites, online alcohol sales, social media and other age-restricted activities. This week, Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/pornhub-texas-blocked-age-verification-law-1235942280/">reported</a> on adult content giant Pornhub blocking access to users in Texas over new <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/texas-online-age-verification-law-upheld-on-appeal">age verification laws</a>. As the saying goes, everything’s big in Texas – including a user base large enough to matter in a U.S. context, especially with several other states already on the block list.

		Recently proposed legislation to establish a digital ID in the state of Tennessee may not have been necessary, while users from many states throughout the U.S. remain unable to add their mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) to Apple Wallet years after the company announced the feature was in the works.
<h2>Existing Tennessee law renders proposed digital ID bill unnecessary</h2>

		Ukraine wants to make it easier for other countries to build up their digital identity ecosystems and to help them find inspiration, it is making its own e-government application Diia open-source.

Since its launch in 2019, the Diia project has been attracting interest in places such as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202209/estonia-and-ukraine-to-collaborate-on-digital-id-development">Estonia</a> and the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202212/uk-and-ukraine-sign-digital-trade-deal-collaborate-on-digital-identity">UK</a>.

		Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu recently directed officials to use the national digital ID system to enable the accurate identification of beneficiaries for a government-to-people welfare payment program in the country. The scheme is relaunching after being halted for a while after reported incidents of fraud, and it aims to reach 12 million households. Across the continent in Rwanda, the government, early this month, also rolled out a similar social welfare program dubbed the “Imibereho Dynamic Social Registry System” which will be based on a new digital ID database. It is part of a project to take almost one million Rwandans out of poverty.

Meanwhile, the <em>Cybersecurity, Capacity Development, and Financial Inclusion (</em>CyberFI) project run b

		The Swiss parliament is preparing to debate a new law regulating its digital identity, paving the way for the planned introduction of the country’s e-ID in 2026.

The parliament’s lower house, the Swiss National Council, approved the E-ID Act on Thursday by a large majority.  The Council also greenlighted a budget of 100 million francs (US$113.3 million) for developing the digital identity system. The next step will be gaining the approval of Switzerland’s upper house, the Council of States, trade magazine Werbewoche <a href="https://www.werbewoche.ch/en/digital/2024-03-14/neue-vorlage-zu-elektronischer-id-kommt-im-nationalrat-gut-an/">reports</a>.

		According to a news wire <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-airport-security-facial-recognition-37b8f40ad768706cd335d9254e6a07e4">report</a>, migrants trying to board a domestic flight in the U.S. have to submit to a facial biometric scan if they don’t have a passport.

The Associated Press says that migrants this week faced a biometric check when trying to board flights out of the region. It is not clear if the new procedure is in place elsewhere or, in fact, when the South Texas change was implemented.

As of now, anyone identified as a migrant must show their papers to travel. If they can’t or refused to comply, they must be biometrically scanned. If they refuse, they must exit the airp

		Biometric voter registration systems have been gaining ground in countries around the world – but still remain a point of contention in tense political environments.

Papua New Guinea has outlined a plan to establish an ID system relying on biometric data that will help it prepare for the 2027 general elections.

Prime Minister James Marape said that the initial step will be completing the National Census in 2024. The data gathered during the census will be used for identification through the National Identification (NID) program, paving the way to the implementation of a biometric voting system, local news outlet PNG Facts <a href="https://www.pngfacts.com/news/png-pm-marape-eyes-corruption-free-2027-elections-with-introduction-of-biometric-system">reports</a>.
