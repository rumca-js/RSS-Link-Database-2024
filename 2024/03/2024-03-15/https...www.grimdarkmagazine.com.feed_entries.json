This companion volume, the aptly named Returns, brings us back to the infinitely large library of The Book that Wouldn\u2019t Burn and its excellent cast of characters, including the deputy head librarian, Yute, and the precocious young librarian, Livira. Returns also features our trio of beloved animal companions from The Book that Wouldn\u2019t Burn, all of whom are depicted in Thomas Brown\u2019s cover art. The oversized cat, Wentworth, is front and center, along with the ink-black dog, Volente, and the raven whose name I shall not reveal. All three animal friends are present in Returns, with Volente featuring prominently in both stories. The title story of Returns concerns the search for a missing volume, The Book of Many Stories, that must be returned to the Library. The search cuts across space and time and may have implications for Yute\u2019s", "page_rating_visits": 0}]
