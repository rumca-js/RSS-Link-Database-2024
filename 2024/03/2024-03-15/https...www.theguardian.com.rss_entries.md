<p>Lecturer and social historian whose books on witchcraft transformed the study of the subject</p><p>In the mid-1990s the historian James Sharpe, who has died aged 77, wrote Instruments of Darkness, a book on witch-hunting in England that reopened a field of research that had been in the doldrums for a generation after the Welsh historian <a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/fellows/keith-thomas-FBA/">Keith Thomas</a>’s brilliant Religion and the Decline of Magic (1971). Published in 1996, Jim’s book helped to make the study of British witchcraft what it is today: one of the most lively areas of historical writing.</p><p>Earlier historians had argued that whereas witch-hunting on the European continent was fantastical, dominated by beliefs about the devil, English witch-hunting was comparatively rational and down-to-earth, centred on beliefs about the practical harm that witches caused to people and animals. Jim showed that this was nonsense, and that English witch-h

<p>The scale of loss is horrifying, but the global death toll is falling fast and can be reduced further </p><p>In 2022, almost 5 million children under five died around the world – equivalent to one death every six seconds. Each one of those deaths is a story of grief and of unfulfilled potential; of the farmers, scientists, labourers, poets and traders who will not be. The large majority of these deaths, tallied in <a href="https://childmortality.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/UN-IGME-2023-Child-Mortality-Report.pdf">a UN report published this week</a>, were entirely preventable. Those growing up in the highest-mortality country face a risk of dying before age five that is 80 times greater than in the lowest-mortality country.</p><p>Yet as grim as the figure is, it is also cause for optimism. This was a historic low. More children are surviving today than ever before. The global mortality rate for this age group has declined by 51% since 2000. There is no one simple explana

It’s the first time France have fielded the same 23 men from one week to the next since Galthié’s predecessor, Jacques Brunel, did it back in the spring of 2019. Galthié says it’s because of the short turnaround between the fourth and fifth rounds of the championship. His side played in Cardiff last Sunday, came home that evening, took one day off, did one hard day’s training, and travelled to Lyon on Thursday ready for the captain’s run on Friday.</p><p>It’s a show of faith in the team that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/10/wales-france-six-nations-match-report">beat Wales 45-24</a>, one that anyone who saw the way they defended in that match may won

The endless hours spent on the treatment table, strapping his body together again, have taken their toll. The 20-year-old, who was billed as the future of English rugby, as someone capable of things hitherto unseen in a white jersey, has developed into a wise old head, an elder of Steve Borthwick’s squad. The one constant, however, is Tuilagi’s unmistakable smile.</p><p>As he prepares for what is expected to be his 60th and final England appearance on Saturday, Tuilagi could be forgiven for a litany of regrets. Without such injury trouble – and some of it was self-inflicted because he would hide the issue to keep playing – he would surely have reached three figures. He has also endured disciplinary problems – missing the 2015 World Cup in England as a r

<p>Ireland may not the first place you’d think of as a wine-growing nation, but the country’s winemakers are making a mark all around the world</p><p>You might be more inclined to drink whiskey or stout to celebrate St Patrick’s Day, but if you fancy a wine, it’s not that difficult to find one with some kind of Irish connection. True, they don’t make much wine in Ireland, but there are a few small producers, such as <a href="https://llewellynsorchard.ie/">Lusca</a>, whose wines you can find in the <a href="https://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/Lusca-Cabernet-Merlot-Wine">Celtic Whiskey Shop in Dublin</a>. But the quantities it’s made in are tiny and the prices correspondingly high. Ireland’s climate doesn’t lend itself to large-scale winemaking.</p><p>Irish-born winemakers are making wine elsewhere, however, including, interestingly, one of the best producers of sparkling wine in the UK, Dermot Sugrue, who until relatively recently was winemaker at <a href="https://www.wistonesta

<p><strong>Riverfront, Newport<br /></strong>Arts Council of Wales’s decision to axe its funding for Mid Wales Opera means this effective and cogent production is likely their last on this scale</p><p>With the peremptory axing of all its funding last September, Mid Wales Opera has already been dealt a deathblow by the Arts Council of Wales. The company’s strong and sterling new Verdi staging – now confirmed as its last full-scale production – makes the council’s decision look all the more ludicrous.</p><p>Fielding a cast of 17, and the 16 musicians of Ensemble Cymru plus a community chorus, this may not be full-scale Verdi, but there is absolutely no compromise on integrity. With some fine musical characterisation from the principals as well as those in cameo roles, and a particularly blazing finale to act one, there is a wonderful sense of a defiant upholding of MWO values by artistic director/designer Richard Studer and music director Jonathan Lyness.

The actor talks pie and mash, stunt training – and why there are no nipples in her new series</p><p>When Louisa Harland was cast as the lead in the new Sally Wainwright drama, Renegade Nell, the director told her: “Nell needs to be one of those characters, even when she’s on the screen so much, you still want the audience to miss her when she’s not.” It’s quite an ask: Nell is a massive Doctor Who of a role, swashbuckling, always with a new accent or cool pyrotechnics or punch in the face, and Harland fills the screen every second she’s on it. Somehow, though, you do miss her when she isn’t. Meeting the 31-year-old in central London, I&nbsp;can&nbsp;see&nbsp;exactly why she was chosen for Nell, even though almost the first thing she says is “I never in my wildest dreams thought I would get this role. My parents still think it is so random.”

A crowd member is brought up on stage to spin a wheel, offering a one-time-only chance to hear a randomly selected song from the band’s 2021 debut EP Dark Days. It lands on the title track and the band dutifully bash out the kind of jagged post-punk that led to their rapid ascent during lockdown.</p><p>Three years on, with the band seemingly feeling restricted by their own earlier sonic template – one which they created, by their own admission, in a deliberate attempt to board the last train out of post-punksville at the end of the decade – they return with a more ele

<p>More than 400 players, including several young English talents, are competing in Iceland’s premier event</p><p>More than half a century on, the Bobby Fischer v Boris Spassky series at Reykjavik 1972 remains the most famous of all world championship matches. It triggered a global chess boom, not least in Britain where for a brief period a galaxy of talent made England the No&nbsp;2 chess nation behind the Soviet Union.</p><p>On Friday, the annual Reykjavik Open starts at the Harpa conference centre in the heart of the city with a full ­complement of 420 players, ranging from elite grandmasters to ordinary amateurs, nearly a tenth of them British. The excursion on the tournament’s free morning includes a visit to Fischer’s grave. It is also 60 years since the first Reykjavik Open in 1964 was won by Mikhail Tal, who along with Spassky was Fischer’s great contemporary rival, with a stunning 12.5/13 total.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/15/chess-fischer

<p>This story of a woman retreating from the world to a convent in New South Wales considers guilt, forgiveness and human connection</p><p>What are we going to do about&nbsp;global heating, about mass extinction, about our rivers? What ability do we have to change things, now that power lies mostly in the hands of unaccountable corporations and shameless demagogues? Is there even any point in trying? The narrator of Stone Yard Devotional, who has been working in species conservation, chooses that most seductive solution – despair. She leaves her life and marriage in Sydney and checks into the retreat house of an enclosed convent on the Monaro Plains in New South Wales. And retreat she certainly does. For a while she just lies on the floor. Later, she joins in with&nbsp;the life of the convent – preparing food, cleaning, turning up to mass and&nbsp;the hours of office. There’s no great conversion moment, no sense of&nbsp;redemption, just some women getting on with things. This

The views are amazing and varied, from gorges and ledges to grassy mountaintop finishes and, for the bold, huge vertical ladders – with castles, bastions and shrines along the route. It’s a great area, too, for hiring a bike or picking one of the many apartments that include them, to explore the paths and see the lakes and mountains by pedal power. Bored with all that? There’s also paddleboarding, windsurfing, swimming and river boat trips. All accompanied by brilliant food and gelato.<br />

<p>This goes far beyond a Tory donor’s racist comments about Diane Abbott, and Labour’s opportunistic response</p><p>“The very serious function of racism is distraction,” Toni Morrison argued in a lecture in Portland, Oregon, in 1975. <em>“</em>It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining, over and over again, your reason for being. Somebody says you have no language and so you spend 20 years proving that you do. Somebody says your head isn’t shaped properly so you have scientists working on the fact that it is. Somebody says that you have no art, so you dredge that up. Somebody says that you have no kingdoms, and so you dredge that up. None of that is necessary. There will always be one more thing.”</p><p>So, in the furore over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/11/biggest-tory-donor-looking-diane-abbott-hate-all-black-women">Frank Hester’s comments</a>, let us not be distracted by the question of whether they were racist.

<p>It’s an eight-game lineup, with places at Wembley up for grabs and a quartet of top-flight matches too</p><p>Gary O’Neil conceded his decision to start Pedro Neto against Fulham backfired, with the Portuguese winger set to miss Wolves’ date with Coventry on Saturday after aggravating a hamstring problem. Jean-Ricner Bellegarde is also a doubt with a knee injury sustained in the same game, so opportunities could arise for those on the periphery. Nathan Fraser, the 19-year-old forward, made his full debut last time out. Noha Lemina, the 18-year-old brother of midfielder Mario who was on the bench against Fulham, could get his first minutes in old gold while the 18-year-old striker Leon Chiwome – tipped for a bright future last year in our Next Generation series – is another untried option. The 20-year-old midfielder Tawanda Chirewa could also feature but O’Neil, with last week’s big calls fresh in the memory, will be careful not to be too bold given what is at stake. <strong
