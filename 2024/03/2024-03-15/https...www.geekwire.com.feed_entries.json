The Real-Time Traffic Signal Safety Interventions (RTSSI) project will test the use of intelligent sensors, video analytics, deep learning and edge computing to detect risks for vulnerable road users and immediately adjust traffic signals. &#8220;Our traffic signal systems are really optimized for vehicle throughput,&#8221; said Laura Milstead, a public information officer with the Bellevue Transportation Department. &#8220;Those signals aren&#8217;t dynamic enough and remain static for people who&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/bellevue-awarded-1-4m-to-test-tech-that", "page_rating_visits": 0}, {"tags": [], "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "title": "Tech Moves: Optimize Health names new CEO; Seattle-area marketing firm makes acquisition", "comments": [], "album": "", "page_rating_votes": 0, "language": "en-US", "vote": 0, "age": null, "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/tech-moves-optimize-health-names-new-ceo-marketing-firm-makes-acquisition", "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 131, "user": null, "date_published": "2024-03-15T17:57:45+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "permanent": false, "page_rating_contents": 94, "dead": false, "thumbnail": null, "page_rating": 94, "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1631278764456.jpeg\" width=\"800\" /><br />Optimize Health, a Seattle-based startup that sells remote patient monitoring software, announced Ryan Clark as its new CEO.
