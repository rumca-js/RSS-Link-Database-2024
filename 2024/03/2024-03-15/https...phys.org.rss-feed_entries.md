Liquid crystal monomers (LCMs) are synthetic organic chemicals used in manufacturing liquid crystal displays (LCDs) present in numerous digital electronic devices. As the use of digital electronics, such as computers and smartphones, becomes increasingly prevalent, concerns over LCM exposure have risen to prominence as a public health issue. However, research into the occurrence of LCMs in human and environmental matrices remains limited.

## Not just a lodger: Novel host-guest assembly provides enhanced reactivity

By design, synthetic molecules typically have specific jobs to prevent or accelerate reactions between other molecules. To help control more complicated reactions, researchers may harness spare space in one molecule to synthesize another chemical structure. The host-guest assembly can better induce the specific desired reaction than either component individually—if the scientists designing the assembly get it right.

Australia is home to more than 350 species of native mammals, 87% of which are found nowhere else on Earth. But with 39 of these species already extinct and a further 110 listed as threatened, there's every chance many will vanish before you even knew they existed. So here's one we think you simply must know (and save), before it's too late.

Researchers studying the role of proteins in health and disease use experimental tools that inactivate proteins, destroy them, or prevent them from being made in cells. In one approach, they mark targeted proteins with "destroy me" tags that work with small molecules known as molecular glues to prompt the cell's own protein-clearing machinery to gobble up the proteins. Yet, many tags used today are too large to tag the genes that encode a cell's native proteins, or they cause collateral damage, sparking destruction of proteins beyond the targeted one.
