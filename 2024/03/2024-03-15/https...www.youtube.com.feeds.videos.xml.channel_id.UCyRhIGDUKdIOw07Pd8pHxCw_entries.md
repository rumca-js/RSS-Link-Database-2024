Sometimes, we get things wrong. Well, Tom does. In this absolutely massive video, Tom and Matt dive into the design of Dune: Imperium - and how itâ€™s grown and evolved since we last covered it in 2021. We also review the latest (and perhaps greatest) version of the game to date: Dune: Imperium - Uprising. Enjoy!
