Subsequently, the Biden Administration is sending $1 billion to the border. But it‚Äôs not to assist in the migrant crisis. It‚Äôs to combat climate change. </p><p><br /></p>

He tried to get that conviction overturned by the Supreme Court. The court held that conviction but they were not happy that the judge in the case referred to the victim as a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù because that is ‚Äúunfortunate‚Äù and it‚Äôs ‚Äúconfusing.‚Äù And instead, the judge should have said ‚ÄúPerson with a vagina.‚Äù </p>
<p>That is not satire. The Canadian Supreme Court degraded a rape victim as nothing more than a ‚Äúperson with a vagina.‚Äù It does not even look like she identifies as trans. The court is just that deranged and that asinine. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

But in reality, ‚ÄúTrans rights‚Äù are only possible by destroying the civil liberties of women everywhere. </p>
<p>No one knows this better than Riley Gains. </p><p>Gaines, along with many other female athletes, were forced to not only share a locker room with a man, but many of them lost out on winning titles for things they dedicated their entire lives to. </p>
<p>All of that was considered illegal not even a decade ago. If a man claimed to be a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù and insisted he must undress in the women‚Äôs locker room, that would be condemned to the fullest extent. But one day Progressives woke up and decided that that very act was worth being glorified ins
