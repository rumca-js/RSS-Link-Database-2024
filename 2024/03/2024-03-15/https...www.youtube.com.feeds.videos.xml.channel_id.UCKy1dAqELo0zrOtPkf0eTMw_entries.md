Backpack Battles Early Access reviewed by Michael Higham on PC.

Backpack Battles has a strong foundation, smartly mixing the satisfying puzzle of inventory organization with some clever RPG elements and autobattler combat. The systems and ideas in place offer something refreshing, although its current barebones state leaves a lot of potential waiting on the table. As it stands, there's a noticeable lack of content and few reasons to come back to it after you've seen everything once. What's there is enjoyable, though, with plenty of room to grow, and my time with the Early Access build of Backpack Battles has me excited to see it do just that.

Tribes 3: Rivals Early Access reviewed by Travis Northup on PC.

Tribes 3: Rivals is a return to form for the series that absolutely nails the most essential parts of this iconic high-speed murder fiesta – but in its current Early Access state, it’s also missing a whole lot that its predecessors pulled off so well, from alternate game modes to vehicles. I’ve had a blast relearning the ropes and becoming a badass titan of the skies once more, despite weird party size limitations and the odd bug here and there, and I’m hopeful the planned ongoing development will make this a more fully featured sequel. But for now, much like controlling the jetpack-powered commandos it stars, Tribes 3 is a really fun time that threatens to run out of fuel quite quickly.

In today's Daily Fix:
The ambitious space sim Star Citizen has been in development for more than a decade, and has allegedly cost over $700 million to make...but it's never been officially released. However, creator Chris Roberts posted on a blog that the upcoming Alpha 4.0 release has accelerated the development of new features and that a full 1.0 release "twinkles on the horizon." In other news, the Palworld devs have a problem: they're making too much money. The game cost less than $6 million to develop, but has already raked in at least ten times their production costs. Yeah, we're not jealous at all. And finally, Minecraft is getting a subscription service. Content from the Minecraft Marketplace will be curated by Microsoft and could be a decent deal for younger players who just want to check out a bunch of stuff and don't have a lot of coin to buy everything.

Immaculate reviewed by Katie Rife. In theaters March 22, 2024.
Immaculate has all the elements of a successful religious horror movie: A macabre setting, a rising star, a disturbing premise, and creepy imagery. It’s beautifully shot, and very loud. But much of the film is simply too mild and reliant on jump scares, and Syndey Sweeney’s performance doesn’t achieve the hysterical heights a movie like this needs until it’s too late.

It doesn’t always come together, thanks to some slapdash filmmaking, but it’s funny and sincere enough to make for a good time.

Things can start a little slow and the story definitely ends too early as of its Early Access launch, but the charming world to explore and make your own outshines its current limitations.

Based on Pulitzer Prize winner Stacy Schiff’s book, “A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France, and the Birth of America,” “Franklin” explores the thrilling story of the greatest gamble of Benjamin Franklin’s career. In December 1776, Franklin is world famous for his electrical experiments, but his passion and power are put to the test when – as the fate of American independence hangs in the balance – he embarks on a secret mission to France.
 
At age 70, without any diplomatic training, Franklin convinced an absolute monarchy to underwrite America’s experiment in democracy. By virtue of his fame, charisma and ingenuity, Franklin outmaneuvered British spies, French informers and hostile colleagues to engineer the Franco-American alliance of 1778 and the peace treaty with Great Britain in 1783.
 
The eight-year French mission stands as Franklin’s most vital service to his country. Diplomats and historians still regard it as the greatest single tour of duty by an ambassador in ou
