Ninja Theory has confirmed Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 will - like its predecessor, so not exactly a massive surprise - have a photo mode on release, meaning you can go wild recording its striking visuals for prosperity when it launches for Xbox Series X/S and PC on 21st May.
</p><p>
Confirmation of a photo mode in Hellblade 2 came via Ninja Theory's social media channels, with the announcement being <a href="https://twitter.com/NinjaTheory/status/1768653457165058133">accompanied by four new images</a> of the game taken using the same in-game camera that'll be available to players. And yes, it still looks bloody lovely.
</p><p>
There's not much more to report on the photo mode front, alas, leading us back to Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hellblade-2-finally-gets-may-release-date">most recent news dump</a>,

Developer Heart Machine has revealed Hyper Light Breaker - the studio's co-operative rogue-lite spin in its acclaimed 2016 action-adventure Hyper Light Drifter - is now targeting a Steam early access launch sometime this "summer" following several delays.
</p><p>
Hyper Light Breaker was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-drifter-is-getting-a-fully-3d-rogue-lite-follow-up-with-online-co-op">announced all the way back in March 2022</a> and was originally expected to launch into early access the following spring. However, it's been hit with multiple delays since then, with its release first shifting to autumn 2023 before it was pushed back to a non-specific point in 2024 so Heart Machine could "bring the game to its full potential".

But now, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyper-li

Developer Mojang has warned anyone playing Minecraft through the Xbox app on PC not to download its latest update as it could cause their worlds to disappear.
</p><p>
That warning comes via Mojang's <a href="https://twitter.com/MojangStatus/status/1768524674403549619">official Minecraft service status social media account</a>, which writes, "Do not update Minecraft through the Xbox app on PC. If you do, your worlds may be lost." Mojang instead recommends players first run the Gaming Services Repair Tool for PC, accessible through the PC app, before installing the new update.

It's been a while since we last heard from Commandos: Origins, developer Claymore Game Studios' revival of the classic WW2 real-time stealth-tactics series, but it's back to show off some of the locations players will be tensely sneaking around in a new trailer.
</p><p>
Commandos, should you be in need of a quite mental refresher, first surfaced in 1998 with launch of original developer Pyro Studios' first series entry, Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines - a notoriously tough, if undoubtedly excellent isometric WW2 adventure in which players took charge of a six-strong team of commandos to complete the likes of sabotage and assassination missions, all while staying as stealthy as possible.

Five more series instalments followed, with Commandos eventually fizzling out with 2006's first-person effort, Commandos: Str

## Kingdom Come: Deliverance is one of the most ambitious Switch ports we've seen

Kingdom Come: Deliverance joins an impressive list of 'impossible ports' on Nintendo Switch and ranks among the most ambitious yet seen on the system. Originally developed by Warhorse Studios for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC back in 2018, it's an open world fantasy RPG powered by CryEngine 3. Marked by sprawling landscapes, complex towns - plus the more advanced CryEngine features for its time, it truly pushed last-gen consoles to their limits. And still does, in fact, given that performance struggles to always lock at 30fps to this day. So today, the challenge of making a such a game run on Switch - a portable machine with greater hardware limits - isn't a trivial one. 
</p><p>
Rising to that challenge is Saber Interactive, a team that - on paper - is more than qualified for the task. Betwe

A replica of Elden Ring's Dark Moon Greatsword can now be bought, if you've got a spare &pound;360.
</p><p>
The sword replica is a metre and a half long and is made of resin, so hopefully isn't as heavy as it looks. And of course it's painted in brilliant, magical blue.
</p><p>
And while it's perfect for cosplayers looking to dress up as a Tarnished, it also comes with a wall mount for those who simply want to display their big weapon.

Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called Valve "assholes" in an old email thread that's been dug up as part of a lawsuit against the Steam owner.
</p><p>
The email thread, spotted by <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-tim-sweeneys-epic-rant-to">GameDiscoverCo</a>, was between Sweeney and Valve's head Gabe Newell discussing the economics of the Steam platform. It began in 2017 with an email from Newell to Sweeney pointedly asking "Anything we doing to annoy you?" and referencing a post from Valve's Sean Jenkins about restricting Steam keys given to developers. 
</p><p>
Sweeney responded instead on "the economics of these 30 percent platform fees" which he described as "no longer justifiable". In short, he said the marketing benefits of the Steam storefront is "far disproportionate to the fee" thanks to "the churn of

Inflexion Games, developer of Victorian fantasy survival crafting game Nightingale, has admitted there are several aspects of the game it's currently "not happy with", following disappointing player numbers at the game's recent launch. 
</p><p>
Nightingale launched on 20th February with a Steam peak of 47,569 players, but this has trailed off ever since, and this week has seen active player counts in the single digit thousands. Meanwhile, player reviews are listed as "mixed". Studio boss Aaryn Flynn has said the team was now gathering feedback, and that the team was aware of several issues. 
</p><p>
"We've been spending a lot of our time reading your impressions online, going through Discord, watching your streams and building our plans for the next phase of the game," Flynn shared. "There are some things we are not happy wi
