When you look at 2004\u2019s state of the art, it\u2019s staggering to see how far we\u2019ve come. There are now billions of devices in our hands, and homes that listen to our queries and do their very best to answer them. But for all of the time, money and effort, chatbots of any stripe have not swallowed the world as their creators intended. They\u2019re miraculous. They\u2019re also boring. And it\u2019s worth asking why.</p>\n<p>Chatbot is a term covering a lot of systems, from voice assistants to AI and everything else in the middle. Talking to your computer in the not-so-good old days meant typing into a window and watching the machine attempt a facsimile of the act of conversation rather than the real thing. The old ELIZA (1964 to 1967) trick of restating user inputs in the form of a question helped sell this performance. And this continued even as far as 2001\u2019s SmarterChild chatbot.

The House passed a bill that could ultimately ban the company if ByteDance doesn\u2019t sell it off within six months.
