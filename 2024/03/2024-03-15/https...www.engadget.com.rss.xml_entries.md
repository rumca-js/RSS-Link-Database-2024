<p>The Federal Trade Commission is looking into Reddit’s AI licensing deals, the company <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm#i1b9a579e78a34dfa99f7f26daeec195b_13"><ins>disclosed</ins></a> in paperwork filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company, which is in the midst of its Initial Public Offering, said that the regulator notified Reddit officials that it  “intended to request information and documents” about the company’s AI deals.</p>
<p>It’s not clear why the FTC is probing Reddit’s relatively new licensing business, but it seems to be in the early stages of its inquiry. “On March 14, 2024, we received a letter from the FTC advising us that the FTC’s staff is conducting a non-public inquiry focused on our sale, licensing, or sharing of user-generated content with third parties to train AI models,” Reddit wrote in a filing. “Given the novel nature of these technologies and

The council passed an ordinance on the issue last week. On Thursday, it voted to overrule a mayoral veto of the measure.</p>
<p>The new rules stipulate that ridesharing companies need to pay drivers at least $1.40 per mile and 51 cents per minute (or $5 a ride, whichever is higher) whenever they're ferrying a passenger. Tips are on top of the minimum pay. According to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/minneapolis-uber-lyft-ridehailing-minimum-wage-d60db6a2e2580dc1d93c438a8cffa5ee"><em><ins>Associated Press</ins></em></a>, the council passed the ordinance to bring driver pay closer to the local minimum wage of $15.57 an hour.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix/"><ins>Netflix</ins></a> is the new streaming home of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor as part of a multiyear deal. This year's prize is going to Kevin Hart, who is being honored for his "extraordinary contributions to the genre and his impressive achievements across comedy, film and television." The likes of Dave Chappelle, Jimmy Fallon, Tiffany Haddish, Regina Hall, Chelsea Handler, Nelly, Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld are set to pay tribute to Hart (and perhaps roast him a bit) at the ceremony.

This doesn't look to be another Prime Day situation, however; Amazon says most of the offers will be available to everyone, with only some exclusives for Prime members. We don't expect this Spring sale to be as heavy on tech-specific deals, either: Amazon's press release says it'll include Echo and Kindle discounts and "up to 40 percent off select electronics" but mostly highlights things like outdoor furniture, beauty products, clothing and sports equipment.<br /><br />If past Amazon sales are any indication, most of these discounts will be bad.

<p>Conversing with your computer has been a dream of futurists and technologists for decades. When you look at 2004’s state of the art, it’s staggering to see how far we’ve come. There are now billions of devices in our hands, and homes that listen to our queries and do their very best to answer them. But for all of the time, money and effort, chatbots of any stripe have not swallowed the world as their creators intended. They’re miraculous. They’re also boring. And it’s worth asking why.</p>
<p>Chatbot is a term covering a lot of systems, from voice assistants to AI and everything else in the middle. Talking to your computer in the not-so-good old days meant typing into a window and watching the machine attempt a facsimile of the act of conversation rather than the real thing. The old ELIZA (1964 to 1967) trick of restating user inputs in the form of a question helped sell this performance. And this continued even as far as 2001’s SmarterChild chatbot.

<p>Another week, another concerted effort to ban TikTok in the US – except this time, it could actually happen. In this episode, Cherlynn and Devindra chat with Engadget Senior Editor Karissa Bell around the latest TikTok drama. The House passed a bill that could ultimately ban the company if ByteDance doesn’t sell it off within six months. It may face a tougher fight in the Senate, but if it’s approved there President Biden has said he’s willing to sign it into law.</p>
<p>Is this a justified fight against the Chinese-owned social media company, or is it the sum of our political fears against all things China? (Maybe it’s a bit of both?) We discuss why this potential ban could be a huge civil rights violation, as well as the need for true data privacy laws in the US, which would apply to all social networks.</p>

<p>Whether you want to set the right mood for your next movie night or you just want hands-free control of your home’s lighting, smart light bulbs might be the solution for you. These IoT devices make it easy to customize and change the lighting in your space as much (or as little) as you want. Some of them support millions of colors while others run the spectrum of warm and cool white light. Smart light bulbs are also some of the easiest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-home-devices-154557162.html">smart home devices</a> to get started with, with many of them working over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, requiring no centralized hub.

<p>We love tech of all shapes and sizes around here, but over the past decade it’s become increasingly obvious that our gadget fervor comes at a cost —especially when it comes to the environment. Metal and plastic don’t fully decompose over time, and almost everything we buy now has rare earth elements in it. But all is not lost as companies and consumers alike have become more cognizant of the problem, and offer possible solutions.</p>
<p>On your end, this means disposing of your old products responsibly, allowing companies and governments to reuse some components and dispose of others in a safe manner. That means taking the things you can’t give away or sell to a recycling center or, at the least, to a store that can pass it along for recycling. Check out our advice below on how to find a place that’ll take your old phones, computers and other broken or outdated gadgets.</p>
