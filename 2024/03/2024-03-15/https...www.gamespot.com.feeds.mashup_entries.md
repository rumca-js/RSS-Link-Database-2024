<p>Despite both being Godzilla movies, the recent Japanese flick Godzilla Minus One and the upcoming Hollywood blockbuster Godzilla X Kong have dramatically different vibes. Godzilla Minus One is a very somber and brooding rumination on the trauma of World War II, and Godzilla X Kong is more focused on spectacle.</p><p dir="ltr">But Godzilla X Kong director Adam Wingard, who also directed the previous movie in the MonsterVerse franchise, says the two films have a crucial piece of DNA in common: He and Godzilla Minus One director Yamazaki Takashi both used cat behavior as influences for Gozilla's mannerisms.</p><p dir="ltr">"With Godzilla himself in this movie, it's funny, like, one of my biggest influences is my cat Mischief. She was, on Godzilla vs Kong, a lot of the mannerisms of Godzilla," Wingard said during a presentation for press at IMAX headquarters, where they had a "war room" full of things from and related to the movie, with the walls covered with what Wingard call

<p dir="ltr">Season 2 Reloaded has introduced a Warhammer 40,000 crossover into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a>, bringing a limited-time mode called Juggermosh. This was initially described as a juggernaut suit mode played in third-person perspective, but this Warhammer 40,000 mode is more like fun-filled Space Marine chaos than just fighting in traditional Call of Duty-style juggernaut suits.</p><p dir="ltr">Before getting hands-on with Juggermosh, I wasn't immediately interested in the playlist. I'm not someone who is a super fan of the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, and juggernaut suits in Call of Duty can often feel sluggish to use and a pain to fight against. However, Juggermosh doesn't feel anything like you'd expect from Call of Duty's jugg suits and offers a distinct style of fun that's worth trying even if you're not a fan of hefty juggernaut armor.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr"> </p><a

It's quite a sight to behold. Cranston ends the song by planting a kiss on Banks' head. The song is being performed live by a person on a piano in the room.</p><p>Then Betsy Brandt (Marie Schrader) chimes in with, "This is gonna be just a shitty party, isn't it?" Norris replies, "And we just started drinking." Aaron Paul, who played Jesse Pinkman, was also in attendance at the dinner party and can be seen smiling widely.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/breaking-bad-cast-reunites-in-the-best-way/1100-6521879/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
