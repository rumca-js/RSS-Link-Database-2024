Like most young actors that strike gold and catch the break of a life time, when Elijah Wood was wrapping up his time as Frodo Baggins in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, there were many roads he could have taken.  Not wanting to be soley thought of as Frodo Baggins, Elijah Wood set out and crafted one of the more interesting careers in Hollywood.  Never forgetting his roots in Lord of the Rings, Elijah Wood wanted to create new, weird, and interesting works that showed he was capable of a wide range of characters and stories.    A big project like Lord of the Rings might ave been it for most up and coming actors,  but Frodo had other plans.
