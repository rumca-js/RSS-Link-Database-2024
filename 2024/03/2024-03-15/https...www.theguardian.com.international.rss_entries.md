Remember specifically 1990, when the assumption was that, after eight league games without a win, Alex Ferguson would be sacked by Manchester United if they went out of the FA Cup in the third round against Nottingham Forest, and how, with a grimly dogged performance, they won with a second-half Mark Robins goal?</p><p>That goal is a key moment in the legend of Ferguson at United.

<p>Midfielder started in England as a 15-year-old at Manchester United but, five clubs later, he is rewarding Marco Silva’s faith</p><p>As a child, Andreas Pereira would finish his football training and wait for his father to pick him up and take him home. The problem: his father, Marcos, was a senior professional at the same club, Lommel United in northern Belgium, and his own training session would often run late. One by one, Andreas’s friends would get picked up and leave. Slowly the car park would empty. Still he waited on his own. “They forgot about me,” he would think to himself.</p><p>The impatience and the impotence. The sensation of time passing, of being forgotten or overtaken, of wondering whether he would ever find home. In many ways these are the themes that would come to define Pereira’s career as an adult: a career that has taken in six clubs across a decade, and yet which feels as if it is only now beginning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2

She also reached 1,000 points in her collegiate career after dropping a season-high 20 against UC Santa Barbara in February 2023.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardia

<p>The president will use his inevitable win in the polls as a mandate for continuing the assault on Ukraine and going after domestic ‘elites’</p><p>For a few weeks in 2022, Vladimir Putin’s world was unravelling fast.

Putin himself appeared unhinged, railing against Lenin or appealing to Ukrainians to overthrow their “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”.</p><p>As Russians go to the polls on Friday in an election with only one possible result, the Kremlin will claim a mandate for that war, enshrining Putin’s bloodiest gamble as the country’s finest moment.

<p>This historical drama about the search for the US president’s assassin takes itself very seriously indeed. But the astonishing performances make it all worthwhile</p><p>Edwin Stanton was Abraham Lincoln’s secretary of war, confidant and friend, as well as an asthmatic and a workaholic. In the wake of the president’s assassination, he led a 12-day search for the killer, John Wilkes Booth, trying to get ahead of Booth’s plans while coping with his own ill health. I think it’s a toss-up as to whether he or I, after getting through Apple TV+’s miniseries about his endeavours, ended up more exhausted.</p><p>There is a lot going on in Manhunt. There is the assassination and the cat-and-mouse chase itself, obviously. But we know (roughly) how that ended, so to add a sense of jeopardy and uncertainty, the timeline is vastly fragmented. We begin on the day Lincoln is killed, then cut to 30 minutes before, then 10, then five days, then 10 hours, and sometimes we take leaps of years.

<p>Michael Gove is rewriting the government’s definition of ‘extremism’ but his actions have drawn criticism from across the political spectrum. Columnist Rafael Behr reports</p><p>Why does the government need a new definition of extremism? There are two ways of answering that, the Guardian’s political columnist <strong>Rafael Behr </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi. </strong>If you listen to the communities secretary, Michael Gove, you would hear a dark story of how certain organisations present themselves as moderate but beneath the surface are ideologically dangerous. These groups must be banned from interacting with the government at any level and blocked from receiving any funding. Another motivation, which the Conservatives would deny, is that it is an election year and they are fighting a campaign based on finding potential cultural dividing lines with Labour.</p><p>It’s been a bumpy week for the government to be highlighting its plan to deal with extremism.
