So I‚Äôve talked about some algorithms‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve talked about some data structures. I‚Äôve shown what they look like, how the code behind them works, why it‚Äôs important to choose the right ones, and mentioned how they‚Äôre used, but it‚Äôs been brought to my attention that I haven‚Äôt shown how they are used in an actual application. In this video, I do just that.
