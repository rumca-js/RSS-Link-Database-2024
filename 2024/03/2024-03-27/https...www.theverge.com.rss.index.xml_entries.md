  <p id="uYybLV">Israel has deployed a mass facial recognition program in the Gaza Strip, creating a database of Palestinians without their knowledge or consent, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/technology/israel-facial-recognition-gaza.html"><em>The New York Times</em> reports</a>. The program, which was created after the October 7th attacks, uses technology from Google Photos as well as a custom tool built by the Tel Aviv-based company Corsight to identify people affiliated with Hamas.</p>

  <p id="btcQ1j">Dbrand is scrapping plans to fix its anti-yellowing Ghost Case, but not because it yellows — it’s that it scratches very easily. The company had <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/dbrand-promises-fix-for-ghost-case-scratches-free-replacements">promised in November to ship free</a> replacements with scratch-resistant coatings, but now it’s telling customers via email they’ll have to wait. Most of its production run of those ended up “unshippable,” the company says, so instead it’s sending a redesigned “Ghost 2.0” this summer. Essentially, it’s a delay.</p>
