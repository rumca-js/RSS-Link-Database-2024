However, for those who haven't played the title, it's impressive to look at its gameplay loop and how much has changed since March 2018. Where there were only Trading Companies and the odd Kraken to fight, there are now narrative-focused quests, a stronger end-game and Safer Seas, private servers for those who prefer to opt out of PvE.\n\nOf course, that's not counting the sheer range of cosmetics, High Seas shenanigans and more. Here are 15 things that new players on PS5 should know about Sea of Thieves before diving in.", "status_code": 0, "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/8Hm774gtOxE/hqdefault.jpg", "bookmarked": false, "page_rating": 100, "manual_status_code": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "language": null, "page_rating_contents": 100, "artist": null, "date_published": "2024-03-27T19:15:00+00:00", "vote": 0, "tags": [], "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "comments": [], "album": "", "page_rating_votes": 0, "user": null}, {"source_obj__id": 129, "age": null, "title": "Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles Review - The Final Verdict", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MfRsf9Sdlk", "description": "Have you ever wanted to sit down with a city-builder and not deal with the nitty-gritty of research, resource allocation and storage, the more complex needs of your civilians and so on?
