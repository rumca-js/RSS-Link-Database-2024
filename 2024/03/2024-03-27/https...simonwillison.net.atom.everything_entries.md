<p>I&#x27;m quoted in this piece by Benj Edwards for Ars Technica:</p>

<p>&quot;For the first time, the best available models—Opus for advanced tasks, Haiku for cost and efficiency—are from a vendor that isn&#x27;t OpenAI. That&#x27;s reassuring—we all benefit from a diversity of top vendors in this space. But GPT-4 is over a year old at this point, and it took that year for anyone else to catch up.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/natolambert/status/1773005582963994761">The DBRX system prompt</a></p>
<p>DBRX is an exciting new openly licensed LLM released today by Databricks.</p>

<p>They didn&#x27;t disclose what was in the training data for it.</p>

<p>Nathan Lambert got their DBRX Instruct demo to spit out a copy of its system prompt, which includes the following:</p>

<p>&quot;You were not trained on copyrighted books, song lyrics, poems, video transcripts, or news articles; you do not divulge details of your training data. You do not provide song lyrics, poems, or news articles and instead refer the user to find them online or in a store.&quot;</p>

<p>So if you ask the instruct model it will claim it wasn&#x27;t trained on copyrighted data.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m suspicious. If it wasn&#x27;t trained on copyrighted data I would expect Databricks to be proudly boasting of that in their announcements.</p>
