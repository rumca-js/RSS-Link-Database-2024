As some of the most famous Dungeons &amp; Dragons players in the world it's interesting to see the company perhaps stepping away from the RPG giant. However, when sitting down to read through the playtest material myself and Wheels were left feeling a little lost, asking ourselves why we struggled to click with the game. Does the world really need another fantasy TTRPG? And is this the best one if it does?\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/daggerheart/video/do-we-need-daggerheart?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed\">Read more</a></p>", "status_code": 0, "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/do-we-need-this.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "bookmarked": false, "page_rating": 100, "manual_status_code": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "language": "en", "page_rating_contents": 100, "artist": null, "date_published": "2024-03-27T17:21:00+00:00", "vote": 0, "tags": [], "source": "https://www.dicebreaker.com/feed", "comments": [], "album": "", "page_rating_votes": 0, "user": null}, {"source_obj__id": 93, "age": null, "title": "D&D 5E shrinks down to a Borrowers and Arrietty-like world in Adventures in the Household RPG", "link": "https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/adventures-in-the-household/news/adventures-in-the-household-5e-adaptation-arrietty-borrowers-kickstarter?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/adventures-in-the-household-5e-pantry-mouse.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>Fantasy stories have long been obsessed with the worldbuilding premise of &ldquo;What if normal-sized things were instead very small?&rdquo; Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels, Arrietty, and - closer to the tabletop RPG realm - Mausritter&rsquo;s world of rodent explorers all portray settings where our normal sense of scale is completely upended  Adventures in the Household follows in this tradition by adapting its original system of tiny travails to the popular <a href=\"https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/dungeons-and-dragons-5e/how-to/how-to-play-dnd-5e\">D&amp;D 5th Edition rules</a>.</p><p>Currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter, Adventures in the Household transmutes the Ennie Award-nominated <a href=\"https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/household/news/household-english-version\">Household RPG</a> into 5E rules bu", "status_code": 0, "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/adventures-in-the-household-5e-pantry-mouse.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "bookmarked": false, "page_rating": 100, "manual_status_code": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "language": "en", "page_rating_contents": 100, "artist": null, "date_published": "2024-03-27T16:04:17+00:00", "vote": 0, "tags": [], "source": "https://www.dicebreaker.com/feed", "comments": [], "album": "", "page_rating_votes": 0, "user": null}, {"source_obj__id": 93, "age": null, "title": "How Yu-Gi-Oh!\u2019s 1999 starter decks turned the card game from a flop into a phenomenon", "link": "https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/yu-gi-oh-tcg/feature/yu-gi-oh-1999-starter-decks-turned-tcg-from-flop-into-phenomenon?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/yu-gi-oh-tcg-duel-monsters-ex-starter-set-reprint-decks.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>Starter decks have long been an essential part of Yu-Gi-Oh!, providing pre-built decks that can introduce the rules to new players and allowing them to instantly jump into a duel to practise what they&rsquo;ve learned.
