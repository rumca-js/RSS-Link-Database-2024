Sand Land is an upcoming action RPG developed by ILCA and published by Bandai Namco, and is based on the manga of the same name created by the late Akira Toriyama. While Sand Land was a fairly short story, the game adds an entirely new chapter to the saga, bringing Beelzebub, Sheriff Rao, and Thief to Forest Land. Sand Land is currently set to release April 26, 2024 for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
