<p>Graceful error handling is an essential aspect of well-designed software. It’s also tricky. This article offers an overview of error handling in React applications and how to use React error boundaries to handle render-time errors.</p><h2 class="toc">React error types</h2>
<p>We can divide React application errors broadly into two types, and error handling into two aspects.</p><p>The two React error types:</p><ul>
<li>JavaScript errors: These are conventional JavaScript errors that occur in the code portion of a component.</li>
<li>Render errors: These are errors raised by the rendering engine, emerging from the markup.</li>
</ul>
