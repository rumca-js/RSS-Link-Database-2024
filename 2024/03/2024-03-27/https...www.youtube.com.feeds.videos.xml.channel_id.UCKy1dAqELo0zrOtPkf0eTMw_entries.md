In today's Fix of entertainment news:
Pierce Brosnan, the 90's-era James Bond, has had nothing but praise for likely frontrunner Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Taylor-Johnson is rumored to have recieved an offer to take on the 007 role, but nothing has been announced officially. In other news, a new version of Disney Plus has rolled out, this one combining that service's offerings with Hulu. Subscribers to both can now access their combined libraries of content from just one app. Convenient. And finally, Jack Black would love to see a Red Dead Redemption or Grand Theft Auto remake.

A new month means new games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. In April, Immortals of Aveum, Skul: The Hero Slayer, and Minecraft Legends are coming to the service. Immortals received positive reviews from many media outlets (including an 8 out of 10 from IGN), but it didn't sell well to keep the studio afloat. Developer Ascendant studios announced layoffs about a month after the game's launch. In other news, GameStop's slow decline continues, as analysts call the company's sales slump "unsustainable." And finally, rumors of a multiplayer-focused hero shooter from Marvel were true. Marvel Rivals was announced today, and it looks a lot like popular hero shooter Overwatch mixed in with Valorant.

Open Roads reviewed by Sarah Thwaites on PC, also available on Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.

Propelled by a star-studded cast and charming retro world, Open Roads' tale of family tragedy stumbles over its heavier themes, delivering an earnest but ultimately safe road trip mystery. Pottering through meticulous environments full of kitschy decor was at least enough to keep me entertained for its short runtime. However, with sharp teeth and no bite, I was left hungry for something meatier and more emotionally charged by the time the credits rolled.
