		Selfie biometrics cannot be relied on to show you are a real person, and government ID documents do not scale. These provocative opinions were shared in a recent <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/selfies-can-no-longer-prove-humanness-online-how-to-get-ahead-of-it/amp/">Forbes</a> Technology Council (fee-based) post by Tools for Humanity Head of Protocol Steven Smith.

Tools for Humanity is the developer for <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/events-in-dozens-of-countries-to-mark-2023-id-day">Worldcoin</a>, so Smith has an interest in making a case for cryptographic digital ID as preferable to other forms of remote identity verification.

		The London Metropolitan police’s use of facial recognition for what it calls “precision policing” based on “bespoke” watchlists has resulted in 17 arrests in London, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68638348.amp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the BBC</a>. The arrests come on the heels of 42 face biometrics-assisted arrests in February – leading critics to level accusations of Orwellian surveillance tactics.

The Met police force, which has benefited from a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/uks-230-million-plan-to-implement-police-facial-recognition-and-drones">government investment</a> of £230 million (approximately US$295 million) in drones and facial recognition technology, has responded to those allegations

		Colorado-based startup Biofire says that it will begin shipping its fingerprint and facial recognition-equipped handguns by the end of March. But the smart weapon maker will still face resistance among gun rights advocates who claim that the technology is unreliable and that smart guns are a backdoor to controlling firearm ownership in the U.S.

The Biofire Smart Gun was designed to prevent unauthorized use by validating user identity, reducing accidental shootings by children, teen suicides, theft and criminal use. Firearms are the<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2201761"> leading cause of death</a> for children in America.

Earlier this year, an employee in the finance department of a multinational company based in Hong Kong was scammed by bad actors who digitally recreated a version of the company’s chief financial officer. The deepfake CFO – created through publicly available video footage – ordered money transfers during a Zoom call with multiple participants. It turns out, the only real person on the call was the employee and yet it was so believable that they followed the “CFO’s” instructions and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/deepfake-videos-looked-so-real-that-an-employee-agreed-to-send-them-25-million">complied with the request</a>.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> has potentially addressed security concerns when it comes to safeguarding sensitive biometric data, such as facial images or fingerprints, by storing processed data that are derived from raw data templates. This measure minimizes the risk of exposing biometric information in the event of a device breach.

Additionally, software updates present a challenge as pre-existing enrollment biometric data may not be compatible with the new version. However, Apple has proposed a solution that allows for a transition of the enrollment templates from the old algorithm to the updated one.

		Efforts by Djiboutian law enforcement agencies to deal with violence and terrorist threats in East Africa through the responsible collection, analysis, transfer, and protection of biometric data, recently came under review in an awareness-raising workshop.

The workshop, which took place early this month, is part of a project supported by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) which aims to support the country’s government draft legislation for the responsible management of biometric data to track criminal activities, per a <a href="https://www.unodc.org/">UNODC</a> announcement.

		Public-private partnerships (PPPs) may play a critical role in the development of a national digital identity infrastructure around the world. Digital transformation initiatives and the rollout of digital public infrastructure (DPI) in Africa, Europe, and Southeast Asia show a government-led push for a shift to digital services, but involving the private sector might be key to accessing the resources needed to establish a comprehensive DPI.
