Rare's successful live-service pirate title Sea of Thieves is out on April 30th for PlayStation 5 after months of rumors, part of Microsoft's strategy of multi-platform games.

Launching with Season 12 on other platforms, it will have a closed beta before launch and early access for the full version. However, for those who haven't played the title, it's impressive to look at its gameplay loop and how much has changed since March 2018. Where there were only Trading Companies and the odd Kraken to fight, there are now narrative-focused quests, a stronger end-game and Safer Seas, private servers for those who prefer to opt out of PvE.

Of course, that's not counting the sheer range of cosmetics, High Seas shenanigans and more. Here are 15 things that new players on PS5 should know about Sea of Thieves before diving in.

Have you ever wanted to sit down with a city-builder and not deal with the nitty-gritty of research, resource allocation and storage, the more complex needs of your civilians and so on? If so, Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles may have something for you.

From the same developer as The Falconeer, it offers a precedented amount of building freedom with intuitive tools and a gorgeous world to explore. As you venture through the world, various factions can be brought to your bulwark, though balancing the population becomes necessary. Otherwise, there are random events and other outposts to discover, supply routes to secure and maybe a little war to wage.

While it does lack many of the finer depths of the genre, not to mention a more involving narrative, Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles delivers on its premise with aplomb.

## Open Roads Review - The Final Verdict

Open Roads aims to tell a very simple story about a daughter and her mother setting off on a road trip. Along the way, the duo are met with plenty of plot twists and interesting revelations about each other. When it comes to actually playing Open Roads, however, there isn’t much there. You’ll walk around its levels, find items, examine them, and maybe have a conversation with your mother about them.

Despite its lack of much in the way of interactivity, however, Open Roads still ends up telling a surprisingly compelling story about this family, the relationship its members have had with each other, and some of the traumas that may have been involved along the way. 

Sadly, the game’s approach to animating its conversations feel out of place enough to make even the stellar voice acting sometimes feel stunted and badly paced.

## How Rise of the Ronin WASTES Its Open World Potential

Team Ninja’s first foray into open world game design isn’t a total disaster despite what some reviewers have you believe. Rise of the Ronin excels in highly customisable combat – a feature expected given the Nioh, Ninja Gaiden, and So Long: Fallen Dynasty producing studio behind this one – and excellent traversal mechanics beef up the journeying across an intriguing open world. 

However, intriguing as it may be, Rise of the Ronin’s open world is undeniably underwhelming. The game takes place during the politically tumultuous Bakumatsu era – as interesting a point in Japanese history as any other – yet the open world Team Ninja have created provides next to no environmental storytelling to flesh out the era our wandering masterless samurai finds themselves in. Outdated paint-by-numbers quest design lessens the effectiveness of this promising open world too.

Calling Dragon’s Dogma 2 a mechanically dense game would be a huge understatement, to say the very least. The action RPG is a mind bogglingly massive game, and in addition to being packed full of places to explore, enemies to trounce, and quests to take on, it is also got a bevy of systems and mechanics tucked away that are entirely too easy to miss. 

From exploration to combat to progression, several of these mechanics can make life significantly easier for players, so to help make your journey through Dragon’s Dogma 2’s fantasy world a little bit smoother, here, we are going to talk about a few things in the game that you absolutely should not be ignoring.
