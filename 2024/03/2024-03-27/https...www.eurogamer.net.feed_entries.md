Europa, the absolutely lovely looking Ghibli-inspired exploration adventure from developer Helder Pinto, has been delayed - and will now likely launch for PC this "summer".
</p><p>
Europa - a "peaceful game of adventure, exploration, and meditation" set on a terraformed moon in Jupiter's shadow - has been in the works since 2017 (Pinto, a former principle art lead at Blizzard has described it as a "passion project"), but it finally got a release date at the end of last year, with the team aiming to launch on 16th April 2024.
</p><p>
However, with that date just weeks away now, Pinto has made the decision to push Europa's release back by a couple of months, "probably until summer".

Nintendo has reportedly cut 120 contractor testing roles at its North American operation - with an unspecified number said to have been converted to full-time positions - as part of a major restructuring effort that comes amid claims of a testing "lull" ahead of Switch 2's arrival.
</p><p>
That's <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-layoffs-testing-zelda-totk-1851369539">according to Kotaku</a>, which describes the restructuring - based on word from a number of former and current contractors - as a "massive downsizing" of Nintendo's Washington-based testing team. While the publication's story doesn't put a number on the job cuts, reporter Ethan Gach said he understands "roughly 120 contractor positions have been eliminated at Nintendo of America" in a <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1773037002

Vampire survival game V Rising is getting an official Castlevania collaboration, introducing vampire hunter Simon Belmont and a range of series-inspired cosmetics, in May.

V Rising's Castlevania collaboration consists of two parts; legendary vampire hunter Simon Belmont will be available as a boss fight for all players in the base game - anyone that manages to overcome his holy arsenal and defeat him unlocks the new whip weapon - and he's accompanied by the Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack DLC.
</p><p>
This paid cosmetic DLC enables players to give their vampiric castle hangouts a bit of a Castlevania makeover with decor and trimmings inspired by the series. This includes the option to use two classic series themes - reimagined by V Rising composer Aleksandria Migova - as castle music. Additionally, the DLC incl

A teenage girl walked around a house looking at objects and talked to her mother about them. We were promised a family mystery but there was barely any sight of it, and I wondered when it would all kick in. Now having played it, I realise why that was: there wasn't much there to tease to begin with. Open Roads is a slight game, I now know, both in terms of running length and scope. There aren't grand ambitions or wild adventures. Instead, there's a story about smaller d

Currently supported titles from Microsoft include Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Pentiment and Halo Infinite. Other big-name games include Fortnite (through a browser only) and ARK Survival Evolved.

Orbital, the 27th major update to No Man's Sky, will arrive today and revamp the game's space stations. 
</p><p>
These deep space locations can now be "vast, procedurally generated, and incredibly diverse", developer Hello Games said today, announcing the update. The aim is for space stations to feel bigger, more individual, and offer new activities and shops for you to explore. It's here you'll also find the new Guild system, with envoys to visit.
</p><p>
Advancements to space stations mean No Man's Sky can also now offer customisation for basic spaceships. The long-requested addition of a ship editor means you can now gather and trade parts and cobble together all-new ship types. Here's how it all looks in action:

$400k worth of Playdate game consoles have disappeared in Las Vegas.
</p><p>
That's according to Panic, the hardware maker behind the palm-sized, crank-operated console, with company co-founder Cabel Sasser calling it "a bit of a true crime drama" (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/playdate-missing-venba-jedi-survivor">Game File</a>).
</p><p>
Sasser spoke at GDC last week, when he revealed this news, stating pallets containing the consoles had gone missing in Las Vegas. Panic, he said, was still trying to track them down.

Speaking with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108670/xbox-epic-games-store-phil-spencer-interview">Polygon</a>, Spencer said he would like to break down the 'walled gardens' that limit players to buying games on a particular platform's official digital store.

"[Consider] our history as the Windows company," he explained. "Nobody would blink twice if I said 'hey, when you're using a PC, you get to decide the type of experience you have [by picking where to buy games]'. There's real value in that."

</p><p>
Across the video games industry as a whole, more than 15,000 people are thought to have been let go over the past 18 months.

In January 2019, The Invisible Guardian (or 隐形守护者 in Chinese), a story-rich historical full-motion video game, or FMV, was published on the Chinese, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese Steam pages, as well as WeGame. It became a great hit, despite not receiving much advertising. It maintained a rating of 9/10 on Steam with over 48,000 reviews and 9.6/10 on Douban (essentially the Chinese equivalent of IMDB for games, movies, books, and other media), with around 32,000 reviews. Additionally, it earned a BAFTA Breakthrough China trophy, solidifying its status as one of the most acclaimed and best-selling games of recent years.
