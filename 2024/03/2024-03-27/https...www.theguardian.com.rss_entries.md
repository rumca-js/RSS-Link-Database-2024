<p>Chelsea progressed to the semi-finals of the Women’s Champions League despite being held at Stamford Bridge by a stubborn Ajax.

It’s utterly heartwarming</p><p>If you had to choose a TV chef to throw you a huge party, who would it be? Let’s face it, there’s only one answer. (OK, two because it is a truth universally acknowledged that no one sets a table like Nigella.) I’m talking about a chef and restaurateur for whom <em>everything </em>is soul food. Someone whose background includes singing in a punk band and throwing legendary warehouse parties in the 1980s, neither of which can be said of Gregg Wallace or Marcus Wareing. A presenter who put the great into Great British Menu, a series that wasn’t otherwise known for its big heart and high glamour.

When the design was sent to TfL for display on the underground, Gamble was told to alter the poster because it failed to comply with the organisation’s advertising policy on featuring foods high in fat, sugar and salt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/mar/27/ed-gamble-comic-hot-dog-banned-transport-for-london-tube-ads">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Yes, it’s a museum piece – but this mini Atari home console, reconfigured for  modern gaming systems, offers a compelling retro experience</p><p>To a kid growing up in the UK in the 1980s, the Atari 400 and 800 machines seemed impossibly glamorous. While most of my friends had Commodore 64s or ZX Spectrums (along with the occasional Amstrad or Acorn Electron), I only ever saw Atari computers on cool TV shows and movies, such as Videodrome and Police Story. Launched in 1979, these two models boasted an Antic video processor providing superior graphics for the era, as well as a sound chip named Pokey for improved audio. They were, like the Apple II, seminal machines for young game coders looking to create new types of experience beyond simple arcade conversions.</p><p>Opening up the new Atari 400 Mini was, then, an oddly emotional experience. The latest nostalgic release from Retro Games is a nicely detailed facsimile of the original computer, featuring a non-functional vers

Yes, to their members, and clearly to those they exclude. When <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexis-de-Tocqueville">Alexis de Tocqueville</a> compared American democracy with British, he said America’s roots were in the mob and Britain’s in the club.

<p>Thriller about rich suburban housewives whose picture-perfect lives belie past traumas lacks the self-awareness needed to prevent it from being utterly absurd</p><p>Here is a hilariously unsubtle and increasingly ridiculous psycho-melodrama of the 1960s American suburbs starring Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain. Some kind of cult status must be on the way, with emote-along midnight screenings, and maybe a new Catfight of the Year Oscar has to be brought in to reward it.</p><p>Mothers’ Instinct is written by Sarah Conradt and directed and shot by celebrated cinematographer Benoît Delhomme making his feature debut; it is partly based on the 2012 French-language thriller Derrière la haine (Behind the Hate) by Barbara Abel, and partly on a 2018 Belgian movie adaptation.

<p>The minutiae of a day in the life of a mostly happy student are brilliantly conveyed in this wryly comic debut</p><p>This debut novel<em> </em>follows a day in the life of Annabel, an Oxford student writing an essay about Shakespeare’s sonnets. She wakes and&nbsp;makes tea, works on the essay, meditates, does yoga, works a little more, takes walks, has memories and fantasies, eats in the dining hall, talks to her boyfriend on the phone. The book ends as the day ends. For most of the novel, she’s alone in her room. It is an uneventful day in a safe, cocooned, mostly uneventful life.</p><p>The great strength of Practice<em> </em>is Brown’s gift for the romance of the quotidian. Annabel is absorbed by the minutiae of her day: the “building roar” of the electric kettle, the growing pressure in her bladder, her ephemeral lust on seeing lines of muscle sharpening in a passing runner’s calves. She takes pleasure in using the same peppermint teabag twice, “As if there might be som

And so begins an adventure up and back down the eastern seaboard, taking Lillian from her native South Carolina up through the nation’s capital, to New York City, Vermont<strong> </strong>and beyond, meeting all manner of eccentrics, extremists, hipsters and hoodlums. It’s the sort of lolloping, weird ride through society that’s a textbook example of the classical picaresque, in which a low-born, none-too-honest but appealing protagonist gets up to stuff.
