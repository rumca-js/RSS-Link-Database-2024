And I&#8217;m wondering what has been done to deserve this amazing inequality.&#8221; So she decided to do&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/pockets-of-opportunity-clothing-line-from-seattle-startup-looks-to-end-an-inequality-in-womens-workwear/\">Read More</a>", "status_code": 0, "thumbnail": null, "bookmarked": false, "page_rating": 100, "manual_status_code": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "language": "en-US", "page_rating_contents": 100, "artist": null, "date_published": "2024-03-27T19:20:26+00:00", "vote": 0, "tags": [], "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "comments": [], "album": "", "page_rating_votes": 0, "user": null}, {"source_obj__id": 131, "age": null, "title": "Protesters block entrances at Amazon HQ, objecting to planned use of fossil fuels in Oregon", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/protesters-block-entrances-at-amazon-hq-objecting-to-planned-use-of-fossil-fuels-in-oregon", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Amazon-protest-March-2024-1-1260x945.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Dozens of environmental activists this morning blocked the entrances at Amazon&#8217;s Day 1 building at its Seattle headquarters. A Washington-based group called the Troublemakers organized the action, calling on the tech giant to cancel its plans to use natural gas from a new pipeline being built in Oregon. The gas would be used to power three data centers in the state. \u201cThe fact that Amazon is still an active participant in a fossil fuel expansion at this moment in time highlights their hypocrisy,\u201d said Emily Johnston, one of the protest organizers. Amazon has multiple initiatives to address climate change.

The track of totality for the April 8 eclipse doesn&#8217;t come anywhere close to the Pacific Northwest. That&#8217;s in contrast to the 2017 total solar eclipse, when the moon&#8217;s shadow crossed the Oregon coast to begin its continent-spanning sweep. You can still get in on the thrill of the event. It&#8217;s not too late to book a last-minute trip to someplace within driving distance of the total eclipse&#8217;s path, which stretches from&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/three-options-for-seeing-solar-eclipse/\">Read More</a>", "status_code": 0, "thumbnail": null, "bookmarked": false, "page_rating": 94, "manual_status_code": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "language": "en-US", "page_rating_contents": 94, "artist": null, "date_published": "2024-03-27T03:18:12+00:00", "vote": 0, "tags": [], "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "comments": [], "album": "", "page_rating_votes": 0, "user": null}]
