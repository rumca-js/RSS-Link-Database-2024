But the mob does not like that because he gives people a platform for ideas that they cannot compete with. They hate that. But although the cancel mob gets its voice through leftist media outlets, most rational people are not like that. There is a reason the podcast is so popular and nothing the cancel mob says will change that.

	There are some stories where you just have to sit back and enjoy the beef. Chris Cuomo calling out Joe Scarbrough and Mika Brzezinski for being anti-GOP, anti-Trump hypocrites is one of them.</p><p>
	The backstory: NBC News hired Trump's former handpicked RNC Chair Ronna McDaniels as an on-air contributor. NBC News journalismers went bananas that they might have to work with a Republican. Yes, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/msnbc-laughs-virgina-immigration" target="_blank">the same network that hired Joe Biden's former press secre

And it turns out that when you do all that on top of villainizing and defunding the police department, you get Gotham City which was once known as The Big Apple. </p><p>Subsequently, a police officer was tragically killed in a "senseless act of violence" by a career criminal.
