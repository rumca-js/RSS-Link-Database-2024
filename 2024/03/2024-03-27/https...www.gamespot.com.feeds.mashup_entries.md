<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Optimus-Building-Collectible-Transformers/dp/B09XVH9ZWQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Lego Optimus Prime from Transformers</a> is discounted to $144 at Amazon. That's 20% off this awesome building set's $180 list price, which matches last year's Black Friday deal. We wouldn't be surprised to see this offer sell out quickly. Amazon doesn't list an end date for the deal either, so it could disappear at any time. Lego Optimus Prime is comprised of 1,508 pieces and, much like other large-scale Lego sets, is recommended for adults and experienced builders. </p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Optimus-Building-Collectible-Transformers/dp/B09XVH9ZWQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4066137-optimus-2.jpg"><img alt="Optimus is ready to roll out." src="https://www.gamespot.com

Bob Kendrick, President of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, is one of those people, and it's easy to see why. You only have to look at Hammerin' Hank's stats--755 home runs and 3,771 hits in Major League Baseball--his outstanding consistency across 23 big league seasons, or the fact that he achieved all of this after such humble beginnings. Growing up, Aaron had few opportunities to play organized baseball. In fact, he had few opportunities to even use the right equipment. Instead, a young Henry Aaron would take his mom's broomstick and use it as a makeshift bat to hit bottlecaps--it's no wonder he ended up being so good.</p><p dir="ltr">I knew of Hank Aaron's incredible career, but supplemental details like this are part of what makes Storylines such a captivating and enlightening experience.

The weapon itself launches seismic charges that explode after a short distance.</p><p dir="ltr">The real fun of Venture looks to be using the drill to move around the battlefield in interesting ways. Venture's Burrow ability allows them to dig underground and emerge underneath enemies, dealing damage when surfacing. While underground, Venture is invulnerable, allowing the ability to serve as both an offensive and defensive tool. Drill Dash allows Venture to, well, dash through the air, pushing enemies who come into contact with the drill back. Taken together, Venture can zip around fights usin

This trailer shows off new multiplayer maps, more operator skins, and the return of Call of Duty's Capture the Flag game mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Capture the Flag was once a Call of Duty staple, but the mode was not included with the launch of Modern Warfare 3. Finally, Season 3 will let players go for those intense flag captures and defends. In addition to the game mode, players can also expect four multiplayer maps to arrive.</p><p dir="ltr">As shown above, the trailer gives glimpses of the season's new maps. One map showcases close-quarters fights in what appears to be a grow house, and another map takes the fight outdoors at what could be some sort of luxury resort with pools. <a href="https://twitter.com/SHGames/status/1773021663476502900">Sledgehammer G

<p>Pepper Grinder is built around having an enormous drill that you can use to burrow through soft ground, but as a new video shows, it gets a lot of mileage out of that central concept. In an exclusive gameplay walkthrough from Devolver, you can see Pepper skimming along the water, hitting grappling nodes, and more.</p><p>The walkthrough covers three varied stages in Pepper Grinder: a beach with volcanic activity, a spooky poisonous world, and a frosty tundra. Each one has its own specialized stage elements, like magma that cools and becomes soft soil to dig through when it hits the water, or cannons that shoot you from location to location or crack through heavy ice blocks. Your drill can even be used to spin up a rocket, which comes in handy for obvious reasons.</p><p>You can also see Pepper grabbing collectibles, like gems and Skull Coins. As the commentary points out, the gems are littered throughout the stage and meant to be collected, but some of them are traps made to

<p>Jake Gyllenhaal had come close to some serious franchise roles early in his career only to lose out in the final round. The Oscar-nominated actor, who can now be seen in the Roadhouse remake on Prime Video, recently talked about what drove him harder when being let down. </p><p>Talking to Howard Stern, Gyllenhaal said that losing out on Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins and Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge helped him become more motivated in landing roles he believed in. He also praised both directors for coming to him personally and telling him he didn't get the roles and why. </p><p>"When you get that far, there's a real legitimacy to you potentially getting something. It's not like they're going, 'Oh, thanks so much.' They are going, 'I saw these aspects of you that I really wanted in the role and are wonderful, but in the end I ended up moving this way because it matches better with this person who is opposite you or would be opposite you," he said.

<p>Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming, has spoken more about his desire to create a more open console ecosystem, similar to how PC users can access multiple storefronts. When asked in a GDC interview if he could see a future where Xbox consoles allowed stores like Itch.io and the Epic Games Store to exist on that platform, Spencer replied with a brief "yes" before expanding on his vision for the future of gaming.</p><p>"[Consider] our history as the Windows company. Nobody would blink twice if I said, 'Hey, when youâ€™re using a PC, you get to decide the type of experience you have [by picking where to buy games].' There's real value in that," Spencer said to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108670/xbox-epic-games-store-phil-spencer-interview">Polygon</a>.</p><p>Not only could console gamers benefit from having multiple stores to browse, but console makers could as well, Spencer added.

Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/judas-first-details-how-ken-levine-is-building-on-bioshock-with-narrative-legos">IGN</a>, Levine explains that Bioshock's multiple endings were something 2K really pushed for, and that he "didn't really have my heart in."</p><p>"I didn't really want the two different endings and that was one of the few concessions," Levine explained. "The publisher didn't make too many demands on us, so I don't want to say they were overbearing, but that was one thing they really wanted and I didn't really have my heart in.

<p>Bioshock creator Ken Levine's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/judas/">Judas</a> has been in development for almost ten years, and now his studio Ghost Story Games are finally ready to show what its been working on all that time. While Judas is still a narrative-driven FPS in the style of the Bioshock games, it's also a procedurally generated roguelite set in a dynamically-shifting open world. Here's what we know so far.</p><p>Judas is fundamentally built around a concept Ken Levine calls "narrative Legos," which he has been refining since his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-creators-next-game-features-a-small-scale/1100-6433214/">GDC talk by the same name</a> all the way back in 2014. The concept mixes procedural generation with bespoke building blocks of narrative or dialogue, creating a game that can react to a player's decisions in a way that feels natural.</p><p>"We call it pseudo-procedural because it's not like Minecraft where everything's
