The PS5 Pro has been leaked! Well, it’s been leaked for a while actually. It’s just that now we’re getting more concrete specs and information about what Sony’s mid generation refresh might be.

I’ve talked about before how I’m not all that enthusiastic about the prospect of a “PS5 Pro”, but as time has gone on I think it’s started to make more sense why Sony is developing this hardware, and the reasons are….odd.

Very odd.

Today I want to discuss what I feel is the purpose for this devices creation, who it will appeal to, and whether I personally intend on buying one.
