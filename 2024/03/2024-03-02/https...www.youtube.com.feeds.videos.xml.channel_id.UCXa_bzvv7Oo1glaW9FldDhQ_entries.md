Three decades on from its launch, Star Wars: Dark Forces was a standard setter in so many ways, because not only was it a simple classic FPS clone – of which there was no shortage back in those days – it was also one of the very first prominent examples of first-person shooters actually paying attention to storytelling in a meaningful way. 

Its remaster, developed by the ever-so-talented Nightdive Studios, captures all of its strengths – its unique aesthetic, its excellent action – while also providing it with a significant glow up thanks to some excellent remastering work. Some notable aspects of the experience have aged poorly, which will likely make the game frustrating for many, but there’s still plenty to like here.

Of course, in today’s day and age, there’s no shortage of open world games, but even amidst that saturation, there’s plenty about Rise of the Ronin’s take on the formula that’s catching the eye, from its grounded, period Japanese setting to its traversal mechanics.
