## Dune: Part 2 Is a Perfect Adaptation Because of One Key Difference

Dune: Part 2 completes the Denis Villeneuve adaptation of the first Dune novel by Frank Herbert. It’s a wildly influential work of science fiction and the follow up to a blockbuster Part 1. But how far did Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts veer from the beloved source material? And is that a bad thing? It’s time to let the spice flow, open our minds and appreciate that a perfect adaptation from page to screen is one that’s different.

Inevitably, adaptations as weighty as this will get held to the scrutiny of decades of fandom. What was left out, what was added, what was different.

Whatever happened to Respawn’s Mandalorian FPS? On the heels of the news of Respawn canceling its Mandalorian Star Wars video game, the Beyond crew discuss the seemingly cursed bounty hunter genre of video games. Even in a world of High on Life, that game suffered some controversy due to Squanch Games former creator, Justin Roiland. Metroid Prime 4 had to go back to the drawing board and Prey 2’s first iteration are just some of the various other bounty hunter-based video games that never saw the light of day, so we discuss a few theories as to why on this BEYOND clip with Max, Brian and Akeem.

One of the first big challenges you’ll face in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is against the optional summon boss, Titan in chapter 2. You’re not generally advised to fight him as soon as you can, and we'd instead recommend that you first search out the three crystals in the grasslands to be able to weaken him, but if you’re looking for a challenge, here’s a guide on how to beat Max Power Titan in FF7 Rebirth.

There are  7 pieces of the Artifact in Sons of the Forest, but only 6 can be found around the island. Each of them is tucked away inside the various caves. If you played the game in Early Access, you'll be familiar with most of these caves, as they house various useful items like the rebreather, zipline rope, and pickaxe. And while some of those item locations may have changed with the 1.0 release of Sons of the Forest, we're here to show you exactly where to go to not only complete the Artifact but how to power it up as well with blueprints.
