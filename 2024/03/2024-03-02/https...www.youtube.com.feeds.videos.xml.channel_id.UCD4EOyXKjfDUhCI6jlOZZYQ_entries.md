4.3 Inch LCD Touchscreen on Amazon - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B29T8YF?tag=elietherton-20

This 800x480 touchscreen for the Raspberry Pi works surprisingly well.  It allows for the full Pi OS GUI, is detailed enough to allow you to read code in VSCode and plays YouTube videos well.

This is a great add-on for Network  Appliances and IoT devices so that you can easily see important information without having to figure out the devices DHCP Address.

It works off of a basic USB Battery, but may give "low voltage" warnings.

NOTE: I purchased this with my own money and have no link to the company.  I found this while building my IoT Messaging Projects using the Blues IoT Modem.
