We have the full set of Rise of the Inklands in our hands now and folks: It’s wild. Who could have expected that there would be so much Tailspin representation, let alone several cards from The Rescuers – quite possibly the most depressing and moribund Disney flick of all time? Seriously, watch that thing on [&#8230;]

At this point I have to accept that I fully exist in a hell of my own creation. I&#8217;m writing this sitting at the judges desk at the Goonhammer Open, with round 1 in full swing, and Lowest of Men up on stage playing in the stream game (check out the stream all weekend with [&#8230;]

So you’re looking at your Solar Auxilia and you’re thinking “yes, these are cool, but wouldn’t they be better mechanised?”. I know you are. Mechanised infantry, however they actually play on the tabletop and regardless of whether they’re a good points investment in your army list are just functionally much cooler than footslogging infantry and [&#8230;]

I love a good Leman Russ. Back in 96 it was the first tank I ever bought, and some of the much-battered, often-restripped parts of that particular Russ has stayed with me to this day. So I was damn excited to get the Solar Auxilia Leman Russ Strike Tank, because the kit promises “the same [&#8230;]

For a year now we&#8217;ve heard the slow tramping of void-armour shod feet faintly whenever we&#8217;ve played Heresy games. Somewhere out there, there was a nutter with a horde army entirely made of Forge World Resin. The Solar Auxilia have remained a fever-dream for many for too long &#8211; but now that marching sound has [&#8230;]

Today we&#8217;ll be having a look at the new unit in the Solar Auxilia Battle Group box set: The Aethon Heavy Sentinel. Thanks to Games Workshop for providing us with the Solar Auxilia Battle Group box for review. The Model This is a really detailed model for a walker, though not a simple build. You get [&#8230;]
