<p>Raye’s six Brit awards marked a huge vindication for the newly independent artist and rightly shamed the major label that apparently couldn’t see her potential</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/02/brit-awards-2024-women-dominate-as-raye-scores-record-smashing-six-wins">Brit awards 2024: women dominate as Raye scores record-smashing six wins</a><br />• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2024/mar/02/brit-awards-2024-liveblog">Brit awards 2024: as it happened</a></p><p>If Raye was lost for words when she won her first Brit award of the evening, song of the year, then – other than begging the music industry to award songwriters points on master recordings – she had certainly almost run out of them by the time she tearfully collected her sixth award of the night for album of the year, which saw her “ugly crying on national television”. The British pop star had already broken the record for the most nominations in a single year with six nod

<ul><li>Kerr wins men’s 3,000m; Caudery the women’s pole vault</li><li>Laura Muir misses out on 3,000m medal before Glasgow crowd</li></ul><p>First came the sight of Josh Kerr roaring and punching the Glasgow air, adrenaline whizzing around him like a tornado. Then, 34 minutes later, we watched Molly Caudery crying and shaking her head, still adapting to the thrill of the new. And just like that Britain had two gold medals, two world indoor champions, and a glorious evening in a sport that has suffered its fair share of wobbles.</p><p>Naturally Kerr, who was born in Edinburgh, stole the majority of the attention of the home crowd. The world 1500m champion spent all winter mulling over whether to return to Scotland for these world indoor championships. But in the final of the 3,000m he was as decisive as a ­gambler who sticks it all on red.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/02/josh-kerr-and-molly-caudery-claim-world-indoor-gold-for-britain">Continue readi

Previous studies have <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/snow-ice">shown</a> that in many locations precipitation is now coming in the form of rain, rather than snow, due to warming temperatures.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/02/ski-resorts-snow-global-warming-study">Continue reading...</a>
