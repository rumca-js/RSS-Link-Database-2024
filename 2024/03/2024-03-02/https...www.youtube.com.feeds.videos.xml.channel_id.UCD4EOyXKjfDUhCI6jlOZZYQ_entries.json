It allows for the full Pi OS GUI, is detailed enough to allow you to read code in VSCode and plays YouTube videos well.\n\nThis is a great add-on for Network  Appliances and IoT devices so that you can easily see important information without having to figure out the devices DHCP Address.\n\nIt works off of a basic USB Battery, but may give \"low voltage\" warnings.\n\nNOTE: I purchased this with my own money and have no link to the company.  I found this while building my IoT Messaging Projects using the Blues IoT Modem.", "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 0, "vote": 0, "album": "", "comments": [], "page_rating_contents": 0, "dead": false, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp016mDbJQo"}]
