<p>The captain is often maligned for his on-field antics but would Roy Keane be any different with this team around him?</p><p>Bruno Fernandes is Manchester United’s 2020s version of Roy Keane: vocal, aggressive, fiercely competitive, highly talented and deemed by his manager to be the obvious captain. The Portuguese is all these things, especially in a United vintage that is among the weakest of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.</p><p>If Ferguson viewed Keane as his alpha male, the Irishman was surrounded by stellar acts in Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Jaap Stam and numerous others. At different times, all had an argument for being the Premier League’s best player in their position. Fernandes does not enjoy the same supporting A-list cast. In a team game he looks around the pitch each week and sees maybe only Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martínez, when they are fit, who are his equal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/02/bruno-fernandes-mancheste

<p>This game, in truth, only really came alive in second-half stoppage time. Then, 36 seconds over the initial eight minutes of added time, bedlam ensued. Darwin Núñez, who arrived on the hour, leapt high to meet Alexis Mac Allister’s dinked cross and generated just enough power to drop a header inside a post, a priceless winner in Liverpool’s bid to win the Premier League. Jürgen Klopp was mobbed by Adrián and the rest of Liverpool’s substitutes flooded the pitch.</p><p>For Nottingham Forest, deserving of a crucial point in their fight to avoid relegation, it was a thoroughly demoralising end to a frenetic finale. By the end, this game had turned bad-tempered, the referee, Paul Tierney, heading down the tunnel to a wall of boos from the angry home support, seconds after sending off Steven Reid, Forest’s first-team coach.

These previously unseen illustrations, found in Hulanicki’s private archives, were made using pencil, pen and ink and gouache, and demonstrate why her designs are still regarded as the gold standard of fashion. “Barbara’s design philosophy followed on from her erstwhile career as a fashion illustrator,” says Pel, “where bold silhouettes and an avoidance of fussy detail made for a stronger look.”</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.fashiontextilemuseum.org/exhibitions/the-biba-story-1964-1975">The Biba Story, 1964-1975 is at the Fashion and Textile Museum, London SE1, 22 March-8 September</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/galler

<p>It’s cheap, quick and available 24/7, but is a chatbot therapist really the right tool to tackle complex emotional needs?</p><p>Last autumn, Christa, a 32-year-old from Florida with a warm voice and a slight southern twang, was floundering. She had lost her job at a furniture company and moved back home with her mother. Her nine-year relationship had always been turbulent; lately, the fights had been escalating and she was thinking of leaving. She didn’t feel she could be fully honest with the therapist she saw once a week, but she didn’t like lying, either. Nor did she want to burden her friends: she struggles with social anxiety and is cautious about oversharing.</p><p>So one night in October she logged on to <a href="https://beta.character.ai/">character.ai</a> – a neural language model that can impersonate anyone from Socrates to Beyoncé to Harry Potter – and, with a few clicks, built herself a personal “psychologist” character. From a list of possible attributes, she

He has no memory of what has just occurred or how he travelled the 14 miles from his house to the home of his parents-in-law. All he sees is the blood on his clothes.

Regardless of where she is, she’s painted prodigiously. “I’m an obsessive person by nature,” she accepts, surrounded by piles of pictures, overloaded boxes and shelves seeping with supplies. “In the past, I’d juggle all sorts of things at once. Now, each day, I channel everything into my painting.”</p><p>Restraint doesn’t come naturally to McDaid. “And why should it? Doing something you enjoy is addict

<p>A new book of lyrics by Kazuo Ishiguro joins collections by Kate Bush and Jarvis Cocker. But can songwriting ever work on the page?</p><p>Long before he wrote Booker-winning novels and Oscar-nominated screenplays, the Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro wrote bad songs. In his own words, these unheard lyrics were “mostly ghastly” but they enabled him to find his voice. He worked through the gauche and the&nbsp;pretentious before alighting on the simpler first-person style that would define his fiction: “understated, almost mundane lyrics, with emotions placed between the lines, only occasionally pushing to the&nbsp;surface”.</p><p>In 2002, Ishiguro chose a track by the American jazz singer Stacey Kent on Desert Island Discs and a friendship developed. Kent’s husband and collaborator Jim Tomlinson suggested to Ishiguro that he try writing her some lyrics – his first in 30 years. These&nbsp;were much better. Now, Faber has collected 16 of them (five as yet unrecorded) in The Summe

<p>The actor on dicing with death as a bicycle courier, hating social media, and a memorable kiss at Ronnie Scott’s </p><p>Born in London, Jack Davenport, 51, gained a degree in film and English at the University of East Anglia.

<p>Christopher Guest and Rob Reiner made a 1984 classic that ingeniously straddles the ‘fine line between stupid and clever’</p><p>The bands that come together organically, without the aid of want ads or tear-off flyers stapled to telephone poles, are generally catalyzed by a mixture of chemistry, inspiration and boredom.</p><p>A few guys – more often than not, it’s still guys – hang out, realize they get along, bond through their overlapping tastes, and then grow fidgety to do something about it. Screwing around becomes noodling, noodling becomes jamming, jamming becomes something that can be passed off as a performance in exchange for beer money. For so many of the greats, rocking began as a gratifying, potentially lucrative way to goof off with one’s friends, their childhood spirit of play aged up from games to music; we can see the natural camaraderie in everything from the laddish pranksterism of A Hard Day’s Night to the hijinks on Boygenius’s social media channels.

<p>South-west Wales is a naturalist’s playground, and early spring is the perfect time to explore its coastal paths, wild flowers and treasured birdlife</p><p>Edward Thomas’s In Pursuit of Spring, published more than a century ago, is a classic in the nature lover’s library, a lyrical account of the&nbsp;poet’s journey from London to Somerset seeking signs of the coming season. Setting out from a rainy Wandsworth in March 1913, shaking loose a long winter, Thomas yearned for apple blossom and cuckoo flowers, “the perfume of sunny earth”, and the nightingale’s song. “Would the bees be&nbsp;heard instead of the wind?” he questioned anxiously.</p><p>This was a relatable pursuit – come March we are all leaning towards the sun – yet rarely might we think of spring as a “place”. For Thomas, it was the rural south-west; for me, the returning spring is best embodied by&nbsp;Pembrokeshire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/mar/02/pembrokeshire-in-spring-is-a-nature-

Struck by a drought that has dried the reservoir to 1% of its capacity, the remains of the village have come back into view. Crumbling stone structures now sit on cracked soil among ashen plants.
