THE 2024 GRIMDARK MAGAZINE OPEN WINDOW Our submissions email address will be open for two weeks until 23:59 14th March. We are looking for short stories of up to 4,000 words for original fiction, and up to 12,000 words for reprints. Anything submitted over the word limit, or outside of the open window timeframes will be auto-rejected. We will be looking for grimdark fantasy, as well as the darker grittier side of sci-fantasy and science fiction. We are also after horror in either of those aforementioned settings (eg. with a fantastical or SF aspect that\u2019s key to the story), through a grimdark lens.

Dark Prince was a fantastic novel with a hard gritty street-crime edge and a loathsome protagonist that, nevertheless, manages to undergo serious character development.
