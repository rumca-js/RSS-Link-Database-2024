Jaime Wyatt grew up in Washington State, lived for a while in Los Angeles, and now calls Nashville home. But wherever she is, making music remains the constant. “It's just what I do,” Wyatt says. “Just writing songs and singing them has proven to be really healing, whether it works out or not, whether it's lucrative or popular or not. It's just important for me to do that.”

Described by Pitchfork as one of music’s “most exciting and skillful storytellers,” Wyatt writes honest lyrics and delivers them with her powerful voice. Her most recent album, "Feel Good," released in November 3, 2023, on @NewWestRecords. Produced by Adrian Quesada of Black Pumas, Feel Good is a genre-spanning collection of songs that contain a delicious Americana gumbo of soul, roots music, and R&amp;B.

Before Wyatt had to press pause on her tour due to a case of flu, Wyatt and her band visited The Current studio to play a couple songs from "Feel Good." Watch the performance of "Feel Good" above.
