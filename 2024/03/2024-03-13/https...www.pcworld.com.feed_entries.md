<p>VPNs aren&rsquo;t just useful for increasing privacy and security, they can also be the most effective tool at bypassing region locks to access streaming content in different countries. The top VPN providers are now offering features such as streaming optimized servers and stealth VPN protocols to make sure you always have access to your favorite sites. With the right VPN, you don&rsquo;t need to play a cat-and-mouse game to access location-restricted content from your streaming provider. That&rsquo;s why choosing your VPN carefully is essential while out of country. </p>



<p>Given the restrictions by services such as Netflix&rsquo;s towards VPNs, you need to choose a service that has active compatibility with that streaming site. Also, it&rsquo;s a good idea to choose a VPN with good overall server spread so that if one server is down in the country y

<p>The XPS 13 has been going strong in its current iteration for nine years, setting the standard for thin-and-light Windows laptops that&rsquo;s been imitated and iterated ever since. Today, Dell is selling last year&rsquo;s model with a 12th-gen Core i5 processor <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/laptops/xps-13/spd/xps-13-9315-laptop/xn9315gmmks&amp;xcust=2-2-2264833-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">for just $599</a>.

<p>If you were impressed by Maingear&rsquo;s limited-edition release of the Zero Drop desktop and its rear-connection cable technology, you&rsquo;ll be happy to hear that you now can begin ordering the Zero Series of prebuilt gaming PCs.</p>



<p>At CES 2024, Maingear debuted the Maingear Zero Drop and the Maingear NV9 Zero, based on Maingrear&rsquo;s MG-RC (Maingear Rear Connection) technology. It&rsquo;s Maingear&rsquo;s response to the so-called <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1937700/2023s-biggest-desktop-pc-trend-the-war-on-cables.html">War on Cables</a>, dating back to 2022. The idea is that migrating as many cables to the rear of the motherboard, rather than the front, makes for an aesthetically cleaner look <em>and</em> eliminates the impediments to airflow those cables cause. It&rsquo;s that technology that serves as the foundation for th

<p>In the 1990s, a colleague took me to &ldquo;Snake Alley,&rdquo; Taipei&rsquo;s red-light district, for a night of drinking with &ldquo;entertainers&rdquo; and some of their very muscled, serious friends. A good time was had by all, fortunately. Still, I was young, dumb, and lucky that I didn&rsquo;t end up in any trouble.</p>



<p>Some parts of the internet are like that, too. If you think you&rsquo;ll be potentially surfing into a risky internet neighborhood &mdash; a knockoff shopping site, a little-known streaming service, or somewhere you&rsquo;re just not entirely sure is legit &mdash; and you have a spare laptop lying around, you can always repurpose it to become what I call a &ldquo;Paranoid PC&rdquo;: a laptop hardened for additional privacy and security. </p>



<p>In my case, I was able to do it for &ldquo;free.&rdquo; But it does require a ve

<p>Laptops are practical because you can take them with you. However, laptops have a relatively small screen. If you work on a mobile computer, it quickly becomes annoying to constantly switch programs. And the contents of windows placed next to each other are often very small.</p>



<p>As a result, text in particular can be difficult to decipher. After a short time, you become tired as you strain your eyes excessively.</p>



<p>An additional monitor connected to the mobile computer can help. Program windows can be moved to the secondary display. You can then keep an eye on important content such as your emails at all times, while simultaneously working in other programs. </p>



<p>As the connected secondary screen is usually much larger than the surface of the laptop display, it is easier to read text, view images, and complete all other work on the com
