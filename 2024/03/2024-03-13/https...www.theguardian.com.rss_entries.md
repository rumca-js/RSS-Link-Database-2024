<p>“<em>Ad </em><em>augusta per angusta</em>,” the banner the stretched across the south stand of the Metropolitano said. Through difficulty to honour, it means, and that was right. It had been long, and it had been wild, and it had torn at all their nerves, but in the end, it had been glorious, an occasion for the ages. For the first time in 2024 Internazionale did not win a football match and it cost them: at 23.43pm local time, Lautaro Martínez of all people sent the final penalty of a shootout high into the stand and this place exploded once more.</p><p>Last year’s Champions League finalists are out; Atlético Madrid are through, Memphis Depay dragging them into extra time with a late goal and an almost superhuman display and then Jan Oblak flying to save two penalties in the shootout, elation just about eclipsing the exhaustion here. A 1-0 first-leg defeat had been overturned. So had a first goal conceded in the second. Atlético had done it.</p> <a href="https://www.thegu

Within the first 90 seconds of the Queen Mother Champion Chase on Wednesday, however, the script had been read and then rejected as far too predictable, as El Fabiolo, the 2-9 favourite, was pulled up with well over a mile still to run, leaving countless bets on a Mullins treble in the day’s Grade One events in tatters.</p><p>Captain Guinness and Rachael Blackmore, who finished nearly 15 lengths behind El Fabiolo at Leopardstown last month, were the pairing to take advantage, finishing one-and-a-half lengths in front of Gentleman De Mee, a stable companion of the odds-on favourite.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.

<p>Rishi Sunak was already struggling to keep up a brave face over the Post Office IT scandal. Then Keir Starmer stood up</p><p>Rishi Sunak needs a lot of things to keep his head above water at the moment, but let’s take one step at a time: for the duration of PMQs, he needed to not look rattled. He has three techniques that he rotates: smiling; dropping his Ts (to offset the tell, that all posh people get posher when they’re stressed); and ratcheting his cadence so that he gets faster and more joyful towards the end of a sentence, like a man selling you candyfloss at a very fun fair.</p><p>Unfortunately, he deploys all these at random, so he did a short peroration on the Post Office miscarriages of justice, grinning all the way through, and dropped the T in the middle of “important” but not at the end, creating the impression of a man who had forgotten what words meant and how to say them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/13/frank-hester-10m-donatio

<p>Rising Damp, Only Fools and Horses, The Morecambe and Wise Show … I love them all, even though they haven’t aged well</p><p>I have just realised I have the same taste in TV comedy as an elderly British white man. Sitting around a table full of pints after a recent football match (we lost), the conversation turned to our favourite comedy shows. There I was, extolling the humour of Blackadder II and the joys of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/morecambe-and-wise">Morecambe and Wise</a> skit when my teammates started talking with glee about the loudly humourless It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and, eugh, The Big Bang Theory.</p><p>It’s not that my tastes are morally superior, but my relationship with TV comedy is an odd one. For much of my childhood, despite allowing me unfettered access to the internet, my parents did not own a TV set. What they <em>did</em> have was a projector and a VHS player, which meant much of my screen time was spent playing old t

<p><strong>Here at Outernet, London</strong><br />The Ghanaian-American singer brings the house down with an intoxicatingly lustful charge across a dizzying array of genres</p><p>Ghanaian-American singer Amaarae’s breakthrough Afropop track Sad Girlz Luv Money became a viral sensation in 2021, thanks to an audacious combination of sweet and innocent feathery vocals with snotty, money-grubbing, lustful lyrics. Her second album Fountain Baby – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/12/the-50-best-albums-of-2023-no-9-amaarae-fountain-baby">No 9 in the Guardian’s best albums of 2023</a> – went further still. With a genreless blend of west Africa’s leftfield alté sound, riot grrrl-esque mall-rock, and seductive dream pop, the album’s ambition and scope was focused through Amaarae’s consistent themes of love, lust, and dancing – themes which now translate magnificently on stage.</p><p>She arrives in a red latex number as a two-piece live band of an electric guitarist a

<p>There’s much more to Nighy than playing grumpy but lovable men – think Pinter, Palace and Pokémon to name just three. Get your questions in by 10am on Thursday</p><p>When it comes to grumpy but lovable men, Bill Nighy has it nailed. He plays Simon Pegg’s grumpy zombie step-dad in Shaun of the Dead with lovable charm, and washed-up grumpy rockstar Billy Mack in Love Actually, for which he won a Bafta for best supporting actor. In 2006, he won a Golden Globe for TV movie Gideon’s Daughter where he plays an, um, grumpy publicist on the verge of a nervous breakdown. In 2022, he was nominated for an Oscar for Living in which he plays an, erm, grumpy 1950s bureaucrat. He plays a grumpy vampire elder in the Underworld series and, less grumpy because he’s near immortal, Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean. He’s fairly grumpy also in the new Netflix football film The Beautiful Game.</p><p>Of course, there’s more to him. On stage, he’s done Shakespeare, Chekhov and Pinter. On TV,

<p>Geraldine Viswanathan lends a quiet seriousness to her role that anchors this otherwise flimsy, silly story</p><p>Here is a saucy, silly, queer road-movie caper from director Ethan Coen and his partner, co-writer and co-producer Tricia Cooke; it’s Coen’s second film without his brother, Joel, following his Jerry Lee Lewis documentary in 2022. Drive-Away Dolls is a flimsy lark wrapped up smartly and economically in 84 minutes with a perfunctory (and cheerfully nonsensical) MacGuffiny premise that makes it look like a Xerox of Coen brothers classics such as No Country For Old Men or Fargo. Lead player Margaret Qualley’s twangy down-home accent is moreover something that could have been re-thought in rehearsal. But it rattles along watchably enough. Geraldine Viswanathan nicely underplays her part and Beanie Feldstein delivers the gags with resounding gusto. There’s a nice sprinkling of A-lister cameos, including Colman Domingo, who I wished had been in the action a bit more.

<p>This careful analysis of the foundational text is full of telling details and keenly observed parallels</p><p>The award-winning novelist and&nbsp;social critic Marilynne Robinson has turned the focus of her literary intelligence on to the first book of the Bible. Genesis, the foundational imaginative text of western culture, has permeated our art and literature, as well as shaping a whole understanding of life, including politics. Its stories remain at once compelling and mystifying. Some of the stories, most obviously that of a great flood, resemble others from Mesopotamia, such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Enuma Elish, but Robinson shows how differently Genesis treats them. There was, she says, no deluge – but the story is a parable to show that although we human beings have made a terrible mess of the world, so much so that we might be tempted to destroy the lot and start again, this is not what God does. He wants life to continue and, despite everything, it remains

<p>The Children’s Art Gallery supports young Nigerian artists from low-income families, helping them sell their work around the world and build a better life</p><p>On a whitewashed wall at the back of the gallery, seven landscape paintings are on display. The artist, Fiyinfoluwa Adeniji, hopes his collection will sell well. Last year, he made 1m naira ($650) from the sale of two paintings – an impressive achievement for an 11-year-old who first picked up a paintbrush when he was seven.</p><p>“I look forward to selling more of my artworks to get a better future, and build a museum when I’m older,” says Adeniji, from Gbagada in Lagos state.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/13/palette-to-paycheck-the-lagos-gallery-helping-children-make-a-living-from-their-art">Continue reading...</a>

## Why are women being blamed for Birmingham’s bankruptcy? | Samira Shackle

<p>The insidious message being sent out by councils is clear: women should accept lower pay for the common good</p><p>By now, you probably know the basic facts: in September 2023, Birmingham city council announced it could no longer balance its books, and was effectively declaring bankruptcy. The <a href="https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/news/article/1381/statement_regarding_section_114_notice">council’s statement</a> blamed “financial liabilities relating to equal pay claims and an in-year financial gap within its budget”. The statement said these equal pay claims were “in the region of £650m to £760m, with an ongoing liability accruing at a rate of £5m to £14m per month”. It did not expand on the other financial issues facing the council. This set the tone for the coverage that followed, with headlines focusing on the role of the equal pay claims in Birmingham’s financial collapse. In these headlines, there has been another implicit message: that women are to blame.</p><p>Clea

Of all the best picture nominees <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/10/oscars-winners-list-live-updates">from this year’s Oscars</a>, which film is the most feminist?

<p>On tour with her daughter after her cancer diagnosis the Scottish national treasure opens up about her life and finds big laughs in the face of death</p><p>Here’s a documentary following the Glaswegian standup comic Janey Godley on her Not Dead Yet Tour; in 2022, Godley was diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer, and she does the first gig in Inverness a day after chemotherapy.

<p>Turquoise seas, tranquil canals and glacial lakes … France offers some of the world’s most scenic paddling routes</p><p>When I first visited Corsica, I hiked down the spine of the Corsican mountains, barely seeing the sea except for glimpses from a bird’s eye perspective. This time, as I hugged the coastline, dipping in and out of sea caves, I felt as though I was winding through the arteries of Corsica. This route starts from Piantarella, just east of Bonifacio on the southern tip of the island. It’s a sheltered lagoon, a deceptive idyll before you head out into open water, fringed by the northernmost islets of the seabird-heavy Lavezzi Islands. As you paddle west along the coast, the cliffs get higher and the coast is so haphazardly splintered that it looks as though someone has taken a sledgehammer to it. At the end of the route, just before Bonifacio, is an extraordinary cave, the Grotte de Saint-Antoine, with an almost perfect circle carved into the roof and a tiny sl

I arrived home one afternoon from school and caught her at work. Hearing sounds I vaguely associated with sex, I let myself in, then<strong> </strong>quietly straight back out again. I wasn’t actually sure what I knew for quite a while. Eventually, I put it together: an unusually high level of phone calls, whispered conversations in the hall and a too-young viewing of the film Pretty Baby meant I eventually realised what her new business was. She certainly wasn’t a secretary any more, as I had always believed her to be. She was in her mid-40s, and maybe she had long ago found other ways to support us. I am unsure of much of my personal history – where one lie ends, and another begins.</p><p>Afterwards, I wasn’t sure she knew that I knew. I

<p>Victoria Lebrec forgave the driver who almost killed her. Nine years on, she is happy, active, at peace with her changed body. But she is still fighting to make the roads safer</p><p>Victoria Lebrec can’t be sure if what she knows about 8 December 2014 is from her own memory, or the BBC video cameras that captured her bleeding heavily at the side of the road, tyre marks visible across her crushed pelvis from the lorry that knocked her from her bicycle. Or maybe what she knows is from the CCTV footage that was reviewed first as evidence in a criminal case and then in a gruelling, victim-blaming struggle for the compensation she urgently needed. How else would she buy the £70,000 prosthetic leg her injuries required? And how else&nbsp;could she find closure and move on in her changed reality and&nbsp;changed body?</p><p>It was a Monday morning.

<p>I thought becoming an author meant I could avoid ever addressing a crowd again. Then I was invited to a writers’ festival</p><p></p><p>When I was younger I was so terrified of public speaking that I went out of my way to avoid it. If I was forced to address a crowd, I didn’t sleep for days before because I would loop disaster scenarios over and over in my head. When it came to the actual event, my hands would be clammy, my breathing would be erratic and I’d speed through my speech in a desperate need just to be done.</p><p>At university, I chose subjects merely because they did not involve class presentations. I never applied for jobs that meant addressing a crowd. And when my best friend asked me to speak at her 21st birthday, I drank so much cheap wine that I slurred a sentence or two and then fled outside in shame.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/13/i-was-sweating-before-i-even-opened-my-mouth-could-i-overcome-my-fear-of-public-speaking">
