Rob Meyerson, a co-founder of the startup and former president of Jeff Bezos&#8217; Blue Origin space venture, told GeekWire that an initial prospecting mission could be launched as early as 2026, with commercial operations beginning in the 2030s. &#8220;For the first time in history, harvesting natural resources from the moon is technologically and economically feasible,&#8221; Meyerson said today in a news release. &#8220;With&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/interlune-helium-3-fusion-fuel-moon/\">Read More</a", "thumbnail": null, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/interlune-helium-3-fusion-fuel-moon", "permanent": false, "page_rating_contents": 94, "title": "Interlune comes out of stealth with its plan to harvest helium-3 and more on the moon", "album": "", "page_rating": 94, "language": "en-US", "page_rating_visits": 0, "tags": [], "date_published": "2024-03-13T21:20:03+00:00", "user": null, "vote": 0, "artist": null, "dead": false, "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "age": null, "source_obj__id": 131, "page_rating_votes": 0}, {"description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20220512_GeekWire_Awards_387-1260x840.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />The voting is now open for the 2024 GeekWire Awards, and this is your chance to have a hand in honoring the best in Pacific Northwest tech.
