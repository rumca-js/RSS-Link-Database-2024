<p>Now that Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/browser-choice-screen/" rel="nofollow">opened up choice to third-party browsers</a> as part of its efforts to comply with the EU’s <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3713189/apple-warns-of-increased-iphone-security-risks.html">Digital Markets Act</a>, we can expect a new focus on browser market share in the near future.</p><p>Third-party browsers have been supported in iOS since version 14.

<p>How did we get to the point where the tech industry is in the user-data business instead of the tech business?</p><p>Every day, <a href="https://www.theregreview.org/2022/03/12/saturday-seminar-data-privacy-through-lens-big-tech/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Google collects data on billions of people worldwide</a>, according to The Regulatory Review. The dodge that users gain some benefit from ad targeting is fallacy. For example, if Google's search were decoupled from its advertising, there would be less chance for users to be misled by ignored search terms and seemingly hard-wired results.</p><p>There's nothing beneficial to the user about Google's sponsored search results.
