[{"description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nA new software update for the PS5 is available now. This adds a few features that were previously in beta, namely improved mic audio from the DualSense and the ability to adjust the brightness of the PS5's power indicator. Neat. In other PlayStation news, March's PS Plus games have been revealed, and this month's offerings include the acclaimed Marvel's Midnight Suns. The card-based game earned solid reviews, but did not perform well commercially. You can also download the Resident Evil 3 remake, as well. Other titles coming include NBA 2K24, Lego DC Supervillains, and Mystic Pillars Remastered, among others. And finally, Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest 2024 has officially been revealed, with the event going live on June 7 at 2pm PT.
