However, the design of such containers, including the containers in the C++ STL, has mostly stayed the same in the past few decades. With computer architectures and performance shifting towards multi-core with multiple layers of caching in the past 10-15 years, these fundamental data structures designed for single-core architectures often become performance hot spots. This talk describes the process of designing an ordered, list-like data structure well suited for modern CPUs starting with the naive approach for a linked list and ending with a design optimized for today's computers, showing a drastic reduction in cache misses and thus showing 2+ times better performance compared to their STL equiva", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/stfEry0zz5E/hqdefault.jpg", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stfEry0zz5E", "permanent": false, "page_rating_contents": 94, "title": "Designing Fast and Efficient List-like Data Structures - Yannic Bonenberger - CppCon 2023", "album": "", "page_rating": 94, "language": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "tags": [], "date_published": "2024-03-13T16:04:26+00:00", "user": null, "vote": 0, "artist": "CppCon", "dead": false, "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "age": null, "source_obj__id": 420, "page_rating_votes": 0}]
