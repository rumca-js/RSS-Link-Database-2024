[{"description": "#Chinainsights#chinanews \nOn January 24, 2024, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk warned, \"If there are no trade barriers established [with China], they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.\" \nWhat he said is true, and China's EV makers aren\u2019t hiding their aggressive plans. China's BYD overtook Tesla to become the world's largest seller of EVs in the last quarter of 2023. While BYD is known for producing cheap EVs, it unveiled an electric supercar priced at $233,455 earlier this year to compete with Ferrari and Lamborghini.  \n\nHave questions?
