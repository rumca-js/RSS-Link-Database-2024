  <p id="MNZs5N">Google DeepMind unveiled SIMA, an AI agent training to learn gaming skills so it plays more like a human instead of an overpowered AI that does its own thing. SIMA, which stands for Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent, is currently only in research. </p>
<p id="Or265I">SIMA will eventually learn how to play any video game, even games with no linear path to end the game and open-world games. Though it’s not intended to replace existing game AI, think of it more as another player that meshes well with your party. It mixes natural language instruction with understanding 3D worlds and image recognition. </p>

  <p id="2nLDNw">Cadillac dropped a teaser for its latest concept, an all-electric V-Series luxury performance vehicle dubbed “Opulent Velocity.”</p>
<p id="Tqja5C">It’s just a concept, so no details yet about production, price, or any specs. We can see the front end with a downward sloping hood and an illuminated Cadillac badge that appears to wrap around the corner. </p>
