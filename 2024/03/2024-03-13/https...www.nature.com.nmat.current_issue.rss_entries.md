<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 13 March 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01812-4">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01812-4</a></p>Suppressed Dexter transfer is needed to achieve efficient and stable hyperfluorescence, but complex matrices must be involved. A molecular design strategy has been proposed where Dexter transfer can be substantially reduced by an encapsulated terminal emitter, leading to ‘matrix-free’ hyperfluorescence.
