Shrimp are renowned for their high nutritional value, offering a rich source of proteins, amino acids, omega-3 fatty acids, minerals, and vitamins, as well as chitin and carotenoids. The increasing consumption of shrimp has led to a significant rise in by-products, such as heads, shells, and tails, which account for up to 50% of waste. This poses a substantial environmental challenge for fish processing industries. Shrimp shells, in particular, are rich in minerals, protein, and chitin. Recognizing the potential of these by-products, there has been a growing interest in converting them into value-added products.

One afternoon last year, we sat in a village hall in Fiji chatting to residents about traditional ways of forecasting tropical cyclones. One man mentioned a black-winged storm bird known as "manumanunicagi" that glides above the land only when a cyclone is forming out to sea. As the conversation continued, residents named at least 11 bird species, the odd behavior of which signaled imminent changes in the weather.

If left to their own devices, bacteria on our teeth or wounded skin can encase themselves in a slimy scaffolding, turning into what is called biofilm. These bacteria wreak havoc on our tissue and, being shielded from antibiotic medication by the slime, are difficult to dislodge. A new strategy may offer a simple way to break up the muck and destroy the bacteria.

Contrary to common belief, not all viruses are harmful to their hosts. Sometimes viruses can even protect their hosts from infection by other viruses. Scientists at the Max-Planck-Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg and their collaborators have now demonstrated that this is the case for so-called endogenous virophages: small DNA viruses that are mostly found inserted into the genomes of single-cell eukaryotes—organisms whose cells have a membrane-bound nucleus. In addition, the scientists show that virophages are highly specific towards giant viruses, focusing on the CroV type in the present study.

Prokaryotic single-celled organisms, the ancestors of modern-day bacteria and archaea, are the most ancient form of life on our planet, first appearing roughly 3.5 billion years ago. The first eukaryotic cells appeared around 1–1.5 billion years later. However, eukaryotic cells have since diversified into many complex, multicellular organisms that we see around us every day—fungi, plants and animals—while prokaryotes have remained decidedly unicellular.
