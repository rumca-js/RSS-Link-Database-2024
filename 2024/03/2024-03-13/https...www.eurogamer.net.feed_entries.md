RimWorld, the acclaimed sci-fi colony sim from Ludeon Studios, will soon be besieged by "monstrous creatures, mind-bending mysteries, infiltrating parasites, and sanity-shredding phenomena" when its new horror-themed expansion, Anomaly, arrives on Steam next month.
</p><p>
Anomaly - RimWorld's fourth paid expansion after Biotech, Royalty, and Ideology - begins as colonists accidentally provoke a mad superintelligence, unleashing its horrors and twisting the world with "ominous, puzzling, mind-controlling, and earth-shaking" threats.
</p><p>
The idea, explains Ludeon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detailed over on Steam">over on Steam</a>, is to give players the tools they need to build their own horror stories, with the developer citing the likes of Cabin in the Woods, The Thing, The Cthulhu mythos, and Hellraiser as insp

Ubisoft has shared a <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1767943707028816361?s=20">post-launch roadmap</a> for its acclaimed series revival Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, which promises to introduce the likes of a permadeath mode, boss rush mode, and story DLC across four updates starting next Wednesday 20th March.
</p><p>
Next week's free update, officially titled Warrior's Path, includes the aforementioned permadeath mode alongside a speedrun mode and four new outfits for Lost Crown protagonist Sargon. It'll be followed by another free update in "spring", titled Boss Attack, which introduces a boss rush mode and more Sargon outfits.
</p><p>
The additions look to get a bit meatier in The Lost Crown's free summer update, known as Divine Trials, with Ubisoft promising new combat, puzzle, a

V Rising's two years of early access development are almost at an end; Stunlock Studios has announced its acclaimed vampire survival game will get its 1.0 release for PC on 17th may, with a PlayStation 5 release to follow later this year.
</p><p>
V Rising, if you're unfamiliar, launched into early access back in May 2022, delivering an isometric survival adventure in which players and their friends explore a gloomy open-world attempting to establish their vampiric superiority.
</p><p>
It's got some neat twists on the survival formula, including a day/night cycle that forces players to stick to the shadows while the sun is high (for obvious reasons), a blood -sucking mechanic granting specific abilities depending on the creatures drained, and - perhaps best of all - the ability to build your own imposing castle. All of which

</p><p>
Marvel's Midnight Suns, available for both PlayStation 4 and PS5, pits players against the forces of Lilith, Mother of Demons, with a little bit of help from an extensive superhero roster. It combines turn-based strategy action with surprisingly enjoyable relationship-building interludes, somewhat similar to Fire Emblem, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-midnight-suns-review-crush-evil-dm-the-ave

Keen Games revealed its roadmap - heavily inspired by the <a href="https://enshrouded.featureupvote.com/">community's most-requested features</a> - over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4122554066513691534?l=english">on Steam</a>, explaining, "On the one hand, we have big ambitions for the game, and loads of ideas!

</p><p>
"Players take on the role of Enoch and must harness his natural combat skills to master a range of powerful and Heavenly weapons under the guidance of the watchful Archangels," the game's description reads. This will all take place with a mix of 2D and 3D platforming, and of course, plenty of combat.

E3 may be dead, but its spirit will once again hang around downtown Los Angeles this year for a week of game announcements and updates in early June. 
</p><p>
Kicking things off, as has now become tradition, will be Summer Game Fest on Friday 7th June. The Geoff Keighley-fronted show will broadcast live from the YouTube Theatre in Los Angeles at 10pm UK time - that's 2pm Pacific or 5pm Eastern.

It only lasted for a little while, but Insomniac Games gifted us a fascinating insight into the inner workings of Marvel's Spider-Man 2. The studio inadvertently released developer tools in version 1.002 of Spider-Man 2, enabling debug options and level selections that offered us a peek under the hood of one of the most technically advanced open worlds in any video game. A hotfix patch was quickly deployed that blocked off access to the menu, but we managed to take a good look at the tools. We wanted to see what kind of goodies it contained, what kind of performance metrics Insomniac uses internally and what kind of early and cancelled content was available. We got all of this - and more.

Let's start out by examining Spider-Man 2's performance metrics tools, which take the form of a frame-time graph with processor

Sea of Stars will receive a co-op mode allowing three players to adventure together.

What's more, the indie RPG has now surpassed five million players since its release last year.
</p><p>
In Single Player+, as it's known, a new "co-op timed hits" mechanic will require all three players to engage in the game's rhythm-based battle system. The mode is "currently in development" with more details due soon.

Swedish non-profit Talita has created a new mod for GTA 5 to highlight real-life issues of sex trafficking.
</p><p>
The organisation helps women out of prostitution and trafficking for sexual purposes and, through this mod, aims to raise awareness of these issues among young men - an audience key to shifting attitudes.
</p><p>
The mod, titled Mission Talita, includes four playable missions based on the true stories of four women the Talita organisation has helped between 2017 and 2023.

</p><p>
Created by alphaZomega and uploaded to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil22019/mods/1446?">NexusMods</a>, the RE2R Classic mod allows fans to play the game with fixed camera angles and tank controls like it's 1998 but prettier.
</p><p>
The remake notably used an over-the-shoulder camera view popularised by the original Resident Evil 4, but some fans of the original may have missed its fixed camera.

Epic Games has announced its pricing for the use of Unreal Engine by non-game creators, who will now typically pay $1850 a head each year to use the powerful development software.
</p><p>
The upcoming change, first telegraphed last year, will kick in with the launch of Unreal Engine 5.4 next month - details of which we're expecting to hear in the coming days from Epic during its annual State of Unreal livestream.
</p><p>
As previously promised, there's no change for game developers, who pay a flat five percent royalty to use Unreal Engine if their project ends up earning over $1m.

Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu believes game music has become too similar to film and "cannot develop further" if continuing in this direction.
</p><p>
Uematsu was interviewed by Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2fobhbpdIc">NewsPicks</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-recent-game-music-boring-why/">Automaton</a>) about his thoughts on video game music and its future, stating "music played the role of oxygen" for 8-bit games in expressing the stories and characteristics of sprites.

Now, though, developers are "satisfied with movie soundtrack-like music in games", he said. "I think people need to have more freedom when creating [game music]," he continued, adding that unless composers move away from movie-style scores, the genre

Ori and the Blind Forest developer Moon Studios has confirmed that its promising-looking Diablo-y Soulslike game No Rest for the Wicked will feature offline play for its solo mode. 
</p><p>
Moon Studios co-founder Gennadiy Korol confirmed the mode via a <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGennadiy/status/1767381395154846115?s=20">post</a> on social media platform X, noting that it had been a "common question" - presumably after the lack of ability to play solo offline in other games recently.
</p><p>
No Rest for the Wicked "will not require online connection to play in Single Player and will feature a rich Offline Mode," Korol wrote. "Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play

Blocks of colour fan out, moving from pink to purple to cyan. The light creates shapes, but what are these shapes? Starbursts, nebula, volcanic eruptions. The screen seems to mirror the action, double it, so we get a lot of crabs with two pincers raised to the sky, a lot of mermaids with two fins, a lot of Rorschach blots. Maybe that's it. You look at these dancing lights, these ripples of colour, all caused by the single white dot, and you see what you want to see.</p><p>This is Psychedelia, from 1984.
