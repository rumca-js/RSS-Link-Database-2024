<p>Four years after police killed Taylor, Scheherazade Tillet hopes art is not the only justice Taylor’s family will see</p><p>I first visited Breonna Taylor’s home in Louisville, Kentucky, after the first anniversary of her death. I had recognized the apartment from the video footage, forensic reports, and witness accounts of the night that police officers fatally shot the 26-year-old in the early hours of 13 March 2020. In time, her life and legacy would galvanize a nation to reckon with police violence against Black women, but in the immediate days and hours after her death, her family was mourning her loss and beginning their long fight for justice.</p><p>I had come to Louisville from Chicago to pay my respects and because I was creating <a href="https://www.alongwalkhome.org/projects">The Black Girlhood Altar</a>, an art project that pays homage to the lives of Black girls and young Black women who have gone missing or been murdered in the United States. At first, I had

<p>The follow-up to The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P is a coruscating portrait of low-wage work in an American big-box store</p><p>The post-1945 American novel was usually in some deep way about anxiety: the anxiety of living in America, with its enormous postwar wealth and its correspondingly enormous social pressures and opportunities. The great hope of its characters, like the great hope of America generally, used to lie in social mobility: up, up, and away! But in the 21st century, to hear young writers tell it, the social pressures have won. Anxiety, in the contemporary American novel, has given way to defeatism and pointillist satire: finely honed accounts of a calcified class system, or of its guilt-stricken bourgeois-bohemian alternatives (see the current crop of Berlin expat novels).</p><p>We know what has happened. The&nbsp;increasing concentration of resources in&nbsp;the hands of a tiny cluster&nbsp;of gargantuan corporations; the&nbsp;transfer of manufacturing ope

<p>Its ungainly final twist and unreal violence sequences dim a film with a brilliant premise and rage that still stings </p><p>Twenty-five years ago, the ultimate bro film came out; it is now rereleased for the anniversary. David Fincher’s bone-splintering, soft-tissue-pulping Fight Club is the ultraviolent hipster-fantasy about a depressed white collar nerd befriended by a supercool alpha male and inducted into a secret bare-knuckle combat cult whose purpose is to restore real masculinity. It was adapted by screenwriter Jim Uhls from the uncompromisingly pessimistic novel by Chuck Palahniuk and, after a slow commercial start, became the movie that launched a million gags about all other clubs whose first rule was that you couldn’t talk about them. It is comic meme which survived into Emma Seligman’s recent comedy Bottoms.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,102483,00.html">I was unconvinced at the time</a>, even th

<p>Since the 1970s this band in Western Sahara, made up of Sahrawis who oppose Moroccan rule, have made spellbinding music – and are preparing only their second ever album</p><p>Lying in a tent erected outside his house, Maulud Emhamed Sidi Bashir is listening to a small silver handheld radio. In the Sahrawi refugee camps near Tindouf in south-western Algeria, people often set up traditional tents like this on the doorsteps of newer buildings. The crackling electric guitar notes Bashir, 75, is listening to are a similar mix of traditional and modern. Many of the songs, his relatives say, are by a band called El Wali.</p><p>It can take a while to figure out what, exactly, El Wali is. There is not much information on Google and only one album on YouTube (without the names of the singers or musicians). The very place where the band originated, the Western Sahara, is a question mark to most people. But El Wali has become a sort of national orchestra, a group whose songs don’t hav
