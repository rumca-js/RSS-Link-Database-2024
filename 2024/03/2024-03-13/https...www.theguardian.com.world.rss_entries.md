<p>Launchpad for theatre and comedy talent, which had planned to open its new longterm home this year, announces its closure</p><p>London’s Vault festival, which has kickstarted countless theatre and comedy careers in a warren of performance spaces beneath Waterloo station, has announced its closure.</p><p>The festival had been under threat after its venue-landlord, The Vaults, decided to pursue alternative uses for the tunnels the festival has used since 2012. Vault festival launched a fundraising campaign in 2023 and had secured a new longterm home in central London that was due to open later this year. However, its funding has now fallen through, leading to the cancellation of plans for a new venue and a continued festival. Redundancies have been made across the organisation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/mar/13/london-vault-festival-to-close-theatre-comedy">Continue reading...</a>
