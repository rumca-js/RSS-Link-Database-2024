<p>X has canceled a high-profile partnership with former CNN host Don Lemon to stream a video talk show on the platform. Lemon said that the company canceled his contract hours after he interviewed X’s billionaire owner Elon Musk for the first episode of “The Don Lemon Show,” which was scheduled to stream on the platform this Monday.</p>
<p>“Elon Musk is mad at me,” Lemon <a href="https://twitter.com/donlemon/status/1767949937894121894">said</a> in a video posted to X on Wednesday. “Apparently, free speech absolutism doesn’t apply when it comes to questions about him from people like me.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Lemon’s announcement came a day after company CEO Linda Yaccarino <a href="https://x.com/lindayaX/status/1767675796334776506?s=20">declared</a> that X was becoming a “video first” platform.

<p><em>Paper Trail</em>, the game that lets you fold the world around you, finally has a release date after multiple delays. The top-down puzzler is now scheduled to launch on May 21.</p>
<p>Developed and published by the UK-based <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.papertrailgame.com/">Newfangled Games</a>, <em>Paper Trail</em> combines craft-inspired art with a unique folding mechanic that lets you crease and bend your environment to connect new paths and solve puzzles. “Alter the fabric of your world, contorting, spinning, rotating, twisting around — as you try to untangle the puzzle of the <em>Paper Trail</em>,” the game’s Steam description reads.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The game’s art style matches its folding mechanic, drawing inspiration from flat aesthetic styles, including printmaking and watercolor. You play as Paige (get it?), an 18-year-old aspiring astrophysicist with fuddy-duddy pa

<p>YouTube just announced that it’ll be <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/designing-a-richer-youtube-experience-for-your-tvs/">rolling out a redesign</a> for its TV app over the next few weeks. Concrete details are scant, but the streaming platform says the new design will “open the door for a broad range of new experiences such as shopping for your creators’ favorite products.”</p>
<p>Beyond the pivot to shopping, the update should also improve existing features, with easier access to “video descriptions and comments.” To that end, both the descriptions and comment feed will take up a larger amount of room, when selected, with the actual video shrinking in size. YouTube says that users regularly request a smaller video feed and a prioritization of comments. As it stands, the comment feed lays over the video, so this refresh will allow users to engage with comments without covering up the actual content.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everyone’s favorite <em>Chrono Trigger</em>-esque RPG, <em>Sea of Stars</em>, is getting a <a href="https://sabotagestudio.com/press-release/sabotage-teases-3-player-couch-co-op-mode-as-sea-of-stars-surpasses-5-million-players/"><ins>three-player couch co-op mode</ins></a>. Publisher Sabotage Studios dropped a trailer for the upcoming feature, which has been dubbed Single Player+.</p>
<div id="94c72e0cc09547f896498134c5f373cf"></div>
<p>As you can see, there’s independent traversal for each party member, so long as everyone stays within the same general vicinity. It doesn’t look like one party member will be able to dip out to snag a power up from another map. The trailer doesn’t show combat, but the publisher promises that each player will control their avatar during battles and teased something called “co-op timed hits.” This is likely a two and three-person version of the pre-existing timed hits system, which draws from games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-sup

<p>One of the best things about the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-android-phone-130030805.html">Android ecosystem</a> is the availability of truly affordable phones for as little as $150. By comparison, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-se-3-2022-review-battery-life-camera-sample-touch-id-home-button-130047678-130047247.html">cheapest iPhone</a> is based on a dated design and starts at $429. However, picking the right one can be a bit tricky, as reducing the price of a phone can sometimes result in too many trade-offs. So to give you a hand, we tested a bunch of the most popular options and put together a list of our favorite cheap Android phones.</p>

The House of Representatives approved the measure Wednesday, in a vote of 352 - 65, in a rare showing of bipartisan support. It now goes to the Senate.</p>
<p>If passed into law, the legislation would give parent company ByteDance a six-month window to sell TikTok or face a ban from US app stores and web hosting services. While the “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act” is far from the first effort to force a ban or sale of TikTok, it’s been able to draw more support far more quickly than previous bills.</p>

<p>I miss having clean floors. I've been using a variety of Roombas over the years to help out with vacuuming, but ever since my wife and I had our second child in 2022, mopping has become an afterthought. And really, vacuuming can only clean your floor so much. I missed the shimmer of a mopped hardwood floor and the smell of Murphy Oil cleaner lingering in the air. Instead, I've been living with even more toys, crumbs and an assortment of bodily waste (which three cats contribute to) on my flooring and carpets. Don't judge me (or any parent!), I'm tired.</p>
<p>When Engadget's own Daniel Cooper extolled the virtues of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-combo-j7plus-hands-on-150010629.html">iRobot's first combination robot vacuum and mop</a>, I was intrigued. I'd already grown to love my Roombas, especially after they gained the ability to dump their own waste into their charging docks. But for them to mop as well? That just sounded like an impossible dream. So w

<p>Neil Young is back on Spotify after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/neil-young-is-returning-to-spotify-after-boycotting-it-over-joe-rogans-vaccine-comments-071217691.html">boycotting</a> the platform over two years ago, he said in a new blog post. The Canadian singer ditched the platform over vaccine misinformation on the Joe Rogan podcast. He’s returned because Rogan’s podcast is no longer exclusive on Spotify. “My decision comes as music services Apple and Amazon have started serving the same disinformation podcast features I had opposed at Spotify,” he said – which isn’t really the stance he thinks it is.</p>
<p>When Young dropped his catalog from Spotify, he added he was fed up with Spotify’s “shitty” sound quality. Nothing has particularly changed there.</p>

<p>A startup company called Space One <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/world/asia/japan-rocket-space-one-kairos.html">launched a rocket</a> earlier in hopes of becoming the first private entity in Japan to put a satellite in orbit. Unfortunately, its attempt <a href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-rocket-launch-failed-space-c57640f429471e536161df7bab652aac">ended in a fiery explosion</a>, mere seconds after lift off at 11AM local time. Its 60-foot-long rocket Kairos launched from the company's Space Port Kii in Wakayama, a prefecture south of Osaka in Japan's Kansai region. Space One director Mamoru Endo told reporters at a conference that the rocket's automated system detected an anomaly five seconds after liftoff and triggered its self-destruct function. The company has yet to figure out what that anomaly is and will be investigating the incident for answers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you consider yourself a mobile creator and you’re <em>not</em> using some sort of dedicated microphone, you might be holding yourself back. We’re not judging, but your audience likely is. Audio, especially dialog, is often overlooked, but you need good sound quality if you want your content to stand out. There are many, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/advanced-podcast-buyers-guide-part-1-143053492.html">many options</a> for the home or office/studio, but there are a surprising amount of mobile-specific (or at least, mobile-friendly) solutions out there to elevate your on-the-go recordings be that for social, a jam session, live streaming, making movies, podcasting and beyond.</p>
<p>What “the best mic for iOS or Android” is will vary depending on the task you need it for. If you want to record a TikTok or a podcast or even a jam session, all have slightly different needs but the selection below covers most bases (and maybe even a few you didn’t think of yet) for recor
