[{"description": "It's certainly a time to be a fan of the classics, what with today's remasters and re-releases. Add Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection to the list -it delivers a solid and good-looking rendition of these old shooters and highlights their strengths.\n\nFrom enjoyable campaigns that span the original and prequel trilogies to the stellar Galactic Conquest modes, Star Wars: Battlefront 1 and 2 are worth checking out, even after all these years. Of course, you still need to deal with issues, from the lack of variety in Galactic Conquest's objectives to the terrible AI teammates.\n\nNevertheless, everything else - from the unit variety and sheer scale of the battles to the authentic Star Wars look and feel and some new content - is on point. Whether you're a fan of the originals or the modern titles, Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection is worth checking out.", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/raV70Wl3AV8/hqdefault.jpg", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raV70Wl3AV8", "permanent": false, "page_rating_contents": 94, "title": "Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection Review - The Final Verdict", "album": "", "page_rating": 94, "language": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "tags": [], "date_published": "2024-03-13T17:00:43+00:00", "user": null, "vote": 0, "artist": "GamingBolt", "dead": false, "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "age": null, "source_obj__id": 129, "page_rating_votes": 0}, {"description": "Anticipation for the release of Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 is continuing to build by the day.
