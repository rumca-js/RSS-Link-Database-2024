In today's Daily Fix:
A new software update for the PS5 is available now. This adds a few features that were previously in beta, namely improved mic audio from the DualSense and the ability to adjust the brightness of the PS5's power indicator. Neat. In other PlayStation news, March's PS Plus games have been revealed, and this month's offerings include the acclaimed Marvel's Midnight Suns. The card-based game earned solid reviews, but did not perform well commercially. You can also download the Resident Evil 3 remake, as well. Other titles coming include NBA 2K24, Lego DC Supervillains, and Mystic Pillars Remastered, among others. And finally, Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest 2024 has officially been revealed, with the event going live on June 7 at 2pm PT. And don't forget, IGN's own event, IGN Live, is also coming in June, with dates TBA.

## Godzilla Minus One Did VFX the ’90s Way and That's Why It Won an Oscar

It only took 70 years, but Godzilla has finally gone home with the gold. Godzilla Minus One made history at the 96th Academy Awards, securing the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first-time win for the Godzilla franchise. Given how important Godzilla has been to nearly a century of international film, it’s a long overdue accolade that couldn’t have gone to a more deserving entry. Minus One isn’t just a great movie, but a prime showcase of director Takashi Yamazaki’s strong artistic vision and proof that Godzilla’s ability to change with the times is unparalleled among film characters.

But there is another lesson that Hollywood should take away from Godzilla Minus One’s landmark achievement. How did a movie with a small VFX team of 35 artists and a frugal budget of $15 million show up the entire Hollywood blockbuster apparatus? Part of the answer lies in the film’s leaning into a distinctly 1990s way of depicting CG effects.
