								<p>Warhammer <strong>Age of Sigmar: Realms of Ruin</strong> reviewed poorly and sold even worse when it dropped in November 2023 - but reputations can be deceiving. We think it's a fabulous Warhammer <strong>RTS game</strong> in its way - and right now you can get its $75 Ultimate Edition free (or <em>technically</em> very, very cheaply) as part of March's Humble Choice subscription.</p>
