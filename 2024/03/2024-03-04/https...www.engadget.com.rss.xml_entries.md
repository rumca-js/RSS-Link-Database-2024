<p>On Tuesday, Shure unveiled its better-late-than-never entry into the creator-focused wireless consumer lapel mic space. The audio company’s MoveMic system — available in single-channel (the $249 MoveMic One) and dual-channel (the $349 MoveMic Two) models — joins an increasingly crowded space of wireless lavalier mics alongside three tiers of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-wireless-go-ii-unveiled-150043322.html">Rode’s Wireless Go</a> system and two iterations of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/djis-mic-2-now-records-high-quality-audio-to-your-smartphone-via-bluetooth-130018964.html">DJI’s Mic</a>.</p>
<p>Most products in this space require a receiver for your phone, but Shure offers direct-to-phone wireless transmission — including for two mics in the dual-channel model. But the catch is that it only works when using Shure’s MOTIV apps (available on <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;

Less than a week after Nintendo filed the legal action, accusing the emulator’s creators of “piracy at a colossal scale,” a joint final judgment and permanent injunction filed Tuesday says Tropic Haze has agreed to pay the Mario maker $2.4 million, along with a long list of concessions.</p>

<p>Apple revealed some new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-announces-new-macbook-airs-with-m3-chips-132810766.html"><ins>M3 MacBook Air laptops</ins></a> today and one of the marquee features is that they can drive two external displays while the lid is closed. It’s pretty weird when the Air line gets a feature missing from the beefier MacBook Pro line, but Apple’s on top of it. The company just announced that this feature is also coming to standard M3 MacBook Pro laptops via a software update, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/04/14-inch-m3-macbook-pro-multi-display-support/"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>9to5Mac.</ins></em></a></p>

<p>Google just announced that some Pixel phones are getting next-gen call screening. This improves on the pre-existing Call Screen feature by implementing a new Hello button. Once tapped, the system will deploy Google Assistant to speak on your behalf.</p>
<p>The digital assistant will ask the caller why they’re trying to reach you, and you’ll be able to hear the response in real-time. If it sounds important, you can interrupt and begin the call. If not, you can kick them to the curb and go back to watching TV.</p>

<p>Google is releasing new features for the first-gen Pixel Watch, and they include the health-monitoring capabilities that launched with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-watch-2-review-not-leading-the-way-but-no-longer-lagging-170007702.html">successor</a>. The older wearables will now be able to detect whether you're working out and can automatically start tracking your activity and then stop when you're done. In particular, it works for running, walking, elliptical training, spinning, outdoor biking and rowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll also be able to track the time you spend in different heart rate zones, which could help you optimize your workouts. Plus, you'll be able to set a goal pace for your exercise sessions to get a notification for when you're not performing up to par. In case you want your first-gen Pixel Watch to help you feel more relaxed instead, simply fire up the Fitbit Relax App on the device to guide you through some breathing exercises.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instagram launched direct messaging tools way back in 2013, but there hasn’t been a way to edit them after the fact. That changes today. Meta just rolled out a software update for the Instagram app that <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/03/instagram-dm-updates/"><ins>finally allows for DM edits,</ins></a> with one major caveat. You only have 15 minutes to make any changes.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. Once you send a direct message and realize you made a huge blunder, like “accidentally” professing your love to an old college buddy, just press and hold on the sent message. This will create a dropdown menu. Look for “edit” and make the required changes. Nobody will ever be the wiser, as long as you got there within 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Gather ’round, children, and let me tell you a story about the old bugaboo we used to call DRM.</p>
<p>Digital Rights Management was the beast under every gamer’s bed in the mid-2000s, an invisible bit of software baked into game discs that dictated and tracked player behavior under the guise of preventing piracy. DRM software, like SecuROM, limited the times a game could be downloaded and forced players to regularly connect to the internet for authentication checks, at a time when less than half of American adults had reliable broadband connections. DRM features soured the releases of <em>BioShock</em>, <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Spore</em>, and by 2010, anti-piracy software had rendered <em>Assassin’s Creed 2</em> and <em>Splinter-Cell: Conviction</em> unplayable. When Microsoft attempted to release the Xbox One with always-on DRM features in 2013, intense vitriol from fans forced the company to<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-06-19-xbox-one-80-microsoft-reverses

<p>Following months of speculation, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1161">European Commission has officially handed down its fine to Apple</a>, and it's much higher than initially expected. Apple is on the hook to pay €1.8 billion ($1.95 billion) for restricting alternative music streaming apps on the App Store — the EU's first fine for Apple and its third-largest ever announced. It follows an investigation initially opened in 2020 following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-13-spotify-apple-complaint-eu-app-store.html">Spotify's filed complaint</a> alleging Apple took steps to suppress the music service due to competition with iTunes and Apple Music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission has announced &quot;that Apple bans music streaming app developers from fully informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app and from providing any instructions about how to subscribe to such o

<p>Apple just announced a refresh for the ever-popular MacBook Air series, just one month after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-review-beta-testing-the-future-201430272.html">launching the Vision Pro headset.</a> The big takeaway here? The new MacBook Air is outfitted with the company’s proprietary M3 chipset. This chip was previously reserved for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-14-inch-and-16-inch-review-an-m3-chip-for-every-situation-140048075.html">more powerful MacBook Pro line</a> and the latest iMac models, and it's coming to new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air models.</p>
<p>The M3 chip is significantly more powerful than its predecessor, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-m3-chips-pro-max-003004080.html">benchmark tests showing</a> an approximate performance increase of 17 percent in single-core tasks and 21 percent in multi-core tasks. This carries over to GPU performance, with an improvement of around 15 percent compared t

<p>As with any overly marketed products, the claims around virtual private networks (VPNs) can be fishy. Phrases like “military-grade encryption” or “total anonymity” aren’t verifiable, and certainly won’t help you decide which services suit your browsing needs best. As more of these companies embrace influencer marketing to sell their products, the obscure lingo has only grown, making it a confusing field to navigate, despite VPNs’ importance for online security. We tested nine popular VPNs to demystify the market and help you figure out which is best for you.</p>
<h2>What is a VPN?</h2>
<p>VPNs, or virtual private networks, mask your IP address and the identity of your computer or mobile device on the network and creating an encrypted "tunnel" that prevents your internet service provider (ISP) from accessing data about your browsing history. VPNs are not a one-size-fits-all security solution, though.</p>

<p>This website first began on March 2, 2004. It’s older than YouTube, the iPhone, Uber, Tesla cars, Spotify and a whole lot more. It’s even roughly a month older than the word ‘podcast.’</p>
<p>To mark the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-is-turning-20-170005642.html"> 20th anniversary of Engadget</a>, we’re taking a longer look at how the tech industry has changed over the past two decades.

<p>We were going to kick things off with a letter from the editor, but two weeks ago, Engadget’s parent company laid off many editors, writers and videographers from our small team, including our editor-in-chief, Dana Wollman.</p>
<p>As Aaron Souppouris puts in his introduction to the series, it’s not “business as usual,” but we are committed to pushing Engadget forward. What started as a grass-roots tech blog has now morphed into a media organization “aimi
