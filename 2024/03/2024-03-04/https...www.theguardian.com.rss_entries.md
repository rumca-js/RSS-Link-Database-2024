Even more than the photographs, the footage of the family holidays, the beaming selfies taken with friends and family, it is Yasmin’s stricken stillness that gives the measure of the loss.</p><p>The Push tells Fawziyah’s story as it follows

<p>Instead of sticking to arbitrary limits, politicians should be able to make the case for spending on urgent social repair</p><p>The UK has had seven sets of fiscal rules since 2010. In&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/2024-02/strengthening-uk-fiscal-framework.pdf">study</a> comparing it with 34 peer nations since 1985, Britain not only changed its rules more frequently but they also had shorter lives. Clearly fiscal rules are not immutable laws of nature but arbitrary, human-made restraints. Implicit in this model is a dim view of human nature: that politicians cannot be trusted to resist the temptation to abuse government spending programmes for political or ideological ends. The result is that, instead of a&nbsp;political leadership that spends too much, Britain has politicians who spend too little.</p><p>This is no way to run a country when there is urgent social repair needed.

The nation wept, Walkaway was the song – and I missed the whole thing’</p><p>In 1992, I’d gone from playing bass in the La’s to forming Cast. I was in that beautiful, golden sweet spot of becoming a songwriter, when you’re idealistic and almost naive, and it feels like maybe you can write a song that will be the backdrop to people’s lives. I’d already written five songs for Cast’s debut album, All Change, when I stumbled across the chorus of Walkaway in my bedroom at my mum and dad’s house. I started strumming and literally just moved my hand to follow the vocal melody. All of a sudden, I was like: “Fucking hell, this is something, and I don’t know how I’ve done it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/04/cast-walkaway-fans-snogging-crying-euro-96-england-football">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our ability to resist temptation is increasingly shaped by forces beyond our control</p><p>In the 1960s the Stanford psychologist Walter&nbsp;Mischel devised a way to measure self‑control in four-year-olds. He would leave&nbsp;the preschoolers alone in a room with a plate of marshmallows and a challenge: they could eat one marshmallow right away, or wait&nbsp;until&nbsp;the adult returned and eat two. In the decades&nbsp;that followed, he noticed something interesting. The&nbsp;four-year-olds who had waited for the&nbsp;two marshmallows did better at school, were less likely to take drugs or end up in jail, were happier and earned more. He came to believe that self-control, the ability to delay gratification, was the key to success.</p><p>More recently, however, psychologists <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/marshmallow-test/561779/">have challenged his findings</a>.

It would be a remarkable feat given the strength in depth England have had at scrum-half throughout Care’s career including the likes of the 127-times capped Ben Youngs and Wigglesworth himself. Care has been named in Steve Borthwick’s squad for the game but faces a battle to start at No 9, with Alex Mitchell back in contention after injury, meaning Care may have to settle for a place on the bench.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/spo

<p>The icy glamour of Garbo’s doomed heroines is genuinely iconic, but cinema’s most famous loner could also do comedy. A century after her first appearance – and 83 years since her last, here’s why Hollywood missed her so badly </p><p>A century ago on Sunday, Greta Garbo made her first appearance on screen. Swedish silent epic The Saga of Gösta Berling, released on 10 March 1924, was based on Selma Lagerlöf’s bestselling novel and follows the misadventures of a disgraced ex-minister. Exiled to a wild estate in central Sweden, the commoner Berling falls victim to a marriage plot intended to unseat the heiress apparent. Garbo – born Greta Gustafsson, renamed especially for this appearance – plays the wife of the new intended heir. Cast while still a hopeful student at a Stockholm acting school, and not yet groomed into the rake-thin model of a Hollywood leading woman, she arguably steals the show. She is just as compelling in interior scenes as she is when pulled from a burnin

<p>Rashford displays his best and most frustrating qualities while Watkins and Eze lay down Euro 2024 markers</p><p>Manchester City are inevitable. It’s the quality that struck such fear into Manchester United in a derby that rarely seemed destined to be anything other than victory for the champions. And that includes the 48 minutes United were a goal ahead. Liverpool and Arsenal could only look on in vain hope, even when Erling Haaland delivered one of the greatest misses in Premier League history. City kept their cool. United’s latest derby humbling reminded there is so much more to Pep Guardiola’s team than the Kevin De Bruyne-Haaland partnership. At 23, it can feel like there are no more worlds to conquer for Phil Foden, the match-winner. And Rodri, who performs the same safety-catch service Sergio Busquets supplied for Guardiola’s Barcelona team, remained switched on in the dying seconds to rob Sofyan Amrabat and set up a cleansing goal for Haaland.

The sport has been gearing up for its most important season in modern times under the leadership of IMG, with more buzz than ever in the weeks leading up to the new Super League campaign, more publicity and coverage than the sport has ever had, and the undoubted feeling that the mainstream attention rugby league has craved for so long was finally arriving. “This buzz is like nothing we’ve experienced before,” they said. “But you watch: we’ll find a way to mess it up. It’s the rugby league way.”</p><p>Three weeks into the new campaign those words weigh on the mind.

<p>Barbara McInnis was looking for thrills as she headed into her 90s. Quilting wasn’t quite cutting it, nor was the ukulele. Then she realised she could be the next Ringo Starr</p><p>When she was 89, Barbara McInnis took her first drum lesson. Walking into teacher Chris Joyce’s Morecambe studio, she sat behind the kit, picked up a pair of sticks and began to hit the kit that surrounded her. “I was very nervous but once I got going, it was joyous,” she says. “I made a wonderful racket that I haven’t been able to stop since.”</p><p>Six months on from that first lesson, McInnis is known locally as the “90-year-old drummer” and can often be found at Morecambe pubs playing gigs with groups such as the D’Ukes of Lancaster Ukulele Band and Garstang Ukulele Group. “I see Chris every week or two for a lesson and we work through whatever songs are on my gig set list,” she says. “I’m trying to channel my inner Ringo Starr.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar
