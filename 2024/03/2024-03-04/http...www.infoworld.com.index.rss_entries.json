Over the years, their collective imagination has dreamed up possible futures that are awesome, amazing, terrifying, and often totally wrong.</p><p>Such imaginative speculation isn\u2019t necessarily a crime or even a mistake. After all, it\u2019s just fiction: a bit of fun exploring what might be. It\u2019s not a rigorous, results-oriented slog\u2014that\u2019s for the programmer nerds back in the salt mines. Science fiction is an expedition where we let our imaginations run wild.</p><p>Science fiction creators have also been right at least some of the time. Some sci-fi visions have even helped steer the evolution of technology. <em>Star Trek</em>'s hand-held \u201ccommunicators,\" for instance, might have inspired flip phones.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3713022/10-ways-science-fiction-got-high-tech-wrong.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></s", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "http://www.infoworld.com/index.rss", "date_published": "2024-03-04T10:00:00+00:00", "language": "en-us", "album": "", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": false, "source_obj__id": 151, "comments": [], "title": "10 ways science fiction got high tech wrong", "age": null, "link": "https://www.infoworld.com/article/3713022/10-ways-science-fiction-got-high-tech-wrong.html#tk.rss_all", "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "artist": null}, {"permanent": false, "thumbnail": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/01/boxing-gloves_fight_battle_knockout-100745557-small.jpg", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>Folks, we have an open source problem. And, no, it\u2019s not the problem some think. You\u2019ll hear people rail against corporations that falsely describing their code as open source. Sometimes they\u2019re correct.

We\u2019ve always had businesses try to piggyback on open source branding in pursuit of commercial gains. The difference during the past few years, however, is that free and open source software lost its way, leaving developers (and businesses) just one option: permissive, Apache-style licensing.
