For decades, we’ve been told that plastic waste is recyclable, and have been encouraged to recycle our plastic bottles and packaging. And yet, we somehow only recycle around 5% of the plastic waste we produce every year. And we keep producing more plastic every year. Why isn’t this working? Maybe it’s because even the plastic industry knows that plastic recycling is not technically or economically feasible. And they’ve been lying to us about it the whole time.

A lot of the quotes were sourced from this report by the Center for Climate Integrity: https://climateintegrity.org/uploads/media/Fraud-of-Plastic-Recycling-2024.pdf
