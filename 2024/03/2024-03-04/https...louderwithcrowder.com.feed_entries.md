The only reason you would hide the truth is when you are not on the side of the truth. Which is a pro-abortion OBGYN criticized a very life-like fetal development video for sex education classes and said it was the ‚Äúlast thing kids need to be watching.‚Äù</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

She repeatedly asked the worker if she could return the charger if it did not work. So obviously, it does not take a genius to figure out that she was likely going to return an identical charger she had that was broken. But whether or not that was her intent is not the point. The point is that the unknown woman randomly attacked innocent bystanders for no reason at all. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

However, the problem with that is that moral action and the law cannot be applied retroactively. And if future generations could charge individuals for ancestral crime - we would be living in a very barbaric society that would not only be abhorrent, but completely asinine. </p><p>But even if none of that were true, what this Washington Post columnist said is so naive and so foolish, that you wonder how she can even put complete sentences together given how objectively stupid she is. </p><p>A Washington Post reporter said that shoplifting is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sf-hardware-store" target="_self">not a big deal</a> because Americans are livi
