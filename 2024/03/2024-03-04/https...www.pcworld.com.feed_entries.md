<p>Microsoft appears to have pushed the ability to upload documents, screenshots, and images to Windows 11&rsquo;s Copilot AI assistant, allowing you to ask it to make sense of documents stored on your PC.</p>



<p>Being able to &ldquo;query&rdquo; a document is a subtly powerful capability that you may have never taken advantage of. And it&rsquo;s way, way faster than running it on your own PC. Unfortunately, this new capability may suffer from the same problem that other LLMs might struggle with: persistence.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Querying&rdquo; a document means asking Copilot questions about it. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it mean?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sum it up for me in 30 words.&rdquo; &ldquo;What next steps should I take?&rdquo; Ideally, Copilot should be able to take an involved, complex document like a contract and allow the average user (you and I) to make sense of

<p>Scientists from China are currently working on an optical disc that could store up to 200 terabytes of data in the size of a DVD, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-storage-petabit-optical-disc&amp;xcust=2-1-2254577-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as reported by IEEE Spectrum</a>.</p>



<p>This is made possible by storing data in three dimensions instead of just two. The scientists have developed a way to store the data on 100 layers of the disc. Even more could be possible in the future.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing I like better than a clean PC build, and that&rsquo;s what the new Corsair 2500X enclosure is all about. It&rsquo;s part of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1937700/2023s-biggest-desktop-pc-trend-the-war-on-cables.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the new generation of back-connection cases</a>, which allow for motherboards with most of their power and data connections on the back to allow that rat&rsquo;s nest of cables to be hidden away. Adam Patrick Murray and Will Smith are in the PCWorld studio to check out the case and give it a full build in our latest YouTube video. </p>

<p>AMD has been all the rage with gamers lately, as its Ryzen X3D series of CPUs with extra V-Cache boosts gaming performance for both PC builders and pre-builts. But Intel is still far in the lead in terms of market share, and it hasn&rsquo;t been resting on its laurels. An overclocked variant of its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2108211/intel-core-i9-14900k-core-i7-14700-k-review.html">top-of-the-line Core i9 14900K CPU</a> has been spotted in several leaks, and even in a few users&rsquo; hands, sporting overclocked primary cores for even better performance. The all-but-confirmed Intel Core i9-14900KS supports a native overclock boosting its clock speeds up to an incredible 6.2GHz. </p>
