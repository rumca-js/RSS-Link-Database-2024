The Thaumaturge is a supernatural look at 1905â€™s Warsaw. As the world hovers on the brink of a war in less than a decade, protagonist Wiktor Szulski is roaming around Warsaw, using his strange pet demons to solve mysteries and figure out just what is happening.

When it comes to gameplay, The Thaumaturge is primarily a conversation-driven investigative game, where players will get to make plenty of choices along the way. If the player does manage to find themself in a fight, the game throws up one of the more fun combat systems out there, which manages to be incredibly tactical without getting bogged down in having to deal with the minutiae of character stats or weapon upgrades.

With this feature, I try to make a case for why I need those 10 to 12 hours games back in my life while trying to make a broader point of why the concept of bigger is better doesn't always fly in the realm of video games.

For those who have watched WWE, week-in, week-out, for years, monotony can occasionally set in. Visual Concepts' WWE 2K23 seemed like it was going down the same path last year, but fortunately, the upcoming WWE 2K24 brings more content and new features than its predecessor.

There are four new match types - Ambulance, Casket, Special Guest Referee and Gauntlet; two new MyRise stories with wildly different plotlines and even more replay value than last year; the 2K Showcase covering Forty Years of Wrestlemania with historic matches; and of course, several new gameplay elements, like expanded Backstage Brawls and Trading Blows.

WWE 2K24 is out on March 8th for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5 and PC. Check out 15 differences between it and WWE 2K23 before buying.
