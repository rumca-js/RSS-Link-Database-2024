A long line of influential thinkers have instinctively moved their bodies to open their minds, from Darwin, who advanced his theory of evolution while accumulating laps of his \u201cthinking path\u201d, to Nietzsche, who in 1888 warned: \u201cDo not believe any idea that was not born in the open air and of free movement.\u201d And now scientists are not just confirming the link between exercise and creativity, but unpicking precisely how it works.</p><p>Often, when we hear about the benefits of physical activity, researchers are really referring to the benefits of <em>fitness</em> \u2013 the product of regular and repeated physical activity. But what\u2019s interesting about creativity is that it appears to be enhanced through the very act of moving the body.</p> <a hre", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "date_published": "2024-03-04T10:00:25+00:00", "language": "en-gb", "album": "", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": false, "source_obj__id": 341, "comments": [], "title": "\u2018All it takes is a quick walk\u2019: how a few minutes\u2019 exercise can unleash creativity \u2013 even if you hate it", "age": null, "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/04/all-it-takes-is-a-quick-walk-how-a-few-minutes-exercise-can-unleash-creativity-even-if-you-hate-it", "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "artist": null}, {"permanent": false, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a996f10072c23da13eeb980b834176603a0006a7/0_420_3832_2299/master/3832.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=efa35fa5c25b243cc29df4066487703f", "description": "<p>Children heard crying on 999 calls from boats in days before mass drowning, records suggest, yet no attempts to ensure their safety</p><p>Children \u2013 including babies \u2013 are feared to have been left adrift in small boats in the Channel by overwhelmed UK rescue agencies days before a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/29/uk-coastguard-left-channel-migrants-adrift-in-lead-up-to-mass-drowning\">mass drowning in 2021</a>, prompting the former children\u2019s commissioner to call for an investigation.</p><p>In at least nine incidents in coastguard logs, obtained by the Guardian and <a href=\"https://libertyinvestigates.org.uk/\">Liberty Investigates</a>,<em> </em>no attempt to establish the safety of small boats containing children is recorded after calls for help.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/04/uk-coastguard-children-migrants-channel-tragedy-rescue\">Continue reading...</a>", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "date_published": "2024-03-04T10:00:25+00:00", "language": "en-gb", "album": "", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": false, "source_obj__id": 341, "comments": [], "title": "Fears UK coastguards left children adrift on small boats before Channel tragedy", "age": null, "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/04/uk-coastguard-children-migrants-channel-tragedy-rescue", "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "artist": null}, {"permanent": false, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa9489823f4b460d1cf94cc78bd3ccb615a9ff98/548_0_3573_2144/master/3573.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=68781740221d7d9bb4c26221f474cced", "description": "<p>Uncertain line readings and torpid direction hamper the story of the first British woman to swim the Channel</p><p>It is the misfortune of this waterlogged British indie to be a true-life drama about a female endurance swimmer, coming out when people are still talking about Annette Bening in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/24/nyad-review-annette-bening-pulls-out-all-the-stops-in-engaging-swimming-drama\">Hollywood underdog heartwarmer Nyad</a>, also about a female endurance swimmer.
