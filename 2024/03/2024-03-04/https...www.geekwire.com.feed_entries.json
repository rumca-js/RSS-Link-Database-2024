In a news release, Loopie called the move a strategic way to revolutionize its mobile app marketplace. Launched in July 2018, Loopie is led by co-founder and CEO John Vincent Lee. The mobile app laundromat, connects people who don\u2019t have the time or desire to deal with their own dirty laundry with people who can wash and dry on their own and earn money doing it.

But they&#8217;re also getting fewer tips, and consumer demand has likely fallen. Those are some takeaways from data provided to GeekWire from Solo, a Seattle-based software startup that helps more than 250,000 independent contractors manage their earnings. The controversial law went into effect in January and set a\u00a0minimum\u00a0per-minute and per-mile amount for app-based workers delivering for tech platforms. The companies responded by\u00a0adding\u00a0substantial new fees for consumers \u2014\u00a0$5 for each order \u2014\u00a0and&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/data-from-seattle-food-delivery-drivers-shows", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "date_published": "2024-03-04T17:09:17+00:00", "language": "en-US", "album": "", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": false, "source_obj__id": 131, "comments": [], "title": "Data from Seattle food delivery drivers shows higher hourly earnings, but less customer demand", "age": null, "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/data-from-seattle-food-delivery-drivers-shows-higher-hourly-earnings-but-less-customer-demand", "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "artist": null}, {"permanent": false, "thumbnail": null, "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/7k5a3657-1260x840.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />On a recent trip to India, something caught my attention inside a tech company office. Bunk beds. The Chennai-based team working for Zuper turned their conference room into a sleeping area for employees who were staying late at the office working to improve the company\u2019s software platform. This was just one example highlighting the unmatched determination of founders and teams in India \u2014 which has become a critical part of the innovation ecosystem in Seattle despite being halfway across the world.
