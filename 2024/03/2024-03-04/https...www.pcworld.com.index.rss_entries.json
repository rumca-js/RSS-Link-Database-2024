From the most complex mechanical boards to the sleekest designer sets to the flashiest gamer machines, and everything in between, there are plenty of options for wireless excellence. That even includes keyboards for budget buyers &mdash; you can find a great pick in every category for well under three-digit prices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve spent hours and hours using each model, banging away on our reviews, surfing the web, and keeping up on social media to bring you a list of the very best wireless keyboards around. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2108917/logitech-wave-keys-review-2.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Logitech Wave Keys</a> isn&rsquo;t our pick for the best wireless ergonomic keyboard, even though it&rsquo;s a fairly go", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "date_published": "2024-03-04T19:30:00+00:00", "language": null, "album": "", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": false, "source_obj__id": 245, "comments": [], "title": "Best wireless keyboards 2024: Top Bluetooth and USB models", "age": null, "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/414972/best-wireless-keyboards.html", "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "artist": null}, {"permanent": false, "thumbnail": null, "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a 1080p webcam for your Teams or Zoom calls, you&rsquo;re missing out. Why spend money on hair, makeup, and skincare, then use a poor 720p webcam in front of friends and colleagues? Our picks for the best webcams mean that you can look your best, for less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably no other hardware category has seen such rapid improvements as webcams, thanks to the work-from-home trend. Webcam makers have realized that 1080p resolution and improved audio are now basic requirements. Most laptops still ship with a 720p webcam, however, making a standalone webcam a valuable upgrade. Premium options include 4K resolution, ring lights, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t tested every one of these webcams, just most of them.

It&rsquo;s a trade-off that seems almost unavoidable. The bigger your monitor and the more pixel-dense its panel, the slower your refresh rate, which is why the most competitive PC gamers are sticking to 1080p and 1440p screens. But LG&rsquo;s newest OLED monitor aims to deliver the best of both worlds. This 32-inch UltraGear design has a unique &ldquo;Dual Mode&rdquo; feature, delivering its full 4K (3840&times;2160) resolution at 240Hz, or steps down to 1920&times;1080 at a blistering 480Hz. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html\">The best monitors</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In theory, that means you can lean back and appreciate the latest Netflix series in its glorious maximum quality, then tap a hotkey to activate Dual ", "page_rating_contents": 0, "source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "date_published": "2024-03-04T16:09:00+00:00", "language": null, "album": "", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": false, "source_obj__id": 245, "comments": [], "title": "LG\u2019s new OLED monitor runs at 4K/240Hz or 1080p/480Hz", "age": null, "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2254309/lgs-newest-oled-monitor-runs-at-4k-240hz-or-1080p-480hz.html", "page_rating": 0, "tags": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "artist": null}, {"permanent": false, "thumbnail": null, "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>After launching the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2191793/14-inch-macbook-pro-m3-review.html\">M3 chip in the 14-inch MacBook Pro</a> last October, Apple has <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/apple-unveils-the-new-13-and-15-inch-macbook-air-with-the-powerful-m3-chip/&amp;xcust=2-1-2254448-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">updated the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air</a> with the faster chips in the same thin and light design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the M3 chip&mdash;8-Core CPU/8-Core GPU in the base 13-inch model; 8-Core CPU/10-Core GPU in all other configurations&mdash;Apple has also upgraded the Wi-Fi from 6 to 6E and added support for up to two external displays when the lid is closed.
