The Australian thrilled fans in Bengaluru with a 37-ball 58 including four sixes, one of which smashed the rear window of a sponsor’s car mounted on a stage behind the boundary.</p><p>In response, Warriorz skipper Alyssa Healy cracked a swift half-century herself, but after she was stumped off Sophie Molineux UP’s victory chase gradually subsided. The result moved RCB, playing their final match in front of a home crowd before the event moves to Delhi, to six points, equal top with last year’s finalists Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals, and two ahead of UP.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/05/ellyse-perry-six-car-window-wpl-womens-premier-league-rc

<p>The 23-year-old striker was playing in the fourth tier in December but has inspired Sevilla and now is the team’s ‘soul’</p><p>December 2023, the day before a game, and the manager of a team in Spain’s fourth tier gathers his squad. He reminds them of the plan – the bus will leave at 6am for an 11.30am kick off 230km away, stopping to pick up players en route – and puts on a video. It includes every goal the opposition’s striker has scored: there are 11 from 13 games and, the centre back watching soon realises, not one is a tap in. Instead, Isaac Romero, the Sevilla B forward up there on the screen, makes them all himself. “Unreal, absolutely unreal,” the defender recalls. “You could tell he had to be in the first team, and that’s what happened. He’s on fire.”</p><p>That makes it sound easy, but it wasn’t. “I never imagined this,” Romero says. That morning he played before a few hundred people and didn’t score. The next time he got a goal, there were 12,581 there. The time

It should be essential to the way we define and articulate not just African-American identity but American identity.” The Met curator Denise Murrell recently shared with me the animating idea behind her new blockbuster exhibition, The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism, which brings together an amazingly diverse grouping of some 160 pieces to reveal the true breadth and depth of the work made by Black artists from the 1920s through the 40s. The show’s lofty aspiration is to redefine how we understand the Harlem Renaissance and the modernist art movement.</p><p>Murrell’s exhibition is the first major survey of the Harlem Renaissance in New York City since Studio Museum’s Harlem Renaissance: Art of Black America in 1987,

Now these settlers, with documented histories of arson, theft, physical assault, and destruction of property, will have their assets frozen, travel abroad restricted, and ability to do business constrained.</p><p>These sanctions materially disrupt the machinery of settler violence and send perhaps the strongest signal yet to the Israeli government that it must curb attacks on Palestinian communities, because there will be consequences.
