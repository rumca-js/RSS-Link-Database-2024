<p>Science fiction writers and directors love creating high-tech visions of the future. Over the years, their collective imagination has dreamed up possible futures that are awesome, amazing, terrifying, and often totally wrong.</p><p>Such imaginative speculation isn’t necessarily a crime or even a mistake. After all, it’s just fiction: a bit of fun exploring what might be. It’s not a rigorous, results-oriented slog—that’s for the programmer nerds back in the salt mines. Science fiction is an expedition where we let our imaginations run wild.</p><p>Science fiction creators have also been right at least some of the time. Some sci-fi visions have even helped steer the evolution of technology. <em>Star Trek</em>'s hand-held “communicators," for instance, might have inspired flip phones.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3713022/10-ways-science-fiction-got-high-tech-wrong.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></s

<p>Folks, we have an open source problem. And, no, it’s not the problem some think. You’ll hear people rail against corporations that falsely describing their code as open source. Sometimes they’re correct. You’ll hear others <a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2019/03/15/cloud-open-source-powder-keg/" rel="nofollow">bemoan the influx of venture-backed</a> companies diluting the meaning of open source to fuel corporate gains. Sometimes they’re correct.</p><p>But the problem isn’t the companies. At least, not the primary problem.
