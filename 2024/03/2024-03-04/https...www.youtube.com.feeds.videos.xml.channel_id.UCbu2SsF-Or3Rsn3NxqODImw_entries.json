In 2020, Square-Enix released Final Fantasy VII Remake, a game that felt as though the devs had reached into her head and made the game she remembered playing in her youth. But L.A. based Producer/Host and bonafide comic book expert Hector Navarro? He's never played a Final Fantasy. His JRPG experience stops at Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nThrust into the middle of the action in Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, can Emma guide Hector to victory in his very first boss fight?
