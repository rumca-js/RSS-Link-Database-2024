But they&#8217;re also getting fewer tips, and consumer demand has likely fallen. Those are some takeaways from data provided to GeekWire from Solo, a Seattle-based software startup that helps more than 250,000 independent contractors manage their earnings. The controversial law went into effect in January and set a minimum per-minute and per-mile amount for app-based workers delivering for tech platforms. The companies responded by adding substantial new fees for consumers — $5 for each order — and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/data-from-seattle-food-delivery-drivers-shows

Bunk beds. The Chennai-based team working for Zuper turned their conference room into a sleeping area for employees who were staying late at the office working to improve the company’s software platform. This was just one example highlighting the unmatched determination of founders and teams in India — which has become a critical part of the innovation ecosystem in Seattle despite being halfway across the world. FUSE recently led a $32 million Series B investment in Zuper, a Seattle-based field operations software startup that has&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/why-indias-thriving-software-talent-base-is-important-for-the-seattle-innovation-ecosystem/">Read More</a>

A key to the institute&#8217;s entrepreneurial success is a mindset of open inquiry and collaboration &#8212; and an emphasis on making the code for its protein-design tools readily available. “I really believed from the beginning that we should share everything that we did,” said IPD director and UW professor David Baker, speaking at an event on campus in Seattle last week. More than two decades ago, Baker and his colleagues developed an early&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/protein-design-pioneer-david-baker-on-why-sharing-code-is-important-for-biotech-startups/">Read M
