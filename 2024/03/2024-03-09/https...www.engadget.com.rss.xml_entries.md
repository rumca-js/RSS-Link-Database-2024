<p>An update to Google Wallet has further simplified the process of getting all your passes in one place. Per this week’s release notes for <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://developers.google.com/wallet/docs/release-notes"><ins>Wallet</ins></a>, spotted by Android reporter ​​<a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1766233772607897901"><ins>Mishaal Rahman</ins></a>, Google says movie tickets and boarding passes will now be surfaced automatically after purchase, as long as the confirmation email has made it to the user’s Gmail inbox. It might not work for every theater chain or airline just yet, but Google says the feature is live for “some” and more should be added in time.</p>
<p>Google little by little has been tweaking Wallet to make it more useful. The company last month <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-finally-brings-wallet-passes-to-wear-os-watches-along-with-transit-directions-080010242.html"

<p>Lego and Nintendo are releasing a Mario Kart-themed set, but you’ll have to wait quite a while until you can actually get it. The companies announced the upcoming addition to their collaborative line in a brief teaser today ahead of Mario Day (March 10), which said only “Mario Kart — Ready, set, build! Racing in 2025.” That’s a long way off for anyone whose immediate reaction was, “I need this now.” In the meantime, though, Lego has three other sets coming to its Super Mario collection before that: the Bowser Express Train, King Boo’s Haunted Mansion and Battle with Roy at Peach’s Castle.</p>

<p>There’s been a lot of discussion in recent years about the practice of <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tom-hanks-calls-out-dental-ad-for-using-ai-likeness-of-him-161548459.html">capitalizing on celebrities’ digital likenesses without their consent</a>, whether after they die or while they’re still alive. Zelda Williams, for one — the <em>Lisa Frankenstein</em> director and daughter of Robin Williams — slammed the “disturbing” trend of people trying to recreate the voices and faces of the deceased last year, as striking actors fought for, among other things, better protections around studios’ potential use of AI clones. Yet despite the obvious ethical issues, companies keep doing it. The latest? Soul Machines just unveiled “<a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.soulmachines.com/digital-marilyn-monroe-notification">Digital Marilyn</a>,” an AI chatbot designed to look and talk just like Marilyn Monroe.</p>

<p>The number of unionized workers for Microsoft's video game subsidiaries keeps growing, and the latest group to join the pool is the largest one yet. Approximately 600 quality assurance workers at Activision have <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/quality-assurance-workers-activision-establish-largest-certified-union-us-video-game">joined the Communications Workers of America</a> (CWA), making them the biggest certified union in the US video game industry. They're also the first Activision workers to organize <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-unionization-agreement-cwa-163550095.html">under the agreement</a> between Microsoft and the CWA. If you'll recall, Microsoft agreed to respect the right of Activision Blizzard workers to unionize as part of its efforts to secure regulatory approval for its $68.7 billion takeover of the video game developer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sam Altman <a href="https://openai.com/blog/review-completed-altman-brockman-to-continue-to-lead-openai"><ins>is back</ins></a> on the board of OpenAI, nearly four months after the CEO was ousted, and quickly reinstated, from the company he founded. Although Altman had returned as the AI company’s top executive in November, a temporary board oversaw his return and the subsequent investigation into his conduct.</p>
<p>That investigation is now complete, according to the company, which added three new members to its board of directors. The additions include: Instacart CEO and former Meta executive Fidji Simo, former Sony executive Nicole Seligman and Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, economist Larry Summers and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, who served on the temporary three-seat board, will remain in their positions with Taylor continuing as chair.</p>
