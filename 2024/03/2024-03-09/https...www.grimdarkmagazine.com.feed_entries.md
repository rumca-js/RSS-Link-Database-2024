<p>Jessica A. McMinn is completely on fire in the explosive second volume of her epic Gardens of War and Wasteland quartet. Darker, grander, richer, and filled with even more delicious emotional turmoil, The Blood Curse is simply everything you could ever wish for in a sequel, and then so much more. With most of the groundwork having been laid in The Ruptured Sky, this sequel just hits the ground running and keeps up a relentlessly captivating pacing the entire way through. McMinn masterfully eases the reader back into the story, immediately reminding us of just how dire the situation has become after all the thrilling events and revelations at the end of book 1. Second book syndrome? We don’t know her; The Blood Curse is a dangerously addictive page turner from start to finish. Whereas The Ruptured Sky mostly felt like Amika’s story to me, I really enjoyed how this sequel smoothly broadened the scope and struck a more even balance between all these wonderfully compelling POV
