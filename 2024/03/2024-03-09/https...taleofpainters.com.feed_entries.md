<p>In this review we cover Krethusa's Cronehost, which pairs Krethusa the Croneseer with Sisters of Slaughter and Doomfire Warlocks. This new character model of the Daughters of Khaine has dedicated herself to Morai-heg, and gathers Morathi's outcasts around her. The rules for her new Army of Renown can be found in the new book in the Dawnbringers series "Shadow of the Crone", but today we'll be looking primarily at the model of Krethusa herself.</p>
