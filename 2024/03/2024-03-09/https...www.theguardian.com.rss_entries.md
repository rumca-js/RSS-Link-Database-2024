<ul><li>Aston Villa captain targets Champions League spot</li><li>Victory means hosts will stretch lead over Spurs to eight points</li></ul><p>Aston Villa’s captain, John McGinn, has described Sunday’s top-four crunch match at home to Tottenham Hotspur as the biggest league game in the club’s recent history.</p><p>Victory for Villa, who are fourth in the Premier League, would extend their buffer to fifth-placed Spurs to eight points with 10 games to play (though Spurs have played a game fewer). McGinn, who joined Villa in 2018, said the players understood the significance of the Tottenham test. Fourth place would guarantee Champions League football for Villa, who have not played in the European Cup since 1982-83.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/09/john-mcginn-aston-villa-spurs-champions-league">Continue reading...</a>

The inclination is to congratulate him, but what you’re really wondering is how on earth he got himself in the position of needing one.</p><p>In the end, because they won, this was a story of resilience and Aaron Ramsdale, at least, deserves credit for the way, having handed Brentford an equaliser, he made two outstanding second-half saves, one from Ivan Toney and one from Nathan Collins. There will be praise, too, for the way Arsenal more generally kept going and found the win that took them top of the table, but this was not a game that would assuage the suspicion that their volatility could undermine their title challenge.

Across their 15 albums he has tapped into west African polyrhythms, meditative ambience and soaring spirituality, producing a signature swing that is loose and laid-back without allowing the groove to fall apart. The band are usually accompanied by trumpet and baritone saxophone, and their latest record sees the addition of a string section, creating 12 tracks of typically soulful, freeform jazz.</p><p>Playing through a mix of standards and originals, the album opens with a

<p>Londoners leaving the city have taken their food with them, keeping the pie and mash scene alive</p><p>Moulsham Street in Chelmsford is a typical English high street, with barbers, salons, pubs and no shortage of culinary options: a Chinese, Indian, chippy and Italian, kebab shops and greasy spoons. But there’s one spot you wouldn’t find in most of the country – the pie and mash shop.</p><p>F Cooke has all the trappings of a traditional pie and mash shop: white -tiled walls, pictures of celebrities, marble tables and wooden benches. It opened in 2020, becoming the first in the city, according to director Jordan Lassman. There are now two. Robins, which has six shops across east London and Essex, soon joined it in 2021. They are part of a burgeoning scene in Essex, which according to Lassman, is “the new home of pie and mash”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/mar/09/how-cockney-cuisine-pie-mash-emigrated-from-london-east-end-to-essex">Continue reading...</

<p>The broadcaster on being arrogant, a dangerous encounter with Idi Amin, and getting arrested in a Swiss hotel at dead of night</p><p>Born in Sussex, Snow, 76, began his career at LBC.

<p>Egg-drop soup with thick udon noodles and savoury Japanese sprinkles, and a thick and wholesome Iranian-style ‘minestrone’</p><p>Like everyone else currently eating their way through to spring, I’ve been thinking a lot about comfort food recently. What makes something tick the comfort food box will vary from person to person, but, for me, there are a few obvious wins. The first is eating from a big bowl – I just love cupping my hands around the base, warming them as I go. Noodles are another big yes. True, “slurp” is perhaps not the most gracious of words, but I’m going to own it fully, chopsticks in (my now warmed) hand. Eggs score highly, too, and broth is never <em>not</em> a brilliant idea. Bring all these together and I think I’ve found a dish that is very comfortably going to see me right through.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/mar/09/egg-drop-udon-persian-noodle-soup-yotam-ottolenghi-comfort-food-recipes">Continue reading...</a>

## Why I got it so wrong on GB News – the flailing TV juggernaut that’s too rich to fail | Zoe Williams

<p>The channel has posted a loss of £42m – and that highlights my naivety. With rich backers, who cares about ratings and profit?</p><p>I almost never worry about things I got wrong, unless the error was so egregious that every day brings fresh evidence of how wrong I was; so, hello, GB News. The channel is almost three years old, and it’s just over three years since people started worrying about its provocations: should we be calling for an ad boycott, they wondered? My line was, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/09/gb-news-left-channel-fake-news">relax, everyone</a>, and my reasons were threefold.</p><p>First, GB News would be boring and nobody would watch it. The thing about reactionary views is that they’re nothing if not predictable. They can be incoherent, sure – and argue simultaneously that women belong in the kitchen, and that women’s rights are so fundamental that transgender rights are anathema – but you can always guess which way they’re

<p>In this poignant tale set during the Highland Clearances, two men form an unlikely bond on a far-flung island</p><p>The year 1843 was momentous in&nbsp;the Scottish Church. After years of protest at the right of landowners to confer clerical livings on ministers of their choosing, a third of ministers broke away from the established church to form the Free Church of Scotland. Conscience came&nbsp;at a price. Stripped of their parishes, their manses and their incomes, many of the rebels found themselves penniless.</p><p>At the same time, Scottish landowners were engaged in the final throes of the Clearances, a century-long endeavour to expel tenants from land they had farmed for generations to make way for cattle, crops and sheep. This pitiless enterprise met little opposition from the church, established or free. Both preached the&nbsp;doctrine of providence, in which earthly events unfolded according to God’s will and suffering was His punishment for our sins. The faithfu

<p>With its extraordinary architecture, maze-like streets and ever-present sunshine, it’s no accident that so many film-makers have used the town as a location</p><p>I was eating homemade <em>crostata</em> (jam tart) on a roof terrace in the Sicilian town of Cefalù and reading about Helius, the ancient Greek god of the sun. Sicily is supposedly the inspiration for the deity’s island in The&nbsp;Odyssey and this makes perfect sense – with more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Helius would like it&nbsp;here. The island is especially lovely in spring, when it’s quieter, cooler and&nbsp;more peaceful than in the scorching summer.<br /><br />Cefalù is an ancient fishing village almost exactly halfway along Sicily’s north coast. It’s prized by Italians as one of the island’s loveliest beach-side places. Barbara De Gaetani, a licensed tour guide who grew up here, told me&nbsp;the allure of the place is difficult to&nbsp;explain: “Many other places are gorgeous but not as seductive.

## Uncle Vanya review – Trevor Nunn triumphs with Chekhov’s tragicomedy

<p><strong>Orange Tree theatre, London<br /></strong>This chamber staging, movingly played by an immaculate ensemble, fits perfectly with the drama’s hothouse of disappointment</p><p>At 84, Sir Trevor Nunn is making his first attempt at Uncle Vanya, Anton Chekhov’s 1899 tragicomedy of turgid work and hopeless love on a failing rural Russian estate. Familiar with the largest stages – the only person to have run both the National Theatre and the RSC – Nunn is working in one of the smallest, Richmond’s Orange Tree, although it would be an injustice if this version ends there.</p><p>The minimalist space brings one immediate gain. Frequent references to the characters living suffocatingly together often seem fanciful in vast auditoria. Chekhov’s reputation can command, but here theatregoers nervously tuck their feet in as the eight actors drink, dance, duel and kiss within touching distance. So rawly authentic are the lines and looks that it feels as if we have somehow tuned into
