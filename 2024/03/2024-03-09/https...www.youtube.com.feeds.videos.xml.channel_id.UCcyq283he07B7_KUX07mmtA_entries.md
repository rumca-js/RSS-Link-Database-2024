Pedal harps can cost $70,000 â€” far more than lever harps, which cost $2,000 to $9,000. At first glance, a pedal harp looks like a simple frame with a row of strings. But there are complicated mechanisms inside that musicians use to change notes. At Camac Harps in France, every harp is carved and assembled by hand. For musicians like Grammy-nominated artist Brandee Younger, the pedal harp resonates with sonic potential.
