We all know the biggest Dune news: The Dune 2 popcorn bucket!! The Dune Part 2 bucket is selling massively perhaps more than Dune theaters could have guessed. This second iteration of Dune (2024) starring Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Florence Pugh, and Austin Butler is getting people into theaters; Dune Part Two is a certifiable hit. The Dune: Part Two popcorn bucket has people as entranced as Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is with Paul Altreides (Timothée Chalamet), and it means more than the success of the Dune 2 movie and director Denis Villeneuve. This IGN Dune 2 video is all about the business, much like Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). Dune 2 from Warner Bros is helping theaters stay afloat by riding the sandworm wave to the movies. IGN reporter Kim Horcher has the power of the Dune 2 popcorn bucket explained for you, and why the significance is beyond…what you think of when you see the Dune 2 popcorn bucket. Buy it if you can, because popcorn buckets are becoming more sought after

## 3 Body Problem Review

3 Body Problem, reviewed by Jordan Hoffman.

3 Body Problem reworks Cixin Liu’s mammoth book trilogy for a wider audience to great success, though it may annoy some viewers with its far-out sci-fi and speed-of-light plot machinations. Some sequences work better than others – like the video game side story delivering a soupçon of cringe – but many of the performances and one shocking sequence make for a more-than-worthy adaption of the beloved franchise.
