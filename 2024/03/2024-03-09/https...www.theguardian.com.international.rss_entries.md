<ul><li>Northern Irishman moves into contention at Bay Hill</li><li>‘You should have to prove yourself year after year’</li></ul><p>The very best of Rory McIlroy on the golf course was preceded by the Northern Irishman’s latest insight into how the sport can best emerge from a current state of flux. McIlroy would probably rather not be asked questions about a path forward for elite golf. The trouble is, he is exceptionally good at answering them.</p><p>Firstly, inside the ropes. McIlroy cut a frustrated figure after playing the front nine of his third round in 38. His response was emphatic. McIlroy roared home in 30 shots, including three birdies in the closing trio of holes, to move firmly into Arnold Palmer Invitational contention at five under par. Bay Hill’s ferocious setup, exaggerated by gusting winds, rendered McIlroy’s inward half a superb one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/09/rory-mcilroy-calls-for-more-competitive-tour-after-storming-back-n

<p>A brilliant free-kick from former Japan international Yuya Osako made up for his eye-poppingly dreadful penalty for Vissel Kobe against FC Tokyo. Osako, last season's joint-top scorer in J.League slipped at the point of impact from the spot, kicking the ball against his standing foot and sending the ball looping well wide. However, he later scored superbly from just outside Tokyo's area to help the reigning champions to a 2-1 victory. It is the 33-year-old forward's first goal of the season, having scored 22 last year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2024/mar/09/yuya-osako-atones-penalty-miss-stunning-free-kick-j-league-vissel-kobe-video">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Experts who track down rare designer pieces report a surge in requests from celebrities keen to make mark on the red carpet</p><p>The red carpet has been rolled out. The gold statuettes are polished. And the dresses? Well, for many celebrities attending this year’s Oscars ceremony the race is still on to find the perfect one.</p><p>Commercial relationships often dictate who wears what (as a long-term ambassador for Louis Vuitton, the best actress nominee Emma Stone will no doubt be wearing the French brand) but many A-listers are increasingly delving into fashion’s archives.

After two minutes of the opening round, Joshua landed a shuddering straight right which dropped Ngannou heavily to the canvas. It was a peach of a punch but Ngannou got up, sensibly taking his time, and managed to avoid further calamity before the bell brought refuge. But Joshua was remorseless in the early hours of Saturday morning.</p><p>Fifty seconds were left in round two when Ngannou was caught by a big right followed by a scything left. He slumped to the canvas and looked seriously groggy as the referee counted. Ngannou hauled himself up and then walked slowly towards the centre of the ring. Joshua met him with a monstrous overhand right that knocked Ngannou cold.</p> <a href="https://www.theg
