It's a companion to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY9cZ8nX4xmmJs_01xwUSwyzTNycA93pz">DF Direct</a> - hilariously entitled DF InDirect - and its initial format should be recognisable to viewers/listeners of our weekly show as it's an extension to our existing Supporter Q+A section. The show is available to all backers on all tiers and it's available to watch or listen to right now - and there's a small sample on this page.</p><p>The idea for InDirect came about owing to the sheer wealth of excellent supporter questions we receive each week.
