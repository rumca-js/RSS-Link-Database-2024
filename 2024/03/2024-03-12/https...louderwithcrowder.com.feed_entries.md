So much so that the Governor of Illinois has said that the ‚Äúsacrifices‚Äù of abortion providers make him ‚Äúproud. However, it is unclear what he means by ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù - especially considering these people are not sacrificing anything other than the life of a ‚Äúchoice,‚Äù but I digress.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

	Thank goodness I live in Real America where it is still safe to eat a Cheesy Gordita Crunch without fear of getting mugged or murderized. That is not the case in Oakland, where Taco Bell announced it is shutting down all their dining rooms. Violence has gotten so out of hand, it is unsafe for them to conduct business there.
