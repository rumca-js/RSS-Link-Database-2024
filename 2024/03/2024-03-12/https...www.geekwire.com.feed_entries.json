Police Department is deploying a new tool in its fight against illicit drugs. The agency announced Tuesday that it&#8217;s using a handheld narcotics analyzer called TruNarc that can scan through transparent packaging and identify the chemical composition of more than 530 controlled substances, such as fentanyl, methamphetamine, and heroin. TruNarc uses technology called Raman spectroscopy, in which a laser light beam interacts with the chemical bonds of a material. The device allows officers to quickly identify drugs without disturbing packaging, contaminating evidence or being exposed to harmful substances. The analyzer captures all scan results, including time and&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/in-fight-against-fentanyl-and-other-drugs-police-departments-deploy-handheld-narc"}, {"page_rating_contents": 0, "tags": [], "vote": 0, "title": "Looking for non-dilutive funding? 5 tips for startups seeking small business grants", "page_rating_votes": 0, "artist": null, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "bookmarked": false, "date_published": "2024-03-12T19:34:14+00:00", "permanent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "page_rating": 0, "thumbnail": null, "album": "", "age": null, "comments": [], "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/advice-for-startups-that-want-to-snag-small-business-grants-a-key-source-of-non-dilutive-funding", "page_rating_visits": 0, "source_obj__id": 131, "language": "en-US", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"541\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Richard-Giersch.jpg\" width=\"1016\" /><br />A good idea, preliminary data, and credentials in the field are all key components of landing a small business grant from the U.S. government to launch or expand a company. \u201cIt&#8217;s all about the commercial potential,\u201d said Richard Giersch, executive director of Life Science Washington Institute, at a recent talk at the University of Washington: \u201cFundamentals for startups: Demystifying federal funding opportunities.\u201d SBIR (small business innovation research) and STTR (small business technology transfer) awards account for the vast majority of U.S. government grants to small businesses, said Giersch.

Friedman, a 20-year vet of the tech giant, is a corporate vice president leading design and research across Microsoft, including on its AI products. His skills came in handy on &#8220;Max &#38; The Purple Anxiety Monster,&#8221; a new book that his 13-year-old son wrote about coping with his anxious feelings. Friedman created all of the illustrations for the book using Dall-E, the generative AI program from OpenAI that can create images from text prompts.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-design-exec-turns-to-ai-to-illustrate-sons-book-about-coping-with-anxiety/\">Read More</a>"}, {"page_rating_contents": 0, "tags": [], "vote": 0, "title": "Lumen Orbit emerges from stealth and raises $2.4M to put data centers in space", "page_rating_votes": 0, "artist": null, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "bookmarked": false, "date_published": "2024-03-12T00:54:02+00:00", "permanent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "page_rating": 0, "thumbnail": null, "album": "", "age": null, "comments": [], "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/lumen-orbit-stealth-2-4m-data-centers-space", "page_rating_visits": 0, "source_obj__id": 131, "language": "en-US", "description": "<img alt=\"Illustration: Lumen Orbit satellite in space\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"876\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/240311-satellite2-1260x876.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Bellevue, Wash.-based Lumen Orbit, a startup that&#8217;s only about three months old, says that it&#8217;s closed a $2.4 million pre-seed investment round to launch its plan to put hundreds of satellites in orbit, with the goal of processing data in space before it&#8217;s downloaded to customers on Earth.
