Ginger is one of the world's leading spice crops, and is used for both its medicinal and flavor qualities. It grows well in tropical regions and its rhizomes mature in eight to nine months from planting. Rising consumer demands for organically grown crops in the U.S. provide the opportunity to add locally grown organic ginger to certified crop lists.

This colorful web of wispy gas filaments is the Vela Supernova Remnant, an expanding nebula of cosmic debris left over from a massive star that exploded about 11,000 years ago. Located around 800 light-years away in the constellation Vela (the Sails), this nebula is one of the nearest supernova remnants to Earth. Though the unnamed star ended its life thousands of years ago, the shockwave its death produced is still propagating into the interstellar medium, carrying glowing tendrils of gas with it.

The collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991 yielded social, political and economic effects worldwide. Among them was a suspected role in slowing human-generated methane emissions. Methane had been rising steadily in the atmosphere until about 1990. Atmospheric scientists theorized that economic collapse in the former USSR led to less oil and gas production, and thus a slowdown in the rise of global methane levels, which has since resumed.

## A high-content triethyl phosphate-based, non-flammable, and high-conductivity electrolyte for lithium-ion batteries

Safety issues related to flammable electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) remain a major challenge for their extended application. The use of non-flammable phosphate−based electrolytes has proven its validity in inhibiting the combustion of LIBs. However, the strong interaction between Li+ and phosphate leads to a dominant solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with limited electronic shielding, resulting in poor Li+ intercalation at the graphite (Gr) anode when using high−phosphate−content electrolytes.

This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image shows NGC 4423, a galaxy that lies about 55 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo. In this image, NGC 4423 appears to have quite an irregular, tubular form, so it might be surprising to find out that it is in fact a spiral galaxy. Knowing this, we can make out the denser central bulge of the galaxy, and the less crowded surrounding disk (the part that comprises the spiral arms).

Statistics made available in January 2024 show that while deforestation in the Amazon fell by half in 2023, it increased by 43% in the Cerrado, the Brazilian savanna. A research group at the State University of Campinas's Institute of Biology (IB-UNICAMP) in Brazil dedicated to ecological studies on the Cerrado has already highlighted the urgency of combating destruction of the biome. However, it is not enough to defend what remains: restoration is also needed.

Over the past 30 years, Australia's Tasmanian devil population has been afflicted with an infectious cancer that has pushed the species to near extinction. The marsupials are highly susceptible to devil facial tumor disease, which is almost always fatal to their species. The genomic interactions between the disease and its host correlate with how quickly a susceptible animal becomes infected after exposure to the pathogen.

Dense branching and spines are common features of plant species in ecosystems with high mammalian herbivory pressure. The combination of dense branching and spines is likely to produce the most effective herbivore defenses, as dense branching directly translates into higher spine densities. However, how cage architecture evolved under mammalian pressure has remained unexplored.

Cells rely on complex molecular machines composed of protein assemblies to perform essential functions such as energy production, gene expression, and protein synthesis. To better understand how these machines work, scientists capture snapshots of them by isolating proteins from cells and using various methods to determine their structures. However, this process also removes them from the context of their native environment, including protein interaction partners and cellular location.
