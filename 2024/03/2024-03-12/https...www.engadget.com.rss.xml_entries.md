The change will allow Bluesky users to and developers to work together to create custom labeling tools for the budding social media platform.</p>
<p>The new moderation tools arrive as Bluesky is seeing a surge in growth after it got rid of its waitlist <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bluesky-is-ditching-its-waitlist-and-opening-to-everyone-140026198.html"><ins>and opened</ins></a> to all users in February.

<p><em>Children of the Sun</em> is a bullet-bending puzzle game set in a trippy world of cults and revenge, and it's due to hit PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309950/Children_of_the_Sun/">via Steam</a> on April 9. In <em>Children of the Sun</em>, players line up a single sniper shot and then control the bullet as it ricochets among the cultists in their sights. The goal is to take everyone out with the most speed, elegance and creativity, curving the bullet around the environment and through objects as the targets attempt to flee in slow motion. It's a repeatable, satisfying set of mechanics.</p>

The <em>Fortnite</em> developer will charge an annual “per seat” subscription of $1,850. The term “per seat” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per-seat_license">is tech nomenclature</a> that effectively means “a person using the software.” These changes will go into effect with the release of Unreal Engine 5.4 in late April.</p>

<p>April is just around the corner, so if you're not stressed about filing taxes yet, it's likely coming any day now. Thanks to the lovely (read: horrible) tax lobby and the politicians who take their money, the headache taxes bring is as American as apple pie. The IRS is attempting to simplify things a bit with a <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/">Direct File tool</a>, a free digital program that provides step-by-step guidance for taxpayers submitting their returns, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/irs-direct-file-taxes-98dbc44cc764972991072efbf40f2291"><em>The Associated Press</em> reports</a>.

While it’s not wrong to assume that many robot vacuums land on the high end of the price spectrum, a growing market with many new players entering over the past few years means there are more budget-friendly machines available now than ever before. Gone are the days where it was necessary to spend at least $500 to get one of these robot-vacs home; now, you can find plenty of decent models for $300 or less. After testing dozens of robot vacuums at various price points, we’ve narrowed down our top picks for the best robot vacuums to buy when you’re on a budget.</p>

<p>Since I've tested dozens of robot vacuums, I'm often asked if these gadgets are "worth it" and I'd say the answer is yes. The biggest thing they offer is convenie

<p>Airbnb has announced a complete <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airbnb-to-hosts-please-stop-filming-the-guests-144537408.html">ban on indoor cameras</a> in host properties. Hosts were allowed to have cameras in communal spaces, but they were <em>supposed</em> to be banned from bedrooms and bathrooms. Hosts were also supposed to disclose any cameras in the rental, which may not always have happened. The company says it established the new rules “in consultation with our guests, hosts and privacy experts” and that it’ll continue to seek feedback.</p>
<p>Hosts also have to disclose any outdoor cameras (that can’t point indoors or be in areas with a “greater expectation of privacy” — think showers and saunas). Because humans can be monstrous. The new rules kick in April 30.</p>
<p>Any hosts that violate these new policies could face having their properties banned from Airbnb — and even get their entire account removed.</p>

<p>You might have an idea of which smartphone you want to buy next. But there are more options than ever before that are solid — plenty of companies are making stellar handsets nowadays, at similar prices, all with comparable feature sets. That said, the choice isn’t always cut-and-dry. If you know you want an iPhone, your decision-making process is a bit easier. If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from and more questions to answer before you spend any money.
