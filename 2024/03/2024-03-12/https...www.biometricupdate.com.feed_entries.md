		In Hampshire and Isle of Wight, facial recognition is being used to identify suspects caught on camera, resulting in more arrests, according to an announcement. It is part of the Retail Crime Action led by Hampshire and the Isle of Wight Police and Crime Commissioner Donna Jones and Chief Constable Scott Chilton, resulting in an 83.3 percent increase in outcomes for victims.

Police are also working more closely with retailers through the Op Stopall, which <a href="https://www.hampshire-pcc.gov.uk/commissioner-and-chief-unite-on-zero-tolerance-to-retail-crime">uses facial recognition</a> to identify and build comprehensive evidence against the most prolific offenders. Due to the amount of evidence provided, more offenders are pleading guilty, resulting in fewer

		A trio of outsiders view the U.S. government’s justice and security departments, including members of its own civil rights agency, with increasing distrust when it comes to biometric surveillance use.

The critics say the departments of Justice and Homeland Security are hiding use cases behind overly broad disclosure requirements.

At the same time, law enforcement agencies allegedly are allowed too much latitude when deciding when biometric surveillance is used and who outside an agency can see collected data.

A third accusation states that inherently imperfect biometric surveillance algorithms are being used by the Justice and Homeland Security departments with too little regard for vulnerable communities when writing rules and recommendations for automated s

		Executives at an unmanned systems company in Israel say they have created a $50 million corporate venture capital fund to invest in facial recognition for use by the nation’s military.

The Israel Defense Fund, raised by the leaders of <a href="https://www.titangroup.io/">Titan Innovations</a>, will look for investments in combat-proven software and hardware, including facial recognition and detection algorithms, analytics and cybersecurity.

Titan Innovations is an unmanned systems (drone) integrator.

It will focus on roles including command and control, border security and urban warfare, according to a company announcement. The announcement also notes Titan’s experience with the U.S. defense industry and identifies that country as a target market.

Iceland is rolling out new identity cards with improved security features in line with requirements from the European Union and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

The National Register of Iceland started issuing the new IDs last week.

“The appearance of the identity cards is based on a new standard from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and Iceland is the first country in the world to issue identity cards according to this new standard.

The ID fraud is characterized by Au10tix researchers as a “Mega-Attack.”

The company’s Q4 Global Identity Fraud Report describes two distinct patterns of digital identity fraud attacks at “mega” scale. Half of the 22 thousand attacks took place within a span of two to three weeks, qualifying it as a “sudden burst” attack. “Slow burn” attacks are more typical, where a large number (Au10tix’ example is 2,000) AI-generated IDs are used five or six times a day over a period close

		Over the past years, multi-factor authentication (MFA) has spread across the world, entering every industry and reaching thousands of users. Many of us are using the technology several times a day to access our work or social media sites.

Cloud-based software giant Salesforce has been one of the companies following the trend, making MFA a mandatory requirement for its customers two years ago. But MFA, including those that rely on biometrics, is still facing challenges – from shifting regulations to the dangers of deepfakes.
