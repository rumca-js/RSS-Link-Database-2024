<p>In the turbulent times of the Horus Heresy, the Blood Angels Legion stood as a bastion of courage and integrity amidst the chaos. Today, we present a Blood Angels Legionary, clad in the revered MkVI "Corvus" armour. This "grimdark" paint job portrays a warrior from the latter stages of the Horus Heresy, a period marked by both tragedy and heroism for the IX. Legion. Find out more about this model (and how to paint it) in this post.</p>
