<p>It was ugly, extraordinarily tense, exponentially so. Everybody knew as the closing stages of regulation time ticked down that it would take just one moment to prise the warring parties apart, to deliver a defining victory. The feeling would only harden in extra time.</p><p>Mikel Arteta could feel the weight of history, his own as the Arsenal manager in European competition, even going back to his playing days at the club. Never before in five Europa League knockout ties as the manager at this stadium had he tasted victory – and there had been a few sobering reverses. More broadly, Arsenal had not made it to a Champions League quarter-final since 2009-10, losing in their previous seven last-16 ties.

<p>Four years on, Barcelona are back in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. On the edge in footballing terms and in financial ones too, this was the game they just could not afford to lose but while all the talk had been of obligation, Xavi Hernández had described it as an opportunity, a moment to be enjoyed, and so it was. Sure, there were nerves, but high on Montjuic this became a night to remember.</p><p>Ultimately, the start, two goals inside 15 minutes from Fermín López and João Cancelo, had been enough. And when it looked like it might not be, Napoli having come back to within a goal, Sergi Roberto and Ilkay Gündogan carved open a chance for Robert Lewandowski to roll in the third and ensure it was so.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/12/barcelona-napoli-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Winner distant second to absent Constitution Hill last year</li><li>Victor sent off short-priced favourite on opening day of Festival</li></ul><p>There was, as Willie Mullins conceded, no “wow” about State Man in the Champion Hurdle here on Tuesday, but on the softest ground on the Festival’s opening day for many years, even the much-missed defending champion, Constitution Hill, might have struggled to find his usual turn of foot. In his absence, State Man turned up and, like the grafter he is, he got the job done, carving out a one-and-a-quarter length victory over Irish Point that was a little more convincing than the margin might suggest.</p><p>State Man was to some extent on a hiding to nothing, as he set off at 2-5 on ground that was expected to suit several rivals, and the strong stayer Irish Point in particular.

<p>Sorry/Not Sorry tells the story of the comedian’s sexual misconduct through the eyes of the women who spoke out – and endured a vicious backlash from fans, podcasters and fellow standups</p><p>Caroline Suh was once a huge fan of Louis CK, the comedian known for his semi-autobiographical sitcom, Louie, and a style of standup that explored his own worst impulses. Then, in 2017, the New York Times published allegations of sexual misconduct, specifically that he had masturbated in front of colleagues, which CK admitted was true. Suh, an American film-maker, says: “My immediate reaction was honestly, ‘Is it that bad?’ In my generation, when we were coming up, we saw a lot of bad behaviour and it was like, ‘That’s just the way it is.’”</p><p>Shortly afterwards, in a statement, CK said: “At the time, I said to myself that what I did was OK because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you

Since the pandemic in 2020, the year I moved out of the category of young adulthood, my Instagram “for you” page has been filled with images and videos of the cutest babies you could ever hope to see. Round-cheeked and smiley, they drool and babble and fall haphazardly on their faces when they fart, or smile when they fart, or just fart very loudly. It’s adorable.</p><p>As someone who, at 30, hasn’t been around many actual babies, and has only a couple of close friends who have embarked on parenthood thus far, this online exposure has been transformative.

For the film, Patel’s directorial debut, it took years of laboring to get his passion project to screen. Production was underway in Batam, Indonesia, before Covid, and then “everything that could go wrong, did”, as Patel said at its SXSW premiere on Monday night – delays, movie purgatory, a distribution deal with Netflix that did not realize the dream of having his ambitious action flick debut in theaters.</p><p>And then came Jordan Peele, who felt the movie deserved the big-screen treatment and rescued it from the straight-to-streaming slush pile for a theatrical release through his production company’s deal

When I interviewed him in 2012, over shepherd’s pie at the Groucho Club, he described himself as being a “song creature all my life”. The best tracks by World Party, whom he fronted, sound like a man trying to cram all the love and joy of his own fandom into four minutes, to distil the essence of Bob Dylan, Prince, the Rolling Stones, Sly Stone, Van Morrison, the Beach Boys, perhaps above all the Beatles, into one bubbling, funky, heartfelt and slightly ramshackle homebrew.</p><p>Wallinger, who has died aged 66, pulled it off more than a few times.

<p>Sensual study of Chengdu’s underground club scene follows unselfconscious clubbers, performers and musicians through their neon-detailed nights</p><p>Ben Mullinkosson is a film-maker and skateboarder from Chicago who brings an effortless, freewheeling intimacy to this immersive and sensual study of the underground club scene in Chengdu in central China. The title is enigmatic, but it seems to refer to the imminent closure of a club called Funky Town where his subjects have been hanging out; the darkness is the club’s darkness, which is enfolding and welcoming and reassuring, a neon-detailed night in which nothing matters but youth, beauty and the pleasure of the moment.</p><p>Mullinkosson is utterly at home and embedded with his group of friends – clubbers, performers, musicians – with whom he hangs out while they (utterly unselfconsciously) get very drunk; and in fact the spectacle of people throwing up in the street becomes a bit of a motif. He isolates a very strange se

They were full of laughter and silliness and brilliant stories,” says Whalley, best known as lead guitarist of anarcho-punk band Chumbawamba.</p><p>The result was We’re Not Going Back, which follows three sisters in a pit village.

You still pay for essentials, such as your mortgage and utility bills – the focus is on cutting out any extra spending on unnecessary items, whether it’s takeaway coffees, clothes or impulse buys.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/mar/12/how-to-succeed-at-the-no-spend-challenge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A seven-year-old boy hits the trail of the bad guys with guns in this family movie which has lots for curious kids to pick up on, even if the PG jeopardy pulls no punches</p><p>An unwritten rule of kids’ movies is that they should include a worthy message to ram down little throats – like broccoli dipped into cod liver oil. (Any message will do: kindness, friendship and the importance of believing in yourself are popular choices.) What’s different about this fun, warm-hearted family adventure set in Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland) is that its messages touch on genuine, real-world issues. It’s adapted from a children’s novel by German author Kirsten Boie but is mostly English language with some lovely, natural performances by the young cast.</p><p>A detective story, it follows kids on the trail of rhino poachers.

Blunt, who appeared in Oppenheimer and was nominated for best supporting actress, and Gosling, the now legendary Ken in Barbie, traded a few gags at the microphone, but there was no getting away from the reality: as far as the Oscars were concerned, the A-bomb film had nuked the walking-talking-doll movie.</p><p>A winner in seven categories including best film, best director and best actor, Oppenheimer is the first authentic blockbuster to dominate the Academy Awards since The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King in 2004.

<p><strong>Polka theatre, London<br /></strong>A hip-hop take on the tragedy finds the feud blowing up on social media and the balcony scene remixed for FaceTime but it lacks pathos</p><p>Two hours’ stage traffic becomes one in this modern hip-hop take on Shakespeare, designed for children from Year 5 upwards and set in the Polka’s borough of Merton.
