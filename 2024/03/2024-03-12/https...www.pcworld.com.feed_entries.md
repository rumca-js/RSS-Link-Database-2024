<p>Virtual private networks, or VPNs, are one of the most effective ways to stay safe online. Not only do they allow you to stay anonymous, but they can help you to get past region blocks on streaming services such as Netflix. However, you usually have to pay for a VPN subscription and adding an extra monthly expense to an already tight budget isn&rsquo;t ideal. That&rsquo;s where a free VPN can come in handy. They can provide you with a similar level of security for virtually&mdash;pun intended&mdash;nothing. But not all free VPNs are built the same.</p>



<p>With many free VPNs you&rsquo;ll encounter a lot of restrictions such as speed constraints, bandwidth caps, or a limited country network. These restrictions can add up, making the experience of using a free VPN feel pointless. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important that you choose the right free VPN s

<p>Mechanical keyboards have been around almost as long as personal computers, and the basic switch technology we&rsquo;re still using first popped up in the 1980s. But it&rsquo;s not an exaggeration to say that mechanical boards have never been as popular, or as stunningly variable, as they are right now. If you&rsquo;re just getting into the craze, you might feel paralyzed by the number of options available.</p>



<p>Allow us to remove some of the questioning and doubt. Below are the best mechanical keyboards we&rsquo;ve reviewed, in a variety of categories&mdash;best overall, on a budget, for gaming, wireless, et cetera. Not everything makes the list &mdash; for example, though G.Skill&rsquo;s KM250 is a shockingly good deal, we can&rsquo;t say the same for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2075430/g-skill-km360-keyboard-review.html" rel="norefer

<p>Last month Nvidia released <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2244895/nvidia-app-beta-unifies-nvidia-control-panel-and-geforce-experience.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a beta version of a new self-titled app</a>, intended to completely replace GeForce Experience and incorporate at least some of the features of the long-running Nvidia Control Panel. PCWorld&rsquo;s Will Smith goes hands-on with the new Nvidia App in our latest YouTube video. </p>



<p>Will, and no doubt a few other Nvidia users, appreciate that you don&rsquo;t need to log into this app in order to access its features, which is more than you can say for GeForce Experience. But it&rsquo;s also pretty decent on its own. The homescreen includes your most often-played games and a selection of links to relevant Nvidia services like GeForce Now and Nvidia Broadcast, thou

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface series has become something of the standard-bearer for Windows laptops&hellip;and boy, don&rsquo;t they know it. While the hardware is generally well-received, its pricing is not, running a few hundred bucks above even the best of the competition. But today you can get a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/276340988746?&amp;xcust=2-1-2263533-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">refurbished Surface Laptop 4 (with some reassuring warranties) for just $499.99</a>. </p>



<p>While this is the last-gen Surface Laptop design in its 13.5-inch frame, the machine is no slouch. Along with an 11th-gen Core i5 processor, it&rsquo;s packing 16GB of RAM, which I would consider the minimum for smoothly running the latest Windows 11 builds, and a gener

<p>There is always room for improvement: The manufacturers of the three major browsers Chrome, Edge, and Firefox have been working on the settings for data protection and security for years. </p>



<p>New features are constantly being added to the corresponding options and offer ever more precise choices. This is because the trend is clearly moving towards more protection against tracking and more shielded privacy.</p>



<p>For many users, however, the current browsers do not go far enough. This is because much more is already technically possible, as demonstrated by the large number of extensions for better data protection and anonymous surfing on the internet. They want a browser that protects them from being spied on as they surf the internet by default.</p>
