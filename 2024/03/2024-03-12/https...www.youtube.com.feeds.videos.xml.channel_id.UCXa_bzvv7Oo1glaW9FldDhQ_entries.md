Among the many classic gaming franchises, GSC Game World's S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is perhaps one of the most underrated. Though it's working hard on the upcoming sequel, its trilogy of classics has mostly been relegated to history. Until now, that is.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone Trilogy packs S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chornobyl, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat into one package with a few extra additions. The visuals have seen some slight improvements, including enhanced performance, there are and new control settings. By and large, however, this is the same trilogy that fans know and love.

Though some quirks remain, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone Trilogy is an excellent way to experience the classics. From its uniquely horrifying mood to the compelling survival sandbox, it prompts a new appreciation for the series.

Another month, another title courting some controversy for "only" offering a 30 FPS frame rate. This month, it's Dragon's Dogma 2.

Launching on March 22nd for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC, it offers everything that players of open world games could want. A larger world, over a thousand NPCs whose actions can influence the overall state of the narrative. Unique events can occur. Suffice it to say, there is a lot for players to sink their teeth into.

However, some focus on its uncapped frame rate, which will deliver around or above 30 FPS. Is it a big deal?
