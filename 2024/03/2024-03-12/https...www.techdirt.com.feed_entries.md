After hearing consecutive FBI directors (James Comey, Chris Wray) drone on and on about how device and communication encryption are nudging us ever closer to the criminal apocalypse, it&#8217;s kind of refreshing to hear from someone else equally as misguided. An op-ed written by Steven Wasserman recently appeared at The Hill. Wasserman opens his piece [&#8230;]

We’ve documented in detail how the whole AT&#38;T–&#62;Time Warner–&#62;Warner Brothers Discovery merger process&#160;has been a pointless mess, resulting in no limits of layoffs and damage to the underlying brands.
