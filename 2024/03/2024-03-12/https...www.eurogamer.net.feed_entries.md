Footage of a purportedly cancelled co-operative live-service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac - titled Spider-Man: The Great Web - has appeared online following last year's ransomware attack targeting the developer and its employees.
</p><p>
The trailer (narrated by Yuri Lowenthal, the voice of Insomniac's Peter Parker) points to a five-player co-op Spider-Man game featuring various multiverse incarnations of the character - including Gwen Stacey, Spider-Man 2099, and Scarlet Spider, alongside Peter Parker and Miles Morales - who would go up against the Sinister Six in an open-world Manhattan.
</p><p>
Spider-Man: The Great Web first came to light following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devastating-leak-lays-bare-spider-man-developer-insomniacs-plans-for-the-next-decade">last year's ransomware atta

Discord has announced that, starting on 18th March, it'll be providing third-party developers with the tools to create games and apps that can be embedded and played on its platform.
</p><p>
The move marks an extension of Discord's Activities initiative that <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord">launched last December</a>, offering a limited number of embedded games and interactive experiences users could engage with together on the platform.
</p><p>
Initially, 19 Activities were available to users, but Discord is now looking to significantly expand that by giving third-party developers the tools - in the form of its newly announced Embedded App SDK - to create their own.

Tobias Sj&ouml;gren has been removed from his role as CEO of developer Starbreeze after the company's board concluded the studio "needs a different leadership" to execute its current business strategy. The announcement follows a disastrous launch for last year's Payday 3, which is still struggling to attract players in significant numbers.
</p><p>
Starbreeze's board announced Sj&ouml;gren's removal in a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/2024-03-12-juergen-goeldner-appointed-as-interim-ceo-of-starbreeze/">note to investors</a>, adding that board member - and former CEO of Focus Home interactive - Juergen Goeldner would be serving as interim CEO as the recruitment process for a permanent replacement gets underway.

Developer Nightdive Studios' acclaimed remake of cult-classic sci-fi horror System Shock is - following a successful release on PC last year - making its way to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on 21st May.
</p><p>
Despite a bit of a bumpy road to release, the System Shock remake impressed on its arrival in 2023, giving Looking Glass Technologies' 1994 immersive sim - which sees players grappling with a malevolent AI onboard the Citadel Station deep in space - a finely judged overhaul.
</p><p>
"Nightdive doesn't take the Capcom or Square Enix approach with this remake; they're actually pretty uncompromising in their mission to update the original," Eurogamer contributor Kaan Serin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-review-shodan-steals-the-show-in-this-faithful-remake">

Children of the Sun, the indie puzzle shooter where you have to take out encampments of cultists using only one bullet, will launch for PC on 9th April. 
</p><p>
You can give the game a go right now via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309950/Children_of_the_Sun/">Steam demo</a>, which was one of the highlights of the most recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-next-fest-is-back-and-now-underway-with-hundreds-of-playable-pc-demos">Steam Next Fest</a>. The game has grungey neon visuals and boasts some brainteasing levels - but its the just-one-more-go gameplay that really makes the experience stand out. 
</p><p>
With just one bullet in your rifle's chamber, you need to re-aim and curve shots in mid-flight to zig-zag around levels, through cultists and wildlife, without losing focus.

Production artwork for the Super Mario Bros. Movie shows a number Mushroom Kingdom characters who didn't make it into the final film - including Princess Daisy, Toadette, Eurogamer favourite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/who-is-birdo">Birdo</a>, and the loyal Toadsworth.
</p><p>
The artwork, created by freelance veteran Jed Diffenderfer, was recently spotted after being uploaded to his <a href="https://www.jeddiffenderfer.com/film">website</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/new-mario-movie-concept-art-shows-princess-daisy-in-action">Nintendo Life</a>).

Diffenderfer states he worked as a story artist on the Super Mario Bros. Movie project from 2018 to 2020 - so it's likely that some of the artwork he created dates from early on in the project, before certain na

Elden Ring originally had a different starting point that had players washing up on a beach in Limgrave.
</p><p>
At the beginning of FromSoftware's epic, players battle the Grafted Scion and, whether they win or lose, then fall to their death before waking up in the Stranded Graveyard and exploring the Cave of Knowledge.
</p><p>
It turns out, though, this wasn't always the case, as dataminer Sekiro Dubi has discovered.

Using a combination of a Microsoft Store discount code and the current discounted prices on CDKeys for Microsoft gift cards, you can net yourself substantial savings on both of Microsoft's current gen consoles. Arguably the better deal here is on the Xbox Series X for just under &pound;300, netting you a &pound;120 saving on the refurb price, while the Xbox Series S is available for &pound;149, saving you nearly &pound;70 on the &pound;210 list price.</p><p>The principle for redeeming both of these discounts is the same - as opposed to paying for the Series X or Series S by means of a card or PayPal, you can load up Microsoft gift cards onto your account to give you a balance equal to the amount of the console's pur

The Episode Aigis expansion for Persona 3 Reload has been developed in response to fan feedback, though there's no chance of a female protagonist in the future.

At last week's Xbox Partner Preview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-3-reload-gets-the-answer-after-all">Atlus announced an expansion pass for the remake</a>, including the much-requested epilogue The Answer.

You can prioritise your most-loved companions over any real strategic logic. Heck, I sometimes just pick the characters who I <em>think</em> look cute together, regardless of whether they've spent any on-screen time together. Unicorn Overlord is a strategy RPG <em>all</em> about that lovely party tinkering, and this time, the cast is instead as big as one of those animated sitcoms that have been on air across a couple centuries.</p><p>That almost sounds like too much to manage, but I promise it's not. Unicorn Overlord starts small. The evil Zenoiran Empire sweeps through a high fantasy world, seizing large swaths o
