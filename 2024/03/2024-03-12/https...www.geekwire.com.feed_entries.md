Police Department is deploying a new tool in its fight against illicit drugs. The agency announced Tuesday that it&#8217;s using a handheld narcotics analyzer called TruNarc that can scan through transparent packaging and identify the chemical composition of more than 530 controlled substances, such as fentanyl, methamphetamine, and heroin. TruNarc uses technology called Raman spectroscopy, in which a laser light beam interacts with the chemical bonds of a material. The device allows officers to quickly identify drugs without disturbing packaging, contaminating evidence or being exposed to harmful substances. The analyzer captures all scan results, including time and&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/in-fight-against-fentanyl-and-other-drugs-police-departments-deploy-handheld-narc

Friedman, a 20-year vet of the tech giant, is a corporate vice president leading design and research across Microsoft, including on its AI products. His skills came in handy on &#8220;Max &#38; The Purple Anxiety Monster,&#8221; a new book that his 13-year-old son wrote about coping with his anxious feelings. Friedman created all of the illustrations for the book using Dall-E, the generative AI program from OpenAI that can create images from text prompts.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-design-exec-turns-to-ai-to-illustrate-sons-book-about-coping-with-anxiety/">Read More</a>
