In today's Daily Fix:
Stig Asmussen, director of the hit game Star Wars Jedi and its sequel, announced last year that he was leaving Respawn Entertainment. Now, Asmussen has unveiled his new project: the game studio Giant Skull, who are working on a new narrative-focused single-player AAA title. Asmussen knows a thing or two about making great narrative-focused single-player AAA titles, so we can't wait to see what this games turns out to be. In other news, the Helldivers 2 devs at Arrowhead have adjusted the spawn rate of the Terminid Charger and Bile Titan enemy types. You may not see so many spawn at once (but you might see more of other enemy types), and the Charger's head is a little weaker now. And finally, huge congratulations to the Monster Hunter World team at Capcom, for selling over 25 million copies of the game since its launch in 2018. It's also the series' 20th anniversary this month.

In today's Daily Fix:
Shawn Leydon, former president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America, has admitted this major weakness in big-budget exclusive games: their exclusivity. Game production budgets have ballooned in recently years, with titles like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 costing Sony around $300 million. Since the game was a PS5 exclusive, Sony needed to sell roughly 7 million copies just to break even. Seems smart to release those types of games on multiple platforms like PC. In other news, Helldivers 2 devs are getting just as tired of players being kicked for not having the right loadout as the players are, and they're soliciting ideas from the public. And finally, PUBG is getting a facelift, moving to Unreal Engine 5 and getting destructible environments.

Science-fiction nerds and IMAX enthusiasts rejoice, because Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part 2 (review) has already made big waves on its opening weekend, securing a CinemaScore grade of A, a 93% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and pulling in a global total of $178.5 million – a massive jump over its predecessor’s opening weekend gross. In fact, that’s nearly half of what the first film made in its entire run. With numbers like these and excellent reviews, it looks like Warner Bros. has a breakout sequel on its hands, and the chances of a third film happening in Villeneuve’s proposed trilogy – adapting the second book in Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi series, Dune Messiah – appear to be brighter than ever.

But amidst all the accolades, there’s a gnawing sense that whatever flaws Dune: Part 2 may possess, they’re being completely ignored in favor of many film fans already proclaiming it as one of the greatest science-fiction movies of all time, and potentially as a savior of ci
