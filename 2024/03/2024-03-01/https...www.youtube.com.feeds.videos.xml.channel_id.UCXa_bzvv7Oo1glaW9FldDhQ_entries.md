So, between these two action RPGs, which game delivers the better combat? Here, that’s exactly the question that we’re looking to tackle.

A lot has happened in 2024, and March has only just begun. In a period that's seen the launch of Tekken 8, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, the success of Palworld and Helldivers 2 are probably the most surprising successes.

They're even more noteworthy given the more disappointing titles, like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and Skull and Bones. While budgets play a part, there's also a difference in approach and vision compared to simply following trends and company mandates.

Of course, developing something the team wants is the way instead of falling back on massive budgets and triple-A production values in the service of a trend. Check out why Palworld and Helldivers 2 became so successful and a few lessons Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and Skull and Bones could learn from them.
