<div>Beat Saber&#8217;s next music pack will bring one of the most influential names in electronic music to the game&#8217;s library of downloadable content: Daft Punk.

<div>According to a report from The Information, Google and Meta held a meeting late last year wherein the two companies discussed the possibility of bringing Android XR to Meta headsets.
