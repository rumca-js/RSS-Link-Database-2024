Thursday night, a brightly shining, tech-infused tree in front of the Husky Union Building got a jump on nature. BECU, in partnership with the UW, unveiled the 12-foot-tall work of art in a promotion aimed at symbolizing the credit union&#8217;s &#8220;commitment to supporting the UW community&#8217;s financial well-being.&#8221; The colorful specimen features 550 3D-printed blossoms with LED lights and about 1,200 laser-cut mirrored mylar leaves that flutter and reflect the illumination source.
