<p>Meta is starting to bring the Threads API online, though it will still be some time before it’s widely accessible to developers. The company has begun testing its new developer tools with a handful of companies, Meta engineer Jesse Chen shared in <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@0xjessel/post/C3-0Ci3pU1v"><ins>a post</ins></a> on Threads.</p>
<p>According to Chen, whose post was first <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/01/threads-says-it-will-make-its-api-broadly-available-by-june/">spotted by</a> <em>TechCrunch</em>, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-head-says-threads-is-working-on-an-api-for-developers-140049094.html"><ins>the API</ins></a> is currently in “beta” but a wider rollout could come “by the end of June.” The initial group of companies testing out the beta version of the API include social media management platforms Sprinklr, Hootsuite, Social News Desk and Sprout Soci

<p>Apple has walked back its decision to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-confirms-home-screen-web-apps-will-no-longer-work-on-european-ios-devices-112527560.html">remove home screen web apps in the European Union (EU</a>). After initially blaming its decision to ditch them on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">Digital Markets Act’s (DMA)</a> requirement to support non-WebKit browsers, Apple now says European users will return to enjoying the same web app experience from before when iOS 17.4 arrives early this month.</p>
<p>“We have received requests to continue to offer support for Home Screen web apps in iOS, therefore we will continue to offer the existing Home Screen web apps capability in the EU,” Apple wrote Friday in an updated <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#dev-qa">developer support document</a>. “This support means Home Screen web app

<p>I knew what I was getting into when I sat down for a press screening of <em>Dune Part 2</em>: A towering sci-fi epic best viewed on an enormous theater screen, just like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dune-movie-review-cinema-hbo-max-173051367.html#:~:text=This%20latest%20Dune%20adaptation%20isn,over%20half%20a%20century%20ago."><ins>Denis Villeneuve's first </ins><em><ins>Dune</ins></em><ins> film</ins></a>. What I didn't realize was that it would also give me a serious back massage — it really does kick butt. That was my experience at an Atlanta-area AMC, where the film whipped the Dolby Cinema seats into such a frenzy that, for one thrilling sequence, I felt like I was actually riding a sandworm plowing through the spice-filled desert of Arrakis.</p>
<p>Now, I can't guarantee you'll have the same ride at a normal theater (unless the subwoofer is cranked up obscenely high). What makes AMC's Dolby Cinema locations unique is that they feature rumbling transducers in eve

<p>This week, Adobe revealed an experimental audio AI tool to join its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobes-firefly-ai-is-now-commercially-available-on-photoshop-illustrator-and-express-130049419.html">image-based ones in Photoshop</a>. Described by the company as “an early-stage generative AI music generation and editing tool,” Adobe’s Project Music GenAI Control can create music (and other audio) from text prompts, which it can then fine-tune in the same interface.</p>
<p>Adobe frames the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobes-next-gen-firefly-2-offers-vector-graphics-more-control-and-photorealistic-renders-160030349.html">Firefly-based</a> technology as a creative ally that — unlike generative audio experiments like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-opens-up-access-to-its-text-to-music-ai-202251175.html">Google’s MusicLM</a> — goes a step further and skips the hassle of moving the output to external apps like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pro-tools-subscri

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/spotify/"><ins>Spotify</ins></a> has <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-03-01/spotifys-new-audiobooks-access-tier-gives-booklovers-more-listening-options/"><ins>added another subscription option</ins></a>. This time around, it's offering a plan that has little to do with music. The Audiobooks Access Tier (which is US-only for now) offers 15 hours of audiobook listening each month for $10. You'll have access to Spotify's library of more than 200,000 titles You can, of course, still listen to ad-supported music via Spotfy's free tier.</p>
<p>At first glance, it might seem odd for Spotify to offer an audiobook-only tier at this price. Spotify Premium, which costs $11 per month, has the same 15 hours of audiobook listening time as well as other perks. However, audiobooks often take somewhere in the realm of between seven and 11 hours to listen to.</p>

<p><em>Axios</em>, a site known for political analysis and extensive use of bullet points, has joined the ranks of pundits fawning over  Mark Zuckerberg’s <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/29/mark-zuckerberg-robot-brand-senate-posts">PR strategy</a>. The Meta CEO, they claim, is (as originally headlined) "having a PR moment" which is "casting a halo effect on the company itself." That's obviously untrue, but let's say it in a format more likely to reach <em>Axios's </em>audience.</p>
<p><strong>The big picture: </strong>Zuckerberg’s recent PR blitz is neither out of character nor a sign of a freshly rehabbed image. In fact, Meta and Zuckerberg are staring down one of the biggest crises they’ve ever faced.</p>

<p>It’s 1995, and I’m trying to watch a video on the internet. I entered the longest, most complex URL I’d ever seen into AOL’s web browser to view a trailer for Paul W.S. Anderson’s long-awaited film adaptation of <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. I found it in an issue of <em>Electronic Gaming Monthly</em>, tucked away in the bottom of a full-page ad for the film. Online marketing at the time was such an afterthought, studios didn’t even bother grabbing short and memorable web addresses for their major releases, let alone dedicated websites. (<a href="https://movies.trekcore.com/generations/originalsite/generationswebsite.pdf"><em>Star Trek Generations</em></a> and <em>Stargate</em> were among the few early exceptions.)</p>
<p>After the interminable process of transcribing the URL from print, I gathered my family around our Packard Bell PC (powered by an Intel 486 DX and, let’s say, 8MB of RAM), hit return and waited as the video slowly came down our 33.6kbps dial-up connection. And

<p>This Saturday, on March 2, 2024, Engadget turns 20. Originally founded by Peter Rojas — you can read more about those early days <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-03-the-birth-of-engadget.html">here</a> — the site has had eight editors-in-chief and, to my count, seven parent organizations to answer to. What started as a truly influential tech blog has morphed into a media organization aiming to break news, give no-BS buying advice and highlight the stories in tech that matter. We have written millions of words, we've won awards and we’ve somehow survived several media apocalypses. It’s been a ride — and if you’ve been with us since the start, we salute you.</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, our team has been thinking about how the tech industry has changed over the past two decades. At the heart of our anniversary package is a collection of over a dozen retrospectives of seminal gadgets and apps that did not exist 20 years ago, illustrated by the brilliant <a href="http

The company plans to lay off 15 percent of its workforce — nearly 200 people — as it shifts from a direct-to-consumer to a Dealer Partner model. The company is halting all investments in upcoming models and will resume only if in partnership with another automaker.</p>
<p>The company's fourth-quarter revenue increased to $200.1 million from $128.3 million in Q3. However, its gross margin was negative 35 percent, and it lost $1.23 per share.

We’ve lost some amazing colleagues, but we’re still here aiming to deliver the best tech coverage possible. As for this week’s news, we chat about the reported death of Apple’s “Project Titan” EV car project. It never felt quite real, but it still would have been fun to see.</p>
<p>Here’s a hot take: Maybe the Apple Car felt redundant since Tesla basically built it already. Say what you will about Elon Musk today, but Tesla certainly disrupted the car industry in all of the ways we’d expect Apple to. Agree? Disagree?</p>

Don’t get us wrong: Joy-Cons are perfectly serviceable, but there are more customizable options out there and controllers that will suit certain games better.  Whether you want a better grip when you’re battling armies of Bokoblins in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, or you want affordable and comfortable spares for impromptu <em>Mario Kart</em> competitions with friends, you have plenty of options. We’ve tested a bunch of controllers over the years and these are the best Switch controllers you can get right now.</p>
