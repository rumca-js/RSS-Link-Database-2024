								<p>The biggest of the Lego Donkey Kong sets, <strong>Diddy Kong’s Mine Cart ride</strong> takes a while to build, but includes Lego iterations of two of the series' most beloved characters and pays tribute to one of the most iconic types of level. It delights me endlessly that you can just walk into any toy store and find this on the shelf.</p>

								<p>The <strong>DnD Cleric 5e</strong> is one of the most powerful and streamlined classes in Dungeons and Dragons. Often pigeonholed as an 'armored support' character or discounted as a tiresome, holy goody-two-shoes, the<strong> 5e Cleric </strong>is actually one of the most versatile options adventurers can pick. After tasting that sweet power rush from smiting all the sinners, it's a class you'll struggle to let go of.</p>

								<p><strong>Classified: France ‘44</strong> may appear to be a tactical squad-based <strong>WW2 game</strong> in the vein of Commandos or Silent Storm with lashings of XCOM slathered on top, but that’s not <em>all</em> it is. Instead, Classified: France ‘44 aims high, setting out to explore an authentic story of war, told by soldiers fighting behind enemy lines in a pivotal but little-known theater of World War 2. Developer Absolutely Games has served up a surprising amount to chew on; thankfully, we at Wargamer are a hungry lot.</p>
