<p>Bizarre circumstances behind George Galloway’s sweeping victory makes implications for national politics unclear</p><p>The Rochdale byelection was an extraordinary electoral event. Not only did the combined share of the vote for the Conservatives and Labour drop by 63 percentage points – the worst result for the big two since the wartime byelections of 1941-45 – but the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Reform UK all slipped as well. However, Rochdale’s circumstances were so bizarre that one must be careful when drawing general conclusions about the implications for national electoral politics.</p><p>The stereotype of Rochdale is that it is a deprived Labour stronghold. Although the town does struggle with social problems, the constituency includes some prosperous suburban and rural areas to the east of the town. Rochdale’s electoral history is varied and volatile. Labour has faced competition from the Lib Dems, who held the seat in 1972-97 and 2005-10. In 2015 the Lib Dem vot

It’s the sort of thing for which you definitely think about what you are going to wear, but also don’t want to look like you have spent ages getting really dressed up.</p><p>Anyway, I glanced around the room at what people were wearing, and it dawned on me that every single one of the 10 or 12 women present was wearing trousers. Not a dress, not a skirt, not jeans, but trousers. Lots of different kinds of trousers: wide

As a family, we didn’t have much money and would make the most of the secondhand stores. A lot of people think these shops are dirty, smelly and full of junk people don’t want – but to me they are treasure troves.</p><p>In 2014 I got married, and my partner and I were trying to furnish our first rented apartment. I had worked three jobs to put myself through college, and money had always&nbsp;been a strain. I found homeware shops so stressful, I even cried in one: everything was so expensive and it felt impossible to buy anything. I ended up going to secondhand stores and was shocked at what people had given away. I found $3,000 sofas being sold for $100, midcentury candlesticks and retro dining tables with chairs from the 80s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar
