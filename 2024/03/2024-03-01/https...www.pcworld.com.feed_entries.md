<p>Friendly fire has been a personal scourge ever since it turned me off in Tom Clancy&rsquo;s original <em>Rainbow Six</em>, where I quickly got tired of waiting five minutes to respawn after being mowed down by over-enthusiastic teammates in the first five seconds of each match. Games franchises like <em>Counter-Strike</em> have taken some meaning away from what was originally meant to make gameplay a multifaceted experience, turning friendly fire into a mere penalty for bad play rather than an incentive to develop skill. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/&amp;xcust=2-1-2251042-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"><em>Helldivers 2</em> </a>isn&rsquo;t the kind of game I expected to change the status quo on that, with its gritty attitude and extensi

<p>Ransomware is nasty stuff. This type of malware encrypts files on your PC so that you can&rsquo;t access them&mdash;unless you must pay the attacker to unlock the data. In other words, your files are held hostage until you cough up the demanded ransom.</p>



<p>The best defense against ransomware is avoiding sites and downloads riddled with it, but you can take other protective measures, too. Modern antivirus software often restrict which apps can change files in folders commonly targeted by ransomware. Microsoft Defender, which is built into Windows, can do this too. (Microsoft changed the name from Windows Defender several years ago, but it&rsquo;s the same program.) Some antivirus suites also run automatic backups, in case you need to restore your files.</p>



<p>The catch? Unlike third-party antivirus software, these extra safeguards are <em>not</e

<p>Buying an HDMI cable should be simple&mdash;but some cables don&rsquo;t perform as expected, while others don&rsquo;t clearly indicate the HDMI specifications supported.</p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t have time to dig into the details yourself, use this guide to grab the right cable for your needs. We&rsquo;ve sorted it by HDMI specification (also known as HDMI version), so you can find an instant, affordable match. Our picks also sidestep the problems you might encounter when hunting on your own, be it cheaply made cables that perform poorly or overpriced ones that do nothing better than less expensive alternatives.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Need a cable to use with a high-refresh monitor, especially one above 144Hz? We generally recommend using a DisplayPort cable instead of HDMI&mdash;look for one rated for DisplayPort 1.4 or higher.
