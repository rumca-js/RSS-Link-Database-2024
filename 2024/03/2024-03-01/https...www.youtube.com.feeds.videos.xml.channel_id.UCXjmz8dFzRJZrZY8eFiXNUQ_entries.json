Whether it's the original David Lynch Dune adaptation from 1984, or the current iteration of Dune from Denis Villeneuve, it seems some sacrifices need to be made to bring the novel to theaters.      Denis Villeneuve may have gotten the closest, but after all these adaptations of Dune, it seems the book might be unadaptable in it's truest form. \n\n#dune #duneparttwo #timotheechalamet #nerdstalgic \n\nSources:\nhttps://variety.com/2016/film/news/denis-villeneuve-dune-reboot-legendary-pictures-12\n01929280/\nhttps://www.slashfilm.com/556802/denis-villeneuve-dune-remake-two-films/", "date_published": "2024-03-01T18:00:33+00:00", "source_obj__id": 236, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJOUHEJTmrc", "comments": [], "age": null, "language": null, "bookmarked": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXjmz8dFzRJZrZY8eFiXNUQ", "vote": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "title": "Why Dune Was Considered Unadaptable", "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": "Nerdstalgic", "user": null, "tags": []}]
