We’ve got some casting announcements for HBO’s The Last of Us series. Actors Danny Ramirez, Ariela Barer, Tati  Gabrielle, and Spencer Lord are joining the series as Manny, Mel, Nora and Owen, respectively. Those actor names might not be too familiar to you, but they collectively have very impressive resumes, not to mention how closely they resemble their respective characters. In The Last of Us Part 2 video game, Manny is a loyal soldier, Mel is a young doctor, Nora works in the healthcare sector as a military medic, and Owen is an optimistic member of his respective group condemned to fight an enemy he doesn’t hate. Quite the internal conflict. And as you might remember from a few months ago, showrunner Craig Mazin gave fans an update on where they were in the process of finding the live-action version of Abby from The Last of Us Part 2: That role goes to actor Kaitlyn Dever. Abby’s the main antagonist in The Last of Us Part 2 whose motives for revenge might be justifiable

Join Moon Studios co-founders Thomas Mahler and Gennadiy Korol for a deep dive into No Rest for the Wicked, an upcoming action RPG. The team gives us a peek at the story, the hand-crafted world, the painting art style, the precision-based and animation-driven combat system and overcoming telegraphed attacks, various weapons and how enchantments impact weapons, runes, gear, and the soft class system.

We also get to see a fight against the boss called Warrick The Torn, and get a breakdown of the city of Sacrament, how you can build up this settlement, and get more services like a smithy and others. The video also showcases gathering resources, designing your home, and a look at No Rest for the Wicked's endgame called ALIVE. 

No Rest for the Wicked is heading to Steam Early Access on April 18, 2024, and it will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC at a later date.

## Helldivers 2 Fakes Are Popping Up on Steam - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
Helldivers 2 is a massive success for developer Arrowhead, and of course lazy devs are trying to capitalize on it by releasing fake versions with the same name on Steam. Valve has been quick to squash these fakes like the terminids they are, but Arrowhead is growing concerned about how these fakes end up on Steam with the Helldivers name in the first place. And that's not the only game suffering from impersonators; Palworld has its fair share of fakes popping up on Steam, too. In other news, Crash Bandicoot and Skylanders developer Toys for Bob is going indie. They've broken away from parent company Activision Blizzard and stepping out of the Call of Duty shadow, and now looking to go the indie route. Unfortunately, that means their Smash Bros.-esque Crash Team Rumble is getting its final batch of post-launch content with support for that game now ending. And finally, the physical editions of Baldur's Gate 3 will be available soon, with the Xbox Series X

Dune is one of those epic sci-fi novels that’s just too big to capture in one movie properly. With Dune: Part 2 hitting theaters, we’ve finally gotten the complete story of Paul Atreides and his rise to power as the Lisan al Gaib. Or have we? House Atreides may have gotten its revenge by the end of the movie, but it’s clear there’s a lot more story to tell where Paul and his family are concerned.

With that in mind, let’s break down the ending to Dune: Part 2 and where it leaves characters like Timothée Chalamet’s Paul, Zendaya’s Chani, and Florence Pugh’s Princess Irulan. Where does the story go from here, and why does it appear that these movies are diverging from the books? Here’s everything you need to know about the possible future of the franchise. 

Dune: Part 2 also stars Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler, Christopher Walken and Léa Seydoux. The film is currently playing in theaters.

The new Avatar: The Last Airbender series on Netflix brings the adventures of Aang (Gordon Cormier), Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley) into live-action (again), but as is the case with any adaptation, some key changes were made in the transition. IGN's Joshua Yehl compares the original animated series with the Netflix show and runs through the biggest differences that were made to the Book One: Water storyline, from action-packed flashbacks featuring Zuko (Dallas Liu) and Iroh (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee) to new rules for the Avatar State.

Splatoon 3: Side Order DLC reviewed by Logan Plant on Nintendo Switch.

With already excellent weapon variety and intense combat, Splatoon 3 is a perfect fit for a roguelite game mode. Side Order’s outstanding new enemies and powerful set of abilities result in the craziest combat power trips Splatoon has ever seen. It does occasionally stumble when implementing its roguelite elements, leading to some repetitive boss fights and poor pacing. But even with those issues, this DLC is still a blast. Add in another stellar soundtrack and a distinct style that sets it apart from the rest of the series, and Side Order is a worthwhile stop at the Splatoon 3 buffet.

Sons of the Forest reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC.

"Sons of the Forest takes everything its predecessor did well and does it a little bit better. And considering how much I enjoyed the original, I can easily recommend this strong follow-up. Exploring a huge, beautiful, deadly island through the changing seasons is a treat on its own. The new base building mechanics could entertain me for days without ever touching the main story. And to top it all off, we have smarter and more unsettling enemy behavior paired with thoughtfully improved combat. The technical polish and touched up story since its Early Access release round out what is easily one of my favorite open world survival crafting games ever."
