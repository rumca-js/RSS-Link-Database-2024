<p dir="ltr">It’s been a while since Street Fighter V made Ed a playable character, and he’s changed a bit since then. Still wreathed in Psycho power like Bison, he has slimmed down a bit aesthetically but his gameplay in Street Fighter 6 feels simultaneously more robust and more focused than his previous incarnation. What results is an incredibly fun, fluid, powerful character that is easy enough to pick up, but with plenty of depth for those who truly want to explore his potential.</p><p dir="ltr">During Capcom Cup X, I sat down for a play session with Ed and later spoke to SF6 Director Takayuki Nakayama and SF6 Producer Shuhei Matsumoto to learn more about bringing him back, and the team’s inspirations and goals with him.</p><p dir="ltr">“For [me] personally, he’s a very important character,” Nakayama-san said, “He’s kind of the reason why we have Modern controls… [and] World Tour... He has a very interesting story, and one of the main things [we] wanted to accomplish with

<p>Payday 3 developer Starbreeze has released the first of a series of patches collectively called Operation Medic Bag meant to rehab the troubled game. Today's patch adds fixes and features such as an unready button, DirectX12 support, a new hardcore cook-off challenge, and more.</p><p>According to the developer's <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/news/payday3/2024/02/operation-medicbag/">blog post</a>, future updates under the Operation Medic Bag initiative will include things like a solo mode, progression changes, a UI revamp, and other "new content."</p><p dir="ltr">Players will soon have the option to perform heists by themselves.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dune-part-two-review/1900-6418185/">Dune: Part Two</a> star Stellan Skarsgard is an actor we all know very well at this point--his career has been both prolific and varied, popping up in everything from mega-budgeted blockbusters like The Avengers to tiny art films like Nymphomaniac--as well as everything in between, like the Mama Mia movies. But these Dune flicks feature a particularly memorable role for Skaarsgard, because of the elaborate prosthetic suit he had to wear to portray the post-human, worm-like character. Imagine if Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars had begun his life as a regular human man and gradually altered himself into becoming a giant slug over time.

<p>No Rest For The Wicked--the action-RPG from Ori developer Moon Studios--will be available to play very soon. The studio has revealed it's coming to Steam Early Access on April 18, giving players the chance to check out its animation- and timing-based combat system, "soft class" system, and customizable hub city.</p><p>In a Wicked Inside presentation detailing the combat, early access plans, and endgame content, Moon Studios explained just how its approach to the action-RPG genre differs from other games. Combat draws inspiration from multiple sources, including fighting games, and it seems that a certain very popular series by From Software was an influence, as well. Spacing and timing are important to land hits, and the game's weapons all have bespoke animations to differentiate them from each other.</p><p>Rather than make you pick a set character class, No Rest For The Wicked uses a "soft class" system that encourages you to experiment and play the game the way you want.

<p>In one of the most memorable scenes of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Anakin Skywalker murders a bunch of Younglings as he plows down the path toward going fully evil and becoming Darth Vader. Actor Hayden Christensen has reflected on this scene, telling <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/hayden-christensen-star-wars-interview/">Empire</a> that director George Lucas made a "bold" call to put this into the movie, given the subject matter of killing kids.</p><p>Christensen said the scene was "shocking," and revealed that filming the sequence took time because the child actor in the scene, Ross Beadman, wasn't initially giving the kind of reaction that Lucas wanted. So Christensen amped things up.</p><p>"So I shouted, or growled at him, because we needed a genuine moment of him being startled. It got the response that we needed, and it makes that scene work really well," he said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hayden-christense

<p>Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part One was the sort of adaptation that might be considered <em>too </em>faithful to the source material, but that's not so much the case with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dune-part-two-review/1900-6418185/">Dune: Part Two</a>. The sequel, which adapts the remainder of the first Dune novel, does pretty accurately adapt the story into movie form. but it also adds some crucial pieces of character work that have always been missing from the book.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Warning: The following contains spoilers for the ending of Dune: Part Two.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Frank Herbert's style of writing isn't your typical prose--his approach is more abstract, like reading a textbook about this story more than reading the story itself. The result being that Dune, the book, doesn't really sketch out its characters as fully formed human beings. But Dune: Part Two, the movie, makes a very pointed attempt at changing that, particularly with Chani (Zenda

"I already did one day of shooting--it was technically day zero--but the chemistry that Bella and I have is so palpable. It's really nice to be able to work with someone like that," Merced said.</p><p>Season 2 of the TV series adapts at least some of the events of The Last of Us: Part II. Anyone who's played the game understands some of the drama to come.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-actress-discusses-palpable-chemistry-with-bella-ramsey/1100-6521511

<p>Fake Helldivers 2 games appeared on Steam this week, attempting to trick people out of their cash when they decided to purchase the popular game developed by Arrowhead. The studio and its growing community quickly caught wind of these scams, and it wasn't long before the fake listings were deactivated by Valve. While at least one of them is still up, the purchase options are not available.</p><p>"People posting as us trying to scam people is obviously very sad and frustrating, and for that as well as for security reasons we urge you to stay clear of them," Arrowhead's community manager wrote on the game's Discord server (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-responds-as-fake-games-appear-on-steam">Eurogamer</a>). "Again, the only two Helldivers 2 products we market are Helldivers 2 and Helldivers 2 Super Citizen Edition."</p><p>Another way to be sure that you're getting the real deal is to check the release date, developer, and publisher details on
