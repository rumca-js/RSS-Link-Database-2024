<p>Ben White’s reputation for ambivalence towards football cannot hide a burning desire to help Arsenal win the Premier League title</p><p>Mikel Arteta uses deep meditation or a good book to escape from the intensity of the title race but things are much simpler for Ben White. “That’s one of the best things I’m able to do,” the Arsenal defender says. “I know people say I don’t like football, but I go home and football is not on my mind. I can just be a normal person, relax. When I’m in here it is intense.”</p><p>So rather than watching Manchester City and Liverpool this weekend before Arsenal enter the fray again on Monday night at Sheffield United, White is more likely to get away from it all with a game of bat and ball or Uno against his wife. Just don’t expect him to make it easy for her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/01/ben-white-even-when-i-play-uno-with-my-wife-ill-do-everything-to-win">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Liberate rather than repress’: why corsets are having a fashion moment

<p>Designers can weaponise the garment to symbolise rebellion, or play and experiment with historical perceptions</p><p>Few garments are as bound up with controversy and body politics as the corset. Case in point: the furore this week surrounding pictures the actor Anya Taylor-Joy posted on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3ymTWaJP8_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Instagram</a> of herself wearing a corset, with an hourglass emoji caption.</p><p>The comments underneath gave a neat sample of the polarised thinking surrounding the much-maligned garment. “Can we not normalize starvation?” said one. “What a terrible, terrible thing to do to yourself or share with others,” said another. Others went in the other direction, from “There is such a misconception with corsets. Y’all relax,” to “Everyone is ‘body positivity!!!’ until it’s a skinny person in a corset,” or, pithily, just flame emojis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/mar/01

<p>Some winemakers have long been producing natural wines without shouting it from the rooftops, and they’re even stocked by the big high-street retailers</p><p>Can you find natural wine in the supermarket? The answer, as with most things in life, is complicated, and requires 500 words even to begin to explain. When “natural wine” – a loosely defined term referring to wine made without herbicides, pesticides or the use of sulphur – burst into the public consciousness several years ago, it polarised wine drinkers hugely. Those who have drunk the Kool-Aid and become devotees know exactly where to go to procure the stuff, whether that’s by supporting their favourite independent bottle shops or ordering from specialist e-tailers. But what if you’re rushing into Tesco after work and need to pick up something to drink along with your spaghetti hoops and tampons? Or if you don’t live in one of the UK’s main cities (gasp), and have access only to a supermarket for your wines? Is it p

<p>The president wants young voters to know he hasn’t given up on fixing student debt – but convincing them he has a decent track record is proving challenging</p><p>Maxwell Frost, the only Gen Z member of Congress, was front and center when Joe Biden announced last week that he was canceling $1.2bn of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/jan/19/more-student-debt-forgiven-biden-public-service-workers">student loan debt</a> for more than 150,000 Americans.</p><p>“President Biden knows that canceling student debt is an important issue for young people across our country,” said Frost, who has been a surrogate for Biden’s campaign. “The president’s actions on student debt are in stark contrast with Donald Trump, who spent his entire time in office sabotaging efforts to aid borrowers who are just trying to make ends meet.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/mar/01/biden-student-debt-young-voters-2024-election">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(International Anthem)</strong><br />In this solo project the stalwart of London’s jazz and improv scene is joined by a rolling cast of percussionists to create hypnotic, haunting patterns and demented nursery rhymes</p><p>Over the past two decades you might have seen Italian-born bassist Ruth Goller playing with dozens of line-ups at the punkier end of London’s jazz and improv scene. She’s performed with Acoustic Ladyland, Melt Yourself Down, Sons of Kemet and Let Spin, and featured with artists as diverse as Alabaster DePlume, Marc Ribot, Rokia Traoré and Damon Albarn, usually playing intricate, wiry basslines on her short-scale Mustang bass guitar, using a plectrum.</p><p>This solo project, however, sees her creating a very different sonic world. Here she taps out repeated, hypnotic patterns on a detuned bass to create haunting harmonics – dull, resonant, unearthly clangs that can sound like gamelans, temple gongs or steel pans.

<p><strong>(Mute)<br /></strong>The avant garde musician’s first album in seven years features cinematic ambience, pummelling sound design and whinnying metal guitar</p><p>Iceland-based Australian composer Ben Frost has the portfolio career of most avant garde musicians, dividing his time between scores for film, TV and video games while also making opera and art installations. An album project seems almost quaint, but his first in seven years houses some of his very best work.</p><p>Frost has long tended towards symphonic grandeur, disrupting it with punkish guitar, glitching electronics and spooky sound design – with occasional spells of bluster or self-seriousness. But Scope Neglect undercuts that by centring the gnarly tongue-out riffs used by metal bands, played by prog-metal guitarist Greg Kubacki. Frost gave Kubacki and bassist Liam Andrews fully fledged orchestrations to guide the emotion of their playing – and then removed those orchestrations from the finished recor

<p>A botanist goes in search of the vast, stinking Rafflesia in its natural habitat</p><p>If you think of flowers as beautiful, fragrant, decorous and domesticated – something you order from an online florist or pick up at your local garden centre – Chris Thorogood’s Pathless Forest should come with a health warning. It’s a love letter to the largest flowers in the world: the monstrous blooms of the 40-odd species – no one knows quite how many exist, or may have already been driven to extinction – of Rafflesia. This stinking, sprawling “corpse flower” grows in the tropical rainforests of Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, and from its nickname on, nothing about it is pretty. It’s a parasite that mimics the odour and appearance of rotting flesh to attract its favoured carrion fly pollinators, with a bouquet featuring notes of “blocked drains”, “sewage”, “pigs’ shit” and “bad chicken”.</p><p>It’s also the lifelong love of Thorogood, a botanist and academic who a
