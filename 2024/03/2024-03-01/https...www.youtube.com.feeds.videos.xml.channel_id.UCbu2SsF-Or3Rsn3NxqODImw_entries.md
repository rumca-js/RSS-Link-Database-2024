Here's how to stealth in Helldivers 2. If your entire team drops out leaving you behind, don’t worry, stealth was always an option. Although stealth can work with any build, it really shines if you bring along the Infiltrator armor with scout perk that reduces the detection range by about 30%. This is now my go-to armor for all modes, and honestly, even though it has a lower protection rating, and might be bugged at the moment, I haven’t had any problems. Although you can Silent Snake your way through the game keep in mind it’s a bit easier with Automatons. When you get too close, their red scanners perk up and aim in your direction letting you know to back off. Crouching works most of the time but you can get scary close to patrols if you crawl. If there’s a bad guy between you and an objective and you can’t avoid them, sneak up and hit melee twice. It’s not the best but doesn’t alert other units unless someone gets a shot off.

It’s been another brutal week in the video game industry, with PlayStation, EA, Supermassive, among others, announcing deep job cuts this week. But there was also a glimmer of hope with some teams like Remedy taking control of their own destiny.

This week, PlayStation and EA announced devastating cuts to their workforce. PlayStation laid off 900 people and closed its London Studio. EA announced a workforce reduction of almost 700, and it was revealed that the Respawn Star Wars FPS game had been cancelled and Ridgeline games who were working on a new Battlefield title had been shut down. It's the latest in a terrible 6 months for the industry that has seen thousands of developers lose their jobs. 

Lucy and Tam discuss another interesting trend that's been emerging, where some developers like Remedy, Toys for Bob, and Saber Interactive taking control of their own destiny a bit.

## Stop Whiffing Throws In Helldivers 2

I recently learned that you can tell how far you can toss stuff and it’s been a massive improvement. The first thing you need to do is ping the target you’re going after. A standard throw is about 42 meters but if you’re wearing the Knight armor it’s about 60. Wait for the enemy to hit that exact range before you let go. You’ll hit way more often and wind up shorting way less often blowing up your team in the process. Another great tip now that you’ve mastered that is it turns out the humble Resupply is really good at killing Chargers. If you find your stratagems are on cooldown and you have one of these chasing you around, hit it with the Resupply. The stratagem sticks to them, follows them around, and typically gets a one-hit kill. You’re welcome, carry on Helldivers.
