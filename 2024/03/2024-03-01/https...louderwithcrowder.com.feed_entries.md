So much so that at this point, I would consider this harassment fueled by hate for his religion. But apparently, bakers who are Christian don‚Äôt have the right to freedom of religion when they make cakes. Because tyrants all around the country are demanding he bake a cake with a dildo-licking Satan topper and one celebrating a gender transition. </p><p>Even though the man requesting these deranged and abhorrent cakes can just go to another baker, he is demanding that Phillips fulfill the request, despite it going against his deeply held religious beliefs. Because these people believe a right to a Satan cake Trumps the First Amendment. </p><p>And to no surprise, one of these people is Letitia James. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

Because it turns out that tenants have a right to the landlord's property. And by tenants, they mean anyone who steps foot in the house. </p><p>Squatter rights is an asinine thing because it turns a criminal trespassing matter into a civil one where the burden of proof falls upon the victim. This is long, costly, and wrong. I don‚Äôt understand how officials have been able to enact laws where uninvited guests somehow have rights to another person's property, but here we are with those laws wreaking havoc on unsuspecting victims.</p><p>Anyway, the s
