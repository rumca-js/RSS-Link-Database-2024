		Only a judge’s signature remains to settle one of the more storied biometric privacy lawsuits in the United States.

A $75 million settlement has been reached by litigants in Rogers v. BNSF Railway in the U.S. District Court of Illinois. The final approval belongs to the judge, and it is not known if or when that will occur.

BNSF had collected biometric identifiers from all truck drivers entering BNSF railyards. Under Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act, the rail company was required to get consent before collection and specify how the data would be managed.

Like dozens of other companies, BNSF did not do that, and 45,000 drivers took the company to court.

Concurrent with this case, the Illinois Supreme Court decided damage awards in B

		For many, certain key life relationships have a core of trust that is beyond question – a bond of the sort that biometrics and digital identity providers might envy. One of these is between <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/your-car-is-a-good-listener-maybe-too-good">people and their cars</a>. Like houses, cars are products that, because of their importance and financial heft, feel woven into the fabric of life. Automotive financing, meanwhile, is one of the most trustworthy loans around.

That core of trust is part of what is allowing automakers to be well positioned among digital identity stewards of the near future. A recent <a href="https://www.automotiveworld.com/articles/automakers-poised-to-become-digital-identity-stewards/">Aut
