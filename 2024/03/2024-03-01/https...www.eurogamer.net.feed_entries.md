Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, the lovely looking musical adventure based on Tove Jansson's classic series of children's stories, finally has a released date and will be launching for Switch and PC via Steam on Tuesday, 7th March.
</p><p>
Melody of Moominvalley sees players slipping into the oversized green hat of the wanderer Snufkin, as he harnesses the power of music - and his trusty harmonica - to restore nature after the Park Keeper and his minions build hideous parks all over Moominvalley.
</p><p>
"As Snufkin you will distract police officers, pull out signs, and knock over misplaced statues," explains Norweigian developer Hyper Games, "as you vigorously try to restore nature and the inhabitants' home while putting an end to the industrious Park Keeper's plans."

Balatro, the poker-themed rogue-like from solo developer LocalThunk that's been a huge critical and commercial hit since releasing last week, has been unexpectedly yanked from sale in some countries, with publisher Playstack blaming the issue on a surprise ratings change.
</p><p>
Playstack addressed the issue in a <a href="https://twitter.com/PlaystackGames/status/1763614758043795909">lengthy statement shared on social media</a>, explaining Balatro's temporary removal from console stores had so far only happened "some countries". It admitted it could not "estimate with complete confidence which stores" had been impacted, adding, "Our hope is that only a minority of stores will be affected". It says it remains "highly confident" Balatro will remain available on PC, including Steam.

Ori and the Blind Forest developer Moon Studios has announced its dark action-RPG No Rest for the Wicked will launch into Steam early access on 18th April.
</p><p>
No Rest for the Wicked, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ori-and-the-blind-forest-studio-announces-action-rpg-no-rest-for-the-wicked">unveiled during last year's The Game Awards</a>, is described by Moon Studios as an "expansive" and "visceral" action-RPG that's "set to reinvent the genre". It casts players as a Cerim - a holy warrior "imbued with remarkable powers" - who embarks on a journey across the harsh Isola Sacra to defeat an unholy plague.
</p><p>
Its campaign promises a "mature, dark" narrative, as well as "brutal, precision-based" combat, and a hand-crafted world, with players can take on No Rest for the Wicked's ch

Frost Fatales, the winter version of Games Done Quick's <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/framefatales">Frame Fatales charity speedrunning initiative</a>, is back this Sunday for a week of impressively fast gaming escapades.
</p><p>
This year marks the fourth annual Frost Fatales event -  which, like its summertime equivalent Flame Fatales, is specifically intended to showcase women and femmes in the speedrunning community - and proceedings get underway this Sunday, 3rd March, at 5.30pm UK time.
</p><p>
Then, across the next seven days, Frost Fatales has scheduled over 60 speedruns - which, as always, cover a broad spectrum of games, including acclaimed indies, retro classics, and oddities, with a small selection of more modern blockbusters also putting in an appearance.

## PlayStation cloud streaming vs Microsoft xCloud: image quality, performance and latency tested

We've been critical of cloud streaming in the past, as what you gain in convenience you often lose in image quality and latency - so how does the Sony offering compare to the native experience on PS5 on that front? And what about Xbox's cloud gaming offering, dubbed Project xCloud? The latter point through up an interesting curveball during testing: Microsoft's servers are based on Xbox Series X silicon, but the games being streamed are <em>definitely</em> the Series S versions.</p><p>We've looked at xCloud before (though admittedly, it has changed dramatically since then) but it's worth having a quick

This isn't because it's poorly designed or lacking waypoints. It's because it's frantic, endlessly generous, and loves to throw horrible things in your path. It's unfair in the very best way. It's an arcade game. Specifically, it's a twin-stick.</p><p>All twin-stick shooters bow at the altar of running in circles, often the altar of running backwards in circles. Now I am a grown-up and know a little of the mysteries of baking, I often think of Robotron and its glorious ilk as being Churning Games. You're in the kitchen, spoon and bowl in hand, and you're getting the air into that egg mixture.</p><p>Going in circles isn't just the optimal way to play something like Robotron, it's also the most beautiful wa

If you, like me, fell rather in love with Visai Games' narrative cooking game Venba last year, I have good news. Its Cookbook DLC is on the way, with a release date set just two weeks away.
</p><p>
Venba's Cookbook DLC will arrive on 13th March and - even better - when it does arrive, it will be free for all owners of the base game. 
</p><p>
Venba's upcoming DLC will offer players a way to look through detailed recipes for the dishes made in the game. This is something, let's be honest, we all wanted while playing along. Everything just looked (and sounded) so delicious.

It's an old game - 1995, so it's as old as Elastica's first album, for those of us who use that metric. A remaster has to bring it up to date without losing that thrilling sense of oldness. The right kind of oldness, though. Complicated.</p><p>Remasters are on the ri

Destiny 2 is adding a new kind of vehicle - the hoverboard-esque Skimmer - in its next update due on Tuesday, 5th March.

Skimmers will let players zoom around looking cool, pull off tricks and even grind on rails. They'll live alongside Sparrows - the game's traditional Star Wars speeder bikes - in your inventory.
</p><p>
As with anything fun or cool, the first hit is free - all players will get a Skimmer as part of the upcoming Guardian Games All-Stars event. A second Skimmer "inspired by a beloved Destiny weapon" will be available to buy via Destiny 2's Eververse microtransaction shop.

Another Thursday, another Epic Games Store freebie to add to your ever-growing backlog, this time in the form of stylish 3D side-scroller Never Yield.
</p><p>
Never Yield - also known as Aerial_Knight's Never Yield to ensure you don't forget who developed it - released back in 2021, offering up an experience something like a classic endless runner. It sees players stampeding across a strikingly designed future Tokyo, all to a winning soundtrack created by Detroit artist Danime-Sama.
</p><p>
"Take the role of Wally," explains Never Yield's official description. "A mysterious character that has recovered what was taken from him. Hopefully, you're fast enough to outrun your enemies. Expose the truth and try to uncover the mystery of what happened to them."

Vampire Survivors might continue to be suspiciously devoid of vampires, but it does now have a bunch of new cosmic sci-fi bits (clearly last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-announces-among-us-dlc-collaboration">Among Us collaboration</a> just wasn't space-y enough), courtesy of its latest free update on Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and mobile.

Space 54, as the update is known, introduces a new bonus stage going by the same name - officially described as a "cosmic border-realm between this plane of existence and a sinister, third dimension" - as well as two new characters to deploy.

One of those characters, Space Dude, is the star of developer Poncle's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVyydTcMBZc">energetic Space 54 trailer</a> (or Space-54, or Space54 - the s
