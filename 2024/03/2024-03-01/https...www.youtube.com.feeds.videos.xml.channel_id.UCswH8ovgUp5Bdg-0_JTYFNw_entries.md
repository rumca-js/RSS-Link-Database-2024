As Tucker Carlson calls Jon Stewart “a tool of the regime” after The Daily Show host criticised his interview with Vladimir Putin, is the media missing vital viewpoints from both men in its appetite to create its latest polarised battle in the culture war?

Today, we had the privilege of speaking to Senator Rand Paul about his new book: ‘The Great Covid Cover-Up.’

As we all know, Senator Rand Paul has been at odds with Anthony Fauci from the beginning. As one of the few leaders who dared to challenge “America’s Doctor,” Senator Rand Paul, a physician himself, has been vocal about his concerns. His book, ‘Deception,’ serves as an indictment of the catastrophic failures of the public health bureaucracy during the pandemic. Additionally, we asked him about the potential of him becoming the Minority Leader in the Senate.
