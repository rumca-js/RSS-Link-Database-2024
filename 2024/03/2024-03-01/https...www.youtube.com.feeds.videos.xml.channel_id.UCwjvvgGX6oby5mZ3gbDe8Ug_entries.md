Following the Chinese New Year and despite claims by much of Chinaâ€™s official media that "the whole country is full of optimism," China has entered upheaval in the Year of the Dragon.
We previously reported on the mass shooting in Shandong Province. This type of case is on the rise. Recently, a similar vicious case was reported in Henan Province. Previously, social revenge took the form of hurting people indiscriminately. Now, it has evolved to include arson where mountainsides are set aflame.
