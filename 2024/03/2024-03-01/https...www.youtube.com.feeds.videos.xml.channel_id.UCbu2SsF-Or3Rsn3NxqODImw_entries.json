If your entire team drops out leaving you behind, don\u2019t worry, stealth was always an option. Although stealth can work with any build, it really shines if you bring along the Infiltrator armor with scout perk that reduces the detection range by about 30%. This is now my go-to armor for all modes, and honestly, even though it has a lower protection rating, and might be bugged at the moment, I haven\u2019t had any problems. Although you can Silent Snake your way through the game keep in mind it\u2019s a bit easier with Automatons. When you get too close, their red scanners perk up and aim in your direction letting you know to back off. Crouching works most of the time but you can get scary close to patrols if you crawl. If there\u2019s a bad guy between you and an objective and you can\u2019t avoid them, sneak up and hit melee twice. It\u2019s not the best but doesn\u2019t alert other units unless someone gets a shot off.

But there was also a glimmer of hope with some teams like Remedy taking control of their own destiny.\n\nThis week, PlayStation and EA announced devastating cuts to their workforce. PlayStation laid off 900 people and closed its London Studio. EA announced a workforce reduction of almost 700, and it was revealed that the Respawn Star Wars FPS game had been cancelled and Ridgeline games who were working on a new Battlefield title had been shut down. It's the latest in a terrible 6 months for the industry that has seen thousands of developers lose their jobs. \n\nLucy and Tam discuss another interesting trend that's been emerging, where some developers like Remedy, Toys for Bob, and Saber Interactive taking control of their own destiny a bit.\n\nSpot On is GameSpot's weekly news show in which managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer", "date_published": "2024-03-01T22:00:27+00:00", "source_obj__id": 127, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSsBmfYJvuE", "comments": [], "age": null, "language": null, "bookmarked": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "vote": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "title": "Another Terrible Week In Video Games, What Is Going On? | Spot On", "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": "GameSpot", "user": null, "tags": []}, {"permanent": false, "dead": false, "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/YuVyC0OZ99w/hqdefault.jpg", "description": "I recently learned that you can tell how far you can toss stuff and it\u2019s been a massive improvement. The first thing you need to do is ping the target you\u2019re going after. A standard throw is about 42 meters but if you\u2019re wearing the Knight armor it\u2019s about 60. Wait for the enemy to hit that exact range before you let go. You\u2019ll hit way more often and wind up shorting way less often blowing up your team in the process. Another great tip now that you\u2019ve mastered that is it turns out the humble Resupply is really good at killing Chargers. If you find your stratagems are on cooldown and you have one of these chasing you around, hit it with the Resupply. The stratagem sticks to them, follows them around, and typically gets a one-hit kill. You\u2019re welcome, carry on Helldivers. \n\n#helldivers2 #gaming #gamespot", "date_published": "2024-03-01T17:56:32+00:00", "source_obj__id": 127, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuVyC0OZ99w", "comments": [], "age": null, "language": null, "bookmarked": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "vote": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "title": "Stop Whiffing Throws In Helldivers 2", "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": "GameSpot", "user": null, "tags": []}, {"permanent": false, "dead": false, "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/msuIJG-GUSI/hqdefault.jpg", "description": "Tune in for the Wicked Inside Showcase on March 1, 9am PST / 12pm EST / 5pm GMT / 6pm CET for a deep dive into the highly anticipated Action-RPG, No Rest for the Wicked.", "date_published": "2024-03-01T16:13:06+00:00", "source_obj__id": 127, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msuIJG-GUSI", "comments": [], "age": null, "language": null, "bookmarked": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "vote": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "title": "Wicked Inside Showcase Livestream", "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": "GameSpot", "user": null, "tags": []}, {"permanent": false, "dead": false, "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/NUHyIKBLHQg/hqdefault.jpg", "description": "We sat down with Naoki Hamaguchi, Co-Director of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and interviewed them on their journey as a fan, their vision for Rebirth, and creating Queen's Blood.\n\n#gaming #finalfantasy7 #gamespot", "date_published": "2024-03-01T16:00:15+00:00", "source_obj__id": 127, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUHyIKBLHQg", "comments": [], "age": null, "language": null, "bookmarked": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "vote": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0, "title": "From Fan to Creator - FF7 Rebirth Director Naoki Hamaguchi Interview", "album": "", "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": "GameSpot", "user": null, "tags": []}]
