Outpost: Infinity Siege reviewed by Travis Northup on PC.
Outpost: Infinity Siege takes some pretty big swings with its mishmash of ideas, and succeeds at a surprising number of them – whether it's the insanely dense RPG mechanics, its tight FPS gunfights, or its open-ended base-building options. It certainly doesn’t stick the landing everywhere, with a dreadful story, overly grindy and RNG-driven progression, and levels that become monotonous and predictable after a few visits. But even so, I found myself gladly sinking dozens of hours into a delightfully weird and unpolished adventure that’s unlike anything I’ve ever played before. Not everyone is going to have the patience to learn the sometimes incoherently complicated systems required to get the most out of Infinity Siege, but those willing to make the effort are in from a very good time.

Renowned designer Ken Levine invited IGN's Ryan McCaffrey and The Game Awards creator Geoff Keighley to Ghost Story Games in Boston, where we spent six hours playing a recent build of his new narrative-driven single-player first-person shooter Judas, followed by a lengthy conversation with the award-winning game designer to discuss the long wait since BioShock Infinite, bringing the "narrative LEGOs" concept to life in Judas, what the game is all about, and much more. You can watch the entire interview in the video above, but before you do, we figured you might want to know a little bit about Judas first. So we'll share the basics, without spoiling anything: Judas is a first-person narrative-driven shooter that, from a moment-to-moment gameplay perspective, will feel familiar to BioShock fans.
