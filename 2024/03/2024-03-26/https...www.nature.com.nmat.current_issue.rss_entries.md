<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 26 March 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01845-9">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01845-9</a></p>Lack of local phase patterning in liquid crystal elastomers has hindered their broad implementation. The authors report a laser-induced dynamic crosslinking approach with allyl sulfide groups to achieve reconfigurable high-resolution patterning of multiple liquid crystalline phases in a single film.
