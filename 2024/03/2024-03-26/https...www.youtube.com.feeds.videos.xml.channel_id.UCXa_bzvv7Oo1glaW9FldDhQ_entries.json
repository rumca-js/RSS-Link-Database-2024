Leaving aside its troubles with the Star Wars Battlefront titles and the cancellation of Project Ragtag, the publisher seemed to be on the right track after the success of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor had its share of issues but still performed well financially (though sales numbers have yet to be announced). Things seemingly spiralled downward after that with EA cancelling an upcoming Star Wars single-player FPS. \n\nBit Reactor's strategy title remains alive, and Star Wars Jedi 3 is in the works, but the overall mood is odd. What motivates the publisher's recent moves, especially in light of layoffs?

Specifically, it feels like a perfect cross between Elden Ring and The Elder Scrolls, capturing the former\u2019s aversion to guide or handhold the player in any way, and the latter\u2019s reliance on AI-driven systemic, emergent gameplay. \n\nCombining both styles and throwing in its own ideas, it ends up delivering something entirely unique.
