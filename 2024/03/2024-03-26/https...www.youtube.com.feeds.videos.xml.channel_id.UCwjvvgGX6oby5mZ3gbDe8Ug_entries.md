Even though many powerful Chinese have made a fortune in the red country, it's the American green card that makes them feel safe. Recently, a Chinese billionaire with countless secrets of top CCP officials pleaded guilty in the U.S. Under a plea deal, what could have been a maximum sentence of 27 years in prison is reduced to six months. At the same time, the billionaire has agreed to give up his legal permanent resident status in the U.S. and be deported elsewhere. We speculate that it must have been those Chinese secrets that helped him avoid the 27-year sentence. So, what are the shocking secrets kept by this Chinese billionaire? In this episode, we look at the story of Qin Hui, a former Chinese nightclub owner.
