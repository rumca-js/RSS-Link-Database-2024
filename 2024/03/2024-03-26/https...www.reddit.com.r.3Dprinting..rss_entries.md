<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TL:DR - Set a print bed to 70 C, put parts directly on the bed, cover and heat for ~1-1.5 hrs, possibly longer.</p> <p>---</p> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/Bq3BUyI">https://imgur.com/a/Bq3BUyI</a></p> <p>So, after watching some videos and reading some articles on annealing PLA I decided to attempt annealing some old functional prints just to see what would happen. So I grabbed some old prototypes and started heating them. They're six drywall anchor hook combo things (replacements for weird old broken ones) with 3 walls, 15% infill, total 5 continuous walls (except one part where I fucked up the print).</p> <p>I torture tested samples by putting them in a bowl, dumping freshly boiled water directly on the parts, and then going nuts with a pair of sharp tweezers - squeezing the part as well as pushing the tip into the middle of the part to see what would happen.</p> <ol> <li>No Annealing, No Testing.
