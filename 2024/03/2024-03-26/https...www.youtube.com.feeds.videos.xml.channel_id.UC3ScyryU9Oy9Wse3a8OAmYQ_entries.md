The CDC has estimated that more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections happen each year in the U.S., killing more than 35,000 people annually.

The 2014 documentary “Outbreak at NIH” centered on the story of a young man who contracted an antibiotic-resistant infection called KPC during an outbreak at one of the country’s most prestigious research hospitals. His parents spoke out about what they experienced. “He had acquired other infections along the way, but they always had antibiotics that were used, and he was able to get through those infections,” his father said in the documentary. “We never thought that it would be an infection that couldn’t be cured.”
