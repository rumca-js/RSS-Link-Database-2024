		In the UK, Pa Edrissa Manjang, an Uber Eats driver, has received a payout in an out-of-court settlement after UberEats' biometric identity verification locked him out "due to continued mismatches," resulting in a loss of work opportunities, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68655429">BBC</a>.

In 2021, Manjang's account was removed due to the mismatches on the Microsoft-powered app. The company previously said its facial recognition software is less accurate for those who are ethnic minorities.

Still, in comments to the BBC, an Uber representative said "our real-time ID check is designed to help keep everyone who uses our app safe and includes robust human review to make sure that we're not making decisions about someone's livelihood in a vac

		Portugal’s data regulator, the <a href="https://www.cnpd.pt/comunicacao-publica/noticias/cnpd-suspende-recolha-de-dados-biometricos/">Comissão Nacional de Proteção de Dados</a> (CNPD), has imposed a 90-day suspension on Worldcoin’s biometric data collection activities in the country, citing complaints about the unauthorized collection of data from minors, inadequate communications regarding their iris-scanning Orb program offering crypto tokens in exchange for biometrics, and other risks to personal digital rights.

In a release, the CNPD says the “urgent provisional measure” is in response to a notable spike in activity by the firm, with the number of locations hosting an Orb device for biometric data capture almost doubling in six months. Furthermore, says the regulat

		As deepfake threats rise, enterprises are losing faith in the security of identity verification and authentication without further protection. Gartner projects that by 2026, 30 percent of enterprises will no longer see <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/deepfake-videos-looked-so-real-that-an-employee-agreed-to-send-them-25-million">biometric identity verification</a> as reliable on its own.

As security threats evolve, so does MFA. Nametag has just launched Nametag Autopilot for self-service account recovery. Researchers at IIT Mandi in India have developed the adaptID system to replace passwords and OTPs with keystroke behavioral biometrics. Intercede has launched MyID MFA v5, which integrates FIDO passkeys.

		Lakeland, Florida is not known as a particularly violent city. It does not appear on lists of America’s <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/4366668-these-cities-and-towns-are-most-dangerous-in-the-us-study-finds/">most crime-ridden</a> towns. But it is home to one of the first installations of real-time public facial recognition in the U.S.

The first among the cameras have been installed by the Lakeland Downtown Development Authority (LDDA), according to local NBC affiliate <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/polk-county/facial-recognition-cameras-in-downtown-lakeland-hyper-focused-on-specific-individuals/">WFLA</a>. <a href="https://www.theledger.com/story/news/local/2024/03/21/ldda-using-new-cameras-to-track-people-of-inte

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/attain-insight">Attain Insight</a>, an Ottawa, Canada-based data security and analytics firm that provides services for identity resolution and compliance, has launched a new tool to decouple personally identifiable information (PII) from biometric data without losing match fidelity.

A company release from the firm says its Attain Insight Intrinsic product enables organizations to take “specially anonymized biometric data including <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/research-shows-improved-facial-recognition-accuracy-and-low-resolution-performance">facial recognition</a> data” and compare it with accuracy and compliance, despite tightening regulations on the capture, storage and sharing of facial re

		The digital version of the Philippines national ID card (PhilID), known as <a href="https://philsys.gov.ph/ephilid/">ePhilID</a>, makes it much easier for users to carry out important transactions given the slow distribution of physical cards, according to an adviser of the country’s president.

Frederick Go, Special Adviser to the President on Investment and Economic Affairs, said recently during a public event that “a digital ID will simplify transactions across public and private sectors,” as <a href="https://www.manilastandard.net/business/314429308/go-pushes-digitization-of-phil-id-system-to-simplify-transactions.html">reported</a> by Manila Standard.

		Opposition lawmakers in Ghana’s parliament have stood up against a proposal by the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) to spend the sum of 200 million Ghana Cedis ($15.2 million) for the production of national ID cards (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/ghana-card">Ghana Cards</a>) for children between six and 14 years of age.

		The limitations of real-world biometric training datasets, including the introduction of bias through unbalanced demographic representation, are well established. Synthetic training data offers promise, but has its own limitations. A novel method of avoiding those limitations was presented at the Norwegian Biometrics Laboratory <a href="https://eab.org/events/program/331?ts=1710249294956">Annual Workshop 2024</a>, hosted by the EAB earlier this month.

Pietro Melzi of the Autonomous University of Madrid presented the GANDiffFace model, which generates synthetic faces for the purpose of mitigating demographic bias in training data. The research project was a collaboration between UAM, <a href="https://ww

		Australia's Digital ID Bill is being amended to bring private sector identity service providers into the system within two years, in an attempt to gain enough Senate votes for approval, <a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/govt-amends-digital-id-bill-to-win-senate-support-ahead-of-debate/">InnovationAus</a> reports.

Opposition parties the Coalition and Greens had signaled they would not support the version of the bill which was approved in the lower house. Rolling the system out incrementally would be a “Big Government” approach, according to the Coalition.

The Labor Party holds only 26 of 76 seats in the upper house, so must gain the support of at least one other party to pass the legislation.
