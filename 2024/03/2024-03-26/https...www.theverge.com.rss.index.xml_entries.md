  <p id="INlFwJ">The world is a noisy place. High-end headphones are getting better at shutting it out; solid noise-canceling headphones from Sony, Bose, and others are increasingly a must-have for anyone who spends a lot of time on planes and trains, or in coffee shops full of people pitching AI startups. It’s a sanity thing, really.</p>
<p id="qX4W0W">But there are already people working on a giant leap in active noise cancellation. Instead of just blocking all the sound around you, the next generation of headphones might block all the sound you don’t want — but let in all the things you do want to

  <p id="aoXoiA">Disney has made some slight but notable updates to the logo and splash screen for its Disney Plus streaming service that likely nod to its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23990787/disney-plus-hulu-one-app-experience-beta-launch">looming merger with Hulu</a>. The biggest change is the new teal / seafoam background color, which appears to be a rough mix between its original blue background and the green that Hulu uses.</p>
