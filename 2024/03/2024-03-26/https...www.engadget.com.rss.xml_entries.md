<p>TikTok, already fighting a proposed law that could lead to a ban of the app in the United States, may soon also find itself in the crosshairs of the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC is close to wrapping up a multiyear investigation into the company, which could result in a lawsuit or major fine, <em>Politico</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/26/biden-administration-tiktok-data-practices-00149139"><ins>reports</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The investigation is reportedly centered around the app’s privacy and security practices, including its handling of children’s user data. According to <em>Politico</em>, the FTC is looking into potential violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), as well as “allegations that the company misled its users by stating falsely that individuals in China do not have access to U.S. user data.” TikTok could also be penalized for violating the terms of its 2019 <a class="no-affiliate-link" h

<p>Scientists have created a blazing-fast scientific camera that shoots images at an encoding rate of 156.3 terahertz (THz) to individual pixels — equivalent to 156.3 trillion frames per second. Dubbed SCARF (swept-coded aperture real-time femtophotography), the research-grade camera could lead to breakthroughs in fields studying micro-events that come and go too quickly for today’s most expensive scientific sensors.</p>
<p>SCARF has successfully captured ultrafast events like absorption in a semiconductor and the demagnetization of a metal alloy. The research could open new frontiers in areas as diverse as shock wave mechanics or developing more effective medicine.</p>

<p>Back when I was a kid (puts on old man glasses) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySiGJmDCjG8">we had the Casio SK-1</a>. We’d spend all day making samples of burps and turning them into stupid little songs, but that’s about as far as it went. You couldn’t layer tracks or anything. Modern children, however, are about to get an actual full-featured groovebox, thanks to Playtime Engineering.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blipblox.com/pages/blipblox-mytracks">Blipblox myTRACKS</a> is a complete music production studio, according to Playtime. It features a built-in microphone for sampling (just like the Casio SK-1) but also 50 instrument sounds and 25 pads to play them on. These sounds can be arranged into five tracks, resembling many grooveboxes intended for adults, and there are two FX processors and a range of effects. Sure, it looks like a toy and probably feels like a toy, but it’s not really a toy. To that end, the announcement video shows an adult going to town on

<p>There's a huge range of Android tablets out there. Some are great for reading comics, while others can double as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tablets-150026056.html">laptop replacements</a>. However, with devices starting at under $200 and going up to well over $1,000, picking the right one for your needs can be kind of tricky. We’ve tested dozens of tablets over the years from companies like Samsung, Lenovo and Google. So to help you select a device that fits your life, we've collected our top picks for the best Android tablets across various prices and use cases.</p>
<h2>What we look for in a good Android tablet</h2>
<p>Aside from cost, there are several specs and features we check out when evaluating new devices. One of the most important factors is the kind of display a tablet has. Not only its size (from less than seven inches to over 14), but also how bright it gets (ideally upwards of 400 nits) and what type of panel it uses (LCD, Mini LED, OLED, etc.). Bu

<p>We had the first wave of changes and tweaks to Apple, Google and other big tech companies’ policies and services just before the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act (DMA) took a harder line against monopolistic behaviors and practices.

<p>The Oversight Board is urging Meta to change the way it moderates the word “shaheed,” an Arabic term that has led to more takedowns than any other word or phrase on the company’s platforms. Meta asked the group for help crafting new rules <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/1299903163922108-oversight-board-announces-a-review-of-meta-s-approach-to-the-term-shaheed/"><ins>last year</ins></a> after attempts to revamp it internally stalled.</p>
<p>The Arabic word “shaheed” is often translated as “martyr,” though the board notes that this isn’t an exact definition and the word can have “multiple meanings.” But Meta’s current rules are based only on the “martyr” definition, which the company says implies praise. This has led to a “blanket ban” on the word when used in conjunction with people designated as “dangerous individuals” by the company.</p>

Devices in this space have come a long way over the past few years, making them better than ever and more accessible to boot. No longer the clunky, dim models of the past, the latest machines are brighter, sharper, more compact and easier than ever to install. But most importantly, they have much improved image quality now and they can achieve screen sizes that no regular TV could. If you want a true, big-screen viewing experience, a good home theater projector is the best way to get it.<br /><br />But the projector space is vast, with dozens of options running from ultra-short-throw to portable to long-throw.
