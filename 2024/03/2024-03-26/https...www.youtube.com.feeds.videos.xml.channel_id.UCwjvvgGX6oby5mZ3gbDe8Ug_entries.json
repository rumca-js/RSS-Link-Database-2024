Escaped justice from China & U.S. sentence: 27 year reduced to 6 months", "age": null, "permanent": false, "description": "#Chinainsights#chinanews \nEven though many powerful Chinese have made a fortune in the red country, it's the American green card that makes them feel safe. Recently, a Chinese billionaire with countless secrets of top CCP officials pleaded guilty in the U.S. Under a plea deal, what could have been a maximum sentence of 27 years in prison is reduced to six months.
