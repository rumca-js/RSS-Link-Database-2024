Lucy travelled to Ghost Story Games in Boston to play five hours of Judas, the new game from Ken Levine. It's shaping up to be a narrative-driven first person shooter... with a twist.

It's been over ten years since the release of BioShock Infinite, and in that time, developer Ken Levine has been working on something else: Judas. Lucy recently travelled to Ghost Story Games in Boston to visit the studio and played Judas for five hours. In this special episode of Spot On, she discusses the game's vision with Tamoor, its structure, how narrative LEGOs works, and how the game is much more than just BioShock in space. 

Spot On is a weekly news show in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest in games.
