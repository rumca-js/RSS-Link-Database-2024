Building Effective Embedded Systems in C++: Architectural Best Practices - Gili Kamma - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

Embedded development is a complex process that brings together software, electronics, physics, mechanics, and algorithms.
Designing a system with embedded components requires careful consideration of multiple factors.
However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding correct practices in building embedded systems.
In my talk, I will offer valuable insights to enhance the effectiveness of embedded development, focusing on improving robustness, speed, and maintainability.
By addressing the challenges in this field, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how to design and build embedded systems correctly.
Through practical advice and best practices, I aim to empower developers to overcome obstacles and achieve successful outcomes in their projects.
