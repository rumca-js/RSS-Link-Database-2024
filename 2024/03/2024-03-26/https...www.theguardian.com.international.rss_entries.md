<p>It is hypocritical of the US to seek to lock up Assange while boasting about its commitment to press freedom</p><p>For Julian Assange, the wait continues. The pause can be counted as a small victory in the long battle to fight his extradition to the United States. But it is one of the many shameful issues in this most shameful of sagas that his waiting room is a cell in a high security prison where he has been held for the past five years, despite having been convicted of nothing.</p><p>The high court decision issued by Dame Victoria Sharp and Mr Justice Johnson means that the US has been given a short time to offer “assurances” as to how his trial would be conducted and that the death penalty would not be imposed. Astonishingly it has previously been unable to provide them. Assange’s defence team will then be allowed to challenge those “assurances” issued by a country with a long record of ignoring many of the basic rights of anyone deemed to be threatening the security o

It’s usual for locals to put their bric-a-brac out on their lawns, hoping to raise some cash.

Now that she has turned 50, she “doesn’t give a fuck”, and allows herself one slovenly day a week, watching reality TV and ordering takeaways. This is quite a common refrain, not just in the wellness world, but from the realm of the perfect. They reach a certain age – usually 50, sometimes 45 – and assertively cease to care. Sometimes it hinges on diet and exercise, other times it’s “I turned 50 and stopped being a pleaser, saying yes to everything, hiding my true feelings.”</p><p>Passing this age threshold is framed as a liberating Rubicon, and those of us who were already reckless and past caring should be welcoming Gwyneth, and everyone like her, into our ranks.

<p>This compelling study of 1930s journalist Sefton Delmer reveals how he used ‘grotesque cabaret’ as propaganda to undermine the Germans’ faith in nazism – and how such methods could be used against today’s tyrants</p><p>In 1941 a secret British radio station called on Germans to rise up against Hitler. Run by German exiles, it was explicitly left wing. The station’s target audience was “the Good German”. Its broadcasts were serious and idealistic: a ray of light amid totalitarian darkness. They were also a complete flop. With Nazi propaganda rampant, and Hitler’s armies seemingly invincible and on the march across Europe, few bothered to listen in.</p><p>It was at this point that Britain’s wartime intelligence services tried a more radical approach.
