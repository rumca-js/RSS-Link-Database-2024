<p>It was a night when England wanted to impose themselves as an attacking force, after the frustration of Saturday’s 1-0 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/23/england-brazil-friendly-international-match-report">defeat here against Brazil</a>, and they did.

<p>Rivalries, putdowns, betrayals … director Natalie Ibu explains why she is thrilled to be making her National Theatre debut with an award-winning play about the famous writing sisters</p><p>Natalie Ibu is about to make her National Theatre debut directing a new play about the Brontë sisters, but the Kardashians keep creeping in. “I’m constantly comparing them, because they’re the ultimate disruptors – and they’re also three sisters with a brother that no one really remembers. We may not like what they stand for, but they are successful and exquisite at what they do,” she says.</p><p>Ibu is well aware that some will see this as an appalling slight against the 19th-century daughters of a country clergyman, who disrupted the canon by producing some of the most important novels in the English language.

<p><strong>Linbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London</strong><br />Rafael Bonachela’s beautiful choreography and Paula Levis’ striking costumes stand out in pieces ranging from a gentle voyage to stark electro intensity</p><p>Twenty years ago, Rafael Bonachela was a major new talent in UK dance. A Spaniard who’d spent years dancing in London with Rambert and was making waves with his choreography. But in 2009 he left to become artistic director at Sydney Dance Company, so this show is a bit of a homecoming. The triple bill, titled Ascent, opens with a short piece of Bonachela’s own, I Am-ness, and it’s a reminder of the quality of his choreography: 10 minutes of beautiful movement, set to the keening and soaring violin of Lonely Angel by Latvian composer Pēteris Vasks. It’s less frenetic than some of Bonachela’s early works, and takes time and pleasure in the facility of the four dancers in long, continuous, ever-evolving phrases. They’re on their individual paths, but en ro

A performance that, again, left one wondering how his pinpoint delivery or ability to pile-up goals and assists hadn’t seen him establish himself in this Socceroos outfit before he was the wrong side of 30, or how he was never to establish a sustained European career.</p><p>It was a night in which Kusini Yengi and John Iredale celebrated their first international goals for their country.

<p>In 1941, thousands of people died in Huaraz when the natural dam on a lake above the city gave way. Now, melting glaciers are raising the chances of it happening again<br /><br />• Photographs by Harriet Barber</p><p>Lake Palcacocha is high in the Cordillera Blanca range of the Peruvian Andes, sitting above the city of Huaraz at an altitude of about 4,500 metres. When the lake broke through the extensive moraines, or natural dams, holding it in place on 13 December 1941, it sent nearly 10m cubic metres of water and debris into the narrow valley towards the city, 1,500 metres below.</p><p>The result was one of the most <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Huaraz">devastating glacial lake outburst floods</a> – or “GLOFs” – ever recorded.

Most don’t do wetsuits; when the water temperature drops, on go the woolly hats, gloves and booties to protect extremities.</p><p>The dam is a mill pond built in the 1830s; about 20 years ago, under threat of being drained, it was rescued by a group of enthusiastic locals.

He claimed to do his rhyming, as he nonchalantly called it, “at night / When a Cunt is tied close to my inkstand”, and on receiving royalty cheques from his publisher he vowed that “what I get by my brains I will spend on my bollocks”.</p><p>When not drinking, gambling and having sex, Byron also tossed off 3,000 letters, which race to keep up with the flux of his sensations as he reels throug
