It's been 10 years since BioShock Infinite, and creator Ken Levine is still not done with follow-up project Judas. But the game is inching closer, evidenced recently by its appearance in trailers and now, a marketing beat where select people such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5wjyC1P1Jc">Game Awards host Geoff Keighley</a> have now played it for several hours. 
</p><p>
On the surface, this is a BioShock game in all but name, with gunplay  and elemental powers in an offbeat alternate universe setting. And this is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levines-new-game-looks-like-bioshock-in-space">essentially what trailers</a> have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">shown us of the game so far</a>.

## We've ranked all of Dragon's Dogma 2's meat grilling videos from worst to best

Bumbling around, getting into emergent scrapes with giant enemies one minute and then tossing my more aggravating pawns off of cliff tops the next. But there's nothing that I like doing more in this game than watching the live action meat grilling videos playing out each time I set up camp for the night.</p><p>There are eight different types of meat that you can grill in the game and each one has two different live action videos that can play out, depending on whether or not you're doing your grilling during the night or during the day. Except for the Dried Meat and Exquisite Dried Meat that is, those two share their videos for some reason. This means there is a grand total of 14 different videos that feature hot meat action in Dragon's Dogma 2 and, in the video above,

## Rise of the Ronin PS5 tech review: a good game marred by technical challenges

Building on the same in-house technology that powered Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and Stranger of Paradise, the pure focus on PlayStation 5 development makes the project particularly tantalising in what has become a prolonged cross-generation era. To that end, fully open world streaming is incorporated into the engine plus ray-traced reflections. </p><p>Despite these engine breakthroughs, Team Ninja has a huge challenge in following 2020's Ghost of Tsushima, Sucker Punch's open-world samurai action game which set a high bar for visual quality despite its cross-gen release. How does Rise of the Ronin fare in comparison, and which of its three graphics modes are the best way to enjoy the game? </p><p>Th

## Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom devs explain why it was a much bigger overhaul than you'd think

In a packed-out talk at GDC last week - which may go down as one of the conference's great talks of the last few years - technical director Takuhiro Dohta, lead physics engineer Takahiro Takayama, and sound programmer Junya Osada explained the complexity and sheer scale of the task at hand.</p><p>The goal, they said, was to take the two central ideas of Breath of the Wild - the notion of a "vast and seamless Hyrule" as one; the other its "multiplicative gameplay", where physics and chemistr

## Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles review - meditative city building on a stormy archipelago

Faced with the barren rocky outcrops of a stormy archipelago, and a handful of buildings to place on them, I thought I knew what to do. In a sense, I did - I knew I needed to build all over it. But how I'd end up doing that would be in a way completely of the game's own. Bulwark is eccentric. Bulwark is its own thing, for better and for worse.</p><p>I expected that, to a degree. To fill you in a bit: Bulwark is the second game in what we now know will be a trilogy - the Falconeer Chronicles - made by solo designer Tomas Sala. The first game, The Falconeer, came out a few years ago and had you fly around a stormy archipelago on the back of a giant fa

Lego Fortnite gets its second major update today, with the arrival of vehicles to build and drive around. 
</p><p>
The survival crafting game, playable within Fortnite, now lets you zoom about its world in a variety of vehicles you can build and customise. These range from the single-seat Speeder quad bike to the four-seat Offroader buggy, to the huge Hauler flat-bed truck.
</p><p>
Vehicles are cobbled together using a selection of new parts: power cells, wheels and seats. You will need to keep your vehicles fuelled, but pleasingly, all fuel in Lego Fortnite is eco-friendly, and generated as biomass from the new Compost Bin station.

Baldur's Gate 3 boss Swen Vincke has revealed a number of ideas cut from  the game during its development - including the ability to recruit a major antagonist as a companion character.
</p><p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-director-reveals-one-surprising-villain-that-used-to-be-playable">IGN</a>, Vincke also mentioned plans to feature a wider range of locations in the game - including several that will be familiar to Dungeons and Dragons players.

## "Majority" of Xbox games will come to PS5 at some point, it's claimed

It is understood the "majority" of Xbox games will eventually be coming to PlayStation. 
</p><p>
That's according to Chris Dring from Eurogamer's sister site GamesIndustry.biz. Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H14GFYHOLss">GI Microcast</a>, Dring said his takeaway from GDC was that "Xbox is in real trouble as a hardware manufacturer". Sources who spoke to Dring during the conference last week said that "Xbox's performance in Europe is just flatlining", and some publishers were now expressing concerns about supporting the console. 
</p><p>
"The phrase one major company who released a big game last year said [was], 'I don't know why we bothered supporting it'," Dring shared. "We mentioned on a previous podcast that we'd heard retailers in Europe are considering or had already been cutting back their Xb

Xbox gaming boss Phil Spencer has discussed the idea of a Microsoft handheld games device, and how Xbox games should play on third-party handheld hardware.
</p><p>
Spencer, a keen handheld PC enthusiast, told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108660/xbox-handheld-console-phil-spencer-interview">Polygon</a> that Microsoft was discussing "different hardware form factors and things that [they] could go do" to grow the Xbox audience further.
</p><p>
"What should we build that will find new players?" Spencer mused. "That will allow people to play at times when they couldn't go play [in the past]?"
