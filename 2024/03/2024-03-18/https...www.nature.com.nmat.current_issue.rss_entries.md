<p>Nature Materials, Published online: 18 March 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01844-w">doi:10.1038/s41563-024-01844-w</a></p>Single-crystal black phosphorus nanoribbons have been grown through chemical vapour transport, using black phosphorus nanoparticles as seeds. The nanoribbons orient exclusively along the zigzag direction and have good semiconductor properties that render them suitable for use as channel material in field-effect transistors.
