Developer Ecosystem research by JetBrains is conducted yearly, with the infographics and the raw data published for free for everyone. Since launch we learnt many insights on how to collect and process the data to get the results which are not presenting our thoughts on state of the art but close to the real world. The knowledge starts from the way to ask questions and goes to the way we interpret the answers, including the \u201cfacepalm\u201d issues we meet yearly.\n\nIn this talk, I'll feature the results of the recent C++ community surveys, make some comparisons, and will try to showcase how to treat the differences. We'll also dive into the survey methodology aspects, learning how to remove brand, targeting and sampling biases, as well as see how a \"properly\" asked question changes the data in ou", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_contents": 94, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "age": null, "comments": [], "artist": null, "permanent": false, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54LiB_OxPHE", "language": null, "album": "", "bookmarked": false, "tags": [], "source_obj__id": 420, "page_rating_votes": 0, "vote": 0, "dead": false, "date_published": "2024-03-18T16:05:44+00:00", "title": "Tips on Surveying the C++ Community - Anastasia Kazakova - CppCon 2023"}]
