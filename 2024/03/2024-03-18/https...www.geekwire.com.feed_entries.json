To be eligible for consideration in this category, startups need to be no more than five years old in 2024.

Several decades later \u2014 after a stint with Google, a tech job in Tanzania, and a $825 million startup exit \u2014&#160;Peterson finds himself back home, at the precipice of another big technology shift. The entrepreneur-turned-investor is leading Aviso Ventures, a venture capital fund founded last year that backs early stage enterprise and infrastructure software startups. In 2013, Peterson and his former Etsy colleague Nick Galbreath co-founded Signal Sciences, a cybersecurity company acquired by Fastly in 2020.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/this-seattle-investor-went-from-google-to-africa-to-a-big-exit-and-is-back-home-investing-in", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_contents": 94, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "age": null, "comments": [], "artist": null, "permanent": false, "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/this-seattle-investor-went-from-google-to-africa-to-a-big-exit-and-is-back-home-investing-in-startups", "language": "en-US", "album": "", "bookmarked": false, "tags": [], "source_obj__id": 131, "page_rating_votes": 0, "vote": 0, "dead": false, "date_published": "2024-03-18T15:18:23+00:00", "title": "This Seattle investor went from Google to Africa to a big exit \u2014 and is back home investing in startups"}, {"thumbnail": null, "page_rating": 94, "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/souvik-banerjee-JLj_NbvlDDo-unsplash-1260x840.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />LinkedIn wants to add a little more fun to its feed.
