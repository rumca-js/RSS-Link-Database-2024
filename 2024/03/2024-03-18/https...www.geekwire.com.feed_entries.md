Several decades later — after a stint with Google, a tech job in Tanzania, and a $825 million startup exit —&#160;Peterson finds himself back home, at the precipice of another big technology shift. The entrepreneur-turned-investor is leading Aviso Ventures, a venture capital fund founded last year that backs early stage enterprise and infrastructure software startups. In 2013, Peterson and his former Etsy colleague Nick Galbreath co-founded Signal Sciences, a cybersecurity company acquired by Fastly in 2020.&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/this-seattle-investor-went-from-google-to-africa-to-a-big-exit-and-is-back-home-investing-in

Posts on social media and a report from TechCrunch over the weekend revealed the Microsoft-owned platform may add several puzzle-based games to the overall LinkedIn experience, some of which are titled “Queens,” “Inference,” and “Crossclimb.” &#8220;We&#8217;re playing with adding puzzle-based games within the LinkedIn experience to unlock a bit of fun, deepen relationships, and hopefully spark the opportunity for conversations,&#8221; a LinkedIn representative said in a statement.
