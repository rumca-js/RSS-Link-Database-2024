<p>It's shaping up to be a busy spring for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a>, which has multiple events lined up over the next few months. Not only is there <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-at-microsofts-march-21-event-204559003.html"><ins>a work and Copilot-centric event this Thursday</ins></a> and almost certainly an Xbox showcase coming up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-2024-summer-game-fest-showcase-is-set-for-june-7-162854440.html"><ins>in early June</ins></a>, but Build is on the horizon. The company's major developer conference is set to run from May 21 until May 23. However, three days apparently isn't long enough to cram in everything Microsoft wants to talk about.</p>
<p>The company sent Engadget an invite to a private event taking place on May 20, the day before Build starts. Details are scant, but Microsoft says CEO Satya Nadella will dig into its "AI vision across hardware and software." There won't

<p>Rivian owners <a href="https://twitter.com/Rivian/status/1769758297438159021"><ins>can now use Tesla Supercharger stations</ins></a> to juice up their electric trucks and SUVs, after a software update issued during the weekend. The company first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-owners-will-be-able-to-use-tesla-superchargers-starting-in-2024-141546633.html"><ins>announced the integration last year</ins></a>, along with plans to include Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) ports in forthcoming vehicles. These ports won’t start showing up until 2025, so Rivian has also started a program to send Tesla-made NACS adapters to current customers.</p>
<p>The adapters will be free of charge, which calls to mind the move Ford made last month as it continues to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-ev-owners-can-now-use-tesla-superchargers-in-the-us-and-canada-130053549.html"><ins>transition to the NACS charging standard</ins></a>.

<p>Many companies and platforms are wrangling with how to handle AI-generated content as it becomes more prevalent. One key concern for many is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-plans-to-ramp-up-labeling-of-ai-generated-images-across-its-platforms-160234038.html"><ins>labeling of such material</ins></a> to make it clear that an AI model whipped up a photo, video or piece of audio.

<p>YouTube sensation Dunkey, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@videogamedunkey"><ins>aka videogamedunkey</ins></a> or Jason Gastrow, has added game publishing to his resume. Last year, he started a company called Big Mode which is <a href="https://www.animalwell.net/"><ins>releasing its first title on May 9</ins></a>. <em>Animal Well</em> is a sidescrolling Metroidvania platformer that will show up on the PS5, the Nintendo Switch and PCs. There’s a trailer that’s absolutely oozing with retro-gaming goodness.</p>
<div id="3476e85e43ec4c5d84de4d7707a4ce22"></div>
<p>Now, Dunkey didn’t make this game. Big Mode is a publisher and not a developer. A company called Shared Memory is behind <em>Animal Well</em>, which is just a solo dev named Billy Basso. He’s been <a href="https://twitter.com/Billy_Basso/status/1769527715462348962?s=20"><ins>working on the game for seven years</ins></a> and his hard work show from the trailer.&nbsp;</p>

While it might seem like an admission that Apple is lagging behind on AI, the partnership fits if you think of generative AI models as an evolution of web searching, something Google already provides to all of Apple's devices. According to the report, Gemini could be the cloud-based generative AI engine for Siri and other iPhone apps, while Apple's models could be woven into the upcoming iOS 18 for on-d

<p>The company is said to have manufactured well more than 2 million units. According to analysts at IDC, the company sold around 1.7 million headsets in 2023. Perhaps most concerningly for Sony, sales appeared to have slowed significantly throughout the year. Hardware sales often pick up ahead of the holidays, but the fourth quarter was the most sluggish sales period

<p>The vacuum world has gone cordless, untethering us from outlets and saving us fights with pesky wires. Cordless vacuums can be great alternatives to traditional corded models since they’re lightweight and easier to maneuver around your home. They’ve also gotten much more powerful in recent years. Some even come with extra features like app connectivity, self-emptying bases and more. But just like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">robot vacuum</a> space, there are dozens of cordless vacuums to choose from now (no, Dyson isn’t your only option).

After testing a bunch of the most popular cordless vacuum cleaners available today, we’ve come up with our top picks, plus loads of buying advice to help you figure out which cordless stick vacuum is right for you.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s not just Nintendo prepping new console hardware for 2024. <em>Insider Gaming</em> reports details for the PS5 Pro come from documentation Sony recently sent to third-party developers.</p>
<p>Hold onto your skepticism. Based on the reports, the PS5 Pro will offer a more consistent frame rate (fps) at 4K and a performance mode for 8K resolution. It’s also expected to render games up to 45 percent quicker and have ray tracing capabilities two to three times faster than current PS5 consoles.</p>
<p>The report says Sony may target a<a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ps5-pro-is-reportedly-coming-this-holiday-season-084404542.html"> holiday release for the PS5 Pro</a>, to target those heightened sales. Can it make <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>look pretty like it does on PC? Please?</p>
