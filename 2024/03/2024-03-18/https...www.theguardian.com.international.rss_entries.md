<p>Vladimir Putin’s landslide victory in a fake contest marks the latest phase in a transition from authoritarianism to outright autocracy</p><p>One of the curiosities of the Soviet Union was the serious weight its leaders attached to holding elections. In a dictatorship, why bother? Academic studies <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1953432">concluded</a> that ensuring a 99% vote share for the only candidate on the ballot was a useful tool for civic mobilisation, and a way of isolating and intimidating anyone who aspired to a real democratic choice.</p><p>Under the repressive, paranoid leadership of Vladimir Putin, Russians are going back to the future. Mr Putin’s 87% <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/17/kremlin-vladimir-putin-claim-landslide-russian-election-victory">landslide</a> in Russia’s presidential election – the highest percentage in any post-Soviet poll – confirms that, almost a quarter of a century after he first entered the Kremlin, the resu

The man who allayed fears that sequels are never any good by reminding everyone of The Godfather Part II when he returned to Bilbao for a second spell as coach of Athletic Club in 2013 and then proved it by leading to them to their first trophy in 31 years has gone and done it again.

Kita has already fired two managers this season: Pierre Aristouy in November and Jocelyn Gourvennec, who was sacked after a 3-1 home defeat to Strasbourg, on Sunday.</p><p>“We have felt for a while that we were taking a bad turn,” said Kita in November. That statement sums up Nantes’ direction of travel since he took control of the club in 2007. However, this was not a moment of profound self-reflection from the president. Instead, it was his justification for sacking Aristouy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/footba
