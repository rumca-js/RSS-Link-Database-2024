As a modern video game release, Outcast \u2013 A New Beginning boasts an impressive new jetpack that hopes to give new life to the act of exploration in a massive open world.\n\nWhile the combat and traversal in Outcast \u2013 A New Beginning can be a lot of fun, especially thanks to the unique approach to weapon customization and the jetpack, the game is filled with archaic design decisions that can be frustrating. Even the story feels incredibly badly done, despite having some characters that ooze charm and sincerity.", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_contents": 94, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "age": null, "comments": [], "artist": null, "permanent": false, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPgElIUoEfM", "language": null, "album": "", "bookmarked": false, "tags": [], "source_obj__id": 129, "page_rating_votes": 0, "vote": 0, "dead": false, "date_published": "2024-03-18T21:30:04+00:00", "title": "Outcast: A New Beginning Review - A Disappointment"}, {"thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ulBXrY9JP1U/hqdefault.jpg", "page_rating": 94, "description": "After months of rumors, Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush is available on PS5. It carries all of the post-launch updates and leverages the console as you would expect. While it signals a shift for Microsoft to a new multi-platform strategy, it still stands out as one of the best first-party titles.\n\nAs Chai, players battle through a rhythm-based hack-and-slash adventure with enemies, environmental objects and more moving to the beat. The colorful presentation and incredible attention to detail hide a deep combat system with multitudes of options. It also doesn't hurt that the story, level design and overall writing are consistently on point.\n\nHi-Fi Rush may face extensive competition this week, with AAA games coming up.
