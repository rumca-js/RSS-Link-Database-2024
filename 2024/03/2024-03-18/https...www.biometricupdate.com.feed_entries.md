		The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/remote-id-proofing-good-practices">ENISA</a>, has released a report outlining good practices for remote identity proofing (RIDP), as the EU proceeds with a digital transformation that will rely heavily on biometrics, digital identity and reliable remote identity verification services.

The report, sensibly titled “Remote ID Proofing Good Practices,” points to a general shift toward digitization across European society and the economy, which was accelerated by the sudden need for remote identity verification during pandemic-related restrictions, resulting in “a period of intens

		Industry, tech and digital ministers of the world’s seven biggest economies (G7) say AI and other digital systems have the potential to help improve the way governments and private sector operators provide public services to citizens.

This affirmation is contained in a <a href="https://assets.innovazione.gov.it/1710505409-final-version_declaration.pdf">declaration</a> adopted by the ministers after their two-day meeting which took place from March 14-15 in Italy, with support from the OECD, UNDP, UNESCO and ITU.

While recognizing the transformative power of digital technologies, the ministers said they also fully endorse “the ongoing international discussions on different approaches to digital identity and other digital government services, including

		Facial recognition algorithms traditionally depend on biometric data to make matches. However, with the implementation of the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202403/ai-act-passes-eu-parliament-arguments-on-implementation-and-implications-heat-up">Artificial Intelligence Act</a> within the European Union, the legal status of facial recognition systems has changed, especially if they pose a risk to personal freedom and privacy.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/smart-engines">Smart Engines</a> has identified this market gap as a need for facial recognition that does not depend on the use of biometrics. The company claims to have addressed this issue by utilizing a neural network, trained to compare facial images in a manner similar

		As the AI Act nears enactment, the EU is pouring money into the industry while regulating health data. Meanwhile, the EUDI Wallet is being received with some skepticism from fintech experts.
<h2>EU kicks off funding round for AI projects</h2>
The European Union is planning to invest €67.5 million (US$73.3 million) in supporting businesses working in the artificial intelligence sphere.

The AI-focused funding will support companies in preparation for the upcoming AI Act, including an AI innovation accelerator, coordinating on AI regulatory sandboxes and setting up testing facilities which will help EU member states verify compliance of AI systems on the market.

The funding is part of the latest, €176 million (US$191.3 million) round of cash infusion into the

		The Philippines is allowing children four years of age and younger to sign up for the country’s digital ID, the Philippine Identification System or PhilSys.

Signing up for the ID system usually requires biometric information, such as fingerprints, iris scan and a facial image. Registering children, however, will only require demographic data and a photograph, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority in the Central Visayas region. The agency, which is in charge of implementing the digital ID system, will only capture their biometrics once they reach five years old.

The children’s PhilSys Number (PSN) will be linked to their parents or legal guardians. Upon reaching the age of 15, their biographic and biometric data will be recaptured once again

		Nigeria’s National Identity Management Commission is reassuring citizens and stakeholders that their digital identity data is secure, after a private company was revealed to be selling the personal data of Nigerians online.

A company called XpressVerify, billing itself as an identity verification provider, had unrestricted access to the country’s National Identification Database, reports the <a href="https://fij.ng/article/after-fijs-story-namecheap-suspends-private-website-selling-nigerians-nin-other-data/">Foundation for Investigative Journalism</a>, which stores the data associated with Nigerians’ National Identity Numbers.

		A UK government immigration database was found to have mixed up biometric and biographical data of more than 76,000 people, leaving some of them unable to prove their right to work, rent housing and access state-funded medical treatment.

The UK Home Office-operated database, called Person Centric Data Platform (PCDP), stored information on 177 million immigrants, including identity documents, visa applications, and biometric information. Errors in the database, however, have led to “merged identities” of two or more people and listings of incorrect names, photographs or immigration status, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/mar/14/home-office-immigration-database-errors-hit-more-than-76000-people">according</a> to leaked internal documents seen by The

		Certain Israel biometric IDs would be updatable online under a proposed law presented to that country’s national legislature this week.

Israel’s Interior Ministry is pushing a temporary measure that would allow the online renewal of biometric <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202401/biometric-chip-passports-get-priority-in-israel-pakistan-and-russia">passports</a> and IDs that have expired within the past six months or that will expire within the next year.

The bill, which is an answer to the daily uncertainty created by the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, would limit the validity of the biometric IDs in question to a maximum of five years after they are approved, <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-791561">according to<
