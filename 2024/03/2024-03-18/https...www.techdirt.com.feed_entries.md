With the standard caveat that reading too much into oral arguments is dangerous, I will note that I am cautiously optimistic after listening to the oral arguments in the Murthy v.

You probably already know the benefits of learning a language, so let&#8217;s focus on the app. Right off the bat, let&#8217;s be clear about one thing: When we say &#8220;app&#8221; we don&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re limited to using Babbel on your phone. You can use Babbel on desktop, too, and your progress is synchronized across [&#8230;]
