Dropping tomorrow, March 19th, the trailer will give us our first look at what the High Republic Era of Star Wars looks like in live-action.

Spoiler: Miller didn't think the tech looked too great. We don't disagree (although it has gotten better). And finally, Winnie-the-Pooh will be joining a cinematic universe, but it's one filled with nightmares. That's right, Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2 will be the latest entry in the newly-announced Poohniverse cinematic universe.\n\n#IGN", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_contents": 94, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "age": null, "comments": [], "artist": null, "permanent": false, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtBCjeztILM", "language": null, "album": "", "bookmarked": false, "tags": [], "source_obj__id": 149, "page_rating_votes": 0, "vote": 0, "dead": false, "date_published": "2024-03-18T22:46:15+00:00", "title": "Star Wars: The Acolyte Gets a Poster and Release Date - IGN The Fix: Entertainment"}, {"thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/Ir2n4pegD8I/hqdefault.jpg", "page_rating": 94, "description": "Catch up on X-Men: The Animated Series in this latest feature ahead of the two-episode premiere of Marvel Animation's all-new X-Men '97 series on Disney+ on March 20, 2024.\n\n#IGN  #Marvel", "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_contents": 94, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "age": null, "comments": [], "artist": null, "permanent": false, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir2n4pegD8I", "language": null, "album": "", "bookmarked": false, "tags": [], "source_obj__id": 149, "page_rating_votes": 0, "vote": 0, "dead": false, "date_published": "2024-03-18T22:00:07+00:00", "title": "X-Men '97 - Official Recap Trailer (2024) Eric Bauza, Ray Chase, Cal Dodd"}, {"thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/SYQ-7zLPGMk/hqdefault.jpg", "page_rating": 94, "description": "Get a first look at the upcoming tech developments in gaming at the State of Unreal Livestream on March 20.
