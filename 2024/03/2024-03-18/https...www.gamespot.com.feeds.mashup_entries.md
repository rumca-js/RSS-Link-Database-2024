## Zack Snyder's Dawn Of The Dead Has One Of The Greatest Openings In Horror History

<p dir="ltr">The 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake, written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder (in his directorial debut!), celebrates its 20th anniversary this week. Both critically praised and commercially successful at the time of its release, the film, along with 28 Days Later, helped popularize the concept of sprinting zombies over their shambling, slouching, Romero-made counterparts.

Our main character, Ana, is a nurse, and she's wrapping up a long shift at the hospital. What's great about this opening sequence--of her talking with co-workers and killing time--is how mundane it is. This is not load-bearing dialogue, and the actors don't deliver it theatrically, as if to imply narrative stakes. We know that Ana is about to have the worst day of her life. But she d

<p dir="ltr">Fatal Fury: City Of The Wolves is the next chapter in a nearly decade-long story for SNK. Since 2016, the company has painstakingly re-introduced its most popular fighting game franchises to the gaming world: first with King Of Fighters XIV, then Samurai Shodown in 2018, and most recently back to KOF with XV in 2021. In 2025, the company looks to revive another fighting IP, and this time it's one that hasn't seen a new entry in two-and-a-half decades. After a few hours of hands-on with City Of The Wolves during the recent SNK World Championships and speaking to the game's director, Hayato Konya, this new Fatal Fury already looks to be worthy of carrying the baton.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo featured five characters from the game's playable selection.

<p>Between Terminids vomiting corrosive bile and Automatons rolling up to fights with tanks, death comes very quickly in Helldivers 2. But a sudden case of blue-laser-to-the-head is in the cards because players are convinced the game's third faction has snuck into various battlefields, delivering almost instantaneous death to any Helldivers caught unawares.</p><p>Over on Reddit, players have begun documenting how they've been hit by mysterious blue lasers, with all signs pointing to the Illuminate. This faction of hostile aliens was originally in the first Helldivers game and favored the use of sophisticated tactics and highly advanced technology on the battlefield. A race of snipers, illusionists, and high-tech hardware, they were a pain to deal with. And now, they seem to be operating near the borders of Super Earth.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4274630-helldivers-2-i-want-to-believe.jpg"><img alt="T

<p>Miriam Margolyes, who played Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter films, has a message for adult fans of the Harry Potter series--grow up. Speaking to Australia's ABC News, Margolyes doubled down on her previous comments about Harry Potter, saying people should just move on to something else.</p><p>"I'm not unhappy about it. I just think it's for children. And if your balls have dropped, then it's time to forget about it," she said. "You know, go on to other things. No. Seriously. It's a great series. It's a wonderful set of films. I'm proud I was in it. But it was 25 years ago! You know, grow up!"</p><p>Margolyes was asked about this in response to her previous comments about the series that went viral when she said she worries for adult Harry Potter fans because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOT7I2lHt9Y">"they should be over that by now."</a></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-actor-says-adult-fans-of-the-series-need-to-grow-up/1100-652

<p>Details on the rumored--and unannounced--PlayStation 5 Pro have reportedly leaked online, alongside claims that the console is aiming for a Q4 2024 release. According to the YouTube channel <a href="https://youtu.be/SV7BJKnZfP8?feature=shared">Moore's Law Is Dead</a> and corroborated by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-specs-2024/">Insider Gaming</a>, the PS5 Pro specs include a "High CPU Frequency Mode" that increases the PS5 CPU by 10% to 3.85Ghz and a new GPU that is said to be capable of up to 45% faster rendering and dramatically improved ray tracing effects.</p><p>This GPU is claimed to be clocked at 33.5 teraflops, triple that of the standard PS5's 10.28 teraflop GPU, although this doesn't equate to triple the power in a direct comparison. It's also reported that this model will have a detachable disc drive and 1TB of storage capacity. What's especially interesting here is the claim of new upscaling and anti-aliasing techniques called PlayStation Spectral

<p>The upcoming Fallout TV series from Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy is not aiming to please fans and gamers. Trying to do that would be a "fool's errand," Nolan said during a recent event attended by <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/sci-fi-amazon-prime-video-fallout-tv">T3</a>. Instead, as a massive fan of the Fallout series himself, Nolan tried to make a show that made him happy, and he believes he has achieved that.</p><p>"I don't think you really can set out to please the fans of anything," he said. "Or please anyone other than yourself. I think you have to come into this trying to make the show that you want to make and trusting that, as fans of the game [ourselves], we would find the pieces that were essential to us... and try to do the best version."</p><div>          </div><p>Nolan is a huge fan of the Fallout series, starting with Fallout 3. That game "devoured about a year of my life," he said. "It almost derailed my entire career. It's so ludicrously playable and fun

No. 2 so far in 2024 is Kung Fu Panda 4 ($176.5 million) followed by Bob Marley: One Love ($169.2 million) at No. 3.</p><p>Dune: Part II needed only 10 days on the market to surpass the entire North American box office run of the first movie, which was $108 million. Of course, a comparison to the original is not fair given the first movie was released simultaneously in theaters and on Max
