In today's Daily Fix:
The latest Star Wars series hitting Disney+ finally has a poster, and a trailer is not far behind. Dropping tomorrow, March 19th, the trailer will give us our first look at what the High Republic Era of Star Wars looks like in live-action. In other news, Furiosa director George Miller has revealed why he decided to recast the Furiosa character instead of de-aging original actor Charlize Theron. Spoiler: Miller didn't think the tech looked too great. We don't disagree (although it has gotten better). And finally, Winnie-the-Pooh will be joining a cinematic universe, but it's one filled with nightmares. That's right, Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2 will be the latest entry in the newly-announced Poohniverse cinematic universe.

Join producer Jordan Peele for a look at Monkey Man and what appealed to him about the upcoming action movie starring Dev Patel. Monkey Man opens in theaters on April 5, 2024.

Inspired by the legend of Hanuman, an icon embodying strength and courage, Monkey Man stars Patel as Kid, an anonymous young man who ekes out a meager living in an underground fight club where, night after night, wearing a gorilla mask, he is beaten bloody by more popular fighters for cash.

After years of suppressed rage, Kid discovers a way to infiltrate the enclave of the city’s sinister elite. As his childhood trauma boils over, his mysteriously scarred hands unleash an explosive campaign of retribution to settle the score with the men who took everything from him.

Packed with thrilling and spectacular fight and chase scenes, Monkey Man is directed by Dev Patel from his original story and his screenplay with Paul Angunawela and John Collee (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World).
