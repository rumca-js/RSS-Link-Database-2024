<p>C++ creator Bjarne Stroustrup has defended the widely used programming language in response to a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3713203/white-house-urges-developers-to-dump-c-and-c.html">Biden administration report</a> that calls on developers to use memory-safe languages and avoid using vulnerable ones such as <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3688923/c-23-language-standard-declared-feature-complete.html">C++</a> and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3402023/why-the-c-programming-language-still-rules.html">C</a>.</p><p>In a March 15 response to an inquiry from InfoWorld, Stroustrup pointed out strengths of C++, which was designed in 1979. “I find it surprising that the writers of those government documents seem oblivious of the strengths of contemporary C++ and the efforts to provide strong safety guarantees,” Stroustrup said. “On the other hand, they seem to have realized that a programming language is just

<p>The world has become “sensor-fied.”</p><p>Sensors on everything, including cars, factory machinery, turbine engines, and spacecraft, continuously collect data that developers leverage to optimize efficiency and power AI systems.

<p>Once upon a time, few companies needed metering or usage-based billing. This is changing, and fast, as the world shifts toward ever more granular pricing based on consumption. As <a href="https://mattturck.com/lago/" rel="nofollow">FirstMark investor Matt Turck expresses</a> it, “The problem is only getting worse as the software industry transitions from subscription-based to consumption-based revenue models. What started as a trickle is becoming mainstream.” First it was the software-as-a-service companies, followed by fintech companies, and now artificial intelligence companies such as Mistral; they all need the same sort of billing infrastructure that powers infrastructure companies like AWS. Sounds simple, right? It’s not. Complexity skyrockets once you need to correctly track the usage of billions of monthly events.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3714620/open-source-comes-to-real-time-metering.html#jump">To read this article
