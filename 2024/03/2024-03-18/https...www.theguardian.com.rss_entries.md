He took office in 1984 in a landslide victory, but saw his popularity plummet by the early 1990s.</p><p>As prime minister, he raised his country’s international profile.

<p>Claims of a leadership bid are ‘bonkers’, say Penny Mordaunt’s allies. But so too is staying silent while the PM stumbles towards an election</p><p>There are many good reasons for Rishi Sunak to postpone a general election. All are about reducing his party’s potential loss of seats. There is also an overwhelming reason for calling one now. It is in the national interest.</p><p>British government needs an act of cleansing. It needs renewal and a fresh start under a new regime. Every month that start is delayed has a cost in decisions postponed. The presumed next government of Labour’s Keir Starmer is waiting and ready to go. Its learning curve will be steep and its climb hard. There is not the remotest national advantage in another six months of bickering and squabbling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/18/tories-rishi-sunak-leadership-plot-penny-mordaunt-general-election">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Singer and songwriter best known for the 1970s No 1 hit Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) </p><p>Steve Harley, the frontman of Cockney Rebel, who has died aged 73 of cancer, was much more than a one-hit wonder, but his sole UK chart-topper defined his career. This was Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) , which reached No 1 in February 1975. The following year it also became the group’s only appearance on the US charts when it reached No 96.</p><p>A seemingly cheerful piece, powered by a bouncing bassline and an infectious “ooh la-lala” hook sung by female backing singers, it was the perfect playground for Harley’s distinctive and eccentric vocal style. The lyrics were part sung and part declaimed, with vowels stretched and syllables twisted as if Harley were auditioning to play Richard III. The way he delivered the line “for only metal, what a bore” was a case in point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/18/steve-harley-obituary">Continue reading...</

Written by Meredith Scardino, a storied writer with credits on SNL and The Colbert Report, Girls5Eva at times seemed almost too beautiful to live.

<p>Dane Elcar writes, directs and films this innovative indie movie that follows a bickering couple with seemingly no end</p><p>A plucky microbudget indie, Brightwood is a masterclass in what is achievable with hardly any money whatsoever: just a premise, a couple of actors, and a writer-director (Dane Elcar) who doubles as cameraperson. It’s also an illustration of the limits of the form, because it would be starry-eyed and untrue to claim that money makes no difference to what can be achieved.</p><p>We open on a couple, jogging in the woods and fighting as they go. Jen (Dana Berger) and Dan (Max Woertendyke) have evidently been married for long enough to really get to know and dislike each other. She’s listening to a podcast about how to divorce, he’s irritated she won’t take her earbuds out long enough for them to have a conversation, she’s furious about his drinking and flirting and, on top of everything else, he’s wickedly hungover. Their interactions have a painful, cir

<p>Individual wealth is reaching levels we’ve never seen before. What might that mean?</p><p>At the beginning of each year, the world’s corporate and political elite gather in the Swiss ski resort of Davos to pat each other on the back, attend seminars on “the fourth Industrial Revolution” – whatever that might be – and generally mull over the state of the world. Rarely is so much wealth to be found in so few conference rooms. And each year, Oxfam, the global development charity, takes the opportunity to <a href="https://policy-practice.oxfam.org/resources/inequality-inc-how-corporate-power-divides-our-world-and-the-need-for-a-new-era-621583/">run the numbers</a> on the state of global inequality. Oxfam’s findings are often eye-catching, but this year especially so.</p><p>The wealth of the five richest people in the world, they found, has more than doubled, from $405bn (£320bn) in 2020 to $869bn in late 2023. That’s an increase of about $14m an hour, which is not bad going by

<p><strong>First Direct Arena, Leeds</strong><br />Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill preside over an energetic set thrills fans of their chart reign and their post-punk era</p><p>Two years ago, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/31/simple-minds-jim-kerr-interview">Simple Minds’ singer Jim Kerr</a> told the Guardian how, in the early 2000s, the band would drive past stadiums they used to sell out en route to playing a club that wasn’t. Now, they’re back in arenas, which the frontman regards as “intimate – but not too cavernous”. Their fortunes have turned around as more people have woken up to the pioneering brilliance of their early albums. Meanwhile, a retooled seven-piece line-up including two women have brought a new energy. Sarah Brown shares lead vocals occasionally and Cherisse Osei is an outstanding drummer. Decades-old songs arrive waxed and polished, while 1995’s Hypnotised and 2022’s Vision Thing have a contemporary shimmer.</p><p>Opening the tour in a

Taking people high up into the building through a vast central open area, the escalator ride afforded a glimpse of the varied attractions that occupied each floor – the Mad Bazooka bumper car ride, the Ghost Hunt

<p>It is the new CrossFit and Tough Mudder, and might actually be harder than both. But what’s the best way to survive it and improve your time?</p><p>If the word “Hyrox” sounds familiar, it’s probably because the obviously fit person in your office or at your child’s sports day was talking about it. Featuring 8k of running split up by eight mini-workouts, it’s the hottest new must-do event for people who love the gym <em>and</em> the ’Gram. Launched in 2017, it’s now sponsored by Red Bull, with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xufx5kUhWo0">sculpted superhumans</a> who win its world championships taking home a combined prize pot of $150,000 (£118,000).

Tropical Cyclone Megan, which developed in the Gulf of Carpentaria on Saturday, has been declared a category 3 cyclone by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Megan is forecast to make landfall on Monday, but has already brought gale-force winds and heavy rainfall to some areas over the weekend. Groote Eylandt was cut off after more than 400mm of rain in just 24 hours on Sunday.</p><p>There is a chance that Megan could strengthen further into a category 4 storm before making landfall, with the potential for damaging wind gusts of up to 125km/h.

Twenty years after their final show, they’re back, touring the UK with tales from the wireless’s wildest ride</p><p>You’ll remember Mark Radcliffe and Marc “the Boy Lard” Riley from their riotous Radio 1 shows in the 90s and early 00s, first late night on the graveyard shift in 1993, then in a short, ill-fitting turn as bleary-eyed DJs on the Radio 1 breakfast show in 1997, before conquering early afternoons from 1997 to 2004. (Riley’s nickname came after a back injury when he made the mistake of admitting he needed to “shift some lard”.) They brought us memorable catchphrases – “Stop … carry on!”, “by Jovi” and “wickedy wickedy warp” – as well as characters such as Fat Harry White (who was really just Radcliffe doing a Barry White impression into a vocoder). And they cared about the music, championing new bands, just so long as it wasn’t (as they pronounced it) the Stere-<em>O</em>phonics.</p><p>The

And they did, somehow, anyhow, with a goal from Antony and a goal from Amad Diallo. With twice as many wingers on the pitch (those two plus Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford) as defenders (just Harry Maguire and Diogo Dalot). After parking the bus at Anfield, Ten Hag revved the engine, and kept revving. Antony scored his first goal of the season against anyone other than Newport County. Diallo scored his first goal for United since a cute back-header against Milan, which happened so long ago that the manager was Ole Gunnar Solskjær. United had nine shots in extra time to Liverpool’s two. Rashford rose to the occasion at both ends of the game, first on the left wing, then at centre-forward. He missed two good chances but kept calm enough to take the next one. Ten Hag was like a fan, going: “Attack! Attack! Attack!” and it

Ireland and France occupied the table’s top two positions, as they did in 2023, with Wales and Italy in the bottom two and England and Scotland once again the meat in the club sandwich. Ireland, for the third year in a row, had the meanest defence and only the winless Welsh, strangely, managed to score more tries than last year.</p><p>Yet if this was not a vintage Six Nations in absolutely all respects, the old tournament is enjoying a refreshing renaissance. The competition is now so tight that 10 of the 15 matches were decided by four points or fewer, including all three of the final-round games.

In contrast to the supposed quaintness of farm life, the presence of violence is also emphasised; one scene, for instance, lingers on a goat being slaughtered.

<p>She outraged Mary Whitehouse, worked with Tina Turner, Elton John and Freddie Mercury, and is up for an Olivier for choreographing a smash hit production of Guys &amp; Dolls. Will she ever slow down? Not likely ...</p><p>Not long ago, trying to book Arlene Phillips in for a check-up, a nurse was trying to find a date she could make. “I said: ‘I’m sorry – I’m working.’ He said: ‘Well, it says here you’re 80. What are you doing working?’” She told him she had never given it much thought. “I wake up, I go to work, I love it.”</p><p>Not only is Phillips working – steadily, some might say relentlessly – she’s also producing some of her best, most creative work in her ninth decade. Alongside her associate James Cousins, she has just been nominated for an Olivier award for her choreography in the hit musical Guys &amp; Dolls. “I am looking to make sure that everything I do will be as inventive, unusual or as different as can be,” she says, “so I never have to repeat myself.”</p>

<p>Some artists have taken their work to Brussels, saying they no longer feel safe, yet the art market back home continues to boom</p><p>From a rocky perch a larger-than-life rendition of a female protester, clad in a hard hat and a gas mask, gazes over a city in turmoil. Known as Lady Liberty Hong Kong, the statue was hauled to the top of Lion Rock during the 2019 pro-democracy protests. It was meant to be her final resting place. But now all that remains of that intention is photographs. The statue was destroyed by unknown assailants the day after it was hauled up the peak, a landmark said to represent the resilient spirit of Hongkongers.</p><p>A photograph of Lady Liberty’s brief installation is one of several images relating to Hong Kong to be displayed in The Forbidden Art, an exhibition that opens on Monday in Brussels. Staged outside the EU parliament building, it aims to present a “fervent defence of artistic freedom as a fundamental human right”.</p> <a href="https:/

<p>After a successful Six Nations Peter O’Mahony’s men will now face the sternest test of all against the world champions</p><p>It was not quite what the Irish were dreaming of after maximum points from the first three rounds, but back-to-back championships puts this Ireland team in a small elite of Six Nations champions. They become the sixth team to have managed the feat and, interestingly, only the third, after Wales in 2012-13 and England in 2016-2017, to follow up a grand slam with the title. It is as if teams really want to beat you when you are grand-slam champions.</p><p>Peter O’Mahony had the air of a satisfied man. Twelve years after his Ireland debut, this has been his first full campaign as captain. It was, perhaps harshly, pointed out to him that he had never won a thing in nigh on 15 years as a captain (of Munster and intermittently Ireland), and now he has won twice in 10 months (Munster won the United Rugby Championship in May).</p> <a href="https://www.thegua

Audiences will wear headphones rather than masks and follow what Barrett called an audio-driven “linear story” rather than explore the “open world” of Punchdrunk’s trademark shows, which let you roam freely around the space. Theatregoers will, according to publicity material, “feel their way through a maze-like installation as
