Valve has launched Steam Families - a streamlined, enhanced version of its existing household game sharing tools - and it's available for testing now in public beta form.
</p><p>
Steam Families combines and replaces features previously available through Valve's Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View tools, and creates a way for up to six family members to share a combined games library - consisting of titles (including owned DLC) from across each member's individual library - that can be accessed at any time, with a few provisos.
</p><p>
The big caveat to all this is that games are only eligible for sharing if their developer hasn't chosen to opt out of the Steam Families scheme - but once that particular roadblock is cleared, the only other key restriction is that a single owned copy of a game can only be play

GOG has announced a new partnership with Amazon Luna that'll let its customers play the games they own across a range of supported devices via cloud streaming, starting "soon".

A new fan mod for Dark Souls 3 has been released offering a complete overhaul of the game that promises "a retelling of the Dark Souls universe".
</p><p>
Named Dark Souls: Archthrones, it's been created by Archthrones Team and is available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/1765/?tab=description">NexusMods</a> for free. The team comprises concept artists, writers, programmers, composers, and voice actors within the Souls community, according to its description.
</p><p>
Interestingly, it takes its cue from Demon's Souls in terms of level structure - hence the mod name being a play on the Archstones of FromSoftware's first Souls game.

AI may seem like something of a dirty word at the moment, but 62 percent of studios are using AI at some point during game development.
</p><p>
That's according to a new report by game engine maker <a href="https://unity.com/resources/gaming-report?isGated=false">Unity</a>, which reveals that more and more development studios are adopting AI tools to make time and efficiency savings.
</p><p>
In 2022 the average time to launch for games was 218 days; now it's 304 days, the report states. 71 percent of studios responding to the survey said AI had improved their delivery and operations, to reduce that time to launch.

Leaked specifications for Sony's unannounced PlayStation 5 Pro console have been posted online, and show the upgrades present in the souped-up console expected to launch later this year. 
</p><p>
Eurogamer understands these specifications - first reported on YouTube by <a href="https://youtu.be/SV7BJKnZfP8?feature=shared">Moore's Law is Dead</a> - to be legitimate and sourced from Sony's own internal developer network, to which numerous partners have access to. The specs have since been reported on and also corroborated by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-more-specs/">Insider Gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-specs-leak-online">IGN</a>.

Planet of Lana will be arriving on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation consoles next month. 
</p><p>
The cinematic sci-fi puzzler - which is in part inspired by the likes of Inside and Limbo - was first announced to be coming to additional platforms during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-nintendos-latest-indie-world-showcase">Nintendo's Indie World showcase last November</a>, although at this time the team only gave a loose spring release window.

Now, writing on social media platform X, developer Wishfully confirmed Planet of Lana will launch across Switch and PlayStation on 16th April.

I'm not just saying that because it's set on something that looks like an oil rig - I love oil rigs - and involves the collection of old audio cassettes. I'm saying that because it's a game that you play by <em>playing</em> - in the purest sense. You load up, ideally with no idea of what's coming your way, and then you prod and poke and work your way towards an understanding, not just of what's going on, but of how everything operates in the most basic of manners.</p><p>If you do want to know a bit more, I can tell you. This is a puzzle game of sorts, set within a series of dioramas. You explore the oil rig, room by room, opening doors, following paths and getting lost. Some screens just have doors, while some might have a piece of machinery with a missing cog, say, or

Developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone is releasing daily patch notes for the farming sim's long-awaited next update, due out tomorrow on PC.

The latest of these simply reads "you can now drink mayonnaise". I'm unsure exactly why you'd want to do that. Presumably there are some in-game health benefits, but I can't think of anything worse than chugging down a jar of Hellmann's.
