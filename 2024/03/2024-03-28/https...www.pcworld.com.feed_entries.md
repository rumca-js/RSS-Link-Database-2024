<p>Determining the specs for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2854456/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">a new laptop</a> (or a laptop upgrade) can be a delicate balancing act. You want to spend enough so you won&rsquo;t be miserable in the future, but not so much that you don&rsquo;t make use of all the hardware you get.</p>



<p>Memory (or RAM) is the perfect example of this. Your PC uses RAM to hold data temporarily: When you&rsquo;re opening applications, working on large files in Photoshop, or even juggling dozens and dozens of browser tabs, that data is being stored in the system memory, not on your SSD or HDD. The more memory-intensive tasks you do, the more RAM you should have. It&rsquo;ll keep your computer feeling fast and responsive.</p>



<p>Many laptop shoppers know this, but not exactly how much to get. So we&rsquo;ve broken down what to e

<p>PCWorld contributor Will Smith loves him some <em>Fortnite. </em>(Don&rsquo;t hate, it&rsquo;s a solid online shooter!) But for the last few months, his gaming PC has been crashing soon after he departs for his mid-air bus stop. So Will took it in to the PCWorld labs to diagnose the issue and hopefully get it fixed. You can follow along with the process in our latest YouTube video. </p>



<p>Will&rsquo;s a veteran of PC gaming, so he&rsquo;s tried all the usual easy fixes &mdash; reinstalling the game, reinstalling the drivers, turning off all his overclocking&hellip; no dice. So Will and Adam go through the scientific process of hardware diagnosis: replacing parts one by one until the problem goes away. </p>

<p>&ldquo;AI&rdquo; is the buzzword for just about everything this year. Nvidia is probably the biggest benefactor of the AI trend, but it&rsquo;s not content to sit on its laurels and sell billions of dollars in silicon. The company&rsquo;s newest developer tool, the Avatar Cloud Engine, could help game devs make non-player characters in a fraction of the time it takes today. </p>

<p>Enshrining the rights of consumers and third-party technicians to repair their own devices is a long slog of a legal process, but Oregon just took a big step forward. The state just signed its new Right to Repair bill into law, notably adding a measure that others were missing: It&rsquo;ll soon be illegal to pair up hardware parts with software checks that block replacements. </p>



<p>Governor Tina Kotek signed the law in yesterday, and it will take effect starting in 2025 and applying to some hardware as far back as 2015. It was a surprisingly bipartisan effort in an otherwise bitterly divided political climate, with the Oregon state House of Representatives passing it by 42-13 and the Senate going 25-5. &ldquo;This is a win for consumers and will help bridge our digital divide and support small businesses across our state,&rdquo; said Kotek. </p>

<p>Testing a webcam seems easy enough: Assemble a bunch of them, use them to take photos or video, and compare the results. But it&rsquo;s worth it to go further.</p>



<p>When recommending a webcam, I want it to do one simple thing: allow you to look your best on a Teams or Zoom or Google video call, and for as little as possible. Since you likely own a laptop, and most laptops have webcams, that means you&rsquo;ll be happiest with a webcam that offers significant improvements over what you already own.</p>



<p>All of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-4k-webcam-buying-guide.html">PCWorld&rsquo;s recommendations for the best webcams</a> are evaluated by the same criteria, which include:</p>



<ul>
<li>The price of the webcam, versus the competition</li>



<li>The webcam&rsquo;s features, which includes resolution, refresh rate, and more</li>

<p>Partitioning your hard drive makes managing the operating system, files, and file formats of each partition easier. For example, you can install Windows 11/10 on one partition and store movies or music on another. When you don&rsquo;t want these movies, you can directly format the current partition, which will not harm your system and relevant data on the other partition.</p>
