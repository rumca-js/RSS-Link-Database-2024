<p>The Derry Girls actor is funny to her bones in this sitcom about mental health and long-term friendship. It’s full of lovely touches, if not enough nuance</p><p>In the opening episode of Big Mood, struggling playwright Maggie (Derry Girls’ and Bridgerton’s Nicola Coughlan) is on a mission. And on a scooter. But that was an expensive mistake, so she gives it away to a passerby. She needs her best friend Eddie (It’s a Sin’s Lydia West) to take the day off work, running the bar her late dad left her, and come with her to her old secondary school, where she has been invited to make a speech about her career in the theatre. Maggie is hoping to meet her old history teacher, Mr Wilson, on whom she developed a passionate teenage crush after he saved her from lecherous maths teacher Mr Phillips. “Because <em>he</em> wouldn’t shag a child!” she beams, full of blissful memory. “Wow,” says Eddie. “We should nominate him for a Pride of Britain award.”</p><p>Off they go, and a parade of increasi

They have conceded points at will, been beaten heavily on numerous occasions and it already seems inevitable that a difficult season at the foot of the table lies ahead for the Tigers.</p><p>But for 40 minutes here, their fortunes seemed to have turned for the better. They were much improved against Leeds Rhinos, and were arguably the game’s dominant side. However, the one thing missing from that spirited first-half display in attritional conditions was the one thing that matters most: points on the board. And when the t

<p>God’s Ghostwriters by Candida Moss aims to shine a light on the contributions to Christianity by imprisoned workers</p><p>Enslaved people wrote the Bible, carried the messages of the apostles and spread the word of Jesus around the Roman empire, according to a shocking new book by the theology professor Candida Moss. God’s Ghostwriters: Enslaved Christians and the Making of the Bible argues that apostles and early Christians used enslaved scribes, secretaries and messengers to write the New Testament and shape the very foundations of Christianity.</p><p>“The overwhelming literary and archeological evidence shows that this kind of work was done by enslaved or formerly enslaved people,” says Moss, the Edward Cadbury professor of theology at the University of Birmingham. Scholars think only about 5-10% of Romans were literate: the very wealthy – and the people they enslaved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/28/you-can-see-it-as-a-revenge-fantasy-the-new-book-arg

As the clock ticks down to kick-off on Sunday, you can be sure commentators tasked with covering the game will have spent long evenings working diligently on their painstakingly scripted “ad-libs”, fervently hoping Arsenal’s No 9 will score the winning goal. Ideally, a strike that finishes a most unlikely comeback for his team. Suffice to say that Football Daily has got its Peter Drury bingo card ready and phrases such as “divine intervention”, “back from the dead” and the rather snappy “Arsenal looked doomed on their Etihad Calvary but Jesus has resurrected their title hopes on this Easter Sunday!” all feature.</p><p>Interesting reading the ‘Paul Bodin moment for the modern

The former Welsh rugby union star is <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10114663-nfl-rumors-chiefs-signing-louis-rees-zammit-to-contract-rugby-star-will-play-rbwr">reportedly nearing a deal</a> to join the Kansas City Chiefs, the back-to-back Super Bowl champions.</p><p>Rees-Zammit is likely to join the team for their annual training camp, a kind of extended trial as he learns the rigors of the NFL. He will join a 90-man training camp roster that will eventually be whittled down to 53, with 16 further places up for grabs on the practice squad, an effective reserve team. This season also marks the first time that teams will have an extra spot available on the practice squad carved out for players who have come through

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells, London</strong><br />Given its UK premiere by English National Ballet, Johan Inger’s new version of the Bizet story cuts out cliche and embraces the bleakness – albeit at the expense of some passion</p><p>Who is Carmen? A free-spirited lover, a woman bent on destruction, or a pragmatist using the only currency she has to get what she wants? In Johan Inger’s ballet, given its UK premiere by English National Ballet, it’s hard to say. She flirts (and more) with every man she passes, but merely for sport it seems. And it turns out this is not really Carmen’s ballet – she doesn’t even get a solo – and the story belongs to Don José (Rentaro Nakaaki), a man so tortured by the fantasy of a woman who will never love him that it leads him to murder her.<br /><br />The bleakness only comes later though. It all starts out much warmer, with Bizet’s perky overture and the lively impulse and attack of the choreography. You feel a rush of energy as the women arrive

Jack Black returns as dumpling-loving panda Po, the unlikeliest of lean, mean fightin’ machines. It’s been eight years since Kung Fu Panda 3, and on the evidence here, the delay can’t be put down to KFP4 being a labour of love, the product of animation studio DreamWorks’ A team pouring in enormous amounts of effort. It’s a hurricane of slapstick (some of it in fact very funny) and age-appropriate energetic fight scenes, but lacks the sweetness and charm of the franchise at its best. It failed the wriggle test on my seven-year-old cinema date, who was squirming in her seat around the hour mark.</p><p>The plot is a bit overfussy for its target audience of small kids, though the scriptwriters have been careful to make it work for newbies – no previous Kung Fu Panda experience necessary.

<p>While France and England are among the favourites, Austria could spring a surprise</p><p>This was not a vintage window for Didier Deschamps’ side with a home defeat against Germany followed up by a shaky 3-2 win against Chile in Marseille. The captain, Kylian Mbappé, had a difficult few days and the absence of Antoine Griezmann, who missed his first France games for seven years because of injury, was clearly felt. There were positives, however, with the 18-year-old Warren Zaïre-Emery having a good game against Germany and Randal Kolo Muani scoring and assisting against Chile. Deschamps made nine changes for the second game with William Saliba getting a rare start in Marseille, even though the coach had said beforehand that the Arsenal player “does things he doesn’t like”.
