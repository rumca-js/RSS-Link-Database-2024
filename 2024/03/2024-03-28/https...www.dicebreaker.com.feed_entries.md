A planeswalker originally introduced in 2019&rsquo;s Throne of Eldraine set, and headlining the upcoming Outlaws of Thunder Junction set, Oko ticks all the boxes when it comes to characters I&rsquo;m into - he&rsquo;s a mischievous, charismatic faerie antihero with a dark past and a distaste for authority. This isn&rsquo;t even mentioning his appearance, which definitely plays a major factor in Oko&rsquo;s appeal as a character.</p><p>The artists at Wizards of the Coast knew what they were doing when they designed Oko in Throne of Eldraine. It&rsquo;s not just his fine facial features and the fact that he&rsquo;s always depicted as being bare-chested, though those things certainly help. It&rsquo;s the blue face a

I usually myself talk more about <em>how </em>I play rather than <em>what </em>games in particular I play. I will play the occasional game that the kids can play completely, but often I find myself playing games that are beyond my youthful opponents - games that I simply want to play with them.</p><p>When I first introduce a game, I am usually doing something I call semi-solitaire play. As the children learn over many games, I will shift over to handicapped play of some form. I find that it is not important to tell children many rules - after all, kids are used to navigating the world with partial information. I teach the bare minimum for them to get s
