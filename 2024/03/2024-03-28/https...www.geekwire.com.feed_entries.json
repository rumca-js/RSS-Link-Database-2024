Gov. Jay Inslee today is signing legislation that clearly establishes fusion power &#8212; energy that&#8217;s made by slamming together small atoms under high pressure &#8212; as a source of clean energy that could help the state meet its climate goals. The measure, SHB 1942, also requires the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council and the Department of Health to form a work group of relevant state agencies to begin exploring&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/a-boost-for-fusion-power-with-new-law-washington-state-leaders-signal-support-for-sectors-next-steps/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/a-boost-for-fusion-power-with-new-law-washington-state-leaders-signal-support-for-sectors-next-steps", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "A boost for fusion power: With new law, Washington state leaders signal support for sector\u2019s next steps", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-28T15:16:35+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"644\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/LI_Post-AO_OB_Signup_Palm_Side.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><br />Amazon released a new mobile app for its Amazon One palm-recognition technology, letting users sign up for the service on their phones by taking a photo of their palm to register it for later use for entry, identification and payment. Up to this point, the initial signup and palm registration has been limited to in-store kiosks. Amazon says the ability to sign up separately on the app in advance is meant to make the experience smoother for first-time users. In a post Thursday morning, Dilip Kumar, vice president of Amazon Web Services Applications, says the Amazon One app includes a&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazons-palm-recognition-tech-gets-its-own-mobile-app-with-new-ai-matching-capability/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazons-palm-recognition-tech-gets-its-own-mobile-app-with-new-ai-matching-capability", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "Amazon\u2019s palm-recognition tech gets its own mobile app, with new AI matching capability", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-28T14:00:00+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"1030\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jenhaller-1260x1030.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />\u2014\u00a0Startup veteran Jen Haller has been named partner at Ascend, the Seattle-based pre-seed venture capital firm.

A senior at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Githens grew up in Issaquah, Wash., in a part of the region that people in Seattle call the Eastside. He has spent his college years in a part of the state that people in Spokane call the other Eastside or, if they&#8217;re feeling cheeky, the real Eastside. Githens, 22, a business administration major with a concentration in finance, never imagined starting his career in Spokane. But that changed after he connected with the startup scene, led by determined business and community&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/from-timber-to-tech-spokanes-startup-scene-is-ready-for-its-big-breakthrough/\">Read More</a>", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2024/from-timber-to-tech-spokanes-startup-scene-is-ready-for-its-big-breakthrough", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed", "source_obj__id": 131, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": null, "title": "From timber to tech: Spokane\u2019s startup scene is ready for its big breakthrough", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-28T13:29:00+00:00", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-0131-Governor-Tech-Hub-Panel-20-1-1260x840.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />SPOKANE, Wash. \u2014 Lisa Brown brings a unique background to her role as Spokane&#8217;s mayor, taking office in January after a tightly contested race.
