In today's Daily Fix:
The embattled Embracer Group has found a buyer for Gearbox Software: Take-Two Interactive. Take-Two's 2K division already has a relationship with Gearbox, as the publisher of the Borderlands Games. And speaking of Borderlands, a new game in the series has been confirmed to be in development. In other news, Helldivers now have two new weapons to deploy: the quasar cannon and the MG-101 heavy machine gun. The quasar specifically has already proven to be effective against the Automaton hordes. And finally, the gaming industry layoffs continue with both Nintendo and Sega announcing cuts. Nintendo has said that some contractor positions within their testing departments will not be extended, but they are adding new full-time positions. Sega has revealed about 240 roles being affected across their various divisions, and the sale of Relic Entertainment. IGN wishes those impacted by these cuts the best of luck in an already crowded job market.

## Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2 Review

Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2, reviewed by Matt Donato.

Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2 doubles down on a smorgasbord of satisfying slasher kills, employing some gumption and gnarliness in pursuit of a sick, twisted, and self-aware horror curveball. Rhys Frake-Waterfield's sequel looks infinitely better – and with ten times the budget, it ought to – but that doesn’t excuse the many flaws it inherited from the first Hundred Acre horror flick. Blood and Honey 2 is a story that craves substance beyond Winnie-the-Pooh decapitating ravers. It boasts a nastier midnight-movie appeal, radical practical effects, and a brisk 90-minute runtime. It’s a shaky first step for Frake-Waterfield’s proposed “Poohniverse” concept – but it’s a step in the right direction.

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, reviewed by D. Hood.

Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is a textbook visual thrill ride punctuated by brief moments of forced emotion and little else. Director Adam Wingard has a lot of fun with textures, colors, and camera work, and he’s adept at giving fans the over-the-top monster action that they demand via an imposing new villain. Unfortunately, there’s no time to spend on making things make sense or even matter all that much, and what few emotional punches are thrown lack the necessary wind up to connect, save for some very well done moments between Kong and his Hollow Earth kin.

Pepper Grinder reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on Nintendo Switch.

"Like its diminutive main character, Pepper Grinder may be a little on the short side, but even this small pinch of Pepper still packs plenty of punch. Plowing through platforms feels fantastic, no two levels ever seem the same, and there are some wonderfully destructive toys to discover and employ along the way. I do wish the boss fights outside of the final encounter were a bit more challenging, and the lack of anything meaningful to buy in the in-game store meant I didn’t feel compelled to take too many return trips through each world to collect any missed currency and extend my playtime. But if you’re in the mood for a short but sweet slice of propulsive platforming action of a kind rarely seen since Ecco the Dolphin’s last adventure, Pepper Grinder is all driller and no filler."

The question of which cinematic titan is king – or queen – of them all has been one that viewers and studios have been asking even before the 1962 release of King Kong vs. Godzilla. That primal battle between lizard and monkey draws something out in each of us, including the cast of the latest film in Legendary’s MonsterVerse.

When we chatted with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire director Adam Wingard and the cast of the new film, the ultimate question of course came up: Who is the true King of the Monsters? Not surprisingly, they had some very strong opinions.
