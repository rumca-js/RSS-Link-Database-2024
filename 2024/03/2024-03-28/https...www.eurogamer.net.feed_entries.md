A cavalcade of indie talent - including the studios behind Dead Cells, Darkest Dungeon, Vampire Survivors, Deep Rock Galactic, and Slay the Spire - has joined forces to launch a new 45-minute "no-nonsense" indie games showcase that's set to air on 10th April this year.
</p><p>
Officially known as the Triple-i Initiative Showcase, the newly announced digital event promises "major announcements and reveals" from the likes of Slay the Spire studio Mega Crit, Darkest Dungeon developer Red Hook Studios, Terraria team Re-Logic, and Evil Empire, the developer formerly responsible for Dead Cells' impressive post-launch support.
</p><p>
In fact, the whole Triple-i Initiative was born from an idea by Evil Empire, which says the goal of Triple-i is to create a "straight-to-the-point show packed with announcements as a collective of studios, to speak

What do optimised settings look like? What about Steam Deck? And are any lingering issues that should be addressed in future updates?</p><p>Kicking off with those all-important optimised settings, we had additional insight into making our selections owing to our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-big-horizon-forbidden-west-pc-tech-interview">in-depth conversation with Guerrilla Games and Nixxes</a>, as documented on Eurogamer last week. For example, some settings are there for completeness's sake but won't really impact performance on most gaming PCs. Take ambient occlusion, for starters. There's an SSAO opt

Epic has announced the next lot of games going free on its PC store front, with The Outer Worlds and Thief getting the Epic Games Store freebie treatment starting Thursday, 4th April.
</p><p>
The Outer Worlds - Obsidian Entertainment's 2019 satirical space-faring RPG - arrives in the form of its Spacer's Choice Edition which, if you're unfamiliar, is last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outer-worlds-spacers-choice-edition-out-next-week">all-inclusive spruce-up</a>.

Capcom's big Monster Hunter Wilds reveal in December might have been eye-catching, but it was a little light on detail; but now, new leaks have shed a little more light on the developer's plans, claiming this latest series instalment will be fully open world and launching in Q1 2025.
</p><p>
That's according to reliable leaker Dusk Golem, who recently shared a few scraps of fresh Monster Hunter Wilds information <a href="https://imgur.com/qo3yjyr">over on Discord</a>. Perhaps the biggest claim is that - as had been speculated following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-first-look-at-monster-hunter-wilds-coming-in-2025">December's striking trailer reveal</a> - Wilds will be "fully open world" rather than segmented into discrete explorable areas as was the case in previous games.

This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss who might pick up the baton and develop a potential Baldur's Gate 4 - now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">BG3 studio Larian has confirmed it is leaving the franchise behind</a>. </p><p>The rights to Baldur's Gate of course belong to Wizards of the Coast, who are free to enlist another studio to make further games in the Dungeons and Dragons universe - and even use Larian's characters. And considering how well BG3 has been received, it would seem financially prudent for a publisher to mount some kind of follow-up at some point. Perhaps BioWare might like to give it another go?</p><p>Alternatively you could argue - and Larian's own Swen Vinck

Valheim publisher Coffee Stain has announced a deck-building roguelike from a couple of developers previously at  Stunlock Studios, the outfit best known for V Rising.

Box Dragon was set up by Kevin Chang and Karl Bergstr&ouml;m two years ago; today they announce details of the studio's debut game As We Descend.

The game will feature turn-based card battles set in a dystopian "feudal cityscape".

Earthblade, the next project from Celeste developer Extremely OK Games, won't be out in 2024, but progress is being made.

The studio's director <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2024-03-27-earthblade-update/">Maddy Thorson shared a new update</a> and while "this game ain't coming out in 2024", progress is not "stagnant" and the team is "still excited to work on it".

Game designer Kyle Pulver has now joined the development team - Pulver has worked on a number of small projects and was world champion of TowerFall.

I have quite distinct memories of SNES classic Secret of Mana, despite not playing it too much. It's the visuals that stick in my mind: the bright greens of its forest environments, the electric yellows and pinks of its cute plant and bug enemies, and of course the colossal tree and its tangled roots seen in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-secret-of-mana-and-the-art-of-a-good-box">game's iconic box artwork</a>.
</p><p>
All of this came flooding back to me as I played a demo of Visions of Mana, the next game in the long-running series. Its key artwork alone is a callback to the original, its heroes looking out at another giant tree as the sun sets behind, bathing its autumnal growths in a warm light. And that's before you step into the game's open world.

It turns out, this artistic callback is de

Twitch has once again updated its <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#20SexualContent">community guidelines</a> to prohibit sexualised content, this time preventing streamers using their bodies as a green screen.

</p><p>
From 29th March, "content that focuses on intimate body parts for a prolonged period of time" won't be allowed, defined as buttocks, groin, or breasts.
</p><p>
"Content on Twitch is always evolving, and we want to make sure our rules work as intended and keep up with emerging behaviours," reads a post from Twitch on social media site X. "When needed, we make updates to our rules to capture those shifts in behaviour, and so it's clear to the community what is allowed."

Sony has successfully won a patent infringement lawsuit in which it was being sued for $500m, after a US District Court judge ruled in the PlayStation company's favour.
</p><p>
The lawsuit was based on Sony's controller-to-console communication method, with Genuine Enabling Technology - a company with a history of lawsuits over technology patents - seeking $500m in damages. GET initially filed a complaint against the company back in 2017, claiming Sony had infringed on its patent. </p><p>Specifically, this patent was entitled 'Method and Apparatus for Producing a Combined Data Stream and Recovering Therefrom the Respective User Input Stream and at Least One Input Signal'.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/judge-rules-in-sonys-favour-in-500m-controller-lawsuit?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=

</p><p>
A public user survey is now available to complete, and asks whether you would be interested in purchasing extra content for Dragon's Dogma 2 if it was released. A follow-up question then asks what you'd like to see in that future DLC, and how much you might pay for it.
</p><p>
The topic of DLC has been a hot-button issue for Dragon's Dogma 2, after the game received backlash at  launch for an array of paid unlocks to make the experience easier (although all items you can buy can also be found in-game, albeit in more limited amounts).
