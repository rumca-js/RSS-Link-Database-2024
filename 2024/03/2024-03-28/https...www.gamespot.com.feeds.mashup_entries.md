<p>Indie game developer and publisher Crescent Moon Games and Those Dang Games recently revealed its latest game, Screenbound. What's especially unique about this game is that it's played in both 2D and 3D.</p><p>A video posted to <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1772648122524577939">X/Twitter by @ JakeSucky</a> showcases firsthand how the game runs. Players control a person playing a Game Boy-like system while running around certain obstacles. But the catch is that whenever the player moves, their Game Boy character will also move, and on top of that, the handheld character will also have to fight monsters to progress forward.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">These 3 indie devs are working on a game in which you play in 3D and 2D... at the same time<br />This looks insane lol <a href="https://t.co/nmWRagC1W2">pic.twitter.com/nmWRagC1W2</a></p>  — Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1772648122524577939

Reviewer Phil Owen wrote, "Godzilla x Kong is instead just a sleek and very well made action movie with a coherent story that wraps itself up well before you'll get the chance to be tired of it, and yet never feels like it had half its plot removed the way most Marvel movies do in recent years."</p><div>          </div><p>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is directed by Adam Wingard, who had directed the previous installment Godzilla vs Kong.

I can't attest to the science--or lack thereof--behind this statement, but as a writer born into a long line of guarded women who wielded pens as weapons, I can absolutely relate.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, I have a particular fondness for mother-daughter stories and the catharsis they can offer. When I heard the team behind Gone Home would be tackling the subject in their upcoming game Open Roads, I braced for a beautiful cross-country journey that would inevitably hit too close to home. However, while Open Roads has moments of relatability that are powered by solid dialogue, charming characters, and nostalgia, I was ultimately left underwhelmed by the walk-and-click exploration game. With a runtime too short to truly pull players in and an abrupt ending that leaves things feeling hastily resolved, Open Roads feel

<p>It's almost been 20 years since the first Twilight book by Stephenie Meyer hit bookshelves. The film series that adapted the story of Bella Swan and the macabre love triangle became worldwide hits and forever added "Team Edward" and "Team Jacob" into our vocabulary.</p><p>Despite the vitriol the series got from critics, nobody was probably more aware of how ill-written the series was than stars Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart who played Edward and Bella throughout the films. Pattinson notoriously sliced the films apart while on the DVD commentary and even now Stewart wishes she could have saved Bella from her vampire lover.</p><p>On a recent episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kristen-stewart-is-no-basic-b/id1444559244?i=1000650457836">Not Skinny But Not Fat podcast</a>, Stewart says she's over the character but has plenty of love for Bella.

I've since put over 100 hours into the game, and that remains true to this day. A horror game can rarely be affecting for that long. Usually, exposure should desensitize you to even the genre's all-time greats. But the unpredictable nature of the PvP game makes each round feel like a new horror story unfolding around me.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond the famous family and their taunting dialogue, the maps arranged like dizzying death traps, and the final girl (or guy) music that pulsates like an encroaching cacophony of violence, there's another layer that adds to the haunting atmosphere of the game--but it's easily missed. At the start of each round, brief excerpts of radio broadcasts can be heard. These range from seemingly innocuous baseball recaps to reports of mu

<p dir="ltr">In some ways, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is just another mega-budget Hollywood CGI spectacle, something we've seen a ton of examples of every year for the past two decades and change. But, like the previous MonsterVerse movies, Godzilla x Kong has its own distinct vibe and aesthetic that sets it apart from all those generic blockbusters that the studios and streamers keep churning out. Sure, there's no meaningful substance to be found on this titanic adventure, but you don't really need it when your movie is otherwise this fun and well put together.</p><p dir="ltr">Some time has passed since Godzilla and King Kong devastated Hong Kong when they fought both each other and Mecha-Godzilla in the last movie, and everybody's trying their best to get used to living with these massive beings who keep accidentally slaughtering huge amounts of people while they go about their business--at the beginning of the movie, Godzilla has to fight yet another titan in Rome, before curl

<p dir="ltr">It only takes a glance to understand Pepper Grinder's inventive gimmick. A small girl named Pepper--a pirate by trade--wields a drill named Grinder that's roughly the size of her entire body. The gear allows her to grind through soft surfaces with ease, complete with the ability to launch out of the surface with a leap. That might have been enough to carry the game by itself, but what's most surprising about Pepper Grinder is its sheer variety. Though it's short, that brevity helps to make the campaign a no-filler thrill ride that continuously pushes the boundaries of its central mechanic.</p><p dir="ltr">It turns out Grinder is a pretty versatile tool, even regarding its most basic function. You can burrow through the ground, which immediately feels natural and smooth. At the same time, you can't simply turn on a dime with an instant about-face like a typical platformer--you have to handle turns by curving an arc out of your drilling path. Additionally, when you pop out

<p>An enduring fan theory about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> is that the battle royale mode is populated in part by bots.

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone is a challenging battle royale game that requires skill and patience to be the last soldier or team standing.
