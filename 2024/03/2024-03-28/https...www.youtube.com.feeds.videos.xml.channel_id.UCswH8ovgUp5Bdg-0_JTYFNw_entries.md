Today is my conversation with journalist and writer Alex Berenson. You can find his work on Substack at alexberenson.substack.com

Alex started reporting on the pharmaceutical industry and financial crime for the New York Times in 1999. He also served two stints as a correspondent in Iraq in 2003 and 2004 before leaving the Times in 2010.

During our conversation, we delved into his experiences in the legacy media, his insights on the pandemic and vaccines, and we also engaged in a discussion about our differing perspectives on the Ukraine conflict.
