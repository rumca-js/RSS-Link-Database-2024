<p>Australia’s first unit dedicated to human challenge trials for novel vaccines and treatments has opened. But what are the ethics of infecting healthy people – and who would do it?</p><p>Green plants, cool tones, casually placed scatter cushions: this living room in East Melbourne could belong to – or at least, be rented by – any millennial. The squeaky corridor floors are a giveaway, though; along with the beds on wheels.</p><p>This isn’t a real estate opportunity, but Doherty Clinical Trials (DCT) – Australia’s first unit dedicated to human challenge studies, where trial participants are given a dose of an infectious disease in a controlled setting. An offshoot of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne, it opens on Monday – a breeding ground, its proprietors hope, for discoveries that may redefine the future of disease.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/29/people-assume-youre-crazy-for-doing-it-the-melbo

<p>The stakes in the grand final rematch at the Gabba were greater than usual but the Pies’ tackling proved the difference</p><p>“What is tackles?” Pep Guardiola asked not long after he had arrived in England. The robust Premier League way of playing held no interest for him. But tackles were everything to Collingwood on Thursday night. They’d barely stuck a decent tackle in the preceding three weeks. All week, they spoke about rectifying it.</p><p>By the early part of the second term at the Gabba, they had 32 tackles to Brisbane’s dozen and by game’s end it was 84 to 52. For all the ebbs, flows and momentum shifts of the grand final rematch, it was the Pies’ tackling that was the difference. “We need to get more tackles and we need to get more effective with them,” Chris Fagan said afterwards. Brisbane’s tendency to over-handball, he said, invited Collingwood’s pressure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/mar/29/collingwood-magpies-brisbane-lions-afl-grand-final

<p><strong>Andres/Segev/Metropolis Ensemble/Cyr<br />(Nonesuch)<br /></strong>These three works showcase the US composer’s distinctive and accomplished musical language</p><p>Like a number of US composers of the thirtysomething generation, Timo Andres takes the minimalism of John Adams and Philip Glass as the starting point for his eclectic musical language. But as shown by the solo piano Colorful History, which Andres himself plays as the centrepiece to this collection, his music explores a much broader musical landscape.</p><p>The solo piece, a chaconne of increasing complexity, is framed by two concertos: The Blind Banister for piano from 2017 (composed for Jonathan Biss, but with Andres as the soloist here) and Upstate Obscura for cello. The piano concerto (Andres’s third for the instrument) was commissioned as part of a series inspired by Beethoven’s five examples: for Andres, the pairing was with the second piano concerto, but there’s no hint of Beethovenian pastiche or allusion

Sure, it has its perks – more energy, first loves, first everythings – but I feel for the under-25s with still so many life hurdles left to clear. With the list of current social ills ranging from the housing crisis to social isolation and the any-day-now background note of environmental doom, I think it’s fair to say it’s not easy for young people today.</p><p>So when research last week from <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/gen-z-costing-parents-refusing-learn-drive/">MoneySuperMarket</a> found that driving age under-25s were costing their parents £1,300 a year in additional fuel from being ferried around – sparking unpleasant commentary about feckless young people “refusing” to drive – I found myself thinking: “Leave the kids alone, they’re doing their best!”</p> <a href="https:/

The end is nigh. “In the industrial age, automation came for the shoemaker and the factory-line worker,” writes Dennis Yi Tenen near the start of Literary Theory for Robots. “Today, it has come&nbsp;for the writer, the professor, the physician, the programmer and the attorney.” Like the end-of-the-planet movies that pelted the multiplexes at the turn of the millennium, newspapers and – increasingly – bookshops are awash with economists, futurologists and social semioticians talking up, down and about artificial intelligence.

<p>From picking a perfect fragrance to spraying your radiators and getting rid of the worst stinks, here is how to make sure your life always smells sweet</p><p>From a fancy fragrance to a simple bowl of oranges, scent can transform how you feel about yourself, another person or a place. But how can you work out what suits the moment? And the best way to get rid of a stink? Perfumers reveal how to make your world smell fantastic.<br /><br /><strong>1. Smell is an extreme sensation<br /></strong>“Scent provokes a visceral reaction,” says <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jacksonlloydezra/?hl=en-gb">Ezra-Lloyd Jackson</a>, a perfumer and artist who makes wearable fragrances under the brand name <a href="https://wearedeya.com">deya</a> and creates scent installations for art exhibitions.
