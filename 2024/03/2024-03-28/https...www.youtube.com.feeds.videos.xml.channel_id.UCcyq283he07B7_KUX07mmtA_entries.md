We got an inside look at how new United States Marine Corps officers are trained at The Basic School, a seven-month program that challenges newly commissioned second lieutenants physically, academically, and tactically.

Chief video correspondent Graham Flanagan spent five days inside The Basic School at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia, where he observed five different companies in various stages of training. While Marine Corps officers lead enlisted Marines in combat, in some trainings at The Basic School, they play the roles of enlisted Marines.

These lessons are intended to help them develop hands-on experience performing the tasks that they'll be commanding their subordinates to perform.The Basic School culminates with a crucible known as The War, where students are divided into opposing forces and must strategically battle to seize and defend a city.

Service members from countries like Greece, the Bahamas, and the Netherlands also attend The Basic School.
