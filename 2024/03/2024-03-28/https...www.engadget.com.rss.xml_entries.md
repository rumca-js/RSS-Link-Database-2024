<p>Apple will finally launch new iPads in early May, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-28/when-is-the-new-ipad-pro-ipad-air-coming-out-apple-plans-early-may-launch">according to</a> <em>Bloomberg</em>‚Äôs Mark Gurman. Expected are a new iPad Pro with an OLED display and a faster iPad Air, including a 12.9-inch model for the first time in that lineup. The details of the upcoming iPad models have been consistent, circulating through the rumor mill <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-ipad-refresh-next-year-could-bring-oled-ipad-pros-and-a-129-inch-ipad-air-193729591.html">since last year</a>.</p>
<p>The new iPad Pro models will reportedly add OLED displays (offering <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-09-oled-tvs-will-finally-take-off-in-2017.html">deeper blacks and richer colors</a>) and run on the new M3 chip, already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-14-inch-and-16-inch-review-an-m3-chip-for-every-situation-140048

<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-one-app"><ins>just launched an app</ins></a> that lets people sign up for its palm recognition service without having to head to an in-store kiosk. The Amazon One app uses a smartphone‚Äôs camera to take a photo of a palm print to set up an account. Once signed up, you can pay for stuff by using just your hand, ending the tyranny of having to carry a smartphone, cash or a burdensome plastic card.</p>
<p>The tech uses generative AI to analyze a palm's vein structure, turning the data into a ‚Äúunique numerical, vector representation‚Äù which is recognized by scanning machines at retail locations. You‚Äôll have to add a payment method within the app to get started and upload a photo of your ID for the purpose of age verification.</p>

<p>Walmart ag ‚Äôd have to sell a kidney to afford a giantg 4K TV for the living room. That is no longer true, as television prices continue to decline. Case in point? Vizio just announced a new 86-inch 4K smart TV that costs just $999.</p>
<p>The first thing worth mentioning about the latest member of Vizio‚Äôs lineup of 4K televisions is its size. The next-biggest model is 75 inches and that‚Äôs already large enough to absolutely take over most spaces. This thing will be like having a Times Square billboard in your living room. That's not a bad thing, particularly for home theater buffs.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We don‚Äôt know how this set will look in action yet, but it does offer a serious batch of features. Vizio says it ‚Äúboasts the same powerful picture quality as its predecessors‚Äù, thanks to the inclusion of Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10+. The company also promises the TV can run games at 120 fps once you switch to 1080p. Here‚Äôs hoping the product

<p>Disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was just sentenced to 25 years behind bars in a ruling handed forth New York's Southern District Court. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan announced the decision this morning.</p>

Today, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hulu-on-disney-officially-launches-bringing-together-mickey-mouse-and-the-handmaids-tale-152114434.html">Hulu on Disney+ is officially out of beta</a>, making it easy for subscribers to access content for both services. It‚Äôs also a way for Disney to push its Hulu bundle, which starts at $9.99 a month with ads. And if you want to go ad-free and download content for offline viewing, there‚Äôs the Duo Premium bundle for $19.99 a month.</p>
<p>All your favorite Hulu content is in its own tab, but the big shows (like <em>Shogun</em>) will feature in the main show carousel too. However, if you‚Äôre a long-running Hulu viewer, you‚Äôll lose your viewing progress on things you‚Äôve already watched or half-watched.</p>

If you're out of the loop on all things Twitch, there's a trend going around of streamers projecting their gameplays on green-screened body parts, usually intimate ones like butts and breasts. Because normal picture-in-picture is now apparently too boring. Twitch is putting a stop to its streamers' shenanigans, though, and will <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#20SexualContent">officially prohibit</a> &quot;content that focuses on clothed intimate body parts such as the buttocks, groin, or breasts for extended periods of time&quot; starting on March 29.</p>

<p>Gaming laptops are the true Transformers of the PC world: They‚Äôre powerful enough to play your favorite titles, but you can also harness their speed for media creation or extreme multitasking, like streaming high-resolution gameplay to Twitch. Today, you can even find a few that weight less than the smallest MacBook Pro, making them solid options for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html">daily drivers</a> as well.

<p>It's been five months since President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sweeping-white-house-ai-executive-order-takes-aim-at-the-technologys-toughest-challenges-090008655.html">signed an executive order</a> (EO) to address the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. The White House is today taking another step forward in implementing the EO with a policy that aims to regulate the federal government's use of AI. Safeguards that the agencies must have in place include, among other things, ways to mitigate the risk of algorithmic bias.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that all leaders from government, civil society and the private sector have a moral, ethical and societal duty to make sure that artificial intelligence is adopted and advanced in a way that protects the public from potential harm while ensuring everyone is able to enjoy its benefits,&quot; Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters on a press call.</p>

Parts pairing prevents third-party repair services from replacing a broken component with one that didn't come from the brand itself, because it wouldn't work with the company's software. People would usually get error messages if they try to install an unauthorized part, forcing them to bu
