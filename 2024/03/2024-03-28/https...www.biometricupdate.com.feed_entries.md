		The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has not yet gone public with its full interim policy on the use of facial recognition technology (FRT). However, after passing on an opportunity to testify last week in front of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, the DOJ has now released <a href="https://securisync.intermedia.net/us2/s/folder?public_share=NQ9gXNn5CHuTzCa4t2fxyB0011ef58&amp;id=L1BhbmVsIDIvRGVwYXJ0bWVudCBvZiBKdXN0aWNl">written testimony</a> that it submitted to the commission. The document outlines stances presumably codified in the interim policy, which it says was announced last December, including the use of face biometrics in relation to activities that are protected by the First Amendment.

The interim policy, says the testimony, “prohibits unlawful us

		The fog of war is obscuring details about a pair of contracts involving facial recognition developers; one Russian, one Israeli.

The New York Times reports that <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/corsight">Corsight</a> and Google Photos are being used in combination by Israeli soldiers inside Gaza to identify wanted individuals. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) originally deployed the facial recognition technology to identify hostages among fleeing Gazans, but has since repurposed it to identify Hamas members and associates, according to the Times.

The report includes claims that the technology incorrectly identified people as wanted Hamas terrorists. It also states that IDF soldiers have been demanding names of Hamas members and associates fro

		A joint investigation team told Pakistan’s Interior Ministry this week that a breach from NADRA’s national identity database has been confirmed, <a href="https://www.geo.tv/latest/536685-personal-data-of-27m-pakistanis-stolen-from-nadra-record">Geo News</a> reports. The announcement is the latest twist in a saga in which accusations and denials have been far more plentiful than presentations of evidence.

As many as 2.7 million people’s records are involved, according to investigators.

The joint investigation team was headed by an official from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). It says that data was stolen from servers in Multan, Karachi and Peshawar. The team recommended that legal action be taken against NADRA senior officials responsible at the time. The breach took

		It's been widely noted in the biometrics space that fraud has evolved with the rise of deepfakes, generative AI, and more intricate document tampering, but also better monitoring software. And now, fraud rates are trending upwards because fraud detection is improving, according to the first edition of the <a href="https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-identity-fraud-report/">Identity Fraud Report</a> from identity verification provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/yoti">Yoti</a>.

		Japan has joined the ranks of countries eliminating gender markers from its national identification card. The government has unveiled a new design for its My Number ID cards which will be introduced in 2026.

Aside from removing gender markers, the new design also features birthdates in the Western Gregorian calendar instead of the traditional Japanese Era Calendar. The cardholder's name will be spelled out in English and the print will be larger, Japanese public broadcaster NHK <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20240319_19/">reports</a>.

The new design marks another step towards international standards in ID card cards for Japan, which was designed to incorporate its unique heritage. Japanese documents present a particular challenge in verifying id

		Afghanistan’s National Statistics and Information Authority (NSIA) says 3.12 million national digital ID cards have been districted in the country in the past twelve months.

The government agency said in a Facebook <a href="https://web.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=717252593942265&amp;id=100069725934794&amp;mibextid=oFDknk&amp;rdid=K6zyWwu9sUIqzZS0">post</a> this week that the figures were achieved following efforts deployed by 76 digital ID card distribution centres in all the 34 administrative provinces of the country.

Per the NSIA statistics, 2 million, 68 thousand cards have been handed to men, while 1 million, 56 thousand have been issued to women. In terms of areas with the

		Biometrics are increasingly facilitating different processes in the public transportation sector, with new developments emerging from two countries – China and Russia. While a palm vein recognition payment system for metro tickets has been installed for trial at two metro stations in Shanghai and other parts of China, Moscow Transport in Russia says it is innovating and extending its biometric payments system for metro tickets, at a time when it is also discussing plans for introducing driverless trams using neural networks.

		About 80,000 primary school children, who do not have birth certificates, but who are preparing to write the First School Leaving Certificate or “Certificat d’Etude Primaire” examinations in Cameroon, will have their dreams supported with the free issuance of this important ID document.

A special government operation to materialize this ambition was launched last Friday March 22 in Yaounde, and it is expected to run for a period of two months.

The campaign has the support of the World Bank and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), through an initiative dubbed “Support Program for Educational Reforms in Cameroon,” (PAREC), designed to. It targets pupils in Cameroon’s French and English sub systems of education who have lost possession of their birth certif
