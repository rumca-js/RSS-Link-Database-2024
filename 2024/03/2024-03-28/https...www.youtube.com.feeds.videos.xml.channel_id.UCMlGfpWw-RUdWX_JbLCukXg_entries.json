The first is \u201cRegister Hooking\u201d, where we use the preprocessor to alter the behavior of primitive data type interactions to allow for a model interaction without extensive code alteration. The second methodology is the use of coroutines to define side effects through behavioral models, which constitutes the majority of this talk.\n\nCoroutines have the advantage of representing the parallel nature of hardware in a syntactically friendly way. Using coroutines also avoids several potential synchronization problems that arise with multi-threaded approaches or extensive and nested use of async/future. Complex hardware interactions can b", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmLunUoBcQk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg", "source_obj__id": 420, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/KmLunUoBcQk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Behavioral Modeling in HW/SW Co-design Using C++ Coroutines - Jeffrey Erickson, Sebastian Schoenberg", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
