<p>The 2024 Summer Olympics are just 128 days away. They'll be here before you know it, so what better time to learn about all the groovy features that the Games' streaming home, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/peacock/">Peacock</a>, has lined up?</p>
<p>The platform will host more than 5,000 hours of live coverage across the two weeks, including each of the 329 medal events. That's far more than anyone could possibly watch during the Games, so to help you keep track of several events at once, Peacock is offering several multiview options. On TVs, tablets and desktop browsers (but not phones, sadly), you'll be able to watch four matches at the same time in sports such as track and field, soccer and wrestling in a traditional multiview format.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A mode called Peacock Discovery Multiview aims to direct you to the most important events. Here, you'll see on-screen descriptions telling you what's at stake (such as whether ther

<p>Threads has <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C4vmYupx3TS"><ins>begun testing swipe gestures</ins></a> to help users improve the algorithm that populates the For You feed. It’s reportedly called Algo Tune as, well, it helps people tune their algorithms. It’s pretty rare when any social media site, particularly one run by Meta, allows users to adjust the parameters by which the great and powerful algorithm operates, so this feature is definitely worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>It works a lot like Tinder and other dating apps. If you don’t like something on your feed, you swipe left. If you like a post and want to see more like it, you swipe right. That’s pretty much it. The algorithm is allegedly tuned over time by these responses, adjusting your feed to provide more of the content you want and less of the stuff you don’t want. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls it an “easy way to let us know what you want to see more of on your feed.”</p>

<p>It's been almost three years since we found out that former Naughty Dog and Visceral Games writer and creative director Amy Hennig was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amy-hennig-skydance-new-media-marvel-partnership-172714404.html">working on a Marvel game</a> with her team at Skydance New Media. During Epic Games' <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_DssjLeGa0">State of Unreal showcase</a> at the Game Developers Conference, a new story trailer shed some more light on the game, which is called <em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em>.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, it's set during World War II in Occupied Paris. You'll play as four characters in this story-driven action-adventure: a young Steve Rogers (better known as Captain America), T'Challa's grandfather Azzuri (the Black Panther of his era), US soldier and Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones and Wakandan spy Nanali.</p>

<p>Think about your digital footprint. How many accounts have you created online since you first started using the internet? How many of those use the same logins, so you have an easier time accessing your information? It’s a habit we’ve all fallen into, but it greatly weakens our ability to stay secure online. Just one password leak can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-lastpass-hack-was-worse-than-the-company-first-reported-000501559.html">compromise dozens of accounts</a>. Password managers can help you break that habit. It’ll do the tedious work of creating and storing various passwords to up your security posture without testing your memorization skills. But there are dozens of password managers available now — that’s why we tested out nine of the best services available now to help you choose the right one for your needs. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=29d07367-7ffa-4e05-9a7f-c1dd19430630&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pag

<p>A lot of EVs aren’t that fun to drive, built as they are to glide around a highway like a swan on a river. Sure, like the swan’s manic paddling, there’s a lot of hardware and software sweating in the background to maintain that serenity. But the feeling can be so soporific that you wind up lusting for the day full autonomy comes and puts us out of our misery.</p>
<p>Except, of course, if you’re driving a new Lotus.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You see, when you’re driving an electric Lotus, there’s a sense of cognitive whiplash you don’t often get these days. EVs are quick and have plenty of torque thanks to their electric motors but they rarely have anything close to a personality. But even when you’re driving its new two-plus ton SUV, you’re capable of zooming around a race track as if you were driving a go-kart.

<p>Getty has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/world/europe/princess-kate-middleton-photo-uk.html">flagged</a> another photo captured by the Princess of Wales as digitally altered that was released back in 2022, featuring Queen Elizabeth II surrounded by her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. &quot;Getty Images is undertaking a review of handout images and in accordance with its editorial policy is placing an editor's note on images where the source has suggested they could be digitally enhanced,&quot; a spokesperson told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/19/europe/kate-royals-altered-photo-queen-gbr-intl/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a>.

It seems very unlikely, with the latest example coming from Glassdoor, which published people's real names without their consent, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/glassdoor-adding-users-real-names-job-info-to-profiles-without-consent/"><em>ArsTechnica </em>reports</a>.

<p>Glassdoor's long-standing policy was that users could sign up with their name or anonymously. However, things changed when the company bought FishBowl in 2021 and later integrated it. Now, Glassdoor users get signed up for a FishBowl account and, as a result, must be verified (a Fishbowl requirement). This shift gives Glassdoor access to users' information to eit

<p>There’s nothing quite like getting into the zone during a run, and for many of us, the right soundtrack is a requirement. Whether you need classic rock, reggaeton or an immersive audiobook to properly settle into your morning jog, you’ll get the best listening experience with a good pair of wireless headphones for running. But not all <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-workout-headphones-191517835.html">wireless workout headphones</a> are created equally, and runners need to consider specific needs before investing in a pair like how long your runs are, what type of music or other audio you prefer listening to and how much you want to block out the world during a session. If you’re just getting into a new running routine and need a pair of headphones that can keep up, or you’re a seasoned pro looking for an upgrade, you’ve come to the right place. We’ve tested more than a dozen Bluetooth headphones for running to come up with our top picks and help you decide

<p>In good news for our wallets and the environment at large, many electronic devices like phones and tablets last longer now than they once did. If you’re considering buying refurbished, the gadget you get will likely have a good amount of life left in it. There are no laws governing the terms, but refurbished or renewed devices tend to be a level above just plain “used.” At minimum, refurbished tech should have undergone cleaning and diagnostics, and some sellers also replace components like batteries and screens. Once ready for sale, these devices should operate as if they were new, with only minor scuffs indicating their history.<br /><br />Refurbished devices not only save you a bit of cash, they have a drastically lower carbon footprint since most of the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/795/1/012028/meta">environmental impact</a> comes from manufacturing.

The company could get up to $8.5 billion in direct funding from the government, according to the preliminary agreement it has reached with the Department of Commerce. That money will go towards the chipmaker's efforts to expand its manufacturing facilities in the United States, particularly plants designed to make leading-edge semiconductor chips meant for use in AI and other advanced applications.</p>
<p>The government's investment is expected to support Intel projects across four states, including the construction of two new leading-edge logic fabrication facilities and the modernization of another one in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-7nm-2023-meteor-lake-213933055.html">Chandler, Arizona</a>, as well as the construction of two

<p>It didn’t take long for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">wireless earbuds</a> to become <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">ubiquitous</a>. Apple’s AirPods launched back in September 2016, joining notable true wireless headphones from Jabra, Sony, Samsung, and others. A few years later, they’re the go-to choice for many of us when listening to music, podcasts and streaming services on our phones and tablets.</p>
<p>Your wireless earbuds can get very dirty very quickly, because not only are we using them a lot, but we take them everywhere: to work, on public transport, on flights and everywhere in between. This is especially true if you’re using them to cancel out noise in a busy office – or are simply working from home at the same time as family or roommates.This means they will come into contact with ear wax, oils and skin cells. Hygiene aside, you should clean your earbuds (and their charging case

<p>Meta is continuing its slow march toward compatibility with the fediverse. The company has been experimenting with making posts from a handful of accounts available <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-tests-making-threads-posts-available-on-mastodon-and-other-fediverse-apps-190003236.html"><ins>on Mastodon</ins></a> since the end of last year. Now, it’s offered a brief preview of how the integration works and what it might look like once more people have the ability to share from Threads directly to the fediverse.</p>
<p>Instagram engineer Peter Cottle gave a short presentation on “Threads in the Fediverse” at <a href="https://fediforum.org/2024-03/"><ins>FediForum</ins></a>, a virtual event for decentralized social media enthusiasts. In the demo, Cottle explains how Threads users will be able to opt-in to fediverse sharing and offered some insight into how Meta is thinking about its role in the fediverse.</p>
