Dragon’s Dogma 2 is not your typical open world game. It has an extreme aversion to holding your hand in even the slightest manner possible, to the extent that many may not view it as a very inviting or approachable experience. 

But in doing so, it delivers an open world experience unlike anything else out there. The developer has crafted a massive world here, one that feels alive and unpredictable in ways that games very rarely manage to capture.

Exploration is constantly rewarded, the combat is deep and visceral, and the progression mechanics are immensely engaging. All of that comes together in an experience that delivers excellent emergent gameplay and thoroughly immerses you in its world.
