<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> is revamping how it handles items, and part of that overhaul means players will soon be able to trade some (though not all) of the game's most powerful items.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in the most recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP-JRUMq2N8">Diablo 4 Campfire Chat</a>, Blizzard is looking to focus on quality, not quantity, when it comes to Diablo 4's items come the release of the game's Season 4 update on May 14. That means reducing the number of Legendary and Rare items that drop and the number of affixes on them, but increasing both the strength and the relevancy of the affixes on items that players do find. Playing on World Tier 3 will now always reward Sacred items (instead of only sometimes) and World Tier 4 will always reward Ancestral items, which should make progression smoother.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Lego Fortnite</a> started out as just a single survival-crafting mode, but it's rapidly becoming something much greater this season. Lego and Epic have launched a series of new Lego-themed Fortnite Creative Islands, and they announced at GDC Wednesday that they're now allowing players to build their own Lego islands in Creative mode and the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). The floodgates are open.</p><p>Essentially, this allows Fortnite users to use Lego assets to make their own game experiences within Fortnite--and to make money off them if they're popular enough. Given the kid-friendly nature of Lego, of course, there are some restrictions. Namely, the islands you make with Lego assets must carry age ratings that are no higher than E10 from the ESRB, or 7 from PEGI. So you can't put Lego assets into, say, a Red vs. Blue Deathmatch map or any other map that involves gunfights, but the possibilities are pretty open other

<p>The first trailer for Alien: Romulus, the latest entry in the storied sci-fi series, has arrived--and it's pretty scary. The latest installment in the series aims to take the series "back to its roots," and this means moviegoers are getting treated to (and horrified by) a story about a group of space colonizers scavenging through a derelict space station. Of course things go sideways when they encounter the "most terrifying life form in the universe."</p><p>Cailee Spaeny (Priscilla), David Jonsson (Murder is Easy), Archie Renaux (Shadow and Bone), Isabela Merced (The Last of Us), and Spike Fearn (Aftersun) star in the movie.</p><div>          </div><p>Fede Alvarez, known for the horror movie Don't Breathe, is directing Alien: Romulus from a screenplay he wrote with longtime collaborator Rodo Sayagues.

<p>The Xbox Rewards system has been overhauled, making the task of earning points slightly easier. As <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/Rewards">announced</a> on the company's news site, there is now a rewards hub where you can get an overview of your current points, as well as tasks to tackle. The latter range from playing games to searching on Microsoft Bing.</p><p>To get started, you have to log in with your Microsoft account and visit the rewards hub on your console, or via the Xbox app on either mobile or your PC. Once you're all set up, you'll start earning points by purchasing games and other "eligible items" at the Microsoft Store, playing games, completing quests, and so on.</p><p>The points you've gathered can be redeemed for Xbox Gift Cards, sweepstakes entries, hardware, or as donations to a list of organizations. Keep in mind that both quests and the eligible rewards might vary depending on your region. The new Rewards system is currently available in Australia

Starring in Beetlejuice led to a decade-long working relationship with director Burton and featured in Burton's films Sleepy Hollow and Ed Wood.</p><p>However, in 2003, Jones pleaded no contest to a charge of soliciting a minor to pose for nude photographs and had subsequent arrests for failing to update his sex offender status.

<p dir="ltr">Dragon's Dogma 2 doesn't have a traditional fast-travel system. For most open-world games, this would be a death sentence--an affront to the player's valuable time. Yet somehow, Capcom has turned the absence of this quality-of-life feature into a resounding strength. It's the game's tremendous sense of adventure and discovery that accomplishes this. Every time you leave the relative safety of a village or city, there's no telling what will happen; you just know it has the potential to be spellbinding and will be well worth your time.</p><p dir="ltr">As a sequel, Dragon's Dogma 2 is an extension of everything the first game achieved 12 years ago. It's an enchanting open-world RPG with varied, exciting combat and a player-created companion system that's still unlike anything else. It doesn't do much beyond what the original did, but advancements in technology have enhanced its anomalous strengths, breathing new life into its massive open world and the ways in which

<p>After a lengthy absence, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alone-in-the-dark/">Alone in the Dark</a> is back and ready to scare a new generation of gamers. But is it any good? Reviews have gone live for the remake of the original game, and so far, the reception has been lukewarm. Critics have praised the eye for detail and authenticity in this remake of the beloved horror game, but have also criticized Alone in the Dark for its janky controls, pointless stealth, and poor puzzle design.</p><p>"This isn't Alone in the Dark's first revival attempt, and it's probably not its last, but it isn't the one that will put the series' name in the same breath as the all-time greats it originally helped inspire," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alone-in-the-dark-review-dimly-lit/1900-6418197/">Alone in the Dark review</a>.</p><p>On GameSpot's sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/alone-in-the-dark/">Metacritic</a>, Alone in

<p dir="ltr">There are two things that are simultaneously true about Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. First: It tells a new and original Ghostbusters story, in the vein of the original two, that functions like a true Ghostbusters 3, unlike 2021's Ghostbusters: Afterlife. That's a good thing, in a vacuum. But the second thing is a big caveat: The Ghostbusters formula has been used by so many blockbusters in the past couple decades that Frozen Empire just cannot make a real impression.</p><p dir="ltr">In other words, we've got a legitimate new Ghostbusters movie on our hands, but what the franchise actually needs is to reinvent itself. Not the way Afterlife did it, by doing an '80s-style kid adventure, but by actually finding a new direction. Instead, we've got essentially a Ghostbusters-themed Marvel movie that's got several movies' worth of plot and only occasionally made me laugh. Bummer.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire opens with the Spengler family (Carrie Coon, Mc

<p dir="ltr">Call of Duty is already one of the biggest and most successful games on the market, and its profile and reach stands to grow bigger still with the launch of Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile on March 21. There is of course already a popular Call of Duty game on mobile--the appropriately titled Call of Duty Mobile--but Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile aims to stand apart with a number of key differentiators. First and foremost, Warzone Mobile has cross-progression with Modern Warfare III and Warzone on PC and console, so as long as you link Activision accounts, your progression and (most) purchases will move with you. This isn't the case in CoD Mobile.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite what its name suggests, Warzone Mobile features not just the Warzone battle royale experience, but also standard multiplayer. For Warzone, Activision is hoping the power of nostalgia will draw in players, as Warzone Mobile launches with the beloved Verdansk map that helped launch Warzone four years ag

<p dir="ltr">During the '90s, there were plenty of animated series based on comic properties, but two stood out above the rest: Batman: The Animated Series and X-Men: The Animated Series. Both were standouts for their ability to tell stories and for their art. However, one thing X-Men had above Batman was that it was contemporary and followed the stories taking place in the comic books a bit more strictly.</p><p dir="ltr">Sure, the X-Men team wasn't the same as the one in the comics at the time. However, we got stories ripped from the comics: Days of Future Past, the Mojoverse, The Phoenix Saga, and even The Phalanx Covenant--which came out two years prior in the comic book format.</p><p dir="ltr">The Disney+ animated series picks up where the original animated series left off in September 1997.
