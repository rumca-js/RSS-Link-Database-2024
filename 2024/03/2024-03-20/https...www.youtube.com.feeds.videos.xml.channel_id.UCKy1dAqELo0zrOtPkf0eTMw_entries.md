Capcom returns with their most ambitious title yet in Dragon's Dogma 2 which releases on PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC this week. They reached for more than the moon with its RE Engine. From its inception it was focused on high quality visuals, high performance on consoles and PC but mainly within a linear and atmospheric world. Here the team have pushed all the dials to maximum but this has a big impact on those targets. With our IGN Performance Review we put consoles and PC under the microscope and see just what it takes to run this game at 60fps or higher and if the Xbox Series S can stay the journey.

Dragon's Dogma 2 reviewed by Jarrett Green on PlayStation 5, also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.

"Dragon‚Äôs Dogma 2 is a strange and wonderful game that seems haunted by some of yesteryear‚Äôs bugaboos. It is a retelling and reimplementation of all of those wonderful ideas from the 2012 cult-classic, including an awesome dynamic world and some of the best combat in the genre that integrates a subtle but amazingly complex physics system. On the other hand, its finicky ally AI, clunky climbing, choppy frame rate, and camera with a habit of going haywire at the worst times are all ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù I wish hadn‚Äôt been brought back for another round. Even so, there‚Äôs an action-RPG here that‚Äôs richly rewarding and incomparable to its contemporaries if you can be patient with its quirks and open to embracing its hands-off open-world and quest designs."

Watch our Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire review by Tom Jorgensen. Opens in theaters March 22, 2024.

Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire races onto thin ice overburdened with disparate, uninspired ideas¬† ‚Äì and no one behind or in front of the camera quite knows what to do once the movie‚Äôs flailing in the water. The new generation of Ghostbusters have to give up too much time to an overcomplicated plot ‚Äì time that could‚Äôve been used to embellish the bedrock elements of comedy-horror that the 1984 original deployed so well. If all you need to feel good about busting is ghosts, jumpsuits, and proton packs, you may have some fun, but Frozen Empire makes one thing clear: the franchise should be put in cold storage until someone can figure out how to do justice to the central concept without Murray, Aykroyd, Hudson, and Potts dropping by to prevent mass hysteria.
