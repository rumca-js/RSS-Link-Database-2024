What does \u201ccorrect\u201d even mean? How do we know the code we write today won\u2019t become a long-term liability? These persistent questions can be enough to suck all the fun out of programming, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. In this talk, we\u2019ll look at the connective tissue of good code and show how to keep it strong and supple. There is no need to wait for language features to start using contracts. We\u2019ll suggest replacing code reviews with something better and charting the path to a more hopeful future of software.\n---\n\nDave Abrahams\n\nDave Abrahams is a founding contributor of the Boost C++ Libraries project and the founder of the first annual C++ conference, BoostCon/C++Now.
