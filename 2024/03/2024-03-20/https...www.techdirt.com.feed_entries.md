The laziest court in the land has again decided it&#8217;s not worth its time to undo another horrible decision issued by an appellate court that far too often feels the Fifth (Circuit) is superior to the First (Amendment). The nation&#8217;s top court seems more motivated to take cases if it can curtail long-held rights. When [&#8230;]

Remember Richard Liebowitz? The lawyer who was not very good at his job but really dove deep into the world of copyright trolling? He was suspended from practicing law a few years ago, but now he’s finally been officially disbarred. There are many, many Liebowitz stories out there. It’s hard to beat the time he [&#8230;]

US Private Vaults is a private company, in multiple senses of the word. Despite the use of the acronym &#8220;US,&#8221; US Private Vaults is not a government entity. The service it offers aligns roughly with storage services federally insured banks offer: a secure place to hold valuables that is only accessible by those who have [&#8230;]

We’ve been covering many stories about a potential TikTok ban, including how unconstitutional it clearly is, how pointless it clearly is, and how even those who back it don’t seem to have a good explanation of why, beyond some vague handwaving about “China.” But, there’s one thing that hasn’t received nearly as much attention: people [&#8230;]

For decades, the FCC has maintained an arguably pathetic definition of “broadband,” allowing the telecom industry to under-deliver substandard access. After some industry lobbying to ensure it wasn&#8217;t too stringent, the agency is finally getting around to an update, and has announced that they&#8217;ll soon classify &#8220;broadband&#8221; as anything faster than 100 Mbps downstream, 20 [&#8230;]

Officers who handle drug dogs like to claim they&#8217;re so highly skilled at animal handling they can recognize otherwise imperceptible moves by their animals as the dog &#8220;alerting,&#8221; giving them (and, more literally) their animals free rein to perform warrantless searches of vehicles.
