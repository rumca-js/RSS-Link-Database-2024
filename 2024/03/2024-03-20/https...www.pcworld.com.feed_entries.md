<p>The best USB-C hubs are designed to expand your laptop&rsquo;s capabilities, allowing you to connect printers, mice, and keyboards via a dongle that connects to your laptop&rsquo;s USB-C port.</p>



<p>Each of my USB-C hub recommendations contains a variety of ports (including USB-A ports, HDMI, and more) that allow you to connect legacy devices like USB memory keys, display connectors, and more to your laptop. Our recommendations dive into the benefits of each dongle, which we&rsquo;ve tested and reviewed.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve organized my USB-C recommendations this way: traditional USB-C hubs on top, followed by my picks for the best USB-C docking stations. The latter are a bit bulkier, but tend to offer more connections. I&rsquo;ll also introduce you to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://xn--sonnets%20echo%2013%20

<p>Here are the basics: Microsoft Defender is the virus protection integrated into Windows by default. If no other antivirus program is installed and activated, Defender protects you against viruses. You can check whether Defender is active for you via <em>Windows icon &gt; All apps &gt; Windows security &gt; Virus and threat protection</em> and then under &ldquo;Who is protecting me&rdquo; on the right-hand side. Look for &ldquo;Microsoft Defender Antivirus.&rdquo; </p>



<p>The Defender has a virus guard that constantly analyzes every new file. It also regularly scans all files on your system. The tool tries to start this scan only when you are not using your PC. Users who often leave their computer idle may not even notice the scan. Other users may be disturbed by the scan as it consumes both CPU power and hard drive access time. To find out why the Def

<p>Chromebooks have been around since 2011, but they&rsquo;ve undergone a serious transformation since the early days. They&rsquo;re no longer the low-resolution, low-powered machines from the days of old. Now, in addition to the ones that fit the needs of casual users, a handful of them are capable of running games, a far-fetched idea at one point in time. </p>



<p>Sure, you can probably do more on a Windows machine, but if you&rsquo;re looking for something affordable and zippy enough for everyday tasks, a Chromebook might just be your best option &mdash; and a lot of the compromises these web-based laptops required in their earliest day no longer apply. Let&rsquo;s dig in.<br /></p>
