Are you confident that the code you write, and the changes you make, are correct? What does “correct” even mean? How do we know the code we write today won’t become a long-term liability? These persistent questions can be enough to suck all the fun out of programming, but it doesn’t have to be that way. In this talk, we’ll look at the connective tissue of good code and show how to keep it strong and supple. There is no need to wait for language features to start using contracts. We’ll suggest replacing code reviews with something better and charting the path to a more hopeful future of software.
