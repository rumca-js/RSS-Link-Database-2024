Everybody knew that and, as such, recognised it was a moment in time, something special.</p><p>What they did not realise, as a top footballer went through a fairly routine session, was what was bubbling on the inside. For Gomez, it was a return to the scene of his most traumatic episode, when an innocuous movement, the kind he had performed throughout his career without thinking, had life‑changing consequences.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/20/england-joe-gomez-liverpool-brazil-belgium-wembley">Continue reading...</a>

She became an expert at preserving this vision, using the sliding box camera she received as a gift aged 49 to master both the wet collodian process, where a piece of glass is coated with collodian and exposed, and albumen printing – coating paper with egg white to give a sharper, glossier effect.</p><p>A vast collection of Cameron’s vintage prints are shown alongside pieces by the enigmatic American artist Francesca Woodman in the National Portrait Ga

This was 3<sup> </sup>November 1984. I know this for sure because I just looked it up. It was the day Indira Gandhi was cremated. Laid out on a sandalwood pyre, her head clearly visible, her body – her actual body – was in plain sight, as her son lit the pyre to see his mother, in the words of most newspaper reports, <em>consigned to flames</em>.</p><p>I was aghast, horrified. But my friend’s dad said a thing that made me think again. It went something like this: “No, I think it’s very healthy. Death’s too hidden away in our society.

To earn the right to go to Germany and try to beat Austria into third place behind France and the Netherlands, Wales must first win two successive games.

It also shows their collective 18 children – some of whom have been on television for their entire lives. What started as light patriarchy propaganda took a darker turn in the last few seasons, as Kody belittled his wives, berated his children, and

<p>Griffin Dunne and Rosanna Arquette’s night of farce and coincidence is a tale in which strangeness and anxiety loom large, leading to a woozy punchline</p><p>Martin Scorsese’s 1985 screwball noir is now on rerelease. It felt at the time – and feels now – like an atypical Scorsese movie, a more generic and less auteurist project he accepted from its producer-star Griffin Dunne while progress on his Last Temptation of Christ had temporarily stalled. Maybe he thought of it as “road work”, but time has lent interest to After Hours; the obviously comic and farcical aspect has receded and its strangeness and anxiety loom larger, in a string of unsexy encounters and chilling coincidences culminating in a desolate close-dance scene to the accompaniment of Peggy Lee’s Is That All There Is? It’s a shaggy dog story leading to a punchline, of sorts, but one that feels woozy and illusory; it is not like a nightmare exactly, but a strange dream that’s difficult to shake on waking.</p><p

<p>The horror author on stealing from other writers, why she can’t stand pathos and how Mickey Mouse has inspired her new short-story collection Minihorror</p><p>In Vienna, every second building looks like it was built for a king, the waiters who serve your coffee wear tuxedos, and public transport is not just efficient and cheap, the council pays musicians to play Mozart in the carriages. But in the stories of Serbian author Barbi Marković, set in the Austrian city and its surroundings, there’s something not quite right about the place.</p><p>In Minihorror, the 44-year-old’s very strange and very addictive short story collection, horrifying things lurk behind splendid baroque facades.
