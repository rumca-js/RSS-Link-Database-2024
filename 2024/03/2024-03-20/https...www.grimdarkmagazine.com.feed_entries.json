Not only was Conan forced to kill comrade Chaundra the Chat by his own hand, the other thieves of the Gloryhounds are also dead, supernaturally compelled to murder each other by the three specters inadvertently freed from the stolen Black Stone. With all other involved parties eliminated, the specters force themselves into Conan, psychically battering him into submission. The undead trio agree that Conan will make an ideal tool for their dormant master Thulsa Doom, but to fulfill their dark goals they require blood sacrifices made using the ancient Pictish blade Conan acquired during his adventures with Brissa (during the \u201cBound in Black Stone\u201d story arc, Conan the Barbarian issues 1-4). Unfortunately for Conan\u2019s ghostly tormentors, distraught after the death of his pirate queen B\u00ealit, the barbarian pawned the weapon for drinking money immediately after his arrival in Shadizar ten months ago.
