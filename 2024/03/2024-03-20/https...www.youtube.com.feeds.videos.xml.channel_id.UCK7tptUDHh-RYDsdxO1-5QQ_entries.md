About 450 Cold War-era Minuteman nuclear missiles were only supposed to last 10 years. But now, these ICBMs have defended the U.S. for more than 50. The Air Force is planning to spend $130 billion on replacing them to boost the U.S. nuclear defense strategy with a new modern iteration—the Sentinel missile.
