<p><strong>PlayStation 5 (version tested), Xbox One, PC; Capcom<br /></strong>This gloriously messy, medieval-flavoured silliness will give you the best adventure you’ve had in years. There’s nothing quite like it</p><p>Let me tell you about my pawn, Bowie. He is, as the name might suggest, a beautiful, pale, slender mage with lots of makeup and big, red hair. He is an interdimensional being, and his job is to support me on my adventures as the Arisen, this kingdom’s fate-chosen ruler, a role I unwittingly acquired when a dragon pinned me down, plucked out my heart and ate it.</p><p>Bowie is not very good at his job. He often forgets to heal me when harpies and goblins and ogres knock lumps out of me out in the wilds, forcing me to hammer the “help!” button while being pinned down by a minotaur. When he travels to other worlds, he always comes back with morose tales of how often he fell in battle and how badly he suffered at the hands of other Arisen. I love Bowie anyway, bec

<p>Keir Starmer takes shots at open goals while PM is running on fumes as the disasters keep coming</p><p>MDMA, before it was called ecstasy, was going to be called empathy, having been devised as a marriage counselling drug. The theory was that it would amp up your compassion and dial down your threat response to the degree that you’d be able to hear the truth with an open heart.</p><p>Then it turned out to be better as a party drug and was criminalised, and maybe it’s all for the best, but just once I would love to hear PMQs with everyone on E. Because a lot of what Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday was probably true: Keir Starmer, if he wasn’t Labour leader, probably would enjoy going back to being a lawyer. He probably did get a lot of satisfaction from successfully defending people’s human rights. “I would have thought that, out of everybody, [Starmer] would be the most grateful”, Sunak said of his – always subject to revision – plan to hold an election later rather than soo

Jota has 15 goal contributions (nine goals and six assists) in 25 league games, helping Vitória to fifth in the Primeira Liga.
