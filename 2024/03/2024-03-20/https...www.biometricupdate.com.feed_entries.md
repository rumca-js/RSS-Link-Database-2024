		At the International Joint Conference of Biometrics (IJCB) 2024, the first competition on presentation attack detection (PAD) for ID cards, PAD-ID Card 2024, will take place. The event is sponsored by Spanish biometrics and identity verification provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/facephi">Facephi</a>.

One issue with PAD systems designed to protect comparisons of ID cards with selfie biometrics is that algorithms are trained and tested on a limited dataset of ID documents because of privacy concerns, which limits their generalization capabilities.

PAD-ID Card 2024 will be the first competition series for ID cards. It offers an independent assessment of current algorithms as well as an evaluation protocol that includes a dataset of ac
