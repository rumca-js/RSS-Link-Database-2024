Dragon's Dogma 2 isn't a game that's going to be for everyone. Just like its predecessor, it's a confident, self-assured game made by a team that was clearly unwilling to compromise or water down its vision for the sake of modern conveniences we've gotten so used to, and it's a better game for that. There are stumbles, yes, but Dragon's Dogma 2 has also quickly proven itself to be one of the most refreshing fantasy RPGs I've played in years. #dragonsdogma2 #dragonsdogma #rpg
