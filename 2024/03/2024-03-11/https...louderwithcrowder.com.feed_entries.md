A girl posts a video of her doing things on the internet. An X-Twitter troll shares it and attacks her for it. Everyone else has an opinion and it becomes all anyone is talking about. Our most recent example of this is Hannah Barron vs. Samirah Khan, and a video I guarantee you've seen while scrolling.</p><p>Hannah is someone who likes to hunt, fish, and build homes with her dad. Samirah describes herself as a news analyst who is a part of something called the "Abrahamic Alliance Against Globalism." Samirah shared a video of Hannah working on a home and used her to attack all American women, who are, quote, "literally men."</p><p>It implies people who find Hannah to be a catch are "gay," which is funny because a lot of the "red-pill bros" sound like they're the ones who like the cock. Or are at least cock-curious.</p><div class=
