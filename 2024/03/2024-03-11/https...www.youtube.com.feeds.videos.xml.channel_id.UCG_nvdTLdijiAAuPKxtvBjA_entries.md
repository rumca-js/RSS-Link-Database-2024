Marvel's Secret Invasion continues the recent phase of the MCU on Disney+. And it doesn't do so very well, at least not in the pilot episode... because it fails to convince the viewer to come back for more, which is essential in TV. And since some of you told me about this show after my video on The Marvels, I'll return the favor by taking some lessons from the TV side. We both win. You get to see me say Marvel is bad and I get to talk about TV lessons!
