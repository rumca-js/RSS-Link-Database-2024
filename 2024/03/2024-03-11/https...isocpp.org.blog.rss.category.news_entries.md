		The idea is that the bit-operators are often used with enums to create bitmasks. Filesystem permissions are one example. Essentially you want to be able to write type-safe code like this:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp">
using Filesystem::Permission;&#10;Permission readAndWrite{&#10;&nbsp; Permission::Read | Permission::Write};&#10;</pre>
