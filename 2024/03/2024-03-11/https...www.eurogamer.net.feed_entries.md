As for the newly announced PS4 version of Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, it features the same appealing blend of classic RPG-style questing, Pok&eacute;mon-esque monster collecting and rearing, plus turn-based battling that proved so compelling w

At its worst, it's a lazy and reductive habit - and one that can result in some truly awful headlines, in which two popular games with tenuous connections to the one actually being written about are unceremoniously smashed together.</p><p>However, some games are so clearly built from bits of other games shoved together that it's impossible not to think of them in those terms. Again, at its worst, that can result in a hack job - lots of barely-understood elements clumsily magpied from games that used them with more intention. Rise of the Ronin is one of the exceptions. While I spent my few hours with it reminded of other games, it was with a smile on my face. It's a remix, not a rip-off.</p><p>Rise of the Ronin is built on the foundations of Team Ninja's recent

Developer Turn 10 Studios' previously promised overhaul of Forza Motorsport's controversial car progression system arrives today, 11th March, on Xbox Series X/S and PC.
</p><p>
 Turn 10 confirmed it would be revisiting Forza Motorsport's much-maligned car progression system <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-pledges-ai-progression-and-race-regulation-improvements-in-coming-months">back in January</a>, as part of a conciliatory blog post also promising improvements for a number of other key areas, including driver AI and race regulations.
 </p><p>
Driver AI was the focus of a major free update at the end of that same month, and now it's the turn of car progression. Today's enhancements, which arrive as part of what Turn 10 is referring to as Update 6, makes a number of adjustments, starting with th

Fresh off its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-coming-to-destiny-2-next-month-in-new-collaboration-event">dalliance with Mass Effect</a>, Destiny 2 is getting a Ghostbusters collaboration - which'll seemingly manifest in the form of premium cosmetics - next Tuesday, 19th March.
</p><p>
Developer Bungie revealed its incoming "Destiny 2 x Ghostbusters" collaboration on social media, with a <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1767173634810872298">post</a> proclaiming, "There's something strange in our neighbourhood...".
</p><p>
An accompanying image highlighted three Ghostbusters-themed cosmetics, including a Ghost skin resembling iconic series nuisance (and literal ghost) Slimer, alongside a slightly demonic - but not especially Ghostbusters-y - Sparrow skin, and an Echo-1 that'll presu

The PC version of Final Fantasy 16 is in the "final stages of optimisation", producer Naoki Yoshida has said. 
</p><p>
Speaking with <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/11/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-version-in-final-stages-of-optimization-expect-a-demo-before">GameInformer</a>, Yoshida stated the upcoming port is progressing well. However, he refrained from giving any further specifics, such as when it may be ready for release. 
</p><p>
"When we can release the PC version might be dependent on that - the system requirements and specifications for PC that players will need, so we're trying to figure that out," Yoshida explained, adding that "naturally, [the PC specifications] are looking to be somewhat high".

They are a fundamental part of what we do on Eurogamer and have been for many years. You need only look around the gaming internet to see how important they are, everywhere. But what does it take to pull a guide together, and what are the dos and don'ts of writing them? How, too, do we decide which games to write a guide for and which not to? I aim to discover Everything You Need to Know.</p><p>The episode will air this weekend on Eurogamer.</p>

The studio has moved development to Unreal Engine 5, with director Tony Huynh stating Shaggy sandwiches "have never looked better". This was to rebuild MultiVersus "from the ground up", with the director promising consistent performance, whatever your chosen platform.

Quite why you'd need a quad bike on a teetering pile of shipping containers, though, I don't know.</p><p>The rest of the trailer shows a bit of base building - my favourite part being where on-screen text reads "the only mission: survive!", while we watch a player
