All eight levels do a solid job of playing to my Contra nostalgia, and small tweaks to combat like the weapon upgrade and overload systems add a couple of much-needed wrinkles to its otherwise extremely faithful formula. But with only a few hours worth of things to do and very few surprises to be found, the rollercoaster comes to a halt too quickly and doesn\u2019t have many drops or loop-de-loops to enjoy along the way.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #ContraOperationGaluga #Review"}]
