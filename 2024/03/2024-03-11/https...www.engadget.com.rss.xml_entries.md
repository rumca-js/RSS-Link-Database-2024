<p>Have you ever wondered if your visit to an Airbnb included being on candid camera? Well, there's good news for you and your stress levels because you really shouldn't have to worry about it soon. <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/an-update-on-our-policy-on-security-cameras/">Airbnb has announced new privacy policies</a> that entirely ban the use of indoor cameras.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, the company allowed hosts to keep cameras in communal spaces but banned them in areas like bedrooms and bathrooms. Hosts were technically supposed to disclose any cameras in the rental location, but this shift removes any ambiguity (or issues for most of us who don't read the entire listing description).</p>

<p>Apple has reversed its decision to ban Epic Games’ developer account after it emerged that European Union officials were investigating the issue. And the EU is currently fining Apple for almost two billion dollars, so it's probably wise to pay attention.</p>
<p>This means Epic can bring its own app store to iPhones and iPads in the EU. “Following conversations with Epic, they have committed to follow the rules, including our DMA [Digital Markets Act] policies,” an Apple spokesperson told Engadget.</p>
<p>Earlier last week, Apple killed Epic’s developer account, claiming Epic was unlikely to abide by contractual agreements and even describing Epic as “verifiably untrustworthy.” Now, nearly four years after its disappearance, the publisher can more easily bring Fortnite back to those devices in the bloc.</p>
<p>Yes, <em>Fortnite </em>was last (officially) on iOS four years ago.</p>

<p>Regardless of if you have an older <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">iPad</a> or a new iPad Pro, it’s a good idea to protect it with a case. That will be even more crucial if you use your iPad as a laptop replacement, or if you have kids constantly trying to steal the slab from you to binge-watch <em>Bluey</em>. While it’s impossible to protect your gear from every kind of hazard, you can give your iPad a stronger shell with which to protect itself against accidental drops, dings and falls. This is a crowded space — there are dozens of iPad cases available today, some of which focus more on aesthetics than protection. But sussing out which will provide you the right level of protection you need along with extra features like a built in keyboard and folio can be tricky. Here are the best iPad cases we’ve tried that will suit a variety of needs.</p>
