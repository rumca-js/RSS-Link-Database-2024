Just over a year later, Parthasarathy, one of several notable names from the region&#8217;s tech industry who are backing the Seattle Orcas, is beyond just getting things off the ground. He&#8217;s become fully immersed in the business of the sport he once played&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/tech-vets-went-to-bat-for-major-league-cricket-now-they-have-bigger-goals-for-seattle-and-beyond/">Read More</a>
