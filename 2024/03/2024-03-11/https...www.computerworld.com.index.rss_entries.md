<p>Three authors, Abdi Nazemian, Brian Keene, and Stewart O’Nan, are part of a new copyright infringement lawsuit against Nvidia, the latest such suit to challenge generative AI providers’ reliance on the “fair use” doctrine to acquire copyrighted material to train their large language models.</p><p>The suit, filed late last week, is similar to other suits against generative AI creators, in that it alleges that they used copyrighted material — in this case, works of fiction by the named authors — as training data for an LLM. In this case, the LLM is Nvidia’s NeMo Megatron series, which, according to the complaint, uses several data sets known to contain the authors’ copyrighted material and used without permission.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3714286/new-ai-copyright-lawsuit-targets-nvidia.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

It starts at the mid-six figures and can run into the several-million-dollar range. And that hardware cannot be repurposed for other uses such as databases.</p><p>In addition to purchasing and maintaining the AI hardware, there is the model on which your AI application is based. Training is the difficult part of AI and the most process intensive. Training can take weeks or even months, depending on the size of the data set. That could be months you don’t have.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3713041/aiaas-artifi
