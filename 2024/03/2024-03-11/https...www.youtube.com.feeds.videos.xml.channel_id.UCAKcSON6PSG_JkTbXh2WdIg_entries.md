Sarah Jarosz didn’t go into recording what became the album "Polaroid Lovers" with a specific theme in mind, but after the songs coalesced, the theme emerged. “I realized that each story is a snapshot,” Jarosz explains. “And a lot of the songs are almost sort of dealing with time and the fleeting nature of time … the moment is gone, but the photo lives, and songs are kind of like that.”

Hailed for a fresh new sound that Radio Heartland’s Mike Pengra describes as very “sing-along-able,” "Polaroid Lovers" also saw Jarosz break new ground in terms of co-writing “in a Nashville sort of way,” as she puts it, working with such artists as Natalie Hemby, Ruston Kelly, Jon Randall and producer Daniel Tashian.

While in town for a concert at the Fine Line in Minneapolis, Jarosz and her band visited The Current studio to play songs from the record. Watch and listen to "When The Lights Go Out" above.
