Though after Vin Diesel didn't return after The Fast and the Furious for 2 Fast 2 Furious, it wasn't clear the franchise had much gas left in the tank.  2 Fast 2 Furious is now thought to be a lower tier installment in the Fast Franchise, but looking back, the movie is a lot better than you probably remember.  2 Fast 2 Furious not only introduced Tyrese's Roman Pierce and Ludacris's Tej, but it also started the trend of amplifying what made The Fast and the Furious so much fun.  We may have gotten away from racing down the streets of Miami, but without 2 Fast 2 Furious we may not have 10 installments, with an 11th on the way. \n\n#2fast2furious #fastandfurious #fastx #nerdstalgic \n\nSOURCES\nhttps://www.slashfilm.com/1122366/why-vin-diesel-walked-away-from-2-fast-and-2-furious-and-why-he-returned/\nhttps://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a43903614/fast-furi"}]
