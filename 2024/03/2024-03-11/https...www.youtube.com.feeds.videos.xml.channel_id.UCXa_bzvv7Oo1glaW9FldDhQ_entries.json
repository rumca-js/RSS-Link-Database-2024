Now, after having spent the last few years developing some of the best Soulslikes out there, the studio is coming out with its biggest, most ambitious game yet. \n\nRise of the Ronin is being billed as a much more approachable game than something like Nioh, while also promising a historically grounded, open world setting. And based on the three hours that we\u2019ve spend playing the game so far, it\u2019s stepping into this new direction quite effectively, albeit with some caveats. Here, we\u2019re going to talk about the seven biggest takeaways we have after having played the first three hours of Rise of the Ronin."}, {"album": "", "permanent": false, "artist": "GamingBolt", "page_rating_votes": 0, "title": "15 BIG Live Service Games That Flopped Super Hard", "language": null, "bookmarked": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "source_obj__id": 129, "user": null, "dead": false, "page_rating": 0, "date_published": "2024-03-11T13:45:01+00:00", "page_rating_visits": 0, "vote": 0, "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/HYde13zOvo8/hqdefault.jpg", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYde13zOvo8", "age": null, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "tags": [], "description": "Video games are extremely complicated things that amalgamate elements of storytelling, design, and technology into one cohesive product. One can imagine how tough it would be to juggle all these elements while working towards a singular vision and meeting tough deadlines. \n\nIt\u2019s not rare to see video games fail to capitalize on their potential for one reason or another, and with this video we will be taking a look at 15 such games in the live service genre. Right from highly anticipated games like Anthem to games scarred by tough development cycles like Skull and Bones to games that are a byproduct of hot trends, we take a look at each of these games and try to break down what exactly went wrong."}]
