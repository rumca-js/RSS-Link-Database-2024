Unfortunately, a federal district court did just that in the latest iteration of <em>Oracle v. Rimini</em>, concluding that software Rimini developed was a \u201a\u00c4\u00faderivative work\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 because it was intended to interoperate with Oracle's software, even though the update didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t use any of Oracle\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s copyrightable code.<br /><br />That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a dangerous precedent. If a work is derivative, it may infringe the copyright in the preexisting work from which it, well, derives. For decades, software developers have relied, correctly, on the settled view that a work is not derivative under copyright law unless it is \u201a\u00c4\u00fasubstantially similar\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to a preexisting work in both "}, {"album": "", "permanent": false, "artist": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "title": "EFF\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Submission to Ofcom\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Consultation on Illegal Harms", "language": "en", "bookmarked": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "source_obj__id": 101, "user": null, "dead": false, "page_rating": 0, "date_published": "2024-03-11T17:31:03+00:00", "page_rating_visits": 0, "vote": 0, "thumbnail": null, "link": "https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/effs-submission-ofcoms-consultation-illegal-harms", "age": null, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml", "tags": [], "description": "<div class=\"field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden\"><div class=\"field__items\"><div class=\"field__item even\"><p><span>More than four years after it was first introduced, the Online Safety Act (OSA) was </span><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech#:~:text=The%20UK%20Government%20Knows%20How%20Extreme%20The%20Online%20Safety%20Bill%20Is\"><span>passed by the U.K. Parliament</span></a><span> in September 2023.
