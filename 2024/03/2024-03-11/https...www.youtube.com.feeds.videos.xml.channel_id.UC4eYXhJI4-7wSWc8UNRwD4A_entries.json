The members of 311, who have been a band together for over 30 years, strolled into NPR HQ and barely needed much rehearsal time before playing four of their most beloved tracks. The band has been performing these songs for decades, and you can tell it all just comes naturally. \"This kind of reminds me of being in my dad's basement, being back next to the pool table, but it smells better here,\" said lead singer Nick Hexum, who felt right at home and back to his roots at our office space.\n\n311's self-titled album came out in 1995 when I was entering my peak angst stage. The songs on that album were the perfect soundtrack to all the pre-teen feelings I wasn't able to fully express myself. I also heavily related to what remains to be my favorite lyric of all time from the band's 1997 album Transistor: \"I do, I don't, whatever.\"\n\n311's Tiny Desk set started off"}]
