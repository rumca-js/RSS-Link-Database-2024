<p>Up in the posh seats, Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali could have been forgiven for thinking that everything is going to turn out just fine. Nicolas Jackson, Chelsea’s all-action forward, scored one and gave Newcastle’s defenders nightmares. Cole Palmer, a definite contender for signing of the season, dazzled throughout and made another vital contribution.</p><p>Yet the crowning moment would belong to Mykhailo Mudryk. Mauricio Pochettino, who has been under so much pressure, erupted with joy when the £89m winger came off the bench to seal a resounding 3-2 win for Chelsea. It was a glorious goal, a wonderful showcase of Mudryk’s explosive talent, and Newcastle’s hopes of going seventh were done. They remain 10th after a careless display, only a point above a resurgent Chelsea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/11/chelsea-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Thank goodness. Because what it used to be was a straight-up beauty contest. Never mind that this was a roster of talented, hard-working women with the resilience to achieve success against the impossible odds of Hollywood – come the Academy Awards, the pretty ladies were lined up Miss World-style to be judged on how hot they looked in a corset-boned gown, while the men got on with the important stuff, like collecting awards for best director.</p><p>The red carpet is now a spin-off entertainment industry in its own right.

<p>Liverpool youngster handles Haaland, Thomas Frank should face a kinder ride and another Luton fairytale</p><p>This was a phenomenal Liverpool performance, and the quality and consistency of the players’ decision-making – except, perhaps, in front of goal – was extraordinary. It is almost insulting to the collective to single out any individual for credit and Jarell Quansah was certainly not seeking any when he told Sky after the game that he “didn’t have the perfect game but I’m striving to be good”. There was one obvious mistake from him, when he surrendered the ball toJulián Álvarez in the 57th minute with a goal very nearly the result but beyond that moment he was strikingly assured. A couple of highlights: controlling Erling Haaland’s run in the 35th minute and dancing through a few challenges in the 80th before sending in a low shot that was palmed away – demonstrations of his calmness and bravery. Quansah has played 24 times this season, enough to feel part of the gr

<p>Comments about our differences used to wound me. But then I was forced to confront my decades-long resentment</p><p>“Why are you fat, and why is she thin,” a puzzled middle-aged man asked, as my identical twin Katy and I strolled into a restaurant in central Mumbai for a post-yoga samosa. It wasn’t the first time we had been asked this question – but each time it hurt just as much, and stoked a decades-long resentment towards my sister, who was always being told she was better looking than me.</p><p>As children, we had relished in our identicalness and were joined at the hip. Physically, the only way people (even family members) could tell us apart was by our face shape. I had a slightly rounder face than Katy, with chubby cheeks that earned me the nickname Chipmunk growing up. Katy and I got the same grades, had the same interests, and on birthdays and Christmases got given identical gifts – but in different colours. We were inextricably “one”.</p><p>Lara Rodwell is a fre

It’s a punning nod to the Whole Earth Catalog: the 1960s counterculture tome of west coast environmentalism, DIY and tech utopianism (and more quietly, consumerism) that was championed by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/the-complicated-legacy-of-stewart-brands-whole-earth-catalog">Steve Jobs </a>and Silicon&nbsp;Valley mavens.
