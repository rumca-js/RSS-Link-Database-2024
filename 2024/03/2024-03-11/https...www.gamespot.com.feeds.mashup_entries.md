<p dir="ltr">Rise of the Ronin feels like a natural next step for developer Team Ninja. After two decades spent creating some of the best linear action games in the genre, the studio is stepping outside of its comfort zone with its first crack at an open-world action RPG. Combining a freeform structure with a combat style similar to Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and the Nioh series is an enticing prospect, and it's one of the key areas where Rise of the Ronin stands out after playing its opening two hours.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in late 1800s Japan, Rise of the Ronin sees you take control of a nameless work-for-hire warrior in what is known as the "Bakumatsu" period. This era in Japanese history is notable for heralding the end of the militaristic Tokugawa Shogunate, as the country transitioned to a more modernized government that saw East and West collide. It was a period of cultural revolution and uncertainty, and this transition is evident in much of Rise of the Ronin's design, fro

<p>Daisy Ridley is set to return as Rey in a new Star Wars movie, but like the rest of the world, she doesn't know much about it. Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/03/star-wars-daisy-ridley-sxsw-1235852536/">Deadline</a>, Ridley said all she knows is "what was announced last year."

You could even trash duplicates for "arcane dust," a resource that lets you craft new cards.

The prequel to the 1976 classic comes out in roughly under a month to theaters on April 5.</p><p dir="ltr">The video--seen below--focuses on two young women: Margaret (Nell Tiger Free), an American in Rome working at an orphanage, and Carlita (Nicole Sorace), who apparently "suffers from a touch of madness." At least, those are the words of Sister Silvia, portrayed by Shotgun Wedding actress Sonia Braga. Margaret is trying to look after Carlita, but it seems everyone is warning her of the dangers of doing so.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">That's because Carlita appears to be the eventual mother of Damien, the antichrist and subject of The Omen.

Below, we look back at how the unexpected sequel broke with traditions to stand as one of the most unusual Soulsbornes from the studio that created the genre.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Dark Souls 2 has, since shortly after release, been an odd duck in the franchise. It is the only From Software game in the Souls lineage that Hidetaka Miyazaki did not direct. Bloodborne, which came out the following year, stole its thunder (though it is hard to argue unfairly). By the time Dark Souls 3 rolled around, its predecessor's reception had distinctly cooled. It often, though not always, fills out the bottom of "Every Souls Game Ranked" lists. However, if you push past your assumptions of what a Souls game must be, Dark Souls 2 offers an elegiac and illogical sense of place, in contrast to the tightly constructed ruins of other FromSoft games. Dark Souls 2's plentiful pleasures derive from the ways

<p> In GTA Online's newest raid, the Cluckin' Bell Farm Raid, you can infiltrate a major cartel cocaine-smuggling operation with the help of an LSPD police officer. There are six total missions in the raid and a million-plus dollars to be made, so it's certainly a worthwhile heist if you're looking for some extra cash and RP. However, if you're a solo player, can you even complete the raid without teammates helping you kill cartel members? </p><h2>Can you beat the Cluckin' Bell Farm Raid solo? </h2><p>Fortunately, I can 100% confirm the new raid in GTA Online is fully able to be finished solo.
