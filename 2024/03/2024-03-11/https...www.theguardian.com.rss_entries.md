<p>This unthinkably terrifying story of satanists, paedophiles and trolls so unstoppable they end up in prison is proof that the internet’s off switch should be flicked immediately</p><p>Accused: The Hampstead Paedophile Hoax reminds you that the internet is the greatest unregulated experiment ever conducted on humanity, and leads you inexorably to the conclusion that it might be time to call a halt to it. If animals were the subjects, we’d have done it long ago on ethical grounds.</p><p>The basic story is an ancient one: Accused is a documentary about a witch-hunt, but one enabled in terrifying ways by online connectivity. It begins in 2015, when a video is posted on social media of a nine-year-old girl, “Abigail”, and her eight-year-old brother “Joseph” claiming that a group of parents at their school were making them and their classmates “do sex” and adding details that are absolutely chilling to hear come out of children’s mouths.

<p>This bleak, eye-opening film finds mass strikes, gobsmacking whistleblower lecturers and med students forced to survive on food rations of £10 a week. Higher education is failing so many</p><p>The comedian Geoff Norcott has a dilemma: should he be saving money so his son, “Little Geoff”, can go to university when the time comes, or should he buy a new car now? The conceit may be thin, and you can see the payoff coming, but Is University Really Worth It? is far more interesting than this flimsy framework. Norcott used to be a secondary school teacher, and he explains that in his time, he bought into the New Labour “education, education, education” doctrine wholesale, encouraging countless students to apply to university. Now, amid budget cuts, strike action, punitive fees and the growing corporatisation of learning, he wonders if he would say the same today.</p><p>In order to find out whether a degree for Little Geoff would be “a good investment” – and such corporate, fisca

<p>Köln led twice at Borussia-Park but still needed an equaliser from Damion Downs, a 19-year-old substitute, to salvage a point </p><p>“In our situation,” said Köln’s Faride Alidou, “you have to take every point.” There was a qualification coming. “Even if,” he said, “we’re not satisfied.” It was understandable. On another day the attacking midfielder, growing in status and confidence under new (ish) coach Timo Schultz, could have been the derby hero away at Borussia Mönchengladbach, twice putting his team in front with emphatic finishes after deliveries from his captain, Florian Kainz.</p><p>In the end, he wasn’t even close, with so much happening in what Kainz described as a “totally wild game.” Even someone as balanced as the captain struggled to find the words or, it seemed, the thoughts to frame it accurately. “We have to analyse this properly,” he said after the 3-3 draw. “But so soon after the game, it’s still difficult to say.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.co

<p>A cheat’s version of <em>malai kofta</em>, in which you blend readymade paneer with coriander and spices, roll it into balls, then deep-fry before immersing them in a creamy curry</p><p>This is a week-night take on my mum’s incomparable <em>malai kofta</em>, for which you blend homemade paneer with coriander and spices until fluffy, roll the mixture into balls, then deep-fry and serve with a spiced cream sauce. In this version, you quickly fry shop-bought paneer and serve it with a similar sauce that includes peas for colour and some other veg. My top tip, which comes from food writer <a href="https://www.roopagulati.com/">Roopa Gulati</a>, is that you can improve shop-bought paneer no end by giving it a quick soak before use – it rehydrates and has a lovely, fluffy texture, rather than bouncing off the plate when you try to stab it with a fork.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/mar/11/quick-easy-fried-paneer-curry-tomatoes-ginger-cream-recipe-rukmini-iyer

<p>In the near future humanity is doomed and our options are being determined by AI simulation – unfortunately for us, the AI doesn’t seem particularly bothered if we survive</p><p>This intriguing sci-fi thriller is a throwback to the kind of cerebral teleplays and low-budget movies that flourished in the 1960s: ripe with gloomy lighting and dystopian pessimism, but with barely enough money in the budget to pay for more than two sets. Think On the Beach from 1959, or Seconds from 1966 – but then lower your expectations because it’s not anywhere in their league. But it’s not bad, and the subject is timely.</p><p>The time is a couple of decades in the future, and humanity has accepted that we’ve messed up the planet beyond repair. The only answer is to start colonies off-world, starting with the moon. Helping to sow these seeds for the future is an AI called Jay that runs simulations to calculate risks and resolutions. All that is explained in a crawl and with faux news footage

<p>The Serie A leaders showed their freedom and flexibility against Bologna, and their ability to score goals that are beyond any other team</p><p>Marco Parolo was only joking when he posed the question to Simone Inzaghi last December. “Back when you were coaching me at Lazio you offered us players a dinner for the first goal assisted by one wing-back and scored by the other,” said the former Italy international during an interview after Inter’s home win over Udinese. “What are you trying for now? A goal set up by the defender from one side of your back three and scored by the one on the other side?”</p><p>The translation is a little unwieldy. In Italian, Parolo was contrasting “un gol da quinto a quinto” with one “da terzo a terzo”, but English does not offer an equivalent for this shorthand reference to footballers’ positions as “fifths” and “thirds”. The sentiment was what mattered. Parolo was marvelling like the rest of us at the fluidity of an Internazionale side in whic

<p>Australia’s captain was an unlikely batting hero once more but New Zealand’s defeat should never really have happened</p><p>To be clear, things like this don’t happen often. Setting up in the fourth innings of the Christchurch Test, Australia needed 279 to win. Australian Test teams have been getting on the park for 147 years. Before Monday, they had chased bigger targets than this a grand total of 13 times. Now that total is up to 14, after an innings that could have gone wrong any number of times, did go wrong in three different bursts, and ultimately went calmly and deliberately right.</p><p>One of that previous baker’s dozen of wins came in Edgbaston last year. Late on the fifth day, in the gathering gloom, it was the bowling captain Pat Cummins batting at No 8, finishing on 44 not out, hitting the winning runs with two wickets in hand to reach the target of 282. This time, late on the fourth day, it was Cummins batting at No 9, finishing on 32 not out, hitting the win

Norris Wong’s initially light and scampering comedy drama is counterbalanced by a cynicism that warns of the emotional hazards of dreaming big in this ego-crushing melody factory. In the words of the film’s swansong: “Success is great, but no one talks about being frustrated.”</p><p>Sze (Chung Suet Ying) is part of a high-school posse of aspiring Cantopop lyric- and songwriters.

Living in a rudimentarily furnished home in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa, sixtysomething Sami has spent nearly two decades translating Greek mythology into Amharic.

<p>An ‘empty patch’ in the national story, the Edwardian era – between the death of Queen Victoria and the start of the<strong> </strong>first world war<em> –</em> has many parallels with today</p><p>Alwyn Turner is known for writing wittily about recent eras of British history, with popular culture placed to the fore. Here, he delves further back in time, to that poignant interlude between the death of Queen Victoria and the start of the first world war, when a sort of stodgy calm coexisted with a growing sense of insecurity that seems, in retrospect, entirely justified.</p><p>His description of the man who gave his name to the era provides a foretaste of his droll style. Edward VII was “a very different proposition” to his mother, Queen Victoria, “a well-upholstered yet less weighty figure, more cavalier and more public, like a latter-day Henry VIII, though with multiple mistresses rather than wives”.

<p>Doctors and paramedics in the Donetsk region describe their experiences of evacuating and treating the wounded</p><p>When Russia launched its invasion in 2022, Roman Vozniak gave up his old life. A civilian doctor, he joined Ukraine’s national guard. “I decided to become a combat medic. I told my wife I’d be home in two months,” he said. Two years later, Vozniak is still working on the frontline, treating wounded soldiers. “Your job is to stop people dying. It’s simple. If someone doesn’t make it, you move on. You have to act quickly”.</p><p>Vozniak is based in Sviatohirsk, a picturesque city in the eastern Donetsk region. Once, tourists would visit its turquoise-domed 16th-century monastery, built at the bottom of a steep chalk hill, and relax in beach cafes along the willow-lined Siverskyi Donets River. In May 2022, Russian forces arrived. They occupied Sviatohirsk for four months. By the time they left, pushed out after a battle, houses and sanatoriums had been destroye

They are loose social structures, nominally hierarchical and ideally geared towards a common goal. While the Japanese director accepts that this puts him in the role of the father, he disputes the suggestion that this automatically makes him the boss. He supposes the cast are the children – often literally so. “The time we all spend together,” he says, “is very intense. The cast and crew become very important to me.” But at the end of each shoot, the unit collapses, the family members disperse and all that’s left are memories, mementoes and of course the actual movie itself.</p><p>This idea of the makeshift, sometimes impermanent household is a fascination for Kore-eda, who increasingly lives his life on the road,
