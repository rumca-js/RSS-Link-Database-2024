<p>The NICAR data journalism conference was outstanding this year: ~1100 attendees, and every slot on the schedule had at least 2 sessions that I wanted to attend (and usually a lot more).</p>

<p>If you&#x27;re interested in the intersection of data analysis and journalism it really should be a permanent fixture on your calendar, it&#x27;s fantastic.</p>

<p>Here&#x27;s the official collection of handouts (NICAR calls them tipsheets) and audio recordings from this year&#x27;s event.</p>
