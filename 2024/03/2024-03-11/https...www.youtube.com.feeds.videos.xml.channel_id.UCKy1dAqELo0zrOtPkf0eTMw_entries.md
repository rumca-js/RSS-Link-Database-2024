Rise of the Ronin from Team Ninja is releasing later this month and we got several hours of hands-on time to tell you more about how much we enjoyed it. Rise of the Ronin gameplay is a mix of Assassin's Creed 2, Ninja Gaiden, and a dash of Dark Souls making it a perfect recipe for many. But some graphical elements may look a tad dated to some players. However, the amazing Rise of the Ronin gameplay greatly overshadows any shortcomings we experienced during our preview. Here are our full thoughts.

## Todd Howard Told Fallout TV Show to Not Use Fallout 5 Content - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

The next Fallout game is a long way off, but series director Todd Howard has some idea what he wants in it - and apparently he called dibs on some of the ideas being kicked for the Prime Video Fallout series. In an interview with DenOfGeek, showrunner Jonathan Nolan boasted “We know all about Fallout 5; we’re not telling anyone” - to which Howard added “Well, there were some things where I said, ‘Don’t do this because we are going to do that in Fallout 5,'” The Prime Video Fallout series is set in the same universe as the games, and features some familiar elements and themes, but I think this goes to show just how much effort is being taken to ensure it doesn’t retread any familiar ground - it’s great to know that they won’t be rehashing what we’ve seen play out in preexisting games. Development on Fallout 5 isn’t expected to kick into high gear until after The Elder Scrolls 6 releases, and considering that’s not expected to drop before 2028, we’re probably not getting a new

Contra: Operation Galuga reviewed by Travis Northup on PC, also available on Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch.

Contra: Operation Galuga met my expectations as a marginally modernized run-and-gun arcade game, but it almost never exceeded them. All eight levels do a solid job of playing to my Contra nostalgia, and small tweaks to combat like the weapon upgrade and overload systems add a couple of much-needed wrinkles to its otherwise extremely faithful formula. But with only a few hours worth of things to do and very few surprises to be found, the rollercoaster comes to a halt too quickly and doesn’t have many drops or loop-de-loops to enjoy along the way.
