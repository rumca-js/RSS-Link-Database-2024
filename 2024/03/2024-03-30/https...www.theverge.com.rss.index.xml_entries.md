  <p id="yjrF94">Sony will use a new “PS5 Pro Enhanced” label to tell players which games take advantage of the console’s new abilities, according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-enhanced-details/">documents seen by <em>InsiderGaming</em></a><em> </em>yesterday. The outlet writes that to get the label, a game would have to offer a PS5 Pro graphics mode, which includes PSSR for 4K upscaling, constant 60fps framerate, and added or improved ray-tracing<em>. </em>It would reportedly also indicate higher resolution for both fixed and variable refresh rate games.</p>

  <p id="7E1Og2">Happy Saturday, folks! When Apple launched <strong>AirTags</strong> in 2021, it was a big moment for item trackers. Tile still dominated the landscape back then, however, thanks to Apple’s ultra wideband (UWB) chip and their ability to tap into Apple’s vast Find My network, they quickly became the go-to pick for iPhone owners.

  <p id="Xc1pUf">After Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump’s indie music detour to launch a heavily autotuned track called “<a href="https://twitter.com/LaraLeaTrump/status/1773505260281053235">Anything is Possible</a>,” the Democrats <a href="https://democrats.org/news/new-single-dnc-releases-partys-fallin-down-about-lara-trumps-disastrous-start-at-the-rnc/">have responded</a> with “Party’s Fallin’ Down.” Published three days too early to be passed off as an awkward April Fools’ Day joke, it’s described as “a new AI-generated song about Lara Trump’s rocky start as RNC co-chair.” </p>
