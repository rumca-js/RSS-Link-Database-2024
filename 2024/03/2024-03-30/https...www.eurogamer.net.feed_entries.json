Lower profile titles that aren't exactly triple-A juggernauts gain a new lease of life on competing console hardware. Giving titles like Hi-Fi Rush more of a chance to find a bigger audience can only be a good thing for the games themselves, and equally, could even help evangelise the Xbox platform and what it offers to a wider audience. However, Microsoft needs to tread carefully for obvious reasons - and a combination of bugs, tech polish issues and minor gaffes are concerning. In some cases, the PS5 versions receive features ahead of Xbox Series X and in the case of Hi-Fi Rush, there's a minor graphical upgrade of sorts on the Sony machine. \n</p><p>\nBy moving Xbox-exclusive games o", "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-hi-fi-rush-on-ps5-and-the-xbox-multi-platform-story-so-far?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Hi-Fi-Rush-Site-2.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Hi-Fi Rush on PS5 and the Xbox multi-platform story so far", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-30T13:07:33+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/1644525308_263_These-aliens-come-in-peace-808427766.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" /> <p>Louis Gossett Jr., the first Black man to win a supporting actor Oscar and known to millions as the voice of Half-Life 2's vortigaunts, has died at the age of 87.</p><p>Whilst the aliens were voiced by Tony Todd in Episode Two and Half-Life: Alyx, the original versions in Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2: Episode One were voiced by Gossett.</p><p>As reported by <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/louis-gossett-jr-dies-1e86e1441ec8b614a282f3de22490a07\">AP</a> (thanks, <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/louis-gossett-jr-obituary/\">PC Gamer</a>), Gossett died yesterday morning in Santa Monica, California.

This is something I find truly remarkable. For all the modern talk about portfolio careers and the death of a job-for-life, the idea of embarking on a completely new career in your sixth decade on Earth seems astonishing. At the  age of 44, I sometimes daydream about starting out again, venturing into the unknown, maybe writing a travel book or doing that master's degree I never got round to. But it doesn't happen. There are too many forces holding me back, too much inertia from mortgages and children and the idea of having to learn everything again from scratch. What Mandra has done is nothing short of extraordinary.</p><p>Mandra cheerfully admits to knowing almost nothing about games. \"I'm just not a very good gamer,\" he says when we chat. \"I've only played a handful o", "language": "en-gb", "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/meet-the-57-year-old-who-just-released-his-first-video-game?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "source_obj__id": 107, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/DirectDrive.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "title": "Meet the 57-year-old who just released his first video game", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
