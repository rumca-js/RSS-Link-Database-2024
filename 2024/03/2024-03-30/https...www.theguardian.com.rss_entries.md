<p>England midfielder reflects on club team’s mindset heading into showdown at Manchester City and handling pressure on big stage</p><p>It was a throwaway line from Declan Rice because at the beginning of the week his focus was with England – on his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/25/declan-rice-steps-up-as-england-leader-as-he-reaches-half-century">50th cap in the Wembley friendly</a> against Belgium on Tuesday – and captaining his country for the first time. Still, the Arsenal midfielder was asked about what was coming afterwards – namely his team’s Premier League showdown at Manchester City on Sunday – and he made the point that “if you want to get past that barrier of Arsenal being labelled as stuff, you have to go there and win”.</p><p>Labelled as stuff? It feels like a good starting point for another sit-down with Rice (twice in one week is practically unique for any player, let alone a&nbsp;card-carrying A-lister), especially now that the game is the next

## Ajer rescues point for Brentford in Manchester United thriller

<p>It doesn’t matter what they did two weeks ago, this is still the modern Manchester United, and they are still dismal. A 1-1 draw hardly tells the story of the game. Brentford had 31 shots, four of which hit the woodwork. They didn’t score until the ninth minute of injury time, by which point they were mystifyingly behind, but really by then they should have won almost as comfortably as they did in this fixture last season.</p><p>The problem for United under Erik Ten Hag has been that, while there have been decent performances and results, they have rarely been followed by anything approaching a consistent run. Quite what the win over Liverpool in the FA Cup was, other than thrilling, is unclear.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/30/brentford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Unlike many others who struggle to move on, Collins has discussed her decision without anguish. Coming to terms with the end of her career has instead been freeing, allowing her to swing for the fences and ensure that she finishes with no regrets.</p><p>Having already started the year performing well, over the past two weeks Collins has played tennis of the highest quality, methodically hitting the best players in the world off the court. On Saturday Collins closed off one of the best working fortnights of her career by defeating Elena Rybakina, the fourth seed, 7-5, 6-3 to win the Miami Open – by far the biggest title of her career.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian

<p>There is a strong possibility that all four full-back roles at the Etihad will be filled by players usually deployed as centre-backs</p><p>In 1918, the Kyiv-born artist Kazimir Malevich <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/kazimir-malevich/white-square-1917">painted White Square</a>, a white square on a white field. It followed Black Square and Red Square and was the culmination of his project of “suprematism”, his belief that abstraction was a means of approaching a spiritual understanding of the absolute. By that stage, he had achieved international recognition, but it left him with a problem: where to go next? When you have taken abstraction so far you are painting in white on white, what remains?</p><p>And so, guided in part by the Soviet regime’s increasing hostility towards abstract art, particularly after the death of Lenin, who had been an admirer, Malevich returned to a more representational style. Some have detected a sarcasm in his later work, veiled criticism of the Sovi

Harlequins lost Louis Lynagh and Irne Herbst to the sin-bin and Bath took full toll to get a losing bonus point and a try bonus point.

With an appeal launched Forest fans, more than willing to voice their anger with Premier League powers that be, the stage was set for a vindication that never arrived.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/30/nottingham-forest-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The angst gripping Chelsea will not disappear until they learn how to manage games. Immaturity was key to Mauricio Pochettino’s side failing to make the most of Cole Palmer’s brilliance and somehow contriving to slip to a costly 2-2 draw with 10-man Burnley, who still have hope of staying up after extending their unbeaten run to three matches.</p><p>Burnley, their numbers reduced after Lorenz Assignon’s first-half red card, fought hard for a point. Chelsea led twice, Palmer scoring both of their goals, but they remain in 11<sup>th</sup> place after more poor defending. Pochettino will wince at the fact that his side have conceded twice in each of their past five games. He could not be surprised to hear boos after Burnley, who remain in the bottom three, held on thanks to goals from Josh Cullen and Dara O’Shea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/30/chelsea-burnley-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At some point, most likely next week, Everton will find out how costly these dropped points might prove. Sean Dyche’s side looked to have claimed a fortunate late share of the spoils on the south coast when a Neto howler gifted them an equaliser, only for Séamus Coleman to produce an own-goal clanger of his own to dash any short-lived joy.</p><p>Everton’s winless run has now reached a club record 12 games since they last triumphed in mid-December, sending them plummeting ever closer to the relegation zone. The fear is that the table will soon make for even worse reading when a verdict is delivered imminently into a second case of financial breaches, having already been docked six points for a first. Add in an uncertain takeover that has dragged on for months and the mood around the club could scarcely be more fraught.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/30/bournemouth-everton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From hippies to death metal and MPs, one book seems to rule them all but, oh, how I wish it didn’t</p><p>This is a true story that sounds made up. When Ian McEwan’s latest novel, <em>Lessons</em>, was published, I interviewed him at a live event in London, during which the conversation ranged from the fall of the Berlin Wall to Brexit. Afterwards, I went for dinner with a friend and, because many of the capital’s roads were closed in preparation for the Queen’s funeral, we ran a little late. Apologising profusely, my pal explained what I had been doing to the cheerful and accommodating young woman bringing us our drinks. The effect was galvanic. “No!” she exclaimed. “Not really! That’s just amazing!” It was indeed, I agreed; I’d had a terrific night. “I mean,” she continued, “Gandalf!”</p><p>I have since relayed these events to McEwan, who was both amused and delightfully sanguine about being confused with Ian McKellen.

<p>(Self-released)<br />The UK-based French folk singer embellishes her trad leanings with sultry blues and upbeat swing on a poignant and poetic second album</p><p>Her 2020 debut, <em><a href="https://julieabbe.bandcamp.com/album/numberless-dreams">Numberless Dreams</a></em>, introduced Bristol-based French singer <a href="https://julieabbe.com/home">Julie Abbé</a> as an artist steeped in Irish and English folk with a telling way with WB Yeats poems. The album closed with Yeats’s celebrated line: “Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.” Someone has clearly trampled over Abbé’s since. She frames this second outing as “a full cycle of love, celebrating the beauty of what once was, and honouring the different stages of grieving and healing”. It sounds heavy going, yet opener Lanternes d’Or is a slinky blues that evokes a postwar Parisian cafe, brightly sung and artfully accompanied by a small group in which clarinet and guitar shine.</p><p>It proves a lodestar for a song cycle in

<p>Despite my local council claiming to favour walkers and cyclists, it seems to be actively making my life more difficult</p><p>When I sold my car, I didn’t expect a pat on the head; I wore my halo on the inside, and that was enough. But I did assume that those who had encouraged me to do the right thing – among them, my local council, which supposedly favours the walker, the cyclist and the keen user of the bus – wouldn’t now actively seek to make my life more&nbsp;difficult.</p><p>Three years later, and part of me wonders why I bothered. Thanks to low traffic schemes, which benefit only select groups of very lucky people, bus journey times are often twice as long as they used to be, cars having been forced on to the main road. Meanwhile, the council has decreed that those who want their garden waste to be collected, as it has been ever since I’ve lived here, must henceforth pay £75 a year for the privilege – and for a service only half as frequent as before.</p> <a href="https://ww

Hindu scripture says dying and being cremated there frees a person from the cycle of rebirth and grants them salvation.”</p><p>In 2022, Yosifov, from Bulgaria, had already visited India four times, including one trip to Varanasi.

<p>The cut-price combo felt like one of the last bastions of good value. Now Sainsbury’s has ruined it</p><p>When I lived abroad, one of the things I missed most about Britain was a meal deal. I really did. It’s something we take for granted , the ability to go to any major supermarket and pick up enough food to tide you over until dinner, edible on the move, for a knockdown price. They don’t do it like this in other countries, generally. I can hear a Frenchman somewhere hon-hon-honing about the fact that our food culture is so pitiful, we have convinced ourselves we actually like eating an overrefridgerated supermarket sandwich out of a cardboard box and calling it lunch. He’s right, but here we are. I like a meal deal.</p><p>I don’t want any mathematicians to email me about this, but it is my understanding that there are several thousand possible combinations you can make out of the main-plus-snack-plus-drink offering.

When you’re using the yolks or whites of an egg, for example, you need to find a use for the other.
