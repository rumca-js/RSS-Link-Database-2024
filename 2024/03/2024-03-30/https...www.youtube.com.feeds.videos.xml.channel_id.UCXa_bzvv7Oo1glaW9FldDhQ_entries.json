This video aims to make sense of this concept, and how this game\u2019s open world fosters and supports emergent gameplay, from its environmental changes such as day-night cycle and weather, to character classes and AI companions that influence how the world reacts.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiQzsnmXuS8", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UiQzsnmXuS8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dragon's Dogma 2's EMERGENT OPEN WORLD Is Borderline Unrivalled", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-30T15:30:01+00:00", "description": "The open world shooter has become a household genre in gaming with its fun mechanics and systemic design elements that make for a dynamic moment-to-moment gameplay loop. \n\nFar Cry 2 paved the way for the mega-hit that was Far Cry 3, and Far Cry 4 iterated on those elements with several refinements and improvements that made for a compelling open-world experience back in the day. \n\nWith this video, we take a look back at the game and uncover what made it tick.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86X-xiXGIsk", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/86X-xiXGIsk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "What Made Far Cry 4 ONE HELL OF A GAME?", "user": null, "vote": 0}, {"age": null, "album": "", "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-30T09:30:01+00:00", "description": "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League hasn't been doing so hot since its long-dreaded launch in February.

Unfortunately, the \"content\" part is extremely light, with the player grinding through the same repetitive activities to take on yet another reskinned boss - er, Brainiac clone.\n\nThe story is also laughably bare, with a motion comic intro showcasing The Joker's predicament and a \"humorous\" scene where he joins the Squad. Couple this with the grind to get The Joker, which Rocksteady will give instant access to at $10, and this first Episode of content only solidifies the game's dismal state.", "language": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8C4nkTUfJA", "manual_status_code": 0, "page_rating": 100, "page_rating_contents": 100, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "permanent": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "status_code": 0, "tags": [], "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/a8C4nkTUfJA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League\u2019s Joker Season - WHAT THE HELL?!", "user": null, "vote": 0}]
