<p>An AI chatbot released by the New York City government to help business owners access pertinent information has been spouting falsehoods, at times even misinforming users about actions that are against the law, according to a report from <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://themarkup.org/news/2024/03/29/nycs-ai-chatbot-tells-businesses-to-break-the-law"><em><ins>The Markup</ins></em></a><em>. </em>The report, which was co-published with the local nonprofit newsrooms <em>Documented</em> and <em>The City</em>, includes numerous examples of inaccuracies in the chatbot‚Äôs responses to questions relating to housing policies, workers‚Äô rights and other topics.</p>

<p>X is <a href="https://twitter.com/XNews/status/1773821491626295487">funding a lawsuit</a> filed by Chloe Happe against her former employer Block, which was founded by Jack Dorsey, the same person who founded the website formerly known as Twitter. In her lawsuit, Happe said Block had wrongfully fired her in retaliation for two posts she made on what she called her "pseudonymous, satirical account" on X while on her personal time. One of the posts made after the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel referenced refugees fleeing Gaza and and coming to the region of Kurdistan. In another, she used ableist language and a slur against transgender people while referencing the use of a "gender neutral restroom in the office."</p>
<p>Happe repeatedly stressed that she "expressed her political views, opinions, or beliefs in the form of satire." She said she did not mention Block in any post on her anonymous account and that she did not make those posts during her work hours. Happe also said that

<p>US Congressional staff members can no longer use Microsoft's Copilot on their government-issued devices, according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/29/congress-house-strict-ban-microsoft-copilot-staffers"><em>Axios</em></a>. The publication said it obtained a memo from House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine Szpindor, telling Congress personnel that the AI chatbot is now officially prohibited. Apparently, the Office of Cybersecurity has deemed Copilot to be a risk &quot;due to the threat of leaking House data to non-House approved cloud services.&quot; While there's nothing stopping them from using Copilot on their own phones and laptops, it will now be blocked on all Windows devices owned by the Congress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost a year ago, the Congress also set a strict limit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-is-reportedly-limiting-staff-use-of-ai-models-like-chatgpt-195454777.html">on the use of ChatGPT</a>, which is powered by OpenAI's large language models,
