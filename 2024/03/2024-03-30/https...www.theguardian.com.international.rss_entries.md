<p></p><p>Bayern Munich’s Bundesliga title hopes all but evaporated after a 2-0 home loss to Borussia Dortmund on left them 13 points behind the leaders, Bayer Leverkusen, with seven games remaining.</p><p>Bayern, winners of the previous 11 league crowns, were inefficient in attack and their first shot on goal came late in the second half, with the usually deadly striker Harry Kane having earlier missed their best chances. For Dortmund, it was a first league win in Munich in 10 years, with the Ruhr valley club tightening their hold on fourth place that leads to next season’s Champions League group stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/30/bayern-munich-borussia-dortmund-bundesliga-match-report">Continue reading...</a>
