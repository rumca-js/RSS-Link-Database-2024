The Hype case is anywhere from $100 to $200, depending on where and when you look, and has poorly copied nearly every aspect of the Hyte Y60. We haven't seen a ripoff this egregious previously, and that's because even the product page has literal copied & pasted text from real Hyte's product pages. This is part of our new case testing methodology that we debuted for 2024. You can learn some basics in our Fractal North XL review below.\n\nWe previously reviewed & benchmarked the Hyte Y60 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfsG-Ai2PA -- comparatively, it seems as if the Hype is a step beyond a Hyte clone.\n\nFractal North XL review & debut of new case methodology: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQHKCjuYTVQ\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
