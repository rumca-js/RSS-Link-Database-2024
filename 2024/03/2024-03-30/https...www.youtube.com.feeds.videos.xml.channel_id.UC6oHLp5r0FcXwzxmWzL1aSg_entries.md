This is a video of Francis Jehl (September 6, 1860 - February 11, 1941) speaking in 1932 about working as a lab assistant with Thomas Edison in 1879.  Before working there, he studied chemistry at Cooper Union at night and worked as an assistant for Grosvenor P. Lowrey.  Mr. Lowrey was a founder of both the Edison Electric Light Company and the first Edison company in New York.
