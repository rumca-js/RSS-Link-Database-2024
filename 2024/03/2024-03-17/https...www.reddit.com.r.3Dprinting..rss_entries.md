## Looking for a hard TPU that doesn't cost a fortune.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love using TPU to print parts for robotics projects because of its impact resistance and great layer adhesion. I'm currently using Overture high speed 95A, and while its good, I wish it was less flexible. Is there a good &quot;harder&quot; TPU that doesn't cost a fortune? I know Ninjatek and BASF both make TPU that have a hardness of around 65D, but they also cost about $100/kg. I did find a slightly cheaper material from a company called Extrudr that's 58D, but I can't find out much about it. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Im-a-spider-ama"> /u/Im-a-spider-ama </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1bh9bym/looking_for_a_hard_tpu_that_doesnt_cost_a_fortune/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1bh9bym/looking_for_a_hard_tpu_that_doesnt_cost_a_fortune/">[comments]</a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, so I've been using this to great effect but never really seen it talked about anywhere in 3D printing. </p> <p>I use a concept that's used a lot by engineers to make loose hills safe. It's called ground anchoring. Basically they drill into the side of a landslide area until they hit something solid, and then screw on a gigantic washer which helps hold the landslide back. Then they tighten it up, to compress the loose material between the solid rock, and the loose outside mud/rock. </p> <p>Also another engineering method is similar too, called prestressing concrete (thanks <a href="/u/phirebird">/u/phirebird</a> for making me aware of that).</p> <p>So what I have been doing is when I need a print to be very strong across the layer lines, I put a 3.5mm hole (make it .5mm larger than whatever bolt you're using) in my part almost all the way through all the layers. </p> <p>You want a decent amount of walls for this to work, and the bolt hole
