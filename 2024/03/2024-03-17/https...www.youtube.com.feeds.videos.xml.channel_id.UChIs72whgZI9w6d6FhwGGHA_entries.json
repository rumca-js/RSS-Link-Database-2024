Other than talking about how GPU drivers actually work, we get into what it means when a game is \"compiling shaders\" or is \"caching shaders,\" what it means for a game to be \"unoptimized\" vs. the drivers or hardware, and more. The key goal is to define drivers and how they interact at both a hardware and software level, giving a better understanding as to what it means when Intel, NVIDIA, or AMD talk about \"optimizing\" performance. Likewise, this helps cover some of what it means for a game developer to have an \"unoptimized\" game. We're joined by Intel Engineer Tom Petersen for this discussion.
