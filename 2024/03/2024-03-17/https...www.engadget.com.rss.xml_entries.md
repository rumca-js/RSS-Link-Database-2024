<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> is a hoverboard sim. Technically, it’s a third-person roguelite adventure set in a luminous fantasy-cyberpunk universe, but after playing a 30-minute preview, it’s clear to me that <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> is all about the hoverboard. Vicious beasts, secret alcoves and shiny weapons are secondary to the feeling of gliding over green hills and shallow waters on my glowing blue slab, finding joy in narrowly avoiding enemy encounters.</p>
<p>Intentionally skipping battles was probably the opposite of what lead animator Chris Bullock wanted me to do during the first public hands-on opportunity with <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> — but if that were the case, then he shouldn’t have told me about the hoverboard.</p>

<p>LinkedIn, a platform that surely everybody associates with fun, may soon offer puzzle-based games to give its users something to do besides networking.

<p>A San Francisco judge has ruled that Apple must face a lawsuit accusing the company of negligence over the potential stalking risks created by its AirTags,<em>&nbsp;</em><a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-15/apple-must-face-suit-claiming-air-tags-are-weapon-of-stalkers?srnd=all&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reports. While the bulk of the roughly three dozen claims in the class-action suit were dismissed, US District Judge Vince Chhabria denied Apple’s bid to have the suit thrown out based on three plaintiffs’ claims alleging that “when they were stalked, the problems with the AirTag’s safety features were substantial, and that those safety defects caused their injuries.”</p>
<p>While the suit argues that Apple was warned of the potential for its Bluetooth item trackers to be misused and thus should be held liable under California law, Apple disagrees, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. After

However, don’t confuse it for another Prime Day; according to the retail giant, some offers will be Prime-exclusive, but most will not. We don’t expect the spring sale to be heavy on tech deals either, but rather focus on things like seasonal fashion, outdoor gear and home goods.<br /><br />Nevertheless,  if you're hoping to grab a good gadget at a discount, we'll be sorting through the noise and picking out the handful of tech deals that are actually worth your time.
