I like pc gaming. I like not being constrained to the limits of a closed ecosystem.

Consoles can be nice too, but they have their limits.

But Microsoft is in a unique position to combine their Xbox brand with the Windows operating system.

The best of both worlds? Or a nightmare? Or impossible?

Today I want to talk about why I feel the next Xbox might not go in the direction that some are hoping for.
