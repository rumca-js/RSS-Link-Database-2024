[{"page_rating": 94, "description": "Cappadocia is getting overcrowded and expensive and has become a typical tourist destination. On my second trip to Turkey, I found a new place called So\u011fanl\u0131, which is hardly 50 kilometres away from G\u00f6reme, Ortahisar and other hotspots of the Cappadocia region. The inter-connected and multi-storeyed cave system of Soganli is FREE for everyone compared to the 20-30 Euros tourists pay in G\u00f6reme. So\u011fanl\u0131 is a comparatively lesser-known destination, so there is almost no crowd there. A few travel agencies have operated Hot Air Balloons there, which is a way cheaper alternative to Cappadocia hot air balloons. Watch this video to learn how I reached So\u011fanl\u0131 from Ortahisar. What are the places in So\u011fanl\u0131 and the history behind the place? #TravelVlog #Mountaintrekker #Turkey\n\n\nIf you like my videos, PLEASE SHARE them and let others get inspired to explore this beautiful world.
