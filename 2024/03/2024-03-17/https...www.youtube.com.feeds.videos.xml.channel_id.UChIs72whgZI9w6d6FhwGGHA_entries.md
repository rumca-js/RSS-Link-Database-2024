In this discussion, we talk about a number of questions relating to GPU performance in gaming. Other than talking about how GPU drivers actually work, we get into what it means when a game is "compiling shaders" or is "caching shaders," what it means for a game to be "unoptimized" vs. the drivers or hardware, and more. The key goal is to define drivers and how they interact at both a hardware and software level, giving a better understanding as to what it means when Intel, NVIDIA, or AMD talk about "optimizing" performance. Likewise, this helps cover some of what it means for a game developer to have an "unoptimized" game. We're joined by Intel Engineer Tom Petersen for this discussion.
