Rise of the Ronin has spurred much discussion over the past few weeks. There's the usual hype that comes with a new Team Ninja title, especially one that's exclusive to the PlayStation 5. It's also the developer's biggest and perhaps most ambitious project yet.

We are, however, fans above all else, and as fans, even when we’ve attempted to internalize those facts, we can’t seem to sufficiently silence the part of ourselves that keeps getting restless over that really cool looking game that was announced so long ago that just refuses to come out. 

Here, that’s exactly what we’ll be talking about, as we go over a few games that we’ve been looking forward to anxiously, and for what has started to feel like an eternity.
