Cappadocia is getting overcrowded and expensive and has become a typical tourist destination. On my second trip to Turkey, I found a new place called Soğanlı, which is hardly 50 kilometres away from Göreme, Ortahisar and other hotspots of the Cappadocia region. The inter-connected and multi-storeyed cave system of Soganli is FREE for everyone compared to the 20-30 Euros tourists pay in Göreme. Soğanlı is a comparatively lesser-known destination, so there is almost no crowd there. A few travel agencies have operated Hot Air Balloons there, which is a way cheaper alternative to Cappadocia hot air balloons. Watch this video to learn how I reached Soğanlı from Ortahisar. What are the places in Soğanlı and the history behind the place? #TravelVlog #Mountaintrekker #Turkey
