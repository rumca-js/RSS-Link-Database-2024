[{"page_rating": 94, "description": "Rise of the Ronin has spurred much discussion over the past few weeks. There's the usual hype that comes with a new Team Ninja title, especially one that's exclusive to the PlayStation 5. It's also the developer's biggest and perhaps most ambitious project yet.\n\nHowever, there's also been discussion about the combat, especially in this post-Ghost of Tsushima world. Rise of the Ronin has drawn its fair share of comparisons due to the open-world action RPG structure and use of Styles, parries and whatnot. It's also faced scrutiny for being a little too simple based on the opening hours.\n\nBased on everything seen thus far, Team Ninja looks to offer a different pace with the game's combat. Here's how Rise of the Ronin's combat sets it apart from Ghost of Tsushima, providing a faster flow with more choices.", "artist": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L2wLHEWE-E", "page_rating_votes": 0, "source_obj__id": 129, "page_rating_visits": 0, "vote": 0, "age": null, "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/2L2wLHEWE-E/hqdefault.jpg", "dead": false, "language": null, "page_rating_contents": 94, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-17T16:00:02+00:00", "title": "How Rise of the Ronin Sets Its Combat Apart From Ghost of Tsushima", "tags": [], "album": "", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "permanent": false, "user": null, "bookmarked": false}, {"page_rating": 94, "description": "Given how long it takes to make games, how much money needs to be pumped into their production, and just how indescribably complex and complicated the process of developing one is, it\u2019s frankly a miracle that any game ever even comes out. \n\nWe are, however, fans above all else, and as fans, even when we\u2019ve attempted to internalize those facts, we can\u2019t seem to sufficiently silence the part of ourselves that keeps getting restless over that really cool looking game that was announced so long ago that just refuses to come out. \n\nHere, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll be talking about, as we go over a few games that we\u2019ve been looking forward to anxiously, and for what has started to feel like an eternity.", "artist": null, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kqPB0F2vu4", "page_rating_votes": 0, "source_obj__id": 129, "page_rating_visits": 0, "vote": 0, "age": null, "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/0kqPB0F2vu4/hqdefault.jpg", "dead": false, "language": null, "page_rating_contents": 94, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-17T11:00:01+00:00", "title": "15 Games We Have Been WAITING FOR FOREVER", "tags": [], "album": "", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "permanent": false, "user": null, "bookmarked": false}]
