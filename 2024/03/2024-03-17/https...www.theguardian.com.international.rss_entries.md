Cockney Rebel, he suggested, would kick David Bowie “up the arse”: “he’ll say ‘I’ve got to step on it to stay at the top’.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/17/steve-harley-1970s-cockney-rebel-whose-tale

## Drive-Away Dolls review – Ethan Coen’s lesbian crime caper gets stuck in first gear

<p>This gleefully trashy road movie from Coen, co-written with wife Tricia Cooke, veers too close to puerile for comfort</p><p>Late 90s and early 00s cinema wasn’t <em>all</em><em> </em>bad, but it was responsible for a crop of particularly dismal crime flicks. Including pictures such as the now notorious <em>Rancid Aluminium</em>, these were painfully contrived and agonisingly ironic winks to camera, made by film-makers who watched the movies of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/quentintarantino">Tarantino</a> and the Coen brothers and figured, how hard can it be? So it’s disappointing that Ethan Coen’s solo directorial outing (his brother Joel having already ventured out alone with the sombre, stylised <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/24/the-tragedy-of-macbeth-review-joel-coen-denzel-washington-frances-mcdormand">The Tragedy of Macbeth</a></em>) is a 90s throwback that feels closer in tone and quality to his imitators than it does to the Coens’

<p>The Japanese director of Shoplifters uses different takes on a single story to tell the fraught tale of two troubled boys</p><p>A frazzled widowed mother, Saori (Sakura Andô), suspects that all is not well with her preteen son, Minato (Soya Kurokawa). The boy seems subdued and withdrawn; she catches him hacking inches from his mop of hair. He asks odd, troubling questions: if the brain of a pig was transplanted into a human, what would the resulting creature be, human or pig? Or some kind of monster? And then there are the injuries – an ear yanked so brutally that it bleeds; a livid facial bruise. Saori soon deduces that her son’s new teacher, Michitoshi Hori (Eita Nagayama), at his provincial Japanese elementary school, is responsible for her son’s brooding disquiet. She confronts the school principal (a confounding reflecting prism of a performance from veteran actor Yūko Tanaka), but is frustrated by the school’s response: a suffocating blanket of meaningless apologies
