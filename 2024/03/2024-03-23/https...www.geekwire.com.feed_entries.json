Then, we delve into the\u00a0U.S. Justice Department\u2019s landmark antitrust lawsuit against Apple, and consider the parallels to the DOJ&#8217;s prior case against Microsoft. And finally, we ponder Washington state&#8217;s plan to fight graffiti with drones.

The technique could be put to the test in the 2030s, when NASA&#8217;s Europa Clipper probe is due to make multiple flybys over the Jovian moon. The technique involves analyzing grains of ice that scientists expect one of the instruments on Europa Clipper &#8212; known as the Surface Dust Analyzer, or SUDA &#8212; to pick up as it flies through plumes of frozen water rising up from Europa&#8217;s surface. &#8220;It&#8217;s astonishing how the analysis of these tiny ice grains&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2024/europa-clipper-life-jupiter-ice-grains/\">Read More</a>", "album": "", "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating_contents": 94, "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 94}]
