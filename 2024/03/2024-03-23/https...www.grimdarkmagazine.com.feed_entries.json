After the events of Network Effect (we\u2019ll leave it at that for anyone who hasn\u2019t read it), Murderbot is spending its time safeguarding colonists from ruthless Barish-Estranza corporates and their shady \u2018contract\u2019 offers. The problem is, Murderbot\u2019s recent traumatic experiences have resulted in a noticeable drop in performance, which isn\u2019t ideal\u2026especially considering Barish-Estranza have their own SecUnits and aren\u2019t afraid to play dirty. There\u2019s a lot to keep track of here, with various new characters alongside quite a few jumps around the series\u2019 timeline (a reread of Network Effect, or at least the last few chapters, is definitely advised), but overall System Collapse feels rich and rewarding,", "album": "", "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating_contents": 94, "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 94}]
