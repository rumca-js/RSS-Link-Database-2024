In 1952, Christopher Strachey - a contemporary of Alan Turing - wrote a love letter generation program for a Manchester Mark 1 computer. It produced output like this:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Darling Sweetheart,</p>\n\n<p>You are my avid fellow feeling. My affection curiously clings to your passionate wish. My liking yearns for your heart. You are my wistful sympathy: my tender liking.</p>\n\n<p>Yours beautifully</p>\n\n<p>M. U.

Someone reported a segfault bug in his time-machine library. How you you write a unit test that exercises a segfault without crashing the entire test suite?</p>\n\n<p>Adam&#x27;s solution is a test that does this:</p>\n\n<p>subprocess.run([sys.executable, &quot;-c&quot;, code_that_crashes_python], check=True)</p>\n\n<p>sys.executable is the path to the current Python executable - ensuring the code will run in the same virtual environment as the test suite itself. The -c option can be used to have it run a (multi-line) string of Python code, and check=True causes the subprocess.run() function to raise an error if the subprocess fails to execute cleanly and returns an error code.</p>\n\n<p>I&#x27;m absolutely going to be ", "album": "", "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating_contents": 94, "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 94}, {"source": "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything", "date_published": "2024-03-23T17:50:30+00:00", "title": "Building C extensions for SQLite with ChatGPT Code Interpreter", "age": null, "user": null, "source_obj__id": 423, "page_rating_visits": 0, "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/23/building-c-extensions-for-sqlite-with-chatgpt-code-interpreter/#atom-everything", "dead": false, "tags": [], "language": "en-us", "permanent": false, "thumbnail": null, "description": "<p>I wrote yesterday about how I used <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/22/claude-and-chatgpt-case-study/\">Claude and ChatGPT Code Interpreter for simple ad-hoc side quests</a> - in that case, for converting a shapefile to GeoJSON and merging it into a single polygon.</p>\n\n<p>Today I have a much more ambitious example.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking this morning about vector similarity, and how I really like the pattern of storing encoded floating point vectors in BLOB columns in a SQLite database table and then using a custom SQL function to decode them and calculate cosine similarity between them.</p>\n<p>I've written code for this a few times in Python, with Python functions that get registered with SQLite as custom SQL functions.
