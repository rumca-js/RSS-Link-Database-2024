<p>Accident-prone British hope for Olympic pole vault gold has learned to embrace the mishaps and believe in her talent</p><p>Until the moment Molly Caudery charges down the runway at the Paris Olympics, before bending, twisting and flipping her body over a bar above the height of a doubledecker bus, she will be wrapping herself in cotton wool. With good reason, as it turns out. For while the 24-year-old has a favourite’s chance of pole vault gold this summer – and the X&nbsp;factor to gatecrash the mainstream – she also has an innate klutziness that could scupper everything.</p><p>“It’s just little things that happen in my daily life, like chopping my finger off,” she says, referring to a freak weightlifting accident in 2021 that required three surgeries to repair after 90% of a finger came off. “There’s a natural chaos that my coach has had to learn to deal with, because it’s just a part of me.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/23/molly-caudery-natura

<p>It is the itch that England have struggled to scratch. Rarely do they get very much from Brazil; their record in games with them is worse than that against any other opponent and it was a night when things got worse, adding a worry line or two to Gareth Southgate’s brow.</p><p>It was meant to be different, a friendly to fine-tune for the European Championship in the summer, even as Southgate missed key players – most notably the captain Harry Kane, Luke Shaw and Bukayo Saka. Brazil had been portrayed as being in crisis, the new manager, Dorival Júnior, warning that he did not have a magic wand. By the end, it looked as though he did.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/23/england-brazil-friendly-international-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a fascinating film rating survey shows, what is deemed taboo simply shifts with different mores</p><p>A familiar set of headlines last week: Brits are growing more prudish. The James Bond film <em>From</em> <em>Russia With Love</em> would today be slapped with a higher age rating: modern audiences fret about the violence.

You can’t say anything these days.</p><p>But within the findings of the vast research project conducted by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) was a little noticed second story: Brits are growing less prudish.

## The king of zing: lemons in art – in pictures

<p>Our love of lemons has deep roots. They have been portrayed in still-life paintings and pop art, featured in tales by the likes of Joan Didion and James Joyce, and even played a part in the founding of the mafia. So when David Lane and Marina Tweed of the food and culture journal the <em>Gourmand</em> were looking for the next topic in their book series celebrating individual ingredients (eggs came first), lemons were an obvious choice. “The lemon is the king of the citrus,” says Lane. Featuring artworks by Édouard Manet, Picasso and Frida Kahlo alongside a collection of essays, recipes and new photography, this is a book for dipping into. Does Lane have a favourite image? “The Egyptian wall painting from the tomb of Nakht [below]. It’s just beautiful.”</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.taschen.com/en/books/art/08024/the-gourmand-s-lemon-a-collection-of-stories-and-recipes">The Gourmand’s Lemon.

From his vantage point at the top of his country’s treasury, the view was bleak. The Irish republic was, economically and socially, in deep trouble. It had no natural resources, very little industry and was mired in a deep depression. Inflation and unemployment were high. Ireland’s main export was its young people, who were fleeing in thousands every year, seeking work and better lives elsewhere.

<p>Politically-inspired biopic of Indian politician who opposed Gandhi’s non-violence is hamstrung by its own lack of action </p><p>Of all the hot takes you expect to see when you go to the cinema, the suggestion that Mahatma Gandhi was overrated is perhaps low down the list. But this Hindi biopic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinayak_Damodar_Savarkar">Hindu nationalist leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar</a> (directed and co-written by Randeep Hooda, who also stars as Savarkar in a committed and involving performance) argues exactly that, although it’s careful to have Savarkar note: “I don’t hate Gandhi, I hate non-violence.” Okay then. In general, the stance across the nearly three-hour runtime is that, in contrast to the famous maxim, the sword is in fact mightier than the pen, with Savarkar exhorting followers to “get rid of your pen and arm yourselves”.</p><p>What is odd is that the film doesn’t make more use of its own subject’s principles.

The bait for my new trail camera had to be as pungent as possible. Beside a small tree deep in the woods, we laid out the food and set up the camera. The trees were thick and the sky was growing darker, so we quickly returned home.</p><p>That night, I heard muntjac deer barking and felt hopeful. The next morning, trying to remember the spot, we went to collect the camera. The food was gone – we raced home to look at the footage, and to my delight something ginger flashed past the camera.

<p>Craft yourself some Glamorgan sausages out of stale bread, dark green leek tops and bean water</p><p>Last year, I helped the Welsh government set up a food sustainability toolkit for home cooks and food industry professionals alike. You can <a href="https://food-drink.wales/">access it for free</a>, and it’s full of tips to help reduce food waste, packaging and energy use in the kitchen. The website is also a great resource for sustainable Welsh-inspired recipes, including <a href="https://food-drink.wales/recipes/fish-scrap-croquettes/">fish-scrap croquettes</a> and today’s Glamorgan sausages, which are a great way to use up stale bread.
