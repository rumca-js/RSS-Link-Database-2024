Adult Swim Games indie developers got confusing warnings from Warner Bros Discovery that soon their games would be removed from Steam, and they might not be able to recover or get control of the soon to be delisted games. Is this yet another sign that physical media dying out is the opposite of what we need, with streaming assets being impossible to own. Maybe the physical media vs streaming war isn\u2019t as clear cut as it was once seen, with the Christopher Nolan physical media commentary in mind. The fact that we own nothing is disturbing; lost media is more rampant than we thought in the digital era. IS there a way to prevent digital indie work from becoming lost media?
