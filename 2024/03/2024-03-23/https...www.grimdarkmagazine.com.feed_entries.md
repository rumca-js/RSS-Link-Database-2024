The problem is, Murderbot’s recent traumatic experiences have resulted in a noticeable drop in performance, which isn’t ideal…especially considering Barish-Estranza have their own SecUnits and aren’t afraid to play dirty. There’s a lot to keep track of here, with various new characters alongside quite a few jumps around the series’ timeline (a reread of Network Effect, or at least the last few chapters, is definitely advised), but overall System Collapse feels rich and rewarding,
