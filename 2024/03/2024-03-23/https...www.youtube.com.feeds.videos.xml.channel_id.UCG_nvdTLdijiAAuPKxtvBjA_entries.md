Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom pits Aquaman against an old enemy: Black Manta. The movie has good visuals at times, but overall it fails at being what it's supposed to be... a conclusion. It concludes the DCEU - Snyderverse, all other movies - yet it doesn't feel like a proper finale at all. So, in today's Anatomy of a Failure, let's dive into the topic of sequels and conclusions to see how this movie fails at it, and what to learn from it. One last DCEU video before we move onto James Gunn's cinematic universe. RIP sweet prince.
