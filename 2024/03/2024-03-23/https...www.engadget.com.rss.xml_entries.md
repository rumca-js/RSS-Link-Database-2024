<p><a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-ratify-tv-animation-contracts">SAG-AFTRA</a> has ratified new contracts for voice actors working in TV animation after members‚Äô votes came in at over 95 percent in favor of the terms. The three-year agreements put into place new protections around the use of AI, including a requirement that producers obtain an actor‚Äôs consent before using their name as a prompt to create an AI-generated voice. SAG-AFTRA announced the contracts‚Äô approval on Friday night. They‚Äôll be effective through June 30, 2026.</p>

According to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/rabbit_hmi/status/1771343600519139337?s=20">Rabbit</a>, the first batch of US pre-orders will ship out on March 31 (Easter Sunday).

<p>Rabbit is also hosting a pickup party in New York City on April 23 that it says is open to all buyers, not just batch one. It plans to release more information on the party and the first deliveries next week.</p>

<p>Good morning. I hope you're having a good weekend so far. Unfortunately, our recording schedule meant I didn't get to shoehorn in the fact that the Department of Justice filed an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/justice-department-files-antitrust-lawsuit-against-apple-over-its-infamous-walled-garden-144834571.html">antitrust lawsuit against Appl</a>e ‚Äî it'll pop up again and again for the next six months ‚Äî but we do have Apple striking a possible deal with Google to use its Gemini AI in future iPhones. Yes, I didn't see that coming, either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Federal authorities in the US asked Google for the names, addresses, telephone numbers and user activity of the accounts that watched certain <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-created-the-creator-economy-130028016.html">YouTube</a> videos between January 1 and 8, 2023, according to unsealed court documents viewed by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2024/03/22/feds-ordered-google-to-unmask-certain-youtube-users-critics-say-its-terrifying/?sh=78780911ca71"><em>Forbes</em></a>. People who watched those videos while they weren't logged into an account weren't safe either, because the government also asked for their IP addresses. The investigators reportedly ordered Google to hand over the information as part of an investigation into someone who uses the name &quot;elonmuskwhm&quot; online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authorities suspect that elonmuskwhm is selling bitcoin for cash and is, thus, breaking money laundering laws, as well as running an unlicensed money

## The best portable Bluetooth speakers for 2024

<p>After testing dozens of Bluetooth speakers, one thing was clear to me: there are plenty of good options for most consumers out there. That‚Äôs both a blessing and a curse, though, because it can quickly get overwhelming when you go to buy a new one ahead of your next camping trip or beach outing. I tried out a number of speakers at all different price points, from sub-$100 models to high-end, $500 and up gadgets, and most of them sounded pretty good upon first listen. But in comparing them head-to-head, that‚Äôs when I began to suss out the nuances among the best-sounding ones. Ultimately there‚Äôs no best portable Bluetooth speaker for everyone, but there are plenty of good options at various price points that should fit most use cases. These are our favorites.</p>
