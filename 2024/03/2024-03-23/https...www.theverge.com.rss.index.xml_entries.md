  <p id="sztu2G">Arthur C. Clarke famously said that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” and that’s never been more true than with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24102256/netflix-3-body-problem-review"><em>3 Body Problem</em></a> VR headset. It’s so far ahead of everything else on the market that it doesn’t seem possible. There’s really no doubt: this is the best way to experience virtual reality. Sadly, there’s far too little software to take advantage of all of that advanced tech; at launch, there’s only a single app available. An

  <p id="ddOzji">The <em>Financial Times</em> has a new generative AI chatbot called Ask FT that can answer questions its subscribers ask. Similar to generalized AI bots (like ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini), users can expect a curated natural language answer to whatever they want to know — but with answers derived from the outlet’s decades of published information rather than sources that are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/13/24099618/im-just-not-going-to-go-into-the-details-about-the-data-that-was-used">harder to explain</a> or are subject to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/27/24016212/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit-copyright-infringement">ongoing legal action</a>.

  <p id="w6jlPu">While a lot of our files are stored in the cloud, there are still many ones and zeros that get stored locally. But as the capacity of the drives used by our desktops and laptops has increased, finding files has gotten that much harder. How many photos and videos do you have stacked up in your computer? How many documents and downloads?</p>
<p id="uO5WEl">Personally, I tend to neglect file management because there’s so much storage space available. But when I do need a file, especially one I haven’t used for a while, the old phrase about finding a needle in a haystack comes to mind. It’s even worse if I don’t remember much about what it wa

  <p id="LvBDo3">I heard a new song last weekend called “Soul Of The Machine.” It’s a simple, old-timey number in E minor with a standard blues chord progression (musicians in the know would call it a <a href="https://www.fretjam.com/blues-chord-progressions.html">1-4-5 progression</a>). In it, a voice sings about being a trapped soul with a heart that once beat but is now cold and weak. </p>
<p id="fAQanp">“Soul Of The Machine” is not a real song at all. Or is it? It’s getting harder to say. Whatever it is, it’s the creation of Suno, an AI tool f
