Sala, the developer of The Falconeer and his new game, Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles. I was particularly eager to chat while development on Bulwark was wrapping up, since, as a pretty-much solo developer, Sala's process has always seemed so explorative.</p><p>In the case of Bulwark, this explorative process has resulted in a truly fascinating game: an adventure that tasks you with building a civilisation in the middle of the ocean. Partly shaped by The Falconeer's universe - and partly shaped by an \"evolving demo\" - it's another Sala-made game that's impossible to pin down. So how does it feel to emerge from such an intuitive development?</p><p><strong>How are things?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/the-fear-phase-tomas-sala-on-landing-another-falconeer-game?u", "album": "", "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating_contents": 100, "artist": null, "bookmarked": false, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 100}]
