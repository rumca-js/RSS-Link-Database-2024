Like miscarriage and birth injuries, this aspect of women’s life experience – and healthcare – has often been shrouded in embarrassment.

Between 2021 and 2023 the proportion of UK women aged 45 to 64 prescribed HRT rose from 11% to about 15%.</p><p>This is widely viewed as a corrective after many years during which it was underprescribed due to exaggerated fears about side-effects, including an increased risk of some cancers.

Philip Hammond had an undeniable, if deadpan sense of timing, while Rishi Sunak sometimes gave the impression that he didn’t quite know what a joke was.

His second <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/mar/06/budget-2024-jeremy-hunt-announces-2p-cut-in-national-insurance">budget</a> had all the hallmarks of a holding operation from a government hoping the summer will bring better economic news and leave open the possibility of another package of measures in six or seven months’ time.</p><p>Sure, there was the much-heralded cut in national insurance contributions, which formed the biggest chunk of a front-loaded £14bn stimulus package. Certainly, he took every opportunity to have a pop at Labour in a deeply political speech. This will be the last budget before the election, but it did not feel like the last roll of the dice for the government.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/06/jeremy-hunt-last-budget-election-tax-c

I don’t know how long orgies last – I can’t say I’ve ever been in one – but surely there would be a bit of perspiration somewhat?” But no spray-on sweat was allowed, no fluids at all. A very dry orgy, I suggest. “A very dry orgy!” says Curran with a laugh. “Maybe like certain royals, we don’t sweat.”</p><p>

<p>Voiceovers of Frida Kahlo’s writing give us unprecedented insight into her life as she dealt with chronic pain, divorce, infidelity, miscarriage and commercial success</p><p>“I paint because I need to.” The revelation of this new documentary about Frida Kahlo (yes, another one) is the white-hot brilliance of her writing. On the voiceover, Kahlo tells her story in her own words, stitched together from letters, diaries and interviews (brought to life by Mexican stage actor Fernanda Echevarría del Rivero). The end result has a raw, thrilling intimacy.</p><p>Kahlo was rebellious by nature. As a little girl she tugged on the priest’s cassock: “Was the virgin Mary <em>really</em> a virgin?” At college, on course to become a doctor, she wore men’s suits; in old photos, she looks like a beautiful boy. Then came the life-changing accident that nearly killed her. Aged 18, Kahlo was travelling on a bus that collided with a tram. “The handrail went through me like a sword through a bu

<p>Her savage masterpiece Judith Beheading Holofernes shows in gruesome detail what happens when a man is butchered alive. But how did Gentileschi manage to be so accurate? Our writer explores a centuries-old mystery</p><p>Florence is a city of great artistic violence. In its grand public square, Piazza della Signoria, statues variously hold up a severed head, grasp a screaming victim, and grab a doomed man by the hair as a sword is raised. A medieval alley off the piazza is named after the Baroncelli family, one of whose members was sketched as a dangling corpse by Leonardo da Vinci after he was hanged for his part in a conspiracy. Yet there’s no bloodier work of art in Florence than Artemisia Gentileschi’s Judith Beheading Holofernes, which hangs in the Uffizi Gallery. Painted for the ruling Medici family, this masterpiece of slaughter depicts two women in the process of decapitating a huge man who is clearly still alive with his head partly sawn off.</p><p>As well as the g

<p>This slight work by the Latin American master explores sex, betrayal and damaging secrets through the story of a woman’s one-night stands</p><p>Once a year, in August, a middle-aged woman travels to a Caribbean island to lay flowers on her mother’s grave. On the eighth of these pilgrimages, without premeditation, she invites a man who – like her – is sitting alone in the hotel bar, to come up to her room. They make love. Their excitement is mirrored by turbulent weather: there is a thunderstorm and blue herons fly agitated over the lagoon. When she wakes in the morning the man has gone. She doesn’t even know his name. Afterwards, every year, she sets out to repeat the experience with another stranger.</p><p>That, in bald outline, is the plot of this short novel, the last that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/19/gabrielgarciamarquez-colombia">Gabriel García Márquez</a> wrote, published nearly a decade after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/
