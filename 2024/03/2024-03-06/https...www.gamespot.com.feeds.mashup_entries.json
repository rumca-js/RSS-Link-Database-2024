Rebirth reworks that scene to be less about a rivalry between Tifa and Aerith for Cloud's affections, and more of a measure of your bond with your favorite characters and the friendships you've developed with them. While Tifa and Aerith's scenes are the only romantic ones, you can also bro down with Barret, who--as usual--has some words of wisdom for Cloud as their friendship deepens.
