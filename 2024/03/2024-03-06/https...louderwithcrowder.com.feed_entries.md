That is nothing new. They have done this with the following terms: gender, woman, racism, gender neutral, and more. They also make up new terms in hopes of decreasing stigma and/or misleading people on the reality of what they talk about. Some of those terms include unhoused people, climate change, undocumented immigrants, food insecurity, and the list goes on. </p><p>But there is an evil phrase among the most radical and insane leftists that some are desperately trying to normalize. This word is ‚ÄúMAPS‚Äù which is an acronym for ‚Äúminor attracted people.‚Äù I don‚Äôt have to tell you why this is so deranged and evil but clearly, there is a push to decrease stigma for the sickest and most evil members of our soc
