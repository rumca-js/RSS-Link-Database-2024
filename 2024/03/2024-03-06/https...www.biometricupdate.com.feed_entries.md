		Spain has temporarily banned <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a>, making it the latest country to impose restrictions on the iris biometrics firm’s operations. Spanish data protection regulator AEPD has <a href="https://www.aepd.es/en/press-and-communication/press-releases/agency-orders-precautionary-measure-which-prevents-Worldcoin-from-continuing-toprocess-personal-data-in-spain" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ordered Worldcoin</a> to immediately cease collecting personal information, and stop using data it has already gathered, for a period of up to three months.

The regulator says its ban is in response to a number of complaints, variously regarding the company providing insufficient information, collecting data

		Taxpayers will likely absorb costs of NT$280 million (roughly US$8.9 million) for Taiwan's failed digital ID project, according to <a href="https://news.tvbs.com.tw/english/2413676" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TVBS</a>. In 2021, during his time as premier, Vice President Lai Ching-te's 2018 plan to implement <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202101/taiwan-puts-digital-id-project-on-hold-japan-plans-to-expand-use-of-my-number-card">digital IDs was halted</a> after the public raised concerns about technical and security issues with the ID.

Contracts for the plan were already awarded, and suppliers sought NT $526 million ($16.7 million) in direct compensation from the government. Adding the cost of previously purchased machinery, venue costs, an

		It may become more difficult for people living in several Western African countries to cross international borders, with their exit from regional blocs that provide biometric travel documents and digital IDs.

The Economic Community of West African State​s (ECOWAS) placed Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger under sanctions following military coups in each country.

The three nations are now leaving ECOWAS, meaning that their citizens will no longer be able to use the ECOWAS Passport or <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/ecowas-commission-urges-remaining-9-member-states-to-issue-biometric-regional-id-card">biometric ID card</a>, and they will not be part of the WURI digital ID program.

Most hotels, hostels and bed and breakfasts in China now perform biometric facial scans as part of the check-in process. And yet, “there are no specific laws, administrative regulations, or formal written departmental rules that mandate the installation of facial recognition devices in hotels.”

		Two researchers say they have achieved “promising results” in one-upping the triplet-loss technique used to spot fraudulent face biometrics with a quadruplet-loss process.

The scientists, both working in Portugal, added a fourth image to the conventional three-image comparison technique used to spot facial recognition exploits including morphing. Their work has been <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.14665v1#S1">posted</a> on the Arxiv pre-peer review server.

Digital ID ecosystems are developing and evolving rapidly, but adoption continues to be slow in many places. Digital ID is already the main route to private and public sector services in some countries. It’s changing the way organizations in those countries are onboarding and managing their customers and members, and the changes are positive. But in places where digital ID adoption is still tentative, organizations that will benefit most from it still see digital ID as complex and confusing.

There are three key concerns that keep cropping up in conver
