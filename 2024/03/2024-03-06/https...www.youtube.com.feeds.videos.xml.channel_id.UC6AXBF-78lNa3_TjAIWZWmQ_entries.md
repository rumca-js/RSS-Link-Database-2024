Welcome to Athens, a city that has been an epicenter of human civilization for over 3,000 years. During its Golden Age around the 5th century before Christ, the city was home to famous philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Pericles who still influence our society today. In this tour we'll explore important historical and cultural sites, from the stunning Acropolis to the peaceful National Garden, and dive deep into Greek heritage. 

This episode is brought to you in stereoscopic 3D and at a maximum 8K resolution. 

Obviously best experienced with a VR headset!
