<p>Apple’s latest update to iOS has an important addition — at least in the European Union. With the arrival of iOS 17.4, Apple now officially supports third-party app stores on the iPhone. Web browser makers no longer need to base their apps on Apple’s WebKit, and Apple is opening up the NFC chip to wireless payment methods that are not Apple Pay. These changes all adhere to strict new rules in the EU. (Expect to hear more changes from Apple, Google and other major tech players as the EU’s Digital Markets Act comes into power.)</p>
<p>If you’re <em>not</em> in the EU (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-26-uk-will-not-implement-eu-copyright-directive.html">same</a>), Apple Podcasts now offers automatic transcriptions in English, Spanish, French and German. You can search text and tap it to play the audio at the granular word level. It wouldn’t be an iOS update with even more emoji (finally, phoenix emojis), lots of bug fixes and more.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.tidal.com/hc/en-us/articles/23008953804945-Upcoming-Changes-to-TIDAL-Subscriptions">Tidal is condensing its plans</a> in a bid to compete with fellow music streamers. The platform is removing its HiFi Plus and HiFI tiers to create one individual plan, aptly called Tidal. The new option will offer everything Plus users paid $20 monthly for but for $11— the same price as Spotify and Apple Music's one-person plans. It seems Tidal could no longer justify asking people to pay an extra $9 when its competitors offered similar perks for less (the company notably <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tidal-is-laying-off-10-percent-of-its-staff-140112305.html">laid off 10 percent of its employees</a> in December).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new solo tier will include Dolby Atmos, HiRes FLAC and lossless audio for over 100 million songs. Apple Music also offers lossless audio, but this puts Tidal ahead of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotifys-priciest-lossless-audio-p

<p>Logitech has been in the webcam game since way before the pandemic made having one a necessity. But for some reason, none of them were good enough to be part of its flagship productivity lineup alongside peripherals like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-mx-mechanical-mx-master-3s-amazon-sale-131512369.html"><ins>MX Master 3S </ins></a>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-mx-mechanical-hands-on-gamer-switches-meet-premium-productivity-070109417.html"><ins>MX Mechanical.</ins></a> That changes now with the introduction of the $200 MX Brio which sports a new sensor for significantly improved image quality, upgraded mics and a special hinge that could be really handy for presentations.</p>
<p>Even before you get to photo and video quality, the MX Brio impressed me with a much more premium design compared to the old <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-07-logitechs-4k-webcam-will-make-your-chats-more-cinematic.html"><ins>non-MX Brio from 2017</ins><

<p>Colorware has painted a lot of items over the years going back to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-08-06-colorware-does-their-thing-for-the-iphone-3g.html">iPhone 3G</a> and beyond, but its latest product is particularly clever. The limited edition <a href="https://www.colorware.com/p-1466-colorware-apple-number-2-pencil.aspx?c=variant-15y">Apple Number 2 Pencil</a> transforms Apple's 2nd-gen stylus into a facsimile of a standard HB #2 pencil, with the only thing missing being chew marks on the eraser.</p>
<p>"What sets it apart? It connects with your iPad in a snap, charges without a hitch, and delivers precision that feels just right," the company states on the product page. "And it’s styled after the familiar pencil we all know, upgraded for today’s tech. It’s not just smart; it’s a smart looker too." (As a reminder, the 2nd-generation Apple Pencil offers features like "pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and imperceptible lag," according t

<p>Elon Musk, who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-sues-openai-and-sam-altman-for-allegedly-ditching-non-profit-mission-160722736.html">sued OpenAI</a> for violating its non-profit mission and chasing profits, allegedly wanted the organization to merge with Tesla when it was starting to plan its transition into a for-profit entity in order to accomplish its goals. Well, either that or get full control of the company, OpenAI said in <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-elon-musk">a blog post</a>. The organization responded to Musk's lawsuit by publishing old emails from 2015 to 2018 when he was still involved in its operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When OpenAI <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-11-elon-musk-backs-future-ai-initiative.html">introduced itself to the world</a> back in 2015, it announced that it had $1 billion in funding. Apparently, Musk was the one who suggested that figure, even though OpenAI had raised less than $45 million from him and around $90

<p>Last year TikTok rolled out a new monetization system for streamers called the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-starts-rolling-out-another-creator-monetization-plan-in-the-us-182701698.html">Creativity Program</a> to encourage longer videos that allow it to sell more ads. Now, the company is rolling the scheme out widely with a new name, the <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/for-creators-future-format-summit">Creator Rewards Program</a>, that only pays for videos longer than one minute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;The Creator Rewards Program will continue rewarding high-quality, original content over a minute long with an optimized rewards formula focused on 4 key areas: originality, play duration, search value and audience engagement,&quot; the company wrote.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>TikTok noted that longer content is more lucrative with “with total creator revenue increasing by over 250 percent within the last 6 months, and the number o
