Their work is haunting and lyrical, language as beautiful as the stories are impactful. In a bit of a change from their previous work, Venom &#38; Vow is cowritten with their husband, Elliot McLemore. Venom &#38; Vow is queer, incisive and full of murky morality. Deception is core to characters and plot \u2013 taking queer gender expression as a means to deceive as well as explore identity. Not all is well in the world of Venom &#38; Vow. Cade McKenna is a transgender prince, pretending to be his brother in public. Patrick McKenna is the unwilling heir to the throne, desperate to escape his duties. Valencia Palafox is a lady-in-waiting attending the future queen of Eliana \u2013 an enemy country. Gael Palma is an infamous assassin. Sounds like a lot of characters, but it breaks down to two \u2013 a transgender prince and a bigender assassin/lady. For the most part, the story progresses along expected paths.
