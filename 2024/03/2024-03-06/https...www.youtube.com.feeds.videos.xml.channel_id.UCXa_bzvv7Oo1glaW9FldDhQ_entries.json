The sheer range of gore and shock value is overwhelming, and that's before the Psychosis kicks in. Red Barrels' latest title is co-op focused, though still playable solo, with players controlling subjects in Murkoff Corporation's sinister Trials. \n\nThough presented as \"rehabilitation,\" the objectives range from silencing snitches to mulching bodies. It's a bit much, but despite the repetitious objectives throughout, the gameplay holds up mechanically over multiple playthroughs. \n\nThe Ex-Pops and major villains also keep the action exciting, if more than a little stressful (especially when you're alone). Despite a more hands-off approach with its setting, a few AI nags and some Rigs that could do with some better balancing, The Outlast Trials is a frightening experience that hardly lets up.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwDB22_xbGY", "language": null, "comments": [], "page_rating_contents": 0, "permanent": false, "page_rating": 0}, {"tags": [], "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "vote": 0, "user": null, "bookmarked": false, "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/eTs6hKvKPDs/hqdefault.jpg", "dead": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "source_obj__id": 129, "album": "", "date_published": "2024-03-06T17:00:24+00:00", "artist": "GamingBolt", "age": null, "title": "Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 - 11 NEW Things You Need To Know Before You Purchase", "description": "RPG fans have been waiting for Dragon's Dogma 2 ever since it was announced a while ago.
