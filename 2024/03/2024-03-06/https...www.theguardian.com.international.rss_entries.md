<p>Comedy veteran Peter Farrelly shows very little experience with this puerile caper on Amazon about three friends concocting a wacky scheme</p><p>Imagine your husband, or your friend’s husband, or even your friend, has a pal you’ve never met named Ricky Stanicky. This invisible Stanicky character never visits, barely calls and seems to have about one crisis a year – testicular cancer, or a surprise return from charity work in Kenya, or rehab. This would probably be dubious at best, and baseline annoying. Then suppose this Stanicky calls with a medical crisis in the middle of a baby shower, taking two of the hosts away and causing one to miss the birth of his child. That would definitely be annoying.</p><p>Such is the baseline feeling of watching Ricky Stanicky, a new Amazon buddy comedy directed by genre veteran Peter Farrelly, which doesn’t have enough heart to overpower its puerile humor or its characters’ generally objectionable schemes.

Because by the time it met with disinfected steel, Siffredi’s member was well on the way to being a powerful business asset. It was, as

<p>From the ‘mad octopus’ to the prawn sandwich brigade, some of Ireland’s best wins on English soil remembered</p><p>Back in the mid 1970s, as now, Ireland were the dominant team in this fixture. They racked up five Five Nations wins over England on the bounce and their team sheets were decorated with legendary names: Mike Gibson, Willie-John McBride, Fergus Slattery, Ray McLoughlin, Moss Keane et al. At wintry, splintery old Twickenham exactly half a century ago it was Gibson’s understated brilliance that captivated this wide-eyed nine-year-old as Ireland scored four tries to one, with Gibson scoring twice and the visiting pack turning the screw. Johnny Moloney, the alert visiting scrum-half, capitalised on a couple of English errors to break the game open in the second half before Gibson scored twice himself, quietly popping up at just the right moment on both occasions. Watch the game now and the backs on both sides resemble human Twiglets in comparison with today’s gym-s
