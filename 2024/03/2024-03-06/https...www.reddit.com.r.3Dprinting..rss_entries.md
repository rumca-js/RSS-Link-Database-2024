<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Update, for those who were interested (and perhaps a question or two). As some of you may remember, I posted in this subReddit about 2 months ago about an Ender 3 v2 I found in the trash.</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/191itjf/ender3_found_in_trash_never_used_a_3d_printer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/191itjf/ender3_found_in_trash_never_used_a_3d_printer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p> <p>I knew nothing about 3D printers, never owned one, but had an interest to learn. I watched lots of YouTube videos about the parts and pieces of an Ender 3 v2. I compared them to what I had, and slowly began tinkering. The display screen and spool holder was missing, and the X-axis tensioner was broken off. But the big thing I discovered was that the hotend bracket was bent to the point where the rollers wouldn't tighten on the rail.
