Get your first look at The Alters gameplay which was shown off at the Xbox Partner Preview event.

After crash landing on a desolate planet with a scorching star, Jan must avoid the murderous conditions by taking refuge in a cutting-edge mobile base. The only issue? It’s meant to be operated by a skilled team and he’s just Jan. 

Thankfully, fate takes a turn with the discovery of Rapidium, a mysterious substance exclusive to this perilous world. Interacting with the Quantum Computer on board the mobile base allows Jan to manipulate pivotal decisions from his past—creating alternate versions of himself known as Alters—that have the potential to change everything. 

The Alters will launch later this year for PC and consoles. The game will also be coming to both PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass for console upon its release.
