<p>2p cut to national insurance already reported and further tax cuts may come as chancellor announces spring budget</p><p><strong>Harriett Baldwin</strong>, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Treasury committee told LBC this morning that she “definitely” wants to see an increase in defence spending in the budget.

It is assumed that Tory members want tax cuts above all, but the survey suggests that 74% of them think higher defence spending is more important. They said Jeremy Hunt should increase the defence budget “even if it leaves less room for tax cuts”.</p><p>Retaining the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/mar/05/jeremy-hunt-freeze-fuel-duty-budget-uk-car-sales-feb
