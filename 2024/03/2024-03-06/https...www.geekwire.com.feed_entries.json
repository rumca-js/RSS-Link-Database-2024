A day after a Meta outage knocked out Facebook, Messenger and Instagram, LinkedIn suffered a similar fate on Wednesday, as the social media platform for business professionals went down. &#8220;An error has occurred,&#8221; read a message across the site shortly after 1 p.m. PST. On the company&#8217;s status page, a message said that LinkedIn was &#8220;continuing to investigate the issue.&#8221; Update: The site came back online for me before I could even post this story to Tumblr. The Microsoft-owned platform boasts about 1 billion members worldwide.

Last year, 8.4% of the Washington&#8217;s high school students attending either public or state-tribal schools took a computer science class, according to state data. That&#8217;s fewer than 31,000 teens. Roughly half of the public or state-tribal schools even offer a computer science class. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a watercooler for people who are passionate about these things.&#8221; &#8211; Ben Shapiro, associate professor in the Allen School But fixing the situation won&#8217;t be easy.

Richard Edelman, CEO of Edelman, discussed these and other findings from the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer during visits last week with the global communications firm&#8217;s clients in tech-heavy Seattle and San Francisco.
