<p>1440p resolution (2560&times;1440) seems to be becoming the new standard for PC gaming, finally usurping 1080p for all but the most speed-obsessed esports fans. If you&rsquo;re ready to upgrade, MicroCenter has a rare deal for you &mdash; and even more rarely, it&rsquo;s willing to ship instead of making you come into the store. A 27-inch Acer Predator gaming monitor is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microcenter.com/product/674144/acer-predator-xb273u-gsbmiiprzx-27-2k-wqhd-(2560x-1440)-165hz-gaming-monitor#photogroup-1&amp;xcust=2-1-2257727-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">going for just $199.99.</a> </p>

<p>PC accessories like webcams don&rsquo;t exactly progress at the same breakneck pace as, say, CPUs or smartphones. In fact, Logitech&rsquo;s top-of-the-line Brio 4K design has seen only a few mild adjustments since it was first announced <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406618/logitech-brio-4k-pro-review-a-superb-webcam-ready-for-a-ultra-high-resolution-world.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">more than seven years ago</a>. Today, the company is updating that design and bringing it into the &ldquo;MX&rdquo; line alongside such well-regarded staples as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398011/logitech-mx-master-3-review.html">MX Master mouse</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1934170/logitech-mx-keys-s-review.html">MX Keys keyboard</a>. </p>

<p>One of our favorite online backup services, iDrive, has added a new feature: unlimited cloud-to-cloud backup from Microsoft 365 Personal accounts. </p>



<p>This might feel somewhat familiar: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1806088/idrive-adds-20-cloud-to-cloud-backup.html">iDrive offered a similar program</a> aimed at Google Workspace and Office 365 business users last year, which covered OneDrive, Exchange, SharePoint, and Teams. The Microsoft 365 Personal plan also features OneDrive, and the applications that would back up their files to it: Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Excel. The new Personal plan costs $20 per user, per year, the same per-seat price as last year&rsquo;s professional offering.</p>

<p>I have been working in the IT industry for over 30 years, for most of this time as an editor at PC-WELT (PCWorld&rsquo;s German sister publication), specializing in security. I test antivirus software, give tips on how to make Windows more secure, am constantly on the lookout for the best security tools, and monitor the activities of cyber criminals. </p>



<p>Over the years, I have acquired a whole range of behaviors and principles that seem completely normal and sensible to me. However, when I observe other PC users, I often discover risky or at least less security-oriented behavior. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve put together the 10 most important things I would never do as an IT security expert.</p>
