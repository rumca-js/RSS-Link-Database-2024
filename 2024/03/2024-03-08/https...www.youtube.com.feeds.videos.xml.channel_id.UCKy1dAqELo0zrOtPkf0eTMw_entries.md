Kung Fu Panda 4, reviewed by Emma Stefansky. Narrated by Akeem Lawanson.

Kung Fu Panda 4, the latest installment in DreamWorks’ underrated movie series about a spin-kicking panda, sees dumpling aficionado and Dragon Warrior Po take on a new challenge: deciding whether to pass the torch to a new martial arts master while dealing with the threat of The Chameleon, a shapeshifting sorceress bent on stealing Po’s mastery of kung fu. Though some elements of the previous films are missing or altered, there are enough new additions and expertly choreographed fight scenes to make this another worthy entry into the series.

Since Tom Cruise, Hollywood’s poster boy for risking your life on screen, first dangled from the Burj Khalifa in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, the franchise’s entire marketing blitz has been built around his next big stunt. Whole franchises, like John Wick, have sprung up around the idea of escalating action cinema with practical stunt work and ever-more-ridiculous fight choreography. Directors like Chad Stahelski and Sam Hargrave are fostering some incredible stunt work and forcing an issue with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences… Why isn’t there an Oscar for Stunts?

We spent the better part of 2023 asking everybody we could about that question, from Mission: Impossible to Indiana Jones, Fast and Furious to Extraction. Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, Keanu Reeves, Chris Hemsworth, Hayley Atwell, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Scott Eastwood, Louis Leterrier, Christopher McQuarrie and more all weighed in, while we dug in to the Academy Bylaws to see how tough a job th

On this week's Next-Gen Console Watch, Daemon is joined by Ryan McCaffrey of Podcast Unlocked, and Max Scoville from Beyond, IGN's PlayStation podcast. The topic: live-service games and the industry's obsession with them. The success of Fortnite and forced almost every major publisher and developer to look into making the next big live-service game (or turn an existing IP into one). But does that mean fewer resources for AAA single-player games? And what of the success of WB's Hogwarts Legacy (a single-player game) contrasted with the failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League (a live-service game)? Plus we go over last week's poll, and have a new poll for you to vote on at IGN.com.

## Unicorn Overlord Review

Unicorn Overlord reviewed by Eric Zalewski on PlayStation 5, also available on Xbox and Nintendo Switch.

Most of Unicorn Overlord’s issues end up feeling like nothing more than nitpicks. The tactical combat system is unique and complex while also being easy to understand, expertly blending mechanics from many of its peers with smart new additions of its own. The interesting terrain across the continent of Fevrith makes every fight feel unique, with some of the best map gimmicks in any strategy RPG. And because the campaign is told through the eyes of a diverse and creative cast, its tropey fantasy story is elevated in a way that a more traditional storytelling style wouldn't manage. The shorter, more personal stories work wonderfully to support a loop of exploration and liberation that always leaves you begging to see one more tale told, one more town rebuilt, and one more battle fought.

Nightingale's early access launch reviewed by Justin Koreis on PC.

Nightingale has a lot of good ideas at its Early Access release, but they all seem to come with unfortunate caveats. The ability to create and jump to different types of realms offers almost limitless exploration, but it also means they all feel too much like the same randomized bits smashed together. The setting and concept is really interesting, but not much is done with it yet outside of your charming guide, Puck. There’s an excellent crafting system that ties seamlessly into your overall progression, but that progress is halted with painfully long periods of fetching materials and farming Essences too often. Nightingale is almost equal parts fun and infuriating, and as interesting as it is to explore the Fae Realms, anyone taking the plunge right now should be prepared for some frustration.
