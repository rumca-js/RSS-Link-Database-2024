Neuroscientist<a href="https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/nathaniel-sawtell-phd"> Nathan Sawtell </a>has spent a lot of time studying the electric elephantnose fish. These fish send and decipher weak electric signals, which Sawtell hopes will eventually help neuroscientists better understand how the brain filters sensory information about the outside world. As Sawtell has studied these electric critters, he's had a lingering question: why do they always seem to organize themselves in a particular orientation. At first, he couldn't figure out why, but a new study released this week in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07157-x"><em>Nature </em></a>may have an answer: the fish are creating an electrical network larger than any field a single fish can muster alone, and providing collective knowledge about potential dangers in the surrounding water.   <br /><br /><em>Want to hear us cover more animal news?
