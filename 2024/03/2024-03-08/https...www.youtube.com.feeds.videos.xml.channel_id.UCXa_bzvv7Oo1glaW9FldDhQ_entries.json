Along the way, you\u2019ll take on various missions that help you earn money, allowing you to upgrade your vehicles, buy new trucks, and maybe even build up some amenities in your home base. The core challenge, however, comes from the sheer difficulty in planning an off-road route.\n\nWhat makes Expeditions: A MudRunner Game especially fun is the fact that, while there are several small things to pay attention to, like AWD and differential locks, and even just a fuel gauge, things never really get overwhelming. Instead, you\u2019re encouraged to plan your routes out, and take just about everything you think you might need for a long drive, because if you get stuck in the middle of nowhere without any fuel, well, that\u2019s your fault.", "bookmarked": false, "tags": [], "age": null, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-08T21:00:26+00:00", "permanent": false, "source_obj__id": 129, "page_rating": 0, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6MIVzzpD30", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Expeditions: A MudRunner Game Review - The Final Verdict", "artist": "GamingBolt", "vote": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "dead": false, "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/n6MIVzzpD30/hqdefault.jpg", "album": "", "user": null}, {"language": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "description": "Amid the hype for titles like Team Ninja's Rise of the Ronin and the announcement of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut for PC, one has to wonder about the status of Ghost of Tsushima 2.

Sony has confirmed it won't launch any major titles in existing PlayStation franchises until April 2025, making the outlook bleaker.\n\nWe could get an announcement sometime this year, possibly at the next PlayStation Showcase.

It was to be expected that Microsoft and Sony would extend their grace period for players still playing on aging hardware given the early supply issues both companies endured for their current-gen consoles, but this long into the lifecycle with new games releasing on decade-old hardware there\u2019re accusations floating around that developers simply don\u2019t care about current-gen. \n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t true. Fact is, there is still substantial player bases for both Microsoft and Sony\u2019s older generation consoles \u2013 we\u2019re talking millions \u2013 so it\u2019d make terrible business sense for both tech giants to abandon these players.
