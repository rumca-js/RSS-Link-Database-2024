<p>Chris Lermanis is a keen amateur photographer who spent his weekends in the late 1960s and early 1970s photographing around the inner Melbourne suburbs of Fitzroy, Carlton and Collingwood with his Pentax SV camera and 50mm lens.</p><p>He hand-processed the black and white films at home and made prints in the bathroom or laundry, which was temporarily converted into a darkroom.

<ul><li>Former world No 1 unlikely to play before Masters</li><li>Woods has played just eight events in three years</li></ul><p>Tiger Woods’s latest comeback has been plunged into doubt after it emerged the 48-year-old will not, as had been expected, feature in next week’s Players Championship. Woods, who had set a 2024 goal of competing once a month, is now unlikely to be seen until the Masters in April.</p><p>Woods’s appearance at the Hero World Challenge in November was his eighth since being involved in a car accident in early 2021 and his first since last year’s Masters. He finished 18th in a 20-man field with a level-par aggregate. “Once a month seems reasonable,” he said of his playing prospects for this year. His body has been seriously affected by multiple leg and back surgeries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/08/tiger-woods-absence-from-players-championship-further-fuels-doubt">Continue reading...</a>

It’s 30 years next week since Ken Rutherford calmly guided New Zealand to victory over Allan Border’s Australia in Auckland. That match is the last time the Aussies lost a Test or failed to win a series in New Zealand.</p><p>Thirty years! It’s a bewildering statistic, one that has perpetuated itself in the 21st century, and you don’t need Carel Struycken to tell you it appears to be happening again. Australia had the better of the first day, with Josh Hazlewood bowling majestically to nobble New Zealand for 162. If they see off the first spell from Matt Henry, who bowled beautifully last night, they should sit snugly in

<p>Two young protagonists discover something (but what is it?) in a disused tin mine in Lucy Cohen’s imperfect but atmospheric family psychodrama</p><p>Here is a dreamy, drifting film, directed by Lucy Cohen, set on the Cornish coast in the long distant pre-smartphone summer of 1991. It’s unevenly presented sometimes and not everything here works, yet it is interesting for its atmospheric use of location and images, its tonal shifts and a disconnect between the ostensible reality of what’s happening and the feeling that certain parts are a hallucination, a psychopathological symptom of trauma, or a remembered dream.</p><p>The scene is a wild and rocky coastline where Yvonne (Josie Walker) has arrived for a restorative break at a rented cottage with her quiet 11-year-old daughter Evie (Flora Hylton); Evie’s dad is not with them and Yvonne is apparently taking a break from her marriage. She has assured shy, sensitive Evie that during this tricky time they can hang out together,

To the great surprise of Salter, and others, the UKAEA came to the conclusion that it was uneconomic, and that no further government funding should be given to the project.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/08/stephen-salter-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Stranger Things star isn’t always convincing as a princess fighting for her life, but there’s some fun to be had from this rousing subversion of storybook tropes</p><p>Taking age-old expectations of how a fairytale is supposed to play out and giving them a brisk shuffle is by no means as fresh as some film-makers often like to think, upending cliches with a tired wink and a smug smirk. But Netflix’s Damsel, itself loosely similar to Hulu’s 2022 offering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kFCkfdOfMU">The Princess</a>, doesn’t require our astonishment at its wheel reinvention to pass the bar and is far too sprightly to get overly bogged down in the self-satisfaction of such an endeavour.</p><p>There are, in fact, very few surprises in store here – perhaps Fast X writer Mazeau’s script could have benefitted from a few – but there’s a simple, mechanical satisfaction to watching an underdog fight her way back from the depths, driven by a familiar current of revenge.

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells, London<br /></strong>NYCB’s first UK visit in 16 years brings a quadruple bill that looks to the past briefly, but mostly presents a very 21st-century vision</p><p>One of the world’s most iconic ballet companies makes its first trip to the UK in 16 years. New York City Ballet, in its 75th Anniversary season, is still much defined by the work of founder choreographer George Balanchine, but this quadruple bill shows a 21st-century version of NYCB.</p><p>Balanchine gets a look in, with 1972’s Duo Concertant, but the other three works were all made in the last five years. NYCB’s resident choreographer Justin Peck continues Balanchine’s music-driven neoclassical legacy in Rotunda, soundtracked by composer Nico Muhly. With dancers in practice gear, it has the undramatic feel of dancers at their daily work – and these are some of the US’s best dancers, with inbuilt speed, finesse and quality of line.

<p>With over 60 Tory MPs standing down and councillors quitting before council elections, there is a sense party expects a heavy defeat</p><p>Hours after Wednesday’s budget, the Conservative party’s great and good assembled under the sweeping stone arches of the medieval Guildhall in London to hear Rishi Sunak address the 50th anniversary dinner for the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank. His party had a clear plan, the prime minister told hundreds of Tory MPs, peers, donors and other assorted luminaries: one centred on higher growth and lower taxes.</p><p>Many of those gathered had listened in person as Jeremy Hunt unveiled another 2p cut in national insurance but failed to produce anything approximating the rabbit-from-a-hat announcement that Tory MPs hoped might start shifting the polls. Sunak’s remarks were therefore greeted with scepticism, and some even raised eyebrows and politely shook heads. One attender called the event the “most opulent funeral I’ve ever been to”.

The plan to bring the Xbox exclusive to PS5 had just been hatched; now it was time to get into the detail. “We were educating them about the game, talking through what was special about it,” says Neate. “It was so surreal,” chips in Chapman. “Trying to find treasure on an island with a group from a different platform holder …”</p><p>The PS5 launch is scheduled for 30 April, and pre-orders are now open, but it’s only the latest stage in the evolution of t

<p>New styles of red rioja offer more fruity, less aggressively oaky notes, while a new breed of floral whites are also hitting the market – but neither comes especially cheaply</p><p>It’s always a dilemma writing about a popular wine, not least because most people like it for what it is, rather than what it could be for people who don’t yet buy into it. Rioja is a classic case in point. What’s the problem, you might ask, with an easy-drinking, mellow red at an affordable price? Well, the answer is that there’s just too much of the stuff about, and there aren’t enough people buying it – sales in the UK, one of the region’s best markets, were down just under 12% in 2022. It’s the older generation (of whom I am one), who know what they like and love a bargain, who go for it, not generation Z, many of whom may not drink wine, never mind rioja, at all.</p><p>It’s also far from the full picture, as I discovered at a recent tasting with Master of Wine Tim Atkin, who produces <a hre

Until August, written when the author had dementia, comes a decade after his death, on what would have been his 97th birthday. It has been described by his sons as “the fruits of one last effort to carry on creating against all odds”, and tells the story of a woman who makes a yearly pilgrimage to her mother’s grave on a Caribbean island, a trip that becomes dominated by a series of chance sexual encounters.</p><p>In the face of increasing memory loss, García Márquez – known as “Gabo” – lost confidence in the work before his death, and asked for its destruction.

The book opens with the singer – who narrates – undergoing heart surgery to deal with a blister on his aorta that was ready to “put me in the next life faster than I can make an emergency call”.</p><p>He looks back on his life, describing the death of his mother from a stroke when he was 14 – he believes it was this that led him to become a performer, seeking the love from audiences that he had lost – and his troubled relationship with his emotionally distant, opera-loving father. Surrender also plots the formation of U2 with a group of school friends and the band’s ascent into a stadium-conquering behemoth.

<p>These last weekends of winter are time to do those small jobs before spring really takes hold</p><p>If you subscribe to the meteorological definition of the seasons, spring arrived on 1 March. But I’m a firm fan of the astronomical year and wait for the vernal equinox on 20 March, when day and night are of equal length, to revel in the blossom.</p><p>In early January I cheered myself up with the thought that by the end of the month it would still be light at 5pm. And the first day on which it felt like winter might be easing came a few weeks ago – one of those glorious sunny February days when the air felt thick with the syrupy smell of sarcococca (sweet box) and the earliest daffodils began to pop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/08/savour-this-time-between-winter-and-spring-before-your-garden-leaps-back-to-life">Continue reading...</a>

They talk about adrenaline, desperation – and interviewing Shamima Begum</p><p>In 2014, Vita Maria Drygas was filming in a war zone. She had travelled to the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine to pick up footage for a documentary when she spotted a handwritten advert offering “cheap” tours of the frontline. “It was a mindfuck,” says the 39-year-old Polish director over a video call from Warsaw, with quiet intensity.</p><p>She found the idea of people buying tickets to the frontline, like a theatre production, profoundly shocking: “It was impossible. I didn’t believe it.” At first, she assumed that the advert was a sick joke or maybe a Russian provocation. But back in Poland, digging around on the internet, she discovered the hidden world of war jollies: “A huge branch of tourism that is very underground.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.c

<p>Forget Barbie and pink cupcakes. Radical change is what we should fight for on International Women’s Day</p><p>In 1932, 75-year-old socialist Clara Zetkin stood in Germany’s Reichstag and, despite being so unsteady that she had to be carried into the building on a stretcher, managed to give a rousing speech lasting more than 40 minutes. “The fight of the labouring masses,” she declared, is “the fight for their full liberation.” She wasn’t a fan of feminism (dismissing it as bourgeois), but it was Zetkin’s dream that women everywhere, especially the most deprived and marginalised, might one day be free of all forms of oppression. The Nazis took power in Germany shortly after. Zetkin fled to Russia and died there.</p><p>On the day I went to see Zetkin’s former home north of Berlin in Brandenburg, now a museum, there were no other visitors. Despite her iconic status in her own time, she has been largely lost to history. Her bravery is remembered usually as a footnote to the f

<p>A vivid memoir of life as a nun in one of Catholicism’s strictest traditions, in all its piety and claustrophobic pettiness</p><p>Following the death of her beloved father in 1987, Catherine Coldstream was plunged into spiritual crisis. Convinced she could still feel his presence, she was consumed by thoughts of the afterlife and the fate of the disembodied spirit. A three-year search for deeper meaning and “a transcendent source of love” eventually led her to the Carmelites, a Roman Catholic order based on the hermits who inhabited caves on the mystical Mount Carmel. For Coldstream, they represented a new way of living and a chance to do God’s bidding behind closed doors.</p><p>Or that was the idea. Cloistered, Coldstream’s memoir of her time at the (pseudonymous) Akenside Priory in Northumberland, home to a 20-strong community of Carmelite nuns, opens with her dramatic flight from the institution under cover of darkness.
