OpenAI, makers of ChatGPT, conducted an independent review that found a &#8220;breakdown in trust&#8221; between the prior board and Altman — which did not arise from concerns around product safety, the pace of development, finances, or statements to stakeholders, according to the review. &#8220;WilmerHale found that the prior Board acted within its broad discretion to terminate Mr. Altman, but also found that his conduct did not mandate&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/openai-reinstates-sam-altman-to-its-board-and-adds-former-gates-foundation-ceo/">Read More</a>

Nelson was a featured speaker at the annual &#8220;State of Downtown&#8221; event hosted by the Downtown Seattle Association Thursday afternoon, where more than 1,100 business and civic leaders gathered at the Seattle Convention Center. Since becoming council president in January, Nelson said each of her fellow councilmembers is back at City Hall working in person each day. &#8220;It&#8217;s made all the difference,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The vibe is totally different.

The startup, based north of Seattle, has raised a $750,000 seed round and is now FarmHQ, which is also the name of its irrigation hardware and software platform. Customers were conflating the brand and product, said CEO and co-founder David Wallace, so the switch made sense. Backstory: David and Connor Wallace grew up on their family&#8217;s potato farm in Skagit Valley, leaving for college and jobs. David was previously a senior data scientist with Amazon&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/irrigation-tech-startup-led-by-farming-experts-blossoms-with-revenue-growth-and-new-cash/">Read More</a>

The community statement on the responsible development of AI for protein design is being unveiled today in Boston at Winter RosettaCon 2024, a conference focusing on biomolecular engineering. The statement follows up on an AI safety summit that was convened last October by the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington School of Medicine. “I view this as a crucial step&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/responsible-ai-biomolecular-protein-design/">Read More</a>
