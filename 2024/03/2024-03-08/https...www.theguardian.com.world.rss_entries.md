But they said it doesn’t appear to be a crude spill and are investigating the cause.</p><p>Richard Brahm, US Coast Guard petty officer, said authorities spotted the sheen after daybreak Friday about 1.5 miles (2.4km) offshore, and it later shifted about another mile further from the coast. He said there were no reports of spills or leaks from oil platforms operating offshore and the sheen does not appear to be growing, which leads authorities to suspect it was a one-time discharge or natural seepage of oil in the ocean, which is common.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/08/huntington-beach-california-oil-spill-investigation">Continue reading...</a>
