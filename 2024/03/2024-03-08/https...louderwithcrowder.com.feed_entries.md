But on top of that, he was a squatter. Meaning he took over someone's property and refused to leave. And because he de facto trespassed, he had ‚Äúrights‚Äù to the prope

But clearly, this woman is not of a rational mind because she is accusing the employee who packaged her order of doing this intentionally. </p><p>She also justifies her accusations by claiming she used to work at Target and wants us to believe that Target has never in the history of its existence messed up on an order and that it‚Äôs nearly impossible for Target to make a mistake.

It wasn't until MID male swimmer Will Thomas decided he was going to be Lia Thomas and went on to become a girls' NCAA champion that it became a national issue. One of Lia's opponents, Riley Gaines, has become an outspoken supporter of protecting girls' sport, and she paid a visit to Joe Rogan's podcast.</p><p>As it turns out, Lia wasn't the only trans person competing. There was a female-to-male trans swimmer as well. Yes, a female identifying as male could compete against females AND a male claiming to be female could compete against females. This is what we're expected to accept as reality. "You've got a six-foot-four man in a woman's swimsuit ‚Äì with a bulge ‚Äì nex

One notable moment was when Joe Biden surprised everyone by attempting to say the name "Laken Riley." She is the college student who was murdered by an illegal who was in this country because of the border crisis Biden created. I say "attempting" because unsurprising, Biden butchered the name.</p><p>He had no plans of saying the name or acknowledging that his border policies have a body count. He thought he owned Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene by saying what he thought was the name. Instead, he D'oh Bidened it.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">President Joe Biden at the State of the Union said USC head coach Lincoln Riley was killed by an illegal
