<p>Strikers are both enjoying fine seasons, but don’t expect every chance to be taken when Manchester City visit Liverpool</p><p>There will be smoke, noise and a sense of authentic event glamour. People will shout at a bus. The TV graphics will woosh and sparkle. In due course a skinny-legged man will perform high-speed tactical mime on the touchline, revolving both hands and yanking at invisible levers, as though reversing an imaginary submarine.</p><p>There will surely be goals too. Liverpool and Manchester City have mustered 50 between them in their past 14 games before their bravura meeting at Anfield on Sunday afternoon. But this also feels like a game that might just be marked by misses too, by shanks, muffs, scuffs, crossbar-wobbling hoicks. Chances will be taken. And in between, chances – Big Chances – will also be missed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/08/nunez-and-haaland-are-the-headline-acts-in-anfields-cauldron-of-chaos">Continue readi

<p>Have the new vegans had enough of being called ‘soy boys’? I suspect the reason is far simpler </p><p>It would be easy to assume that the rise of vegan diets and products is now inevitable. More than <a href="https://theconversation.com/veganuarys-impact-has-been-huge-here-are-the-stats-to-prove-it-221062">700,000 people</a> signed up to the official Veganuary campaign in 2023, more than four times as many as in 2018.<strong> </strong>Vegans used to be seen as humourless, sanctimonious and moralistic, but a new generation has changed the diet’s image, bringing a fun, vibrant, health-conscious slant to a vegan lifestyle that eschews some of the stricter elements, and appeals to young, climate-conscious consumers. Terms and trends such as “flexitarian”, “pescatarian”, “meatless Monday” and “Veganuary” have become popularised, as consumers abstain from meat in more relaxed and less all-consuming ways.</p><p>Influencers such as the broadcaster Fearne Cotton and reality TV star

As the three of them go down to the ground, Barrett grips Kelleher’s midriff, pulls him up, away from the turf, and flips him around just before he can get the ball down.</p><p>The replays show Kelleher was only three inches away from scoring that try, giving Ireland a one-point lead and a shot at the conversion too.

<p>His remarks were designed to demonstrate Biden’s vitality. They succeeded</p><p>Like a budget, a State of the Union speech is a moral document: it reflects a president’s values and priorities, distilling his own view of his administration for the American people. On Thursday night, President Joe Biden made his moral case for reelection: he views America as a besieged but worthy global leader, one whose tradition of democracy deserves to be defended and rebuilt. Referring to his opponent Donald Trump only as “my predecessor,” Biden repeatedly contrasted his own vision of a more equitable and prosperous nation with the Republican agenda. The point was to offer Americans an optimistic and inclusive vision—and to remind them of the cynicism, sadism, and depravity of the Trump worldview, which threatens to undermine women’s freedoms, make interracial democracy impossible, and use the machinery of government for little else but to further Republicans own self regard and greed.</

With a small studio currently under fire, the games industry’s silence is deafening</p><p>Ten years ago, a game developer’s aggrieved ex-boyfriend published a vindictive screed accusing her of trading sex for favourable reviews of her indie game. This was leapt upon by the least savoury corner of the 2014 internet, 4chan, and kicked off a harassment campaign that broadened to include all women working in video game development or the gaming press, as well as the industry’s LGBTQ+ community. Sensing blood in the water, “alt-right” agitators on YouTube and Steve Bannon’s Breitbart jumped on the bandwagon, and soon began to steer it – and Gamergate, as this manufactured outrage became known, mutated into one of the first fronts of the modern culture wars, driven by social media, misogyny and the weaponised disaffection of young men.
