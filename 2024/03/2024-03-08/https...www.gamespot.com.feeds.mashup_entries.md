<p dir="ltr">The celebs are just like us, sometimes. In this case, Euphoria and Madame Web actress Sydney Sweeney has revealed that she grew up playing games with her brother, specifically calling out a "Simpsons game" while using her hands to simulate driving a car. The options seem to indicate either 2001's Road Rage or 2003's Hit &amp; Run. There <i>was </i>a game literally called The Simpsons Game released in 2007, but it didn't focus on joyriding, so it doesn't appear to match the limited amount of information she provided.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ign/video/7343756611585953070">IGN</a>, Sweeney doesn't elaborate on which specific Simpsons game she's talking about. The Anyone But You star is 26 years old, so The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run would probably line up better as the title she's talking about--though that's just speculation. GameSpot has reached out to Sweeney's representation to try to get to the bottom of this great mystery. A

<p>In a new interview, former Xbox and EA boss Peter Moore has revealed his thoughts on the future of gaming and how the traditional console generation could be coming to an end. According to Moore, launching new hardware is both expensive and risky for even the biggest and most established companies in the industry, and with new advances in technology, companies might not be willing to risk billions to kick off a new console cycle. According to Moore, while Sony would likely be the trendsetter for new console hardware, other companies like Microsoft could look to cloud gaming to become more profitable.</p><p>"Sony is very much a hardware company, so I would say that that's your barometer company," Moore said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore">IGN</a>.

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/">Sea of Thieves</a> will receive a new weapon class for the first time since the game launched six years ago, Rare revealed to GameSpot in a recent interview. The team isn't ready to share exactly what that weapon is, but unlike other new weapons that have arrived over the years, such as the Trident of Dark Tides and the Ashen Winds skull, which must be found in the open world, this new weapon will be available as the newest class that players can equip from any armory, such as the one on their ship or at forts and outposts.</p><p dir="ltr">Since launch, the game has featured four weapon classes--sword, sniper, shotgun, and pistol--sporting Sea of Thieves' intentional flat progression system where each class has its own unlisted stats but any two weapons within a class share the same stats. This mechanic ensures that all players new and old have no statistical advantages and instead rely on their experience

<p dir="ltr">When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/">Sea of Thieves</a> launches on PS5 next month, it will feature DualSense support, Rare told GameSpot in a recent interview. This will include haptics and adaptive triggers that will be felt in a range of in-game mechanics. "[We're giving] different identities to different objects," said Mike Chapman, creative director on Sea of Thieves.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Rare didn't specify exactly which actions will use the DualSense's unique features--I got the sense these are still in development--there would seem to be many candidates in the game, from raising the anchor and sails, to boarding up holes in a ship's hull, to perhaps even combat with the game's guns and swords. Sea of Thieves has always been a very tactile, immersive experience, aided in part by the first-person perspective, so the DualSense features should feel right at home in Sea of Thieves. Whatever the case, they are one thing you won't be a
