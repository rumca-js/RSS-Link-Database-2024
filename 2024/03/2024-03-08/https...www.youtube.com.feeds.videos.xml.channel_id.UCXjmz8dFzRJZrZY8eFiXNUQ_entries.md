Every year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences comes together at The Oscars to give out awards to the years best films.  Most of the time the top prize of Best Picture goes to the film that stands out above the rest.  Best Picture is supposed to not only recognize the cast and crew for their achievements, but also tell the general public which movies they should go see.  Though, more than a few times, The Academy hasn't always given The Oscar to the most deserving film.  Which in turn leads to some of these Oscar Winners for Best Picture being forgotten before they are able to cement their legacy.  Sometimes The Oscars completely misses the mark, and lets a golden opportunity pass them by.
