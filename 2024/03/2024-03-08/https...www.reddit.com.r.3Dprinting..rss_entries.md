<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have few empty spools and it bothers me to throw them away. It's perfectly good plastic, it costs money obviously. So why not design 3D printed spools, share the STLs, don't worry about AMS compatibility and be done with it?</p> <p>I know not everyone is using AMS but even then compatibility can be tricky. Like dryers and stuff. It would be much easier to design STL that's compatible with most systems than to find a manufacturer that can make it for you. </p> <p>I've seen only 3D fox from Czechia and Slant 3D do this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lamp-town-guy"> /u/lamp-town-guy </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1b9ux71/why_arent_refills_more_popular_with_manufacturers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1b9ux71/why_arent_refills_more_popular_with_manufacturers/">[comments]</a></span>

Lube is optional, dry lube would probably be better. This bearing works great for filament spools or small scale robotics. Would not recommend for high speed constant use unless you use higher end plastics. When used on a drill with PLA for testing, and holding the outer rim in place, PLA became soft due to heat after spinnin
