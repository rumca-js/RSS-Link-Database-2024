Almost everyone investing serious time exploring LLMs agreed that it was the most capable default model for the majority of tasks - and had been for more than a year.</p>\n<p>Today that barrier has finally been smashed. We have four new models, all released to the public in the last four weeks, that are benchmarking near or even above GPT-4.

The second trick is Meta&#x27;s Fully Sharded Data Parallel or FSDP library, which can shard a model across GPUs.
