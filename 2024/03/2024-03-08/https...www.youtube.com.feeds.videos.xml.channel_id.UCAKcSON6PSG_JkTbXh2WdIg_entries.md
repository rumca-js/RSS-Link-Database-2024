How you tell your story is sometimes even more important than the story itself. On her new album, "Bury The Lede," Dessa is once again the storyteller pointing out injustice, sly ironic humor, and finding joy even in the decay of everyday life.

The Minnesota poet, rapper, public radio host, and songwriter is showcasing her multi-hyphenate title to its fullest on her new album. It’s juxtaposition heavy — harsh rapping next to pretty vocals, dance beats blaring while the world burns down around her.

Dessa visited The Current studio to perform her track "Tell Me Again" from "Bury The Lede"
