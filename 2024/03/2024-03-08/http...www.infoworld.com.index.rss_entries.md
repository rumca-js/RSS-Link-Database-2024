<p>Apple has released Swift 5.10, an update to the company’s open-source programming language that reaches a major milestone: providing safety against data races via full data isolation in the concurrency model. The improvement prepares the way for the planned Swift 6 release.</p><p>Binaries for Swift 5.10, <a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-5.10-released/" rel="nofollow">introduced March 5</a>, can be found at <a href="https://www.swift.org/download/" rel="nofollow">swift.org</a> for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p><p>In explaining the milestone, Apple Swift engineer Holly Borla said an increasingly important source of undefined behavior is concurrent code that inadvertently accesses memory from one thread at the same time that another thread is writing to the same memory. This unsafety is called a data race, which makes concurrent programs exceptionally difficult to write, Borla noted. Swift 5.10 finally accomplishes full data isolatio

<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of IaaS cloud computing, public cloud providers are increasingly reaching feature and function parity. This means they are beginning to look alike.</p><p>Before you keyboard warriors remind me that some obscure feature in the object storage system on one provider is better than the object storage feature on another provider, I know they are not <em>exactly</em> the same. I think it’s okay to consider that they are all moving to a similar group of services that do the same things.</p><h2>How did it get this way?</h2>
<p>This development creates a competitive dynamic between these providers and offers new opportunities and challenges for enterprises. If we have three major cloud providers and three other providers that are catching up quickly, then it’s no longer reasonable to point to a single provider as the one to use. There’s no “best cloud” anymore.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3713289/are-th

<p>Entity Framework Core is an object-relational mapper, or ORM, that isolates your application’s object model from the data model. That allows you to write code that performs CRUD operations without worrying about how the data is stored. In other words, you work with the data using familiar .NET objects.</p><p>In Entity Framework Core, the DbContext connects the domain classes to the database by acting as a bridge between them. You can take advantage of the DbContext to query data in your entities or save your entities to the underlying database.</p><p>I’ve discussed the basics of DbContext in a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3311737/how-to-use-the-dbcontext-in-entity-framework-core.html">previous article</a>. In this article we’ll dive into DbContext in a little more detail, discuss the DbContext lifetime, and offer some best practices for using DbContext in Entity Framework Core. EF Core allows you to instantiate a DbContext in
