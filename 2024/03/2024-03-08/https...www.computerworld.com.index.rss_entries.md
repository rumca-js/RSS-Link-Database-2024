<p>With prompt engineers among the workers most in demand in the wake of generative AI’s arrival in the enterprise, it was inevitable that someone would investigate whether their role, too, could be automated, or at least facilitated, by AI.</p><p>And, indeed, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10949.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recent study</a> focused on how to write the best prompts for a large-language model (LLM) AI to solve mathematical problems has found that another AI gets better results than a human. The study sought to determine whether human-generated “positive thinking” prompts—such as “this will be fun!” or “take a deep breath and think”—produce better responses. The results were mixed when using different LLMs.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3714360/ais-may-be-better-at-prompt-optimization-than-humans.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>The first two third-party European app stores to be announced offer different takes on how these stores might work: the first is a white-label service for enterprise app distribution, the second is an all-you-can-eat subscription deal.</p><p>The stores are on the cusp of being introduced now that Apple has been <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3712503/as-apple-opens-the-app-store-a-little-in-eu-winners-and-losers-emerge.html">forced to open up to third party app stores and payment systems</a>. It seems likely more such stores will soon open, and it's interesting these two seem willing to explore new app distribution business models.</p><h2><strong>For the enterprise: Mobivention</strong></h2>

<p>You hear that sound? That’s the sound of augmented reality (AR) fading away as a driving concept in technology.</p><p>You could blame Apple, which handed down an edict to Apple Vision Pro developers: “Refer to your app as a spatial computing app. Don<span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’t describe your app experience as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), extended reality (XR), or mixed reality (MR).”</span></p><p>But blaming Apple would be wrong. Instead, blame artificial intelligence (AI) — specifically the generative AI (genAI) trend of the past year and a half; it’s completely upended and re-directed the purpose and function of the glasses formerly known as AR glasses.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3713462/ar-got-its-killer-app-genai.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Esty Scheiner was especially frustrated, even for the CEO of an AI startup. Her team had figured out a better way to deliver deepfake audio detection and met with various IT groups at key enterprises. Most agreed this is going to be an issue that needs to be dealt with — and could use Scheiner’s software.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since the deepfake problem is months, maybe a year away, Scheiner's company couldn’t get the backing to do anything about it. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therein lies an IT problem I've seen in just about every vertical. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be easier to accept if IT pros were routinely caught offguard by opportunities or problems they didn’t anticipate. Alas, that's not the case. To be blunt, IT decision-makers in the US often see the train charging down the tracks, but they're not permitted to do anything
