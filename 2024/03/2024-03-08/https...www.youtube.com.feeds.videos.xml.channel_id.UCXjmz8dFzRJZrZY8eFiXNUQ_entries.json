Most of the time the top prize of Best Picture goes to the film that stands out above the rest.  Best Picture is supposed to not only recognize the cast and crew for their achievements, but also tell the general public which movies they should go see.  Though, more than a few times, The Academy hasn't always given The Oscar to the most deserving film.
