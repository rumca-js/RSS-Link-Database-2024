<p>TikTok’s future is looking increasingly uncertain as support grows for a new bill that would force the company to sell itself or face a ban in the United States. Now, President Joe Biden has come out in support of the measure, one day after <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-is-encouraging-its-users-to-call-their-representatives-about-attempts-to-ban-the-app-202056111.html">it cleared</a> its first legislative hurdle in the House.</p>
<p>"If they pass it, I'll sign it,” he said, in remarks <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-tiktok-ban-bill/"><ins>reported by</ins></a> CBS News. The bill, called the “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,” which was introduced earlier this week, would give TikTok a six-month window to divest itself from parent company ByteDance or face an app store-level ban in the US. Meanwhile, Republicans in the House of Representatives could bring the bi

<p>Rivian’s R2 reservations are off to a hot start. On Friday, CEO RJ Scaringe<a href="https://twitter.com/RJScaringe/status/1766099647712657839"> posted</a> on X that the automaker had taken more than 68,000 reservations for the SUV in less than 24 hours. Amid alarmingly<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/business/energy-environment/electric-vehicles-sales.html"> weakened</a> demand for electric vehicles, perhaps there’s a latent interest in innovative EV companies when they aren’t helmed by a conflict magnet with a fixation on<a href="https://www.engadget.com/walmart-says-its-no-longer-advertising-on-x-215940504.html"> baseless conspiracy theories</a> and the supposed<a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-restores-andrew-anglins-account-192658758.html"> online “rights” of Neo-Nazis</a>.</p>

<p>Game design is a daring and dangerous endeavor for Niklas Åkerblad, who creates under the name El Huervo. When he describes the artistic process behind <a href="https://www.ultrosgame.com/"><em><ins>ULTROS</ins></em></a>, a neon-speckled platformer set in a demonic cosmic uterus, he talks about pushing against the sharp edges of introspection and sanity, drawing from wells of creativity buried deep in his psyche. It sounds like he could’ve slipped and fallen down any of those wells at any second, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>“I had a pretty rigorous discipline when it came to creating the world of <em>ULTROS</em>,” Åkerblad told Engadget. “It involves deep meditation while working and maintaining 100 percent focus to be able to know when harmony is achieved when working with such a dense flow of shapes and colors. It is almost impossible to cerebrally analyze this process, but it is rather something you have to feel, thus any external disturbance can greatly impact the p

It’s difficult to overstate how influential Steam is to PC gaming, or how rich the storefront has made Valve. As a private company with infinite piles of Steam cash, Valve has the freedom to ignore market pressure from consumers, creators and competitors. It famously has a flat hierarchy with no strict management structure, and developers are encouraged to follow their hearts.</p>
<p>This has all resulted in an incredibly rich studio that doesn’t produce much. It may be a tired joke that Valve can’t count to three in its games, but we’re not talking about Half-Life today. We’re talking about Valve’s

<p>Just as Engadget was hitting publish on its first posts, I was putting a freshly minted English degree to use working at an indie bookshop in Los Angeles. In seemingly unrelated news, Amazon had just reported its first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/28/business/technology-amazon-reports-first-full-year-profit.html">profitable year</a> after switching from selling books to selling “everything” four years before. (It still sold a lot of books.)</p>
<p>Our bookstore did a good job keeping shelves stocked with a balance of the more worthy popular hits and smaller, better fare. But we couldn’t have every book a customer might want, so we offered to order any in-print title. If a distributor had it, it’d take about a week to get in, longer if we had to go through the publisher. That seemed fine for most customers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But sometimes “about a week” was too long. A few people came right out and said, “Nah, I’ll order it on Amazon.”

<p>Apple's refreshed MacBook Air laptops are finally here, and they're toting shiny new M3 chips. This week, Cherlynn chats with Devindra about his review of the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air M3. They're faster, as we expected, but they're also not a huge leap over the M2 MacBook Air, which now starts at $999. (And we're sure you'll find some excellent refurbished and used deals soon.) No matter which one you pick, though, you're getting one of the most stunning ultraportable notebooks around. In other news, we discuss Apple's nearly $2 billion fine from the EU, Microsoft's upcoming Surface AI event and the death of Android apps on Windows 11.</p>

Fundamentally, both are fantastic machines but probably lack some of the gosh-wow factor the M2 Airs had when they debuted in 2022. After all, the M2 heralded a new industrial design and far better internals, while the M3 is more of an iterative update. Think of it like the iPhone S-years, when a dramatic redesign (the iPhone 4, say) was followed by a more refined model (the 4S) the following year.</p>
<p>Consequently, reviewing the M3 is an exercise in spotting the small differences, like the faster Wi-Fi (6E), brighter display and quicker processing speed. Benchmarking saw both machines get out ahead of the M2, but you probably won’t notice if you’re using this machine casually. And Devindra’s clearly getting a kick out of being able to run games like <em>Dea

<p>The European Union's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA) is officially in action, and the ramifications are coming out left and right.

<p>There have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wordle-clones-app-store-232042208.html">plenty of Wordle clones</a> even before <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wordle-nyt-new-york-times-sale-215510156-215510216.html">purchased</a> the real thing in 2022, to the point that they had become a common sight on app stores. It sounds like The Times has been trying to cull the numbers of Wordle knockoffs recently, though, and has been sending DMCA takedown notices to their developers. As <a href="https://www.404media.co/nytimes-files-copyright-takedowns-against-hundreds-of-wordle-clones/"><em>404 Media</em></a> reports, the latest notice the news organization sent could take out not just the target game itself, but also thousands of other alternatives and spinoffs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Times'</em> latest DMCA notice was filed against Chase Wackerfuss, the person behind a Wordle clone called &quot;Reactle.&quot; In its notice, the publication said th

<p>Rivian generally had a good day yesterday, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-reveals-the-45000-r2-electric-suv-and-its-siblings-the-r3-and-r3x-185640727.html">launching</a> the R2 SUV along with the surprise R3 crossover and dune buggy-esque R3X that were met with general acclaim. Buried in that <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240307349103/en/Rivian-Introduces-R2-R3-and-R3X-Built-on-New-Midsize-Platform">press release</a>, however, was the news that the automaker is halting production of its $5 billion Georgia plant in order to save money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of building the R2 in Georgia as originally planned, the company will start production of the electric SUV at its existing Normal, Illinois plant. &quot;Beyond significantly reducing the amount of capital needed to bring R2 to market, the company believes this approach considerably reduces risk to the launch and associated ram,&quot; the company said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Journalists, creators and long-winded VCs on X now have a new way to be exhausting on main. X now allows verified organizations and Premium+ subscribers to <a href="https://twitter.com/Write/status/1765884209527394325"><ins>publish long-form</ins></a> “Articles.&quot;</p>
<p>The feature adds a basic text-editing interface that includes embedded media and some text formatting options, like the ability to make bulleted lists. It also appears that articles can be longer than the 25,000-character limit currently in place for premium subscribers’ “longer posts” feature. According to my initial tests, I hit the character limit for articles at just over 100,000 characters or about 15,000 words.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Here’s what the editing interface looks like:</p>
