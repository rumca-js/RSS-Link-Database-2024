The World-Maker Parable serves as a prequal to Tarzian\u2019s novel, Vultures, but can also be read as its own standalone story. The novella opens with Rhona, a dutiful citizen of her country who leads her lover, Djen, toward execution in the corpse-laden Hang-Dead Forest. Djen has been sentenced to death for treason after unleashing the chaotic Vulture goddess, Lumin\u00edl, upon the world. The Vulture goddess represents entropy unbounded, delivering irreversible disorder and destruction, culminating with certain death. The Vulture\u2019s power is the opposite of the Phoenix goddess, Mirkvah\u00edl, who signifies creation and rebirth. The Phoenix goddess is sought by the other main point-of-view character, Var\u00e9sh L\u00fam-tal\u00e9, a notorious liar who seeks atonement for his sins. Var\u00e9sh\u2019s journey also brings him toward the Hang-Dead Fores", "bookmarked": false, "tags": [], "age": null, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-08T04:25:29+00:00", "permanent": false, "source_obj__id": 137, "page_rating": 0, "link": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-the-world-maker-parable-by-luke-tarzian", "source": "https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/feed", "title": "REVIEW: The World-Maker Parable by Luke Tarzian", "artist": null, "vote": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "dead": false, "thumbnail": null, "album": "", "user": null}]
