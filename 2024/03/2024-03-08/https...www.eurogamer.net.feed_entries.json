This week: first impressions, mazes, and zombie apocalypses.</p><p>If you fancy catching up on some of the older editions of What We've Been Playing, <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/what-weve-been-playing\">here's our archive</a>.</p><p>I've been playing a lot of Nightingale in the last couple of weeks, and I think there are good ideas there but also a lot of frustration. The game is too eager to have you grind, and it suffocates all of the more interesting things it's trying to do.

Everyone who came up in games journalism in the early 2000s will have been given some of these things to review, and it was always a fascinating challenge. I remember a former editor of Eurogamer telling me that the first game they ever put a score on was The Golden Compass, the spin-off game for the wonky big-budget adaptation of His Dark Materials. Now I think about it, my first review was Miami Vice for the PSP. Better than The Golden Compass, at least. Actually, it was quite good?</p><p>That was the thing. Sometimes these games were quite good. Sometimes they were more than quite good. But there was always a sense around my friends who took video games really seriously that licensed games were not worth messing with. Over the years I kept a fond eye on them, t", "bookmarked": false, "tags": [], "age": null, "comments": [], "date_published": "2024-03-08T11:00:00+00:00", "permanent": false, "source_obj__id": 107, "page_rating": 0, "link": "https://www.eurogamer.net/game-of-the-week-snufkins-adventures-in-moonminvalley-show-how-finely-judged-a-licensed-game-can-be?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed", "source": "https://www.eurogamer.net/feed", "title": "Game of the Week: Snufkin's adventures in Moonminvalley show how finely judged a licensed game can be", "artist": null, "vote": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "dead": false, "thumbnail": "https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/moomin_snufkin.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp", "album": "", "user": null}]
