COVID-19 vaccines elicit strong T-cell responses, but clonal-resolution analyses of these responses have not previously been performed. To address this gap, a team of researchers investigated the T- cell receptor sequence and tracked it using trammer analysis, uncovering key insights into the dynamics of T-cell responses. This study can lead to improved next-generation vaccines.

## Good news for coral reef restoration efforts: Study finds 'full recovery' of reef growth within four years

While the majority of the world's reefs are now under threat or even damaged potentially beyond repair, a new study offers some encouraging news: efforts to restore coral reefs not only increase coral cover, but they can also bring back important ecosystem functions, and surprisingly fast.
